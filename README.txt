GUIDE TO FILES:

edgar_web_scraper.py
> Hasn't really been started yet

html_scraper.py
> designed for scraping offline html files, but the code could be easily repurposed to analyze files from the sec website

pdf_txt_converter.py
> from an experiment where i tried to extract the data from txt files instead of pdf or html
> this file just batch converts files in ./14a_pdf/ from pdf to txt and saves them in ./output_as_txt/

txt_scraper.py
> was supposed to actually scrape data from txt files but was scrapped after i realized it would be very hard to analyze only the
	"background of the merger" section

files in ./old/ show a lot of early attempts to do similar things
