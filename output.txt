The merger presents an opportunity to accelerate growth and build value for Rockwell Collins\' stockholders through market-leading positions in cockpit and cabin\nsolutions, and presents to B/E Aerospace\'s stockholders an immediate premium and a substantial equity interest in a strong combined company with a broader range of products,\ncustomers and the combined expertise and resources to create future value.\n\n           Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace entered into an agreement and plan of merger on October 23, 2016. Subject to stockholder approvals and the satisfaction or (to the\nextent permitted by law) waiver of certain other closing conditions, Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace will combine their businesses through the merger of B/E Aerospace with a\nnewly formed, wholly owned subsidiary of Rockwell Collins, with B/E Aerospace thereupon becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Rockwell Collins as the surviving\ncorporation, which transaction is referred to as the merger in this joint proxy statement/prospectus.\n\n           If the merger is completed, B/E Aerospace stockholders (other than (i) Rockwell Collins, B/E Aerospace and Quarterback Merger Sub Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of\nRockwell Collins, and (ii) any stockholders holding shares of B/E Aerospace common stock with respect to which appraisal rights are properly demanded and not withdrawn under\nthe General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware) will receive $34.10 in cash, without interest, and a fraction of a validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of\nRockwell Collins common stock with a value of $27.90, subject to adjustment pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement as further described below, for each share of\nB/E Aerospace common stock, which cash and stock are collectively referred to as the merger consideration. The fraction of a share of Rockwell Collins common stock into which\neach share of B/E Aerospace common stock will be converted, which is referred to as the exchange ratio, will be determined based on the volume-weighted average price per share\nof Rockwell Collins common stock over a specified period of time before the closing of the merger, which is referred to as the Rockwell Collins stock price. This exchange ratio\nwill be adjusted to reflect changes in the price of the Rockwell Collins common stock prior to the closing of the merger. If the Rockwell Collins stock price is less than $77.41 or\ngreater than $89.97, a two-way collar mechanism will apply, pursuant to which (i) if the Rockwell Collins stock price is greater than $89.97, the exchange ratio will be fixed at\n0.3101 and the value of the stock consideration will be more than $27.90, and (ii) if the Rockwell Collins stock price is less than $77.41, the exchange ratio will be fixed at 0.3604\nand the value of the stock consideration will be less than $27.90. Upon the completion of the merger, based on minimum and maximum exchange ratios of 0.3101 and 0.3604, the\nestimated number of shares of Rockwell Collins common stock issuable as a portion of the merger consideration is between 31.1 million shares and 36.1 million shares, which will\nresult in former B/E Aerospace stockholders holding approximately 19.2% to 21.7% of the outstanding Rockwell Collins common stock, based on the number of outstanding shares\nof common stock and outstanding stock-based awards of Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace as of January 26, 2017. For more details on the calculation of the Rockwell Collins\nstock price, the calculation of the exchange ratio and the two-way collar mechanism, see "The Merger Agreement\xe2\x80\x94Merger Consideration to be Received by B/E Aerospace\nStockholders" beginning on page 128 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus.\n\n           If the Rockwell Collins stock price were equal to the Rockwell Collins\' closing stock price on January 26, 2017, the most recent practicable date for which such information\nwas available, holders of B/E Aerospace common stock would receive $34.10 in cash, without interest, plus 0.3101 shares of Rockwell Collins common stock, resulting in Rockwell\nCollins issuing 31.1 million shares of Rockwell Collins common stock as a portion of the aggregate merger consideration and representing approximately $62.40 in value per share\nof B/E Aerospace common stock, which represents a premium of approximately 23.3% over B/E Aerospace\'s closing stock price on October 21, 2016, the last trading day before\nthe public announcement of the merger. The actual value of the merger consideration and the number of shares of Rockwell Collins common stock to be issued by Rockwell Collins\nmay differ from this example, given the Rockwell Collins stock price will not be determinable until the trading day prior to the closing of the merger. The common stock of\nRockwell Collins is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "COL," and the common stock of B/E Aerospace is listed on The NASDAQ Stock Market under the\nsymbol "BEAV." We urge you to obtain current market quotations for the shares of common stock of Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace.\n\n           All fractional shares of Rockwell Collins common stock that would otherwise be issued to a B/E Aerospace stockholder as part of the merger consideration will be\naggregated to create whole shares of Rockwell Collins common stock that will be issued to B/E Aerospace stockholders as part of the merger consideration. If a fractional share of\nRockwell Collins common stock remains payable to a B/E Aerospace stockholder after aggregating all fractional shares of Rockwell Collins common stock payable to such B/E\nAerospace stockholder, then such B/E Aerospace stockholder will be paid, in lieu of such remaining fractional share of Rockwell Collins common stock, an amount in cash, without\ninterest, rounded down to the nearest cent, equal to the product of (x) the amount of the fractional share interest in a share of Rockwell Collins common stock to which such holder\nwould otherwise be entitled (rounded to three decimal places) and (y) the Rockwell Collins stock price. Rockwell Collins stockholders will continue to own their existing shares of\ncommon stock of Rockwell Collins, the form of which will not be changed by the transaction.\n\n           Each of Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace is holding a special meeting of its stockholders to vote on the proposals necessary to complete the merger. Information about\nthese meetings, the merger, the share issuance, and the other business to be considered by stockholders at each of the special meetings is contained in this joint proxy\nstatement/prospectus. Any stockholder entitled to attend and vote at the Rockwell Collins or B/E Aerospace special meeting is entitled to appoint a proxy to attend and vote on such\nstockholder\'s behalf. Such proxy need not be a holder of Rockwell Collins or B/E Aerospace common stock. We urge you to read this joint proxy statement/prospectus and the\nannexes and documents incorporated by reference carefully. You should also carefully consider the risks that are described in the "Risk Factors" section beginning on page\n46.\n\n           Your vote is very important regardless of the number of shares of Rockwell Collins common stock or B/E Aerospace common stock that you own. The merger\ncannot be completed without approval of (i) the proposal to issue Rockwell Collins common stock by the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the votes cast by the\nshares of Rockwell Collins common stock represented (in person or by proxy) at the Rockwell Collins special meeting that are entitled to vote on such proposal and\n(ii) adoption of the merger agreement by the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the shares of B/E Aerospace common stock outstanding and entitled to vote on\nthe record date.\n\n           Whether or not you plan to attend your company\'s special meeting of stockholders, please submit your proxy as soon as possible to make sure that your shares are\nrepresented at that meeting.\n\n           The Rockwell Collins board of directors unanimously recommends that Rockwell Collins stockholders vote "FOR" the proposal to approve the issuance of\nRockwell Collins common stock in the merger, which is necessary to complete the merger.\n\n           The B/E Aerospace board of directors unanimously recommends that B/E Aerospace stockholders vote "FOR" the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, which\nis necessary to complete the merger.\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/861361/000104746917000512/a2230778zdefm14a.htm\n\n3/330\n\n\x0c8/28/2019\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/861361/000104746917000512/a2230778zdefm14a.htm\n\n \n\nRobert K.

They may not include all the information that is important to stockholders of Rockwell\nCollins and B/E Aerospace. Stockholders should carefully read this entire joint proxy statement/prospectus, including the annexes and the\nother documents referred to or incorporated by reference herein.\n\nQ: What is the merger? \n\nA:\n\nRockwell Collins, Inc., which is referred to as Rockwell Collins, and B/E Aerospace, Inc., which is referred to as B/E Aerospace,\nhave entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of October 23, 2016, which (as the same may be amended from time\nto time) is referred to as the merger agreement. A copy of the merger agreement is attached as Annex A to this joint proxy\nstatement/prospectus. The merger agreement contains the terms and conditions of the proposed business combination of Rockwell\nCollins and B/E Aerospace. Under the merger agreement, subject to satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by law) waiver of the\nconditions to the merger set forth in the merger agreement and described hereinafter, Quarterback Merger Sub Corp., a wholly\nowned subsidiary of Rockwell Collins, which is referred to as Merger Sub, will merge with and into B/E Aerospace, with B/E\nAerospace continuing as the surviving corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Rockwell Collins, in a transaction which is\nreferred to as the merger. \n\nQ: Why am I receiving these materials? \n\nA:\n\nRockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace are sending these materials to their respective stockholders to help them decide how to vote\ntheir shares of Rockwell Collins or B/E Aerospace common stock, as the case may be, with respect to the merger and other matters\nto be considered at their respective special meetings.\n\nThe merger cannot be completed unless Rockwell Collins stockholders approve the issuance of Rockwell Collins common stock in\nthe merger and B/E Aerospace stockholders adopt the merger agreement. Each of Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace is holding\na special meeting of its stockholders to vote on the proposals necessary to complete the merger. Information about these special\nmeetings, the merger and the other business to be considered by stockholders at each of the special meetings is contained in this\njoint proxy statement/prospectus.\n\nThis joint proxy statement/prospectus constitutes both a joint proxy statement of Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace and a\nprospectus of Rockwell Collins. It is a joint proxy statement because each of the boards of directors of Rockwell Collins and B/E\nAerospace are soliciting proxies from their respective stockholders. It is a prospectus because Rockwell Collins will issue shares of\nits common stock in exchange for outstanding shares of B/E Aerospace common stock in the merger.\n\nQ: What will B/E Aerospace stockholders receive in the merger? \n\nA:\n\nIf the merger is completed, B/E Aerospace stockholders (other than (i) Rockwell Collins, B/E Aerospace and Merger Sub and\n(ii) any stockholders holding shares of B/E Aerospace common stock with respect to which appraisal rights are properly demanded\nand not withdrawn under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware) will receive $34.10 per share in cash, without\ninterest, and a fraction of a validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of Rockwell Collins common stock with a value of\n$27.90 per share, subject to adjustment pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, for each share of B/E Aerospace common\nstock. The precise fraction of a share of Rockwell Collins common stock into which each share of B/E Aerospace common stock\nwill be converted, which is referred to as the exchange ratio, will be determined based upon the Rockwell Collins stock price, as\ndescribed in more detail in "The Merger\n\n5\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/861361/000104746917000512/a2230778zdefm14a.htm\n\n13/330\n\n\x0c8/28/2019\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/861361/000104746917000512/a2230778zdefm14a.htm\n\nTable of Contents\n\nAgreement\xe2\x80\x94Merger Consideration to be Received by B/E Aerospace Stockholders" beginning on page 128. If the Rockwell\nCollins stock price is greater than or equal to $77.41 and less than or equal to $89.97, the exchange ratio will be equal to the\nquotient of (a) $27.90 divided by (b) the Rockwell Collins stock price, which, in each case, will result in the stock consideration\nhaving a value equal to $27.90. If the Rockwell Collins stock price is less than $77.41 or greater than $89.97, a two-way collar\nmechanism will apply pursuant to which, (1) if the Rockwell Collins stock price is greater than $89.97, the exchange ratio will be\nfixed at 0.3101 and the value of the stock consideration will be more than $27.90, and (2) if the Rockwell Collins stock price is\nless than $77.41, the exchange ratio will be fixed at 0.3604 and the value of the stock consideration will be less than $27.90.\n\nAll fractional shares of Rockwell Collins common stock that would otherwise be issued to a B/E Aerospace stockholder as part of\nthe merger consideration will be aggregated to create whole shares of Rockwell Collins common stock that will be issued to B/E\nAerospace stockholders as part of the merger consideration. If a fractional share of Rockwell Collins common stock remains\npayable to a B/E Aerospace stockholder after aggregating all fractional shares of Rockwell Collins common stock payable to such\nB/E Aerospace stockholder, then such B/E Aerospace stockholder will be paid, in lieu of such remaining fractional share of\nRockwell Collins common stock, an amount in cash, without interest, rounded down to the nearest cent, equal to the product of\n(x) the amount of the fractional share interest in a share of Rockwell Collins common stock to which such holder would otherwise\nbe entitled (rounded to three decimal places) and (y) the Rockwell Collins stock price.\n\nHow will Rockwell Collins pay the cash component of the merger consideration? \n\nRockwell Collins\' obligation to complete the merger is not conditioned upon its obtaining financing. Rockwell Collins anticipates\nthat approximately $3.6 billion will be required to pay the aggregate cash portion of the merger consideration to the B/E Aerospace\nstockholders. Rockwell Collins intends to fund the cash component of the merger through sources of debt financing.\n\nFor a more complete description of sources of funding for the merger and related costs, see "The Merger\xe2\x80\x94Source of Funding for\nthe Merger" beginning on page 123.\n\nQ: When do Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace expect to complete the transaction? \n\nRockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace are working to complete the transaction as soon as practicable. We currently expect that the\ntransaction will be completed in the spring of 2017. Neither Rockwell Collins nor B/E Aerospace can predict, however, the actual\ndate on which the transaction will be completed because it is subject to conditions beyond each company\'s control, including the\nnecessary regulatory approvals.\n\nQ:\n\nA:\n\nA:\n\nSee "The Merger Agreement\xe2\x80\x94Conditions to the Merger" beginning on page 148.\n\nQ: What am I being asked to vote on, and why is this approval necessary? \n\nA:\n\nRockwell Collins stockholders are being asked to vote on the following proposals:\n\n        1.     to approve the issuance of Rockwell Collins common stock, par value $0.01 per share, pursuant to the merger agreement,\nwhich is referred to as the Share Issuance proposal; and\n\n        2.     to approve any proposal to adjourn the Rockwell Collins special meeting from time to time, if necessary or appropriate,\nto solicit additional proxies in the event there are not sufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the Share\nIssuance proposal, which is referred to as the Rockwell Collins Adjournment proposal.\n\n6\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/861361/000104746917000512/a2230778zdefm14a.htm\n\n14/330\n\n\x0c8/28/2019\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/861361/000104746917000512/a2230778zdefm14a.htm\n\nTable of Contents\n\nApproval of the Share Issuance proposal by Rockwell Collins stockholders is required to complete the merger.\n\nB/E Aerospace stockholders are being asked to vote on the following proposals:\n\n        1.     to adopt the merger agreement, which is referred to as the Merger proposal;\n\n        2.     to approve, on an advisory basis, the merger-related compensation arrangements of B/E Aerospace\'s named executive\nofficers, which is referred to as the Merger-Related Compensation proposal; and\n\n        3.     to approve any proposal to adjourn the B/E Aerospace special meeting from time to time, if necessary or appropriate, to\nsolicit additional proxies in the event there are not sufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the Merger\nproposal, which is referred to as the B/E Aerospace Adjournment proposal.\n\nApproval of the Merger proposal by B/E Aerospace stockholders is required for completion of the merger.\n\nQ: What vote is required to approve each proposal at the Rockwell Collins Special Meeting? \n\nA:\n\nThe Share Issuance proposal:    The affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the votes cast by shares of Rockwell Collins\ncommon stock represented (in person or by proxy) at the Rockwell Collins special meeting is required to approve the Share\nIssuance proposal, which is referred to as the Rockwell Collins Stockholder Approval.\n\nThe Rockwell Collins Adjournment proposal:    The affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the shares of Rockwell Collins\ncommon stock represented (in person or by proxy) at the Rockwell Collins special meeting and entitled to vote on the proposal,\nwhether or not a quorum is present, is required to approve the Rockwell Collins Adjournment proposal.\n\nQ: What vote is required to approve each proposal at the B/E Aerospace Special Meeting? \n\nA:\n\nThe Merger proposal:    The affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of B/E Aerospace\ncommon stock is required to approve the Merger proposal, which is referred to as the B/E Aerospace Stockholder Approval.\n\nThe Merger-Related Compensation proposal:    The affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the votes cast by stockholders\nentitled to vote on the proposal that are present in person or represented by proxy, assuming a quorum, is required to approve the\nMerger-Related Compensation proposal. Because the vote on the Merger-Related Compensation proposal is advisory only, it will\nnot be binding on B/E Aerospace. Accordingly, if the Merger proposal is approved and the merger is completed, the merger-related\ncompensation will be payable to B/E Aerospace\'s named executive officers, subject only to the conditions applicable thereto,\nregardless of the outcome of the approval of the Merger-Related Compensation proposal.\n\nThe B/E Aerospace Adjournment proposal:    The affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the votes cast by B/E Aerospace\nstockholders present in person or represented by proxy, whether or not a quorum is present is required to approve the B/E\nAerospace Adjournment proposal. If a quorum is present, the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the votes cast by the\nshares of B/E Aerospace common stock represented (in person or by proxy) at the B/E Aerospace special meeting and entitled to\nvote on the proposal is required to approve the B/E Aerospace Adjournment proposal.\n\n7\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/861361/000104746917000512/a2230778zdefm14a.htm\n\n15/330\n\n\x0cA:\n\nA:\n\nQ:\n\nA:\n\nQ:\n\nA:\n\nA:\n\n8/28/2019\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/861361/000104746917000512/a2230778zdefm14a.htm\n\nTable of Contents\n\nQ: What happens if the non-binding advisory proposal to approve compensation that will or may be paid or provided by B/E\n\nAerospace to its named executive officers in connection with the merger is not approved? \n\nApproval, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, of compensation that will or may be paid or provided by B/E Aerospace to its\nnamed executive officers in connection with the merger is not a condition to completion of the merger. The vote is an advisory vote\nand is not binding. If the merger is completed, B/E Aerospace expects to pay "compensation in connection with the merger" to its\nnamed executive officers. \n\nQ: What constitutes a quorum? \n\nThe presence at the Rockwell Collins special meeting, in person or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the shares of Rockwell\nCollins common stock issued and outstanding on the record date for the Rockwell Collins special meeting will constitute a quorum\nfor the transaction of business at the Rockwell Collins special meeting. The presence at the B/E Aerospace special meeting, in\nperson or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of B/E Aerospace votes entitled to be cast by stockholders entitled to vote on the\nrecord date for the B/E Aerospace special meeting will constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at the B/E Aerospace\nspecial meeting. Abstentions (which are described below) will count for the purpose of determining the presence of a quorum for\nthe transaction of business at each special meeting. \n\nHow does the Rockwell Collins Board recommend that I vote? \n\nThe board of directors of Rockwell Collins, which is referred to as the Rockwell Collins Board, unanimously recommends that\nholders of Rockwell Collins common stock vote "FOR" the Share Issuance proposal and "FOR" the Rockwell Collins\nAdjournment proposal. \n\nHow does the B/E Aerospace Board recommend that I vote? \n\nThe board of directors of B/E Aerospace, which is referred to as the B/E Aerospace Board, unanimously recommends that B/E\nAerospace stockholders vote "FOR" the Merger proposal and "FOR" the B/E Aerospace Adjournment proposal. In addition, the\nB/E Aerospace Board unanimously recommends that holders of B/E Aerospace common stock vote "FOR" the Merger-Related\nCompensation proposal to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, any "golden parachute" compensation arrangement that\nmay be paid or become payable to B/E Aerospace\'s named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the merger or\ncontemplated by the merger agreement. \n\nQ: What do I need to do now? \n\nAfter carefully reading and considering the information contained in this joint proxy statement/prospectus, please vote your shares\nas soon as possible so that your shares will be represented at your respective company\'s special meeting. Please follow the\ninstructions set forth on the proxy card or on the voting instruction form provided by the record holder if your shares are held in the\nname of your broker, bank or other nominee.\n\nPlease do not submit your B/E Aerospace stock certificates at this time.

Please follow the voting instructions provided by your\nbroker, bank or other nominee. Please note that you may not vote shares held in street name by returning a proxy card directly to\nRockwell Collins or B/E Aerospace or by voting in person at your respective company\'s special meeting unless you provide a\n"legal proxy," which you must obtain from your broker, bank or other nominee. Your broker, bank or other nominee is obligated to\nprovide you with a voting instruction card for you to use.\n\nBrokers who hold shares in street name for a beneficial owner of those shares typically have the authority to vote in their discretion\non "routine" proposals when they have not received instructions from beneficial owners. However, brokers are not allowed to\nexercise their voting discretion with respect to the approval of matters determined to be "non-routine" without specific instructions\nfrom the beneficial owner. It is expected that all proposals to be voted on at the Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace special\nmeetings are such "non-routine" matters. Broker non-votes occur when a broker or nominee is not instructed by the beneficial\nowner of shares to vote on a particular proposal for which the broker does not have discretionary voting power.\n\nIf you are a Rockwell Collins stockholder and you do not instruct your broker, bank or other nominee on how to vote your shares:\n\nyour broker, bank or other nominee may not vote your shares on the Share Issuance proposal, which broker non-votes, if\nany, will have no effect on the vote count for such proposal (assuming a quorum is present); and \n\nyour broker, bank or other nominee may not vote your shares on the Rockwell Collins Adjournment proposal, which broker\nnon-votes, if any, will have no effect on the vote count for such proposal (regardless of whether a quorum is present).\n\nIf you are a B/E Aerospace stockholder and you do not instruct your broker, bank or other nominee on how to vote your shares:\n\nyour broker, bank or other nominee may not vote your shares on the Merger proposal, which broker non-votes, if any, will\nhave the same effect as a vote AGAINST such proposal; \n\nyour broker, bank or other nominee may not vote your shares on the Merger-Related Compensation proposal, which broker\nnon-votes, if any, will have no effect on the vote count for such proposal (assuming a quorum is present); and \n\nyour broker, bank or other nominee may not vote your shares on the B/E Aerospace Adjournment proposal, which broker\nnon-votes, if any, will have no effect on the vote count for such proposal (regardless of whether a quorum is present).\n\n10\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/861361/000104746917000512/a2230778zdefm14a.htm\n\n18/330\n\n\x0c8/28/2019\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/861361/000104746917000512/a2230778zdefm14a.htm\n\nTable of Contents\n\nattend the special meeting? \n\nQ: When and where are the Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace special meetings of stockholders?

Unless a Rockwell Collins stockholder or a B/E Aerospace\nstockholder, as applicable, checks the box on its proxy card to withhold discretionary authority, the applicable proxy holders may\nuse their discretion to vote on other matters relating to the Rockwell Collins special meeting or B/E Aerospace special meeting, as\napplicable. \n\nQ: What if I hold shares of both Rockwell Collins common stock and B/E Aerospace common stock? \n\nIf you are a stockholder of both Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace, you will receive two separate packages of proxy materials.\nA vote as a B/E Aerospace stockholder will not constitute a vote as a Rockwell Collins stockholder and vice versa. Therefore,\nplease sign, date and return all proxy cards that you receive, whether from Rockwell Collins or B/E Aerospace, or vote as both a\nRockwell Collins stockholder and as a B/E Aerospace stockholder by Internet or telephone. \n\nMay I change or revoke my vote after I have delivered my proxy or voting instruction card? \n\nYes. If you are a record holder, you may change or revoke your vote before your proxy is voted at the Rockwell Collins or B/E\nAerospace special meeting as described herein.

If you\nare a non-U.S. holder (as defined in "The Merger\xe2\x80\x94U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences"), the merger generally will not result\nin tax to you under U.S. federal income tax laws unless you have certain connections with the United States.\n\nFor a more complete description of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger, see "The Merger\xe2\x80\x94U.S. Federal\nIncome Tax Consequences" beginning on page 125.\n\nThis joint proxy statement/prospectus contains a general discussion of United States federal income tax consequences of the\nmerger.

The "fair value" could be higher or lower than, or\nthe same as, the merger consideration. A detailed description of the appraisal rights and procedures available to B/E Aerospace\nstockholders is included in "The Merger\xe2\x80\x94Appraisal Rights" beginning on page 119.

Upon\ncompletion of the merger, except for outstanding restricted stock unit awards granted to the executive officers of B/E Aerospace in\nNovember 2016, consistent with past practice, which will be cancelled and converted into a cash payment pursuant to their terms,\neach outstanding award of B/E Aerospace restricted stock and each B/E Aerospace restricted stock unit award that in each case was\ngranted on or following the date of the merger agreement will be assumed by Rockwell Collins and converted into a Rockwell\nCollins award of restricted stock or restricted stock unit award, as applicable, which will vest subject to the grantee\'s continued\nservice with Rockwell Collins or its affiliates through each applicable vesting date (with any performance conditions that were\n\n13\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/861361/000104746917000512/a2230778zdefm14a.htm\n\n21/330\n\n\x0c8/28/2019\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/861361/000104746917000512/a2230778zdefm14a.htm\n\nTable of Contents\n\napplicable to the B/E Aerospace award deemed satisfied at target level performance and following the closing, the converted\nRockwell Collins award subject only to time-based vesting) covering a number of shares of Rockwell Collins common stock\n(rounded down to the nearest whole share) determined by multiplying the number of shares of B/E Aerospace that were subject to\nthe B/E Aerospace award by a ratio of the value of the merger consideration divided by the Rockwell Collins stock price (with the\nvalue of the stock consideration portion of the merger consideration determined by multiplying the number of such shares of\nRockwell Collins common stock by the Rockwell Collins stock price).\n\nTreatment of B/E Aerospace Stock Units\n\nEach stock unit credited to the account of any current or former director under the B/E Aerospace Amended and Restated Non-\nEmployee Directors Stock and Deferred Compensation Plan that is outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the\nmerger, which is referred to as the effective time, will be converted into the right to receive the merger consideration.\n\nFor a more complete description of the treatment of outstanding restricted stock unit awards granted to the executive officers of\nB/E Aerospace in November 2016, see "The Merger\xe2\x80\x94Interests of Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger" beginning on\npage 102.\n\nAny applicable withholding taxes resulting from this treatment will be satisfied by reducing the amount of cash, if any, that would\notherwise be provided to holders of such awards. If no cash is to be provided to a holder of such an award or if the amount of cash\nthat would otherwise be provided to a holder of such awards is not sufficient to cover the applicable withholding taxes, then the\nnumber of shares of Rockwell Collins common stock that would otherwise be provided to the holder in accordance with the terms\ndescribed above will be reduced to the extent necessary to cover the shortfall.\n\nQ: What happens if I sell my shares of B/E Aerospace common stock after the record date but before the B/E Aerospace\n\nspecial meeting? \n\nA:\n\nA:\n\nA:\n\nThe record date for the B/E Aerospace special meeting (the close of business on January 18, 2017) is earlier than the date of the\nB/E Aerospace special meeting and earlier than the date that the merger is expected to be completed. If you sell or otherwise\ntransfer your shares of B/E Aerospace common stock after the record date but before the date of the B/E Aerospace special\nmeeting, you will retain your right to vote at the B/E Aerospace special meeting. However, you will not have the right to receive\nthe merger consideration to be received by B/E Aerospace stockholders in the merger.

Over the next 10 years, acquisitions of interior equipment companies established B/E\nAerospace as a broad based provider of interior equipment. Over the following decade, B/E Aerospace consolidated and integrated\nthe acquired businesses, developed a global direct sales and customer support organization and developed into a global market\nleading manufacturer of aircraft cabin interior equipment. In 2014, the Consumables Management Segment, which consisted of B/E\nAerospace\'s aerospace distribution and energy services businesses, was spun-off to form KLX, Inc., which is referred to as KLX.\n\n        B/E Aerospace\'s executive offices are located at 1400 Corporate Center Way, Wellington Florida, 33414, its website address is\nwww.beaerospace.com, and its phone number is (561) 791-5000.\n\n17\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/861361/000104746917000512/a2230778zdefm14a.htm\n\n25/330\n\n\x0c8/28/2019\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/861361/000104746917000512/a2230778zdefm14a.htm\n\nInformation contained on B/E Aerospace\'s website does not constitute part of this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

The principal executive offices of Merger Sub are located at 400 Collins Road NE, Cedar Rapids, Iowa 52498.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nMerger Sub\n\nThe Transaction \n\nMerger Agreement\n\n        On October 23, 2016, Rockwell Collins, B/E Aerospace and Merger Sub entered into the merger agreement, which provides\nthat, subject to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement and in accordance with the DGCL, Merger Sub will merge with\nand into B/E Aerospace, with B/E Aerospace continuing as the surviving corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Rockwell\nCollins.\n\nAmendment to Tax Sharing Agreement\n\n        In connection with entry into the merger agreement, B/E Aerospace and KLX entered into a first amendment to the Tax\nSharing and Indemnification Agreement, dated as of December 15, 2014, which is referred to as the KLX tax sharing agreement.\nThe KLX tax sharing agreement was originally entered into in connection with B/E Aerospace\'s contribution of assets to KLX, B/E\nAerospace\'s repayment of certain debt obligations with the proceeds of a cash distribution from KLX, and B/E Aerospace\'s\ndistribution of the stock of KLX, all in December of 2014, in transactions intended to qualify for tax-free treatment under\nSections 355, 361 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, which transactions, collectively, are\nreferred to as the KLX spin-off and which tax treatment is referred to as the KLX spin-off tax treatment. Among other things, the\nKLX tax sharing agreement sets forth the allocation between B/E Aerospace and KLX of liabilities for taxes arising prior to, as a\nresult of, and subsequent to the KLX spin-off and certain related restructuring transactions and sets out certain restrictions on the\nactivities of both B/E Aerospace and KLX following the KLX spin-off.\n\n        The amendment to the KLX tax sharing agreement modifies a requirement under the KLX tax sharing agreement relating to\nthe ability of B/E Aerospace to enter into certain transactions after the KLX spin-off. In satisfaction of this modified requirement,\nB/E Aerospace provided KLX with an opinion that B/E Aerospace received from its tax advisor, Shearman & Sterling LLP, which\nis referred to as Shearman & Sterling, relating to the impact of the merger on the KLX spin-off tax treatment. In addition, pursuant\nto the terms of the amendment to the KLX tax sharing agreement, KLX delivered a representation letter to Shearman & Sterling, for\npurposes of such opinion. This opinion relies on certain representations, assumptions, undertakings and covenants, from KLX,\nB/E Aerospace and Rockwell Collins and the conclusion set forth in the opinion may be adversely affected if one or more of the\nrepresentations and assumptions is incorrect or one or more of the undertakings and covenants is not complied with.\n\nConsideration to be Received in the Merger by B/E Aerospace Stockholders \n\n        At the effective time, each share of B/E Aerospace common stock that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the\neffective time (other than (i) shares of B/E Aerospace common stock owned\n\n18\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/861361/000104746917000512/a2230778zdefm14a.htm\n\n26/330\n\n\x0c8/28/2019\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/861361/000104746917000512/a2230778zdefm14a.htm\n\nTable of Contents\n\nor held directly or indirectly by Rockwell Collins, B/E Aerospace (including as treasury stock) or Merger Sub, which will be\ncancelled immediately prior to the effective time, and (ii) shares of B/E Aerospace common stock with respect to which appraisal\nrights are properly demanded and not withdrawn under Section 262 of the DGCL) will be converted into the right to receive $34.10\nin cash, without interest, which is referred to as the cash consideration, and a fraction of a validly issued, fully paid and non-\nassessable share of Rockwell Collins common stock having a value equal to $27.90 (subject to adjustment based upon a two-way\ncollar mechanism), which is referred to as the stock consideration. The exchange ratio will be determined based upon the Rockwell\nCollins stock price, as described in more detail in "The Merger Agreement\xe2\x80\x94Merger Consideration to be Received by\nB/E Aerospace Stockholders" beginning on page 128. If the Rockwell Collins stock price is greater than or equal to $77.41 and less\nthan or equal to $89.97, the exchange ratio will be equal to the quotient of (a) $27.90 divided by (b) the Rockwell Collins stock\nprice, which, in each case, will result in the stock consideration having a value equal to $27.90. If the Rockwell Collins stock price\nis less than $77.41 or greater than $89.97, then the two-way collar mechanism will apply pursuant to which, (1) if the Rockwell\nCollins stock price is greater than $89.97, the exchange ratio will be fixed at 0.3101 and the value of the stock consideration will be\nmore than $27.90, and (2) if the Rockwell Collins stock price is less than $77.41, the exchange ratio will be fixed at 0.3604 and the\nvalue of the stock consideration will be less than $27.90. Upon the completion of the merger, based on minimum and maximum\nexchange ratios of 0.3101 and 0.3604, the estimated number of shares of Rockwell Collins common stock issuable as a portion of\nthe merger consideration is between 31.1 million shares and 36.1 million shares, which will result in former B/E Aerospace\nstockholders holding approximately 19.2% to 21.7% of the outstanding Rockwell Collins common stock, based on the number of\noutstanding shares of common stock and outstanding stock-based awards of Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace as of January 26,\n2017. For more details on the shares of Rockwell Collins common stock and other consideration to be received by B/E Aerospace\nstockholders, see "The Merger Agreement\xe2\x80\x94Merger Consideration to be Received by B/E Aerospace Stockholders" beginning on\npage 128 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus.\n\n        All fractional shares of Rockwell Collins common stock that would otherwise be issued to a B/E Aerospace stockholder as part\nof the merger consideration will be aggregated to create whole shares of Rockwell Collins common stock that will be issued to B/E\nAerospace stockholders as part of the merger consideration. If a fractional share of Rockwell Collins common stock remains\npayable to a B/E Aerospace stockholder after aggregating all fractional shares of Rockwell Collins common stock payable to such\nB/E Aerospace stockholder, then such B/E Aerospace stockholder will be paid, in lieu of such remaining fractional share of\nRockwell Collins common stock, an amount in cash, without interest, rounded down to the nearest cent, equal to the product of\n(x) the amount of the fractional share interest in a share of Rockwell Collins common stock to which such holder would otherwise\nbe entitled (rounded to three decimal places) and (y) the Rockwell Collins stock price.\n\nTreatment of Stock-Based Awards \n\nB/E Aerospace\n\nTreatment of B/E Aerospace Restricted Stock Awards and RSU Awards\n\n        Upon completion of the merger, each outstanding award of B/E Aerospace restricted stock and each B/E Aerospace restricted\nstock unit award that in each case was granted prior to the date of the merger agreement will (i) become fully vested and, to the\nextent such award is subject to performance conditions, such performance conditions will be deemed satisfied at the maximum level\nand (ii) be cancelled and converted into the right to receive a lump sum cash payment per share of B/E Aerospace common stock\nunderlying such award equal to the value of the per share merger consideration, less any applicable withholding taxes.

Certain B/E Aerospace executive officers are, by reason of their\nrespective employment agreements with B/E Aerospace, entitled to severance payments and other benefits immediately upon the\nconsummation of the merger (certain other executive officers are entitled to severance payments and benefits upon a qualifying\ntermination of employment following the merger). In addition, Richard G. Hamermesh and John T. Whates, both members of the\nB/E Aerospace Board, will be appointed to the Rockwell Collins Board. The B/E Aerospace Board was aware of these interests and\nconsidered them, among other matters, in approving the merger agreement and in determining to recommend that B/E Aerospace\nstockholders adopt the merger agreement.\n\nU.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger \n\n        The exchange of B/E Aerospace common stock pursuant to the merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes. Accordingly, a U.S. holder (as defined in "The Merger\xe2\x80\x94U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences" beginning on page 125)\nof B/E Aerospace common stock who receives the merger consideration in exchange for such U.S. holder\'s shares of B/E Aerospace\ncommon stock generally will recognize taxable gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between (i) the sum of the\nfair market value of the Rockwell Collins common stock and the amount of cash, including cash in lieu of fractional shares,\nreceived in the merger and (ii) such U.S. holder\'s adjusted tax basis in the shares of B/E Aerospace common stock exchanged\ntherefor. If you are a non-U.S. holder, the merger generally will not result in tax to you under U.S. federal income tax laws unless\nyou have certain connections with the United States.\n\n        This joint proxy statement/prospectus contains a general discussion of United States federal income tax consequences of\nthe merger. This description does not address any non-U.S. tax consequences, nor does it pertain to state, local or other tax\nconsequences. Consequently, you are urged to contact your own tax advisor to determine the particular tax consequences to\nyou of the merger.\n\nAccounting Treatment of the Merger \n\nAppraisal Rights \n\n        The merger will be accounted for as an acquisition of B/E Aerospace by Rockwell Collins under the acquisition method of\naccounting in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., which is referred to as GAAP.\n\n        Under Delaware law, Rockwell Collins stockholders will not be entitled to any appraisal rights in connection with the merger\nor any other transactions described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus.\n\n        Under Delaware law, if the merger is completed, record holders of B/E Aerospace common stock who do not vote in favor of\nthe adoption of the merger agreement and who otherwise properly exercise their appraisal rights will be entitled to seek appraisal\nfor, and obtain payment in cash for the judicially determined fair value of, their shares of B/E Aerospace common stock, in lieu of\nreceiving the merger consideration. The "fair value" could be higher or lower than, or the same as, the merger consideration. The\nrelevant provisions of the DGCL are included as Annex E to this joint proxy statement/prospectus. B/E Aerospace stockholders are\nencouraged to read these provisions carefully and in their entirety. Moreover, due to the complexity of the procedures for exercising\nthe right to seek appraisal, B/E Aerospace stockholders who are considering exercising that right are encouraged to seek the advice\nof legal counsel. Failure to comply strictly with these provisions may result in loss of the right of appraisal. For a more complete\ndescription of B/E Aerospace stockholders\' appraisal rights, see "The Merger\xe2\x80\x94Appraisal Rights" beginning on page 119.\n\n23\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/861361/000104746917000512/a2230778zdefm14a.htm\n\n32/330\n\n\x0c8/28/2019\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/861361/000104746917000512/a2230778zdefm14a.htm\n\nTable of Contents\n\n \n\nRegulatory Approvals \n\n        The merger is subject to the requirements of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, which is\nreferred to as the HSR Act, which prevents Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace from completing the merger until required\ninformation and materials are furnished to the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice, which is referred to as the DOJ, and\nthe Federal Trade Commission, which is referred to as the FTC, and the HSR Act waiting period is terminated or expires. On\nNovember 7, 2016, Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace filed the requisite notification and report forms under the HSR Act with\nthe DOJ and the FTC. The required 30-day waiting period under the HSR Act expired at 11:59 Eastern time on December 7, 2016.\n\n        The merger is also subject to antitrust review by governmental authorities in several foreign jurisdictions in which the\ncompanies have a sufficient market presence to require filings. The parties are making filings in Europe, China, the Philippines,\nSouth Korea and Turkey.\n\n        Although we expect that all regulatory clearances and approvals will be obtained, we cannot assure you that these clearances\nand approvals will be timely obtained or obtained under the terms of the merger agreement at all or that the granting of these\nclearances and approvals will not involve the imposition of additional conditions on the completion of the merger, including the\nrequirement to divest assets, or require changes to the terms of the merger agreement. These conditions or changes could result in\nthe conditions to the merger not being satisfied.\n\n        For a more complete description of regulatory approvals relating to the merger, see "The Merger\xe2\x80\x94Regulatory\nApprovals Required for the Merger" beginning on page 116.\n\nLitigation Relating to the Merger\n\n        In connection with the merger, three putative class action lawsuits were filed by three different purported B/E Aerospace\nstockholders. The lawsuits allege, among other things, that the Form S-4 filed by Rockwell Collins on November 23, 2016 misstates\nand/or omits material information. Two of the lawsuits assert claims against B/E Aerospace and the members of the B/E Aerospace\nBoard; the other lawsuit asserts claims against B/E Aerospace, the members of the B/E Aerospace Board, Rockwell Collins and\nMerger Sub. The lawsuits seek to enjoin the merger, to recover damages and other relief.

The actual exchange ratio will be adjusted to reflect changes in the price of Rockwell Collins\ncommon stock prior to the closing of the merger as described in the section entitled "The Merger Agreement\xe2\x80\x94Merger\nConsideration to be Received by B/E Aerospace Stockholders" beginning on page 128 this joint proxy statement/prospectus. These\ncomputations exclude the $34.10 per share cash portion of the merger consideration.\n\n        The unaudited pro forma per share information reflects the merger and related transactions as if they had occurred on\nOctober 1, 2015 in the case of income from continuing operations per share, and as if they had occurred on September 30, 2016 in\nthe case of book value per share. The information in the table is based on, and should be read together with, the historical financial\ninformation of Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace which is incorporated by reference in this joint proxy statement/prospectus and\nthe financial information contained under "Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements," "Selected Historical\nFinancial Data\xe2\x80\x94Selected Historical Consolidated Financial Data of Rockwell Collins" and "Selected Historical Financial Data\xe2\x80\x94\nSelected Historical Consolidated Financial Data of B/E Aerospace" beginning on page 173, page 35, and page 37, respectively.

The table also shows the estimated implied value of the per share consideration proposed for\neach share of B/E Aerospace common stock as of the same two days. This implied value was calculated by multiplying the closing\nprices of shares of Rockwell Collins common stock on those dates by the exchange ratio of 0.3101 (based on the closing price of\nRockwell Collins\' common stock as of the close of business on January 26, 2017, the most recent practicable date for which such\ninformation was available) and adding the cash portion of the merger consideration of $34.10 per share, without interest. The\nmarket prices of Rockwell Collins common stock and B/E Aerospace common stock will fluctuate before the special meetings and\nbefore the merger is completed. The exchange ratio may be adjusted to reflect changes in the Rockwell Collins stock price prior to\nthe closing of the merger, and the number of shares of Rockwell Collins common stock to be issued as part of the stock\nconsideration (and, in turn, the value of the merger consideration to be received in exchange for each share of B/E Aerospace\ncommon stock) may fluctuate with the market value of Rockwell Collins common stock until the last trading day before the merger\nis complete.\n\n \nOctober 21, 2016\nJanuary 26, 2017\n\nRockwell Collins\nCommon Stock\n\nB/E Aerospace\nCommon Stock\n\n \n\n \n\nImplied Per Share Value\nof Merger Consideration\n\n \n\n84.46  $\n91.26  $\n\n50.61  $\n61.72  $\n\n62.00 \n62.40 \n\n \n  $\n  $\n\n        The market prices of Rockwell Collins common stock and B/E Aerospace common stock have fluctuated since the date of the\nannouncement of the merger agreement and will continue to fluctuate from the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus to the\ndate of the Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace special meetings and the date the merger is completed and thereafter. No assurance\ncan be given concerning the market prices of Rockwell Collins common stock or B/E Aerospace common stock before completion\nof the merger or Rockwell Collins common stock after completion of the merger.

In addition, you should read and\nconsider the risks associated with each of the businesses of B/E Aerospace and Rockwell Collins because these risks will relate to the\ncombined company following the completion of the merger. Descriptions of some of these risks can be found in the Rockwell Collins\nannual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 and the B/E Aerospace annual report on Form 10-K for the\nfiscal year ended December 31, 2015, as such risks may be updated or supplemented in each company\'s subsequently filed Quarterly\nReports on Form 10-Q or Current Reports on Form 8-K, which are incorporated by reference into this joint proxy statement/prospectus.\nYou should also consider the other information in this document and the other documents incorporated by reference into this document.\nSee the section entitled "Where You Can Find More Information" beginning on page 198.\n\nRisks Related to the Merger \n\nThe merger is subject to conditions, some or all of which may not be satisfied, or completed on a timely basis, if at all. Failure to\ncomplete the merger could have material adverse effects on Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace.\n\n        The completion of the merger is subject to a number of conditions, including, among other things, receipt of the Rockwell Collins\nStockholder Approval, receipt of the B/E Aerospace Stockholder Approval and receipt of certain other regulatory approvals, which make\nthe completion and timing of the completion of the merger uncertain. See the section entitled "The Merger Agreement\xe2\x80\x94Conditions to the\nMerger," beginning on page 148, for a more detailed discussion. Also, either Rockwell Collins or B/E Aerospace may terminate the\nmerger agreement if the merger has not been consummated by 5:00 p.m. (New York time) on October 21, 2017, except that this right to\nterminate the merger agreement will not be available to any party whose failure to perform or comply with any of its obligations under the\nmerger agreement has been the principal cause of or resulted in the failure of the closing of the merger to have occurred on or before that\ndate.\n\n        If the merger is not completed, Rockwell Collins\' and B/E Aerospace\'s respective ongoing businesses may be materially adversely\naffected and, without realizing any of the benefits of having completed the merger, Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace will be subject to\na number of risks, including the following:\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nthe market price of Rockwell Collins common stock or B/E Aerospace common stock could decline; \n\nRockwell Collins or B/E Aerospace could owe substantial termination fees to the other party under certain circumstances; \n\nif the merger agreement is terminated and the Rockwell Collins Board or the B/E Aerospace Board seeks another business\ncombination, Rockwell Collins stockholders and B/E Aerospace stockholders cannot be certain that Rockwell Collins or\nB/E Aerospace will be able to find a party willing to enter into a transaction on terms equivalent to or more attractive than\nthe terms that the other party has agreed to in the merger agreement; \n\ntime and resources, financial and other, committed by Rockwell Collins\' and B/E Aerospace\'s respective management to\nmatters relating to the merger could otherwise have been devoted to pursuing other beneficial opportunities for their\nrespective companies;\n\n46\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/861361/000104746917000512/a2230778zdefm14a.htm\n\n56/330\n\n\x0c8/28/2019\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/861361/000104746917000512/a2230778zdefm14a.htm\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nRockwell Collins or B/E Aerospace may experience negative reactions from the financial markets or from their respective\ncustomers or employees; and \n\nRockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace may be required to pay their respective costs relating to the merger, such as legal,\naccounting, financial advisory and printing fees, whether or not the merger is completed.\n\n        In addition, if the merger is not completed, Rockwell Collins or B/E Aerospace could be subject to litigation related to any failure to\ncomplete the merger or related to any enforcement proceeding commenced against Rockwell Collins or B/E Aerospace to perform their\nrespective obligations under the merger agreement. The materialization of any of these risks could materially and adversely impact\nRockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace\'s respective ongoing businesses.\n\n        Similarly, delays in the completion of the merger could, among other things, result in additional transaction costs, loss of revenue or\nother negative effects associated with uncertainty about completion of the merger.\n\nThe merger agreement contains provisions that limit each party\'s ability to pursue alternatives to the merger, could discourage a\npotential competing acquiror of either Rockwell Collins or B/E Aerospace from making a favorable alternative transaction proposal\nand, in specified circumstances, could require either party to pay substantial termination fees to the other party.\n\n        The merger agreement contains certain provisions that restrict each of Rockwell Collins\' and B/E Aerospace\'s ability to, among other\nthings, initiate, seek, solicit, knowingly encourage, knowingly induce or take any other action reasonably expected to lead to, or engage in\nnegotiations or discussions relating to, or approve or recommend, any third-party acquisition proposal. Further, even if the Rockwell\nCollins Board withdraws or qualifies its recommendation with respect to the issuance of Rockwell Collins common stock forming part of\nthe merger consideration or if the B/E Aerospace Board withdraws or qualifies its recommendation with respect to the adoption of the\nmerger agreement, in each case as permitted by the merger agreement, unless the merger agreement has also been terminated in\naccordance with its terms, Rockwell Collins or B/E Aerospace, as the case may be, will still be required to submit each of the Share\nIssuance proposal and the Merger proposal, as applicable, to a vote at their special meeting of stockholders. In addition, following receipt\nby Rockwell Collins or B/E Aerospace, as the case may be, of any third-party acquisition proposal that constitutes a "superior proposal,"\nthe other party will have an opportunity to offer to modify the terms of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement before the\nboard of directors of the receiving party may withdraw or qualify its recommendation with respect to the Share Issuance proposal or the\nMerger proposal, as applicable, in favor of such superior proposal, as described further under "The Merger Agreement\xe2\x80\x94Covenants and\nAgreements\xe2\x80\x94No Solicitation" beginning on page 141.\n\n        In some circumstances, upon termination of the merger agreement, Rockwell Collins could be required to pay a termination fee of\n$300 million to B/E Aerospace and B/E Aerospace could be required to pay a termination fee of $200 million to Rockwell Collins. For\nfurther discussion, see the section entitled "The Merger Agreement\xe2\x80\x94Termination;\xe2\x80\x94Effect of Termination;\xe2\x80\x94Termination Fees and\nExpense Reimbursements" beginning on page 152.\n\n        These provisions could discourage a potential third-party acquiror or merger partner that might have an interest in acquiring all or a\nsignificant portion of Rockwell Collins or B/E Aerospace or pursuing an alternative transaction from considering or proposing such a\ntransaction, even if it were prepared to pay consideration with a higher per share cash or market value than the per share cash or market\nvalue proposed to be received or realized in the merger. In particular, a termination fee, if applicable, may be substantial, and could result\nin a potential third-party acquiror or merger partner proposing to pay a lower price to the Rockwell Collins stockholders or B/E Aerospace\nstockholders than it might otherwise have proposed to pay absent such a fee.\n\n47\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/861361/000104746917000512/a2230778zdefm14a.htm\n\n57/330\n\n\x0c8/28/2019\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/861361/000104746917000512/a2230778zdefm14a.htm\n\nTable of Contents\n\n        If the merger agreement is terminated and either Rockwell Collins or B/E Aerospace determines to seek another business\ncombination, Rockwell Collins or B/E Aerospace, as applicable, may not be able to negotiate a transaction with another party on terms\ncomparable to, or better than, the terms of the merger.\n\nThe merger is subject to the expiration or termination of applicable waiting periods and the receipt of approvals, consents or\nclearances from regulatory authorities that may impose conditions that could have an adverse effect on B/E Aerospace, Rockwell\nCollins or the combined company or, if not obtained, could prevent completion of the merger.\n\n        Before the merger may be completed, any applicable waiting period (and any extension thereof) under the HSR Act relating to the\nconsummation of the merger must have expired or been terminated, and any authorization or consent from a governmental authority\nrequired to be obtained with respect to the merger in certain other applicable foreign antitrust laws must have been obtained. In deciding\nwhether to grant the required regulatory authorization or consent, the relevant governmental entities will consider the effect of the merger\non competition within their relevant jurisdiction. The terms and conditions of the authorizations and consents that are granted may impose\nrequirements, limitations or costs or place restrictions on the conduct of the combined company\'s business. Under the merger agreement,\nRockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace have agreed to use their reasonable best efforts to obtain such authorizations and consents and\ntherefore may be required to comply with conditions or limitations imposed by governmental authorities, except that Rockwell Collins will\nnot be required to agree to sell, divest, lease, license, transfer, dispose of or otherwise encumber or impair its ability to own or operate any\nof its or B/E Aerospace\'s assets or properties if such action would require the divestiture or holding separate of any assets of Rockwell\nCollins or B/E Aerospace or any of their subsidiaries representing more than $175 million of annual revenue generated in the 2015\ncalendar year.\n\n        In addition, regulators may impose conditions, terms, obligations or restrictions in connection with their authorization of or consent to\nthe merger, and such conditions, terms, obligations or restrictions may delay completion of the merger or impose additional material costs\non or materially limit the revenues of the combined company following the completion of the merger or may hinder the anticipated\nbenefits of the merger. There can be no assurance that regulators will choose not to impose such conditions, terms, obligations or\nrestrictions, and, if imposed, such conditions, terms, obligations or restrictions may delay or lead to the abandonment of the merger.

If the\nRockwell Collins stock price is greater than or equal to $77.41 and less than or equal to $89.97, the exchange ratio will be equal to the\nquotient of (i) $27.90 divided by (ii) the Rockwell Collins stock\n\n48\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/861361/000104746917000512/a2230778zdefm14a.htm\n\n58/330\n\n\x0c8/28/2019\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/861361/000104746917000512/a2230778zdefm14a.htm\n\nTable of Contents\n\nprice, which, in each case, will result in the stock consideration having a value equal to $27.90. If Rockwell Collins stock price is greater\nthan $89.97, the exchange ratio will be fixed at 0.3101 and the value of the stock consideration will be more than $27.90, and if the\nRockwell Collins stock price is less than $77.41, the exchange ratio will be fixed at 0.3604 and the value of the stock consideration will be\nless than $27.90. Accordingly, the actual number of shares and the value of Rockwell Collins common stock delivered to B/E Aerospace\nstockholders will depend on the Rockwell Collins stock price, and the value of the shares of Rockwell Collins common stock delivered for\neach such share of B/E Aerospace common stock may be greater than, less than or equal to $27.90.\n\n        It is impossible to accurately predict the market price of Rockwell Collins common stock at the effective time or during the period\nover which the Rockwell Collins stock price is calculated and therefore impossible to accurately predict the number or value of the shares\nof Rockwell Collins common stock that B/E Aerospace stockholders will receive in the merger. You should obtain current market\nquotations for shares of Rockwell Collins common stock.\n\nEach party is subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the proposed merger is pending, which could\nadversely affect each party\'s business and operations.\n\n        In connection with the pendency of the merger, it is possible that some customers, suppliers and other persons with whom Rockwell\nCollins or B/E Aerospace has a business relationship may delay or defer certain business decisions or might decide to seek to terminate,\nchange or renegotiate their relationships with Rockwell Collins or B/E Aerospace, as the case may be, as a result of the merger, which\ncould negatively affect Rockwell Collins\' or B/E Aerospace\'s respective revenues, earnings and cash flows, as well as the market price of\nRockwell Collins common stock or B/E Aerospace common stock, regardless of whether the merger is completed.\n\n        Under the terms of the merger agreement, B/E Aerospace is subject to certain restrictions on the conduct of its business prior to\ncompleting the merger which may adversely affect its ability to execute certain of its business strategies, including the ability in certain\ncases to enter into or amend contracts, acquire or dispose of assets, incur indebtedness or incur capital expenditures. Such limitations could\nadversely affect B/E Aerospace\'s business and operations prior to the completion of the merger.\n\n        Under the terms of the merger agreement, Rockwell Collins is subject to a more limited set of restrictions on the conduct of its\nbusiness prior to completing the merger which may adversely affect its ability to execute certain of its business strategies, including the\nability in certain cases to amend its organizational documents, pay dividends and issue shares of Rockwell Collins common stock. Such\nlimitations could adversely affect Rockwell Collins\' business and operations prior to the completion of the merger.\n\n        Each of the risks described above may be exacerbated by delays or other adverse developments with respect to the completion of the\nmerger.\n\nUncertainties associated with the merger may cause a loss of management personnel and other key employees which could adversely\naffect the future business and operations of the combined company.\n\n        Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace are dependent on the experience and industry knowledge of their officers and other key\nemployees to execute their business plans. The combined company\'s success after the completion of the merger will depend in part upon\nthe ability of Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace to retain certain key management personnel and employees. Prior to completion of the\nmerger, current and prospective employees of Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace may experience uncertainty about their roles within\nthe combined company following the completion of the merger, which may have an adverse effect on the ability of each of Rockwell\nCollins and B/E Aerospace to attract or retain key management and other key personnel.

Two of the lawsuits assert claims against B/E Aerospace and the members of the B/E Aerospace Board; the other lawsuit\nasserts claims against B/E Aerospace, the members of the B/E Aerospace Board, Rockwell Collins and Merger Sub. The lawsuits seek to\nenjoin the merger, recover damages and other relief. For a more detailed description of litigation in connection with the merger, see "The\nMerger\xe2\x80\x94Litigation Relating to the Merger."\n\n        The outcome of these lawsuits is uncertain. One of the conditions to the closing of the merger is that no governmental authority has\nissued or entered any order after the date of the merger agreement having the effect of enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the\nconsummation of the merger or the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, and these lawsuits seek an order enjoining\nconsummation of the merger. If the cases are not resolved, these lawsuits could prevent or delay completion of the merger and result in\nsubstantial costs to Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace, including, but not limited to, costs associated with the indemnification of\ndirectors and officers. The defense or settlement of any lawsuit or claim that remains unresolved at the time the merger is completed may\nadversely affect Rockwell Collins\' and B/E Aerospace\'s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\nThe unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information in this joint proxy statement/prospectus is presented for\nillustrative purposes only and may not be reflective of the operating results and financial condition of the combined company following\ncompletion of the merger.\n\n        The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information in this joint proxy statement/prospectus is presented for\nillustrative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of what the combined company\'s actual financial position or results of\noperations would have been had the merger been completed on the dates indicated. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined\nfinancial information is subject to a number of assumptions, and does not take into account any synergies related to the proposed\ntransaction. Further, the combined company\'s actual results and financial position after the merger may differ materially and adversely\nfrom the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial data that is included in this joint proxy statement/prospectus. The unaudited\npro forma condensed combined financial information has been prepared with the expectation, as of the date of this joint proxy\nstatement/prospectus, that Rockwell Collins will be identified as the acquirer under GAAP and reflects adjustments based upon\npreliminary estimates of the fair value of assets to be acquired and liabilities to be assumed. The final acquisition accounting will be based\nupon the actual purchase price and the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the party that is determined to be the acquiree under GAAP\nas of the date of the completion of the merger. In addition, subsequent to the closing date, there will be further refinements of the\nacquisition accounting as additional information becomes available. Accordingly, the final acquisition accounting may differ materially\nfrom the pro forma condensed combined financial information reflected in this document.

If Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace are unable to negotiate waivers of those provisions, the counterparties may exercise their\nrights and remedies under the agreements, potentially terminating the agreements or seeking monetary damages. Even if Rockwell Collins\nand B/E Aerospace are able to negotiate waivers, the counterparties may require a fee for such waivers or seek to renegotiate the\nagreements on terms less favorable to B/E Aerospace or the combined company. Any of the foregoing or similar developments may have\nan adverse impact on the combined company\'s business and results of operations.\n\nThe Rockwell Collins common stock to be received by B/E Aerospace stockholders upon completion of the merger will have different\nrights from shares of B/E Aerospace common stock.\n\n        Upon completion of the merger, B/E Aerospace stockholders will no longer be stockholders of B/E Aerospace but will instead\nbecome stockholders of Rockwell Collins and their rights as Rockwell Collins stockholders will be governed by the terms of Rockwell\nCollins\' certificate of incorporation and by-laws. The terms of Rockwell Collins\' certificate of incorporation and by-laws are in some\nrespects materially different than the terms of B/E Aerospace\'s certificate of incorporation and by-laws, which currently govern the rights\nof B/E Aerospace stockholders.\n\n        For a more complete description of the different rights associated with shares of B/E Aerospace common stock and shares of\nRockwell Collins common stock, see "Comparison of Rights of Stockholders of Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace" beginning on\npage 187.\n\nThe merger could result in significant liability to Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace if the merger causes the KLX spin-off to fail to\nqualify for the KLX spin-off tax treatment.\n\n        At the time of the KLX spin-off, B/E Aerospace received an opinion of Shearman & Sterling to the effect that, subject to the\nlimitations and assumptions set forth therein, the KLX spin-off that occurred in December 2014 will qualify for the KLX spin-off tax\ntreatment, which generally means a transaction tax-free to B/E Aerospace and its stockholders under the U.S. federal income tax rules for\nspin-offs in Section 355 of the Code and related provisions. If, however, the KLX spin-off were to fail to qualify for the KLX spin-off tax\ntreatment, B/E Aerospace would be subject to tax on substantial gain as if B/E Aerospace had sold the KLX common stock in a taxable\nsale for its fair market value at the time of the KLX spin-off. In addition, if the KLX spin-off failed to qualify for tax-free treatment, each\nB/E Aerospace stockholder at the time of the KLX spin-off would be treated as if it had received a distribution from B/E Aerospace in an\namount equal to the fair market value of the KLX common stock that they received; this distribution generally would be taxed as a\ndividend to the extent of the stockholder\'s pro rata share of B/E Aerospace\'s current and accumulated earnings and profits at the time of the\nKLX spin-off and then treated as a non-taxable return of capital to the extent of the stockholder\'s basis in the B/E Aerospace common\nstock and finally as capital gain from the sale or exchange of B/E Aerospace common stock.\n\n        Under current U.S. federal income tax law, the KLX spin-off would fail to qualify for the KLX spin-off tax treatment if the KLX\nspin-off was determined to have been used by B/E Aerospace principally as a device for the distribution of earnings and profits by, for\nexample, facilitating a taxable sale of the stock of B/E Aerospace or KLX through a planned or intended change-in-control transaction\nidentified prior to the KLX spin-off rather than principally to achieve one or more valid corporate business purposes. Furthermore, even if\nthe KLX spin-off were otherwise to qualify for tax-free treatment under Section 355 and related provisions of the Code, it would be\ntaxable to B/E\n\n51\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/861361/000104746917000512/a2230778zdefm14a.htm\n\n61/330\n\n\x0c8/28/2019\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/861361/000104746917000512/a2230778zdefm14a.htm\n\nTable of Contents\n\nAerospace (but not to B/E Aerospace\'s stockholders) under Section 355(e) of the Code, if the KLX spin-off was determined to be part of a\nplan (or series of related transactions) pursuant to which one or more persons acquire, directly or indirectly, stock representing a 50% or\ngreater interest in B/E Aerospace or KLX.\n\n        If it is determined that the KLX spin-off fails to qualify for the KLX spin-off tax treatment as a result of the merger (for example, if\nthe merger is viewed as part of a plan or series of related transactions that includes the KLX spin-off or the KLX spin-off is found to have\nbeen used principally as a device for the distribution of earnings and profits), or because of the failure of the KLX spin-off to initially\nqualify for the KLX spin-off tax treatment, B/E Aerospace could incur significant tax liabilities. Because B/E Aerospace will be a wholly\nowned subsidiary of Rockwell Collins following the consummation of the merger, any such tax liabilities of B/E Aerospace could also\nadversely affect Rockwell Collins. If the KLX spin-off fails to qualify for the KLX spin-off tax treatment, this may also result in adverse\ntax consequences to stockholders of B/E Aerospace at the time of the KLX spin-off because they would be taxed on the distribution of\nKLX stock as described above.\n\n        In connection with the signing of the merger agreement, Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace each received an opinion from their\nrespective counsel, Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP, which is referred to as Skadden, and Shearman & Sterling to the effect\nthat the merger will not cause the KLX spin-off to fail to qualify for the KLX spin-off tax treatment. The merger is conditioned upon\nreceipt by Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace of tax opinions to the same effect at the time of the consummation of the merger;\nprovided, however, that if either party\'s tax counsel indicates it is unwilling or unable to deliver a tax opinion at the time of the\nconsummation of the merger, the tax opinion condition of either Rockwell Collins or B/E Aerospace may be satisfied by such party\'s\nreceipt of similar tax opinions from both the other party\'s tax counsel and the additional tax counsel.\n\n        The tax opinions received by Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace in connection with the signing of the merger agreement rely on\ncertain representations, assumptions, undertakings and covenants, and the opinions to be delivered at the consummation of the merger will\nbe based on similar representations, assumptions, undertakings and covenants, including representation letters from each of Rockwell\nCollins and B/E Aerospace. These representations relate to, among other items, confirming the accuracy of the representations and\nwarranties originally made with respect to the KLX spin-off, along with compliance with covenants, the actions taken in pursuit of the\ncorporate business purposes of the KLX spin-off, the interaction of the parties, and business developments since the KLX spin-off. If any\nof the factual representations in any of the representation letters, or any of the assumptions in the tax opinions is untrue or incomplete, an\nundertaking or covenant is not complied with or the facts upon which a tax opinion is based are materially different from the facts at the\ntime of the merger, the opinions may not be valid. Moreover, opinions of counsel are not binding on the IRS or the courts. As a result, the\nconclusions expressed in the tax opinions could be challenged by the IRS, and a court may sustain such a challenge. None of Rockwell\nCollins, B/E Aerospace or KLX has requested a ruling from the IRS regarding the impact of the merger on the qualification of the KLX\nspin-off for the KLX spin-off tax treatment.\n\nRisks Relating to the Combined Company after Completion of the Merger \n\nThe combined company may be unable to successfully integrate the businesses of Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace and realize the\nanticipated benefits of the merger.\n\n        The success of the merger will depend, in part, on the combined company\'s ability to successfully combine the businesses of\nRockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace, which currently operate as independent public companies, and realize the anticipated benefits,\nincluding synergies, cost savings, innovation and operational efficiencies, from the combination.

Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace have not previously completed a transaction comparable in size\nor scope to the proposed merger. The integration of the two companies may result in material challenges, including, without limitation:\n\nthe diversion of management\'s attention from ongoing business concerns and performance shortfalls at one or both of the\ncompanies as a result of the devotion of management\'s attention to the merger; \n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nmanaging a larger combined company; \n\nmaintaining employee morale and retaining key management and other employees; \n\nthe possibility of faulty assumptions underlying expectations regarding the integration process; \n\nretaining existing business and operational relationships and attracting new business and operational relationships; \n\nconsolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures and eliminating duplicative operations; \n\ncoordinating geographically separate organizations; \n\nunanticipated issues in integrating information technology, communications and other systems; and \n\nunforeseen expenses or delays associated with the merger.\n\n        Many of these factors will be outside of the combined company\'s control and any one of them could result in delays, increased costs,\ndecreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management\'s time and energy, which could materially affect the combined\ncompany\'s financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\n\n        Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace are currently permitted to conduct only limited planning for the integration of the two\ncompanies following the merger and have not yet determined the exact nature of how the businesses and operations of the two companies\nwill be combined after the merger. The actual integration may result in additional and unforeseen expenses, and the anticipated benefits of\nthe integration plan may not be realized on a timely basis, if at all.\n\nRockwell Collins stockholders and B/E Aerospace stockholders will have a reduced ownership and voting interest after the merger and\nwill exercise less influence over the policies of the combined company than they now have on the policies of Rockwell Collins and B/E\nAerospace, respectively.\n\n        Rockwell Collins stockholders presently have the right to vote in the election of the Rockwell Collins Board and on other matters\naffecting Rockwell Collins. B/E Aerospace stockholders presently have the right to vote in the election of the B/E Aerospace Board and on\nother matters affecting B/E Aerospace. Immediately after the merger is completed, it is expected that current Rockwell Collins\nstockholders will own approximately 80.8% of the combined company\'s common stock outstanding and current B/E Aerospace\nstockholders will own approximately 19.2% of the combined company\'s common stock outstanding.\n\n53\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/861361/000104746917000512/a2230778zdefm14a.htm\n\n63/330\n\n\x0c8/28/2019\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/861361/000104746917000512/a2230778zdefm14a.htm\n\nTable of Contents\n\n        As a result, current Rockwell Collins stockholders and current B/E Aerospace stockholders will have less influence on the policies of\nthe combined company than they now have on the policies of Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace, respectively.\n\nThe future results of the combined company may be adversely impacted if the combined company does not effectively manage its\nexpanded operations following the completion of the merger.\n\n        Following the completion of the merger, the size of the combined company\'s business will be significantly larger than the current size\nof either Rockwell Collins\' or B/E Aerospace\'s respective businesses. The combined company\'s ability to successfully manage this\nexpanded business will depend, in part, upon management\'s ability to design and implement strategic initiatives that address not only the\nintegration of two discrete companies, but also the increased scale and scope of the combined business with its associated increased costs\nand complexity. There can be no assurances that the combined company will be successful or that it will realize the expected operating\nefficiencies, cost savings and other benefits currently anticipated from the merger.\n\nThe combined company is expected to incur substantial expenses related to the completion of the merger and the integration of\nRockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace.\n\n        There are a large number of processes, policies, procedures, operations, technologies and systems that must be integrated, including\npurchasing, accounting and finance, sales, payroll, pricing, revenue recognition, marketing, employee benefits, legal and compliance,\nstrategic and financial planning, information technology and treasury. In addition, the businesses of Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace\nwill continue to maintain a presence in Cedar Rapids, Iowa and Wellington, Florida, respectively. The substantial majority of these costs\nwill be non-recurring expenses related to the merger (including financing of the merger and the refinancing of certain indebtedness),\nfacilities and systems consolidation costs. The combined company may incur additional costs to maintain employee morale and to retain\nkey employees. Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace will also incur transaction fees and costs related to formulating integration plans for\nthe combined business, and the execution of these plans may lead to additional unanticipated costs and time delays. Additionally, as a\nresult of the merger, rating agencies may take negative actions with regard to the combined company\'s credit ratings, which may increase\nthe combined company\'s costs in connection with the financing of the merger and its future cost of capital. These incremental transaction\nand merger-related costs may exceed the savings the combined company expects to achieve from the elimination of duplicative costs and\nthe realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses, particularly in the near term and in the event there are\nmaterial unanticipated costs.\n\nThe combined company will be significantly more leveraged than Rockwell Collins is currently.\n\n        In connection with the merger, the combined company intends to seek approximately $5.9 billion in additional indebtedness. The\ncombined company will have consolidated indebtedness of approximately $8.0 billion, which is greater than the current indebtedness of\nRockwell Collins prior to the merger. The increased indebtedness and higher debt-to-total capitalization ratio of the combined company in\ncomparison to that of Rockwell Collins on a historical basis may have the effect, among other things, of reducing the flexibility of\nRockwell Collins to respond to changing business and economic conditions, requiring the combined company to use substantial amounts\nof cash flow to acquire indebtedness, increasing borrowing costs and placing the combined company in a disadvantage compared to its\ncompetitors with less leverage.\n\n        For a more complete description of the financial impact of the combined company\'s indebtedness, see "Unaudited Pro Forma\nCondensed Combined Financial Statements" beginning on page 173.\n\n54\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/861361/000104746917000512/a2230778zdefm14a.htm\n\n64/330\n\n\x0c8/28/2019\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/861361/000104746917000512/a2230778zdefm14a.htm\n\nTable of Contents\n\nThe financing arrangements that Rockwell Collins has entered into in connection with the merger contain restrictions and limitations\nthat could, under certain circumstances, significantly impact its ability to operate its business.\n\n        Rockwell Collins intends to incur significant new indebtedness in connection with the merger. The agreements governing the\nindebtedness that it will incur in connection with the merger contain covenants that, among other things, may, under certain circumstances,\nplace limitations on the dollar amounts paid or other actions relating to:\n\nconsolidating with or merging into any other corporation or conveying or transferring its properties and assets substantially\nas an entirety; \n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nincurring secured debt; \n\nentering into sale and leaseback transactions; and \n\ndesignating subsidiaries as restricted or unrestricted.\n\n        Such agreements also require the combined company to maintain a debt-to-capitalization ratio, which may further limit the combined\ncompany\'s discretion in the operation of its business following the merger. Such agreements also contain additional restrictive covenants.\nVarious risks, uncertainties and events beyond the combined company\'s control could affect its ability to comply with the covenants\ncontained in its debt agreements. Failure to comply with any of the covenants in its existing or future financing agreements could result in\na default under those agreements and under other agreements containing cross-default provisions. A default would permit lenders to\naccelerate the maturity of the debt under these agreements. Under these circumstances, Rockwell Collins might not have sufficient funds\nor other resources to satisfy all of its obligations. In addition, the limitations imposed by financing agreements on the combined company\'s\nability to incur additional debt and to take other actions might significantly impair its ability to obtain other financing.\n\nThe market price of the combined company\'s common stock may be affected by factors different from those affecting the price of\nRockwell Collins or B/E Aerospace common stock.\n\n        Upon completion of the merger, holders of Rockwell Collins common stock and B/E Aerospace common stock will be holders of\ncommon stock of Rockwell Collins. As the businesses of Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace are different, the results of operations as\nwell as the price of the combined company\'s common stock may in the future be affected by factors different from those factors affecting\nRockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace as independent stand-alone companies. The combined company will face additional risks and\nuncertainties that Rockwell Collins or B/E Aerospace may currently not be exposed to as independent companies.\n\nThe market price of Rockwell Collins\' common stock may decline as a result of the merger.\n\n        The market price of Rockwell Collins common stock may decline as a result of the merger if, among other things, the combined\ncompany is unable to achieve the expected growth in earnings, or if the operational cost savings estimates in connection with the\nintegration of Rockwell Collins\' and B/E Aerospace\'s businesses are not realized, or if the transaction costs related to the merger are\ngreater than expected, or if the financing related to the transaction is on unfavorable terms. The market price also may decline if the\ncombined company does not achieve the perceived benefits of the merger as rapidly or to the extent anticipated by financial or industry\nanalysts or if the effect of the merger on the combined company\'s financial position, results of operations or cash flows is not consistent\nwith the expectations of financial or industry analysts.\n\n55\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/861361/000104746917000512/a2230778zdefm14a.htm\n\n65/330\n\n\x0c8/28/2019\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/861361/000104746917000512/a2230778zdefm14a.htm\n\nTable of Contents\n\nOther Risk Factors of Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace\n\n        Rockwell Collins\' and B/E Aerospace\'s businesses are and will be subject to the risks described above.

You are urged to read carefully the merger agreement in its entirety, a copy of which is attached as Annex A to this joint proxy\nstatement/prospectus and incorporated by reference herein.\n\nBackground of the Merger \n\n        As part of B/E Aerospace\'s ongoing strategic planning process, members of the B/E Aerospace Board and members of B/E Aerospace\nsenior management periodically review and assess B/E Aerospace\'s operations, financial performance and competitive position, as well as\nindustry trends and potential strategic initiatives. In addition, members of B/E Aerospace senior management meet with members of the\nB/E Aerospace Board in the ordinary course of business to discuss strategic alternatives in order to enhance stockholder value, including,\namong other things, business combinations, acquisitions, divestitures, dividends and share repurchases. In connection with these reviews\nand assessments, from time to time, the B/E Aerospace Board and members of B/E Aerospace senior management enlist the assistance of\nfinancial advisors and outside legal advisors.\n\n        As part of Rockwell Collins\' ongoing strategic planning process, members of the Rockwell Collins Board and members of Rockwell\nCollins senior management periodically review and assess Rockwell Collins\' operations, financial performance and competitive position,\nas well as industry trends and potential strategic initiatives to accelerate growth. As part of this process, Rockwell Collins considered a\nnumber of alternatives to expand and strengthen its business. Given Rockwell Collins\' strong position in the products and services that it\ncurrently serves, Rockwell Collins determined to focus its consideration of possible growth opportunities on businesses that were adjacent\nto Rockwell Collins current products and services. Rockwell Collins evaluated the possibility of expanding channels or capabilities, but\ndetermined that adding products and services that would build on Rockwell Collins\' existing strong customer relationships would be a\nmore efficient and lower risk path.\n\n        Accordingly, in early 2015, Rockwell Collins undertook an initiative to assess the desirability of expanding the industry segments\naddressed by Rockwell Collins. This initiative involved a strategic assessment of Rockwell Collins\' capabilities and customer\nrelationships. Starting with approximately 80 companies that fit a general set of criteria, potential targets were analyzed against these\ncriteria. In considering potential acquisition targets, Rockwell Collins considered a number of factors and qualities with respect to potential\nacquisition targets, including the technical differentiation of their respective products and services, the similarity of regulatory regimes in\nwhich they operated, their leadership position in the segments that they served, their customer relationships and reputation and their full\nproduct life cycle capability. At Rockwell Collins\' board meeting in June 2015, a short list of potential targets, which included B/E\nAerospace, was presented. In subsequent board meetings in November 2015, April 2016 and June 2016, the candidates were evaluated\nagainst changing market conditions and assessed fit. The short list of targets evaluated by the Rockwell Collins Board at these meetings\nvaried from 2 to 4 companies. Changes in the composition of the list were made based on Rockwell Collins\' ongoing valuation analysis\nand consideration of market conditions, as well as Rockwell Collins\' assessment of the potential target\'s receptivity to a potential sale\ntransaction. B/E Aerospace remained an acquisition candidate of interest throughout this time.\n\n        The following chronology sets forth a summary of the material events leading up to the execution of the merger agreement.\n\n        In January 2016, a representative of a company, referred to as Party A, contacted Mr. Amin J. Khoury, Executive Chairman of B/E\nAerospace, seeking to arrange a meeting. In the ordinary course of business, B/E Aerospace senior management met with Party A from\ntime to time to discuss, generally, the ongoing business relationship between the parties. In advance of this particular meeting,\n\n57\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/861361/000104746917000512/a2230778zdefm14a.htm\n\n67/330\n\n\x0c8/28/2019\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/861361/000104746917000512/a2230778zdefm14a.htm\n\nTable of Contents\n\nrepresentatives of Party A requested to include a member of its business development team at such meeting, to which B/E Aerospace\nsenior management agreed. In mid-February 2016, Mr. Khoury met with representatives of Party A. During this meeting, the parties\ndiscussed, among other things, their businesses, their business relationship and general market trends. Party A did not make any specific\ninquiries with respect to a potential transaction involving B/E Aerospace at or following such meeting.\n\n        In February 2016, based on Citigroup\'s prior financial advisory work for Rockwell Collins, representatives of Rockwell Collins\ncontacted representatives of Citigroup to inquire about exploring a potential transaction in the aircraft interiors industry. Following that\ninitial discussion on February 8, Rockwell Collins contacted representatives of Citigroup and expressed preliminary interest in exploring a\npotential transaction with B/E Aerospace.\n\n        In late February 2016, Mr. Jeffrey MacLauchlan, Senior Vice President of Corporate Development of Rockwell Collins, contacted\nMr. Joseph Lower, Chief Financial Officer of B/E Aerospace, to arrange a meeting. On February 29, 2016, Messrs. MacLauchlan and\nLower met to discuss market conditions and industry trends. In addition, Mr. MacLauchlan discussed the complementary nature of\nRockwell Collins\' and B/E Aerospace\'s respective businesses. At the conclusion of the meeting, Messrs. MacLauchlan and Lower agreed\nto stay in touch and to potentially continue their conversation at a future date. Following the meeting, Mr. Lower informed other members\nof B/E Aerospace senior management about the meeting.\n\n        In April 2016, a company, which, together with its parent company is referred to as Party B, called Mr. Khoury to arrange a meeting\nthat would include, among others, a senior executive of Party B. Mr. Khoury notified the B/E Aerospace Board of such request. On\nMay 11, 2016, representatives of B/E Aerospace senior management met with representatives of Party B to explore potential strategic\nalternatives, including an investment in B/E Aerospace by Party B or a combination of B/E Aerospace and Party B. Shortly thereafter,\nParty B informed B/E Aerospace senior management that it was not prepared to make an investment in, or further explore a strategic\ntransaction with, B/E Aerospace.\n\n        Between February and June 2016, Rockwell Collins senior management continued to evaluate potential targets and their relative\nmerits. Rockwell Collins senior management provided a status report of this process to the Rockwell Collins Board at its April 2016\nmeeting. At the June 2016 meeting of the Rockwell Collins Board, Rockwell Collins senior management provided a further update on its\nevaluation and recommended to the Rockwell Collins Board that Rockwell Collins engage more formally with B/E Aerospace to consider\nthe potential for a transaction.\n\n        On or about June 27, 2016, Mr. Kelly Ortberg, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Rockwell Collins, contacted\nMr. Khoury telephonically. Mr. Khoury and Mr. Ortberg discussed the complementary nature of Rockwell Collins\' and B/E Aerospace\'s\nrespective businesses, as well as the prospect of a potential transaction involving the two companies. At the conclusion of the\nconversation, Mr. Ortberg advised that Mr. MacLauchlan would contact Mr. Lower to schedule a face-to-face meeting to continue the\ndiscussions.\n\n        On July 7, 2016, B/E Aerospace and Rockwell Collins executed a mutual non-disclosure agreement. Following execution of the\nagreement, representatives of senior management of Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace scheduled a meeting for July 20, 2016.\n\n        On July 20, 2016, representatives of senior management of B/E Aerospace (Messrs. Khoury and Lower and Mr. Werner Lieberherr,\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer of B/E Aerospace) and Rockwell Collins (Messrs. Ortberg and MacLauchlan, and Mr. Patrick\nAllen, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Rockwell Collins) met at B/E Aerospace\'s headquarters in Wellington, Florida\nto discuss the prospect of a potential transaction involving the two companies. Each party presented portions of their investor relations\nmaterials, which included publicly available information about each company\'s respective financial and operational results, business and\nproduct lines. In addition, B/E Aerospace and Rockwell Collins discussed potential areas of cost and revenue synergies\n\n58\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/861361/000104746917000512/a2230778zdefm14a.htm\n\n68/330\n\n\x0c8/28/2019\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/861361/000104746917000512/a2230778zdefm14a.htm\n\nTable of Contents\n\nthat were identified by each party. Rockwell Collins expressed an interest in continuing discussions to further explore the potential\ncombination benefits. The parties agreed that if further discussions were held, advisors could be helpful in refining these estimates and\napproaches.\n\n        On July 28, 2016, the B/E Aerospace Board met in Boston, Massachusetts in connection with the regularly scheduled annual meeting\nof stockholders of B/E Aerospace. At this meeting, among other matters, B/E Aerospace senior management provided an overview of the\nrecent interest expressed by Party A, Party B and Rockwell Collins in connection with a potential transaction involving B/E Aerospace.\nFollowing conversations amongst the B/E Aerospace Board and B/E Aerospace senior management, the B/E Aerospace Board directed\nB/E Aerospace senior management to explore potential strategic alternatives with assistance from independent financial advisors.\n\n        Subsequent to the B/E Aerospace Board meeting, the parties agreed to meet to continue discussions and to include financial and legal\nadvisors going forward.\n\n        On August 9, 2016, senior management of B/E Aerospace and Rockwell Collins met in New York to continue preliminary\ndiscussions regarding a potential transaction involving the two companies and discussed the expectations for the meeting with advisors to\noccur the following day.\n\n        On August 10, 2016, representatives of senior management of B/E Aerospace and Rockwell Collins, together with representatives\nfrom Shearman & Sterling LLP, which is referred to as Shearman & Sterling, outside counsel to B/E Aerospace, Citigroup, as financial\nadvisor to B/E Aerospace, Goldman Sachs, as financial advisor to B/E Aerospace, Skadden, outside counsel to Rockwell Collins, and J.P.\nMorgan, as financial advisor to Rockwell Collins, met at the offices of Shearman & Sterling. At the meeting, representatives of senior\nmanagement of B/E Aerospace and Rockwell Collins discussed their respective businesses. In addition, B/E Aerospace senior\nmanagement discussed the financial outlook of B/E Aerospace and potential cost and revenue synergies that could be achieved in\nconnection with a potential combination of B/E Aerospace and Rockwell Collins. At the conclusion of the meeting, senior management of\nB/E Aerospace and Rockwell Collins agreed to perform additional due diligence and financial analyses with their respective\nrepresentatives, and to meet again following such additional diligence and analyses to further explore the prospects of a potential\ncombination.\n\n        On August 15, 2015, the executive committee of the Rockwell Collins Board met telephonically. At the meeting, Rockwell Collins\nsenior management provided the committee with an update on the potential acquisition of B/E Aerospace, including the meetings between\nthe two parties on August 9 and August 10, 2016.\n\n        On August 16, 2016, the B/E Aerospace Board met telephonically. Present at the meeting were members of B/E Aerospace senior\nmanagement and representatives from Shearman & Sterling, Citigroup and Goldman Sachs. At the meeting, B/E Aerospace senior\nmanagement discussed the B/E Aerospace five-year plan that had previously been distributed to the B/E Aerospace Board and answered\nquestions from members of the B/E Aerospace Board regarding the assumptions and inputs of the plan. The five-year plan, which had\nbeen prepared in connection with B/E Aerospace senior management\'s evaluation of a potential transaction with Rockwell Collins,\nincluded information related to revenue, earnings before interest and income tax, earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and\namortization and free cash flow for the periods set forth therein. B/E Aerospace senior management then provided an update with respect\nto the ongoing discussions between B/E Aerospace and Rockwell Collins, including a report on the meetings between the two parties on\nAugust 9 and August 10, 2016.\n\n        Also at this meeting, representatives of Citigroup and Goldman Sachs discussed certain aspects of the transaction and advised the B/E\nAerospace Board that it was expected that any transaction would include consideration consisting of a significant Rockwell Collins stock\ncomponent. Representatives of Shearman & Sterling discussed with the B/E Aerospace Board, among other things, its fiduciary duties\nunder Delaware law in the context of a transaction process.\n\n59\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/861361/000104746917000512/a2230778zdefm14a.htm\n\n69/330\n\n\x0c8/28/2019\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/861361/000104746917000512/a2230778zdefm14a.htm\n\nTable of Contents\n\n        Following these discussions, representatives of Citigroup and Goldman Sachs were then excused from the meeting to allow the B/E\nAerospace Board to discuss formally engaging both Citigroup and Goldman Sachs as joint financial advisors. Representatives from each\nof Citigroup and Goldman Sachs were then asked to return to the meeting at separate times to answer specific questions about their\nrespective relationships with Rockwell Collins.\n\n        At the conclusion of the meeting, the B/E Aerospace Board authorized B/E Aerospace senior management to proceed with\nnegotiations with Rockwell Collins and to provide the B/E Aerospace five-year plan to Rockwell Collins in order to facilitate further\ndiscussions. In addition, the B/E Aerospace Board authorized B/E Aerospace senior management to formally retain both Citigroup and\nGoldman Sachs as joint financial advisors in connection with the consideration and review of strategic alternatives by the B/E Aerospace\nBoard. On September 6, 2016, Citigroup and Goldman Sachs each executed engagement letters with B/E Aerospace to provide financial\nadvisory services to B/E Aerospace in connection with the consideration and review of strategic alternatives by the B/E Aerospace Board.\n\n        On August 22, 2016, representatives of senior management of B/E Aerospace and Rockwell Collins met to further discuss the\nprospect of a potential transaction. The parties also discussed their respective business plans, including each company\'s five-year plan, and\npresented certain legal, financial and operational information to each other.\n\n        On September 2, 2016, the corporate strategy and finance committee and the executive committee of the Rockwell Collins Board met\ntelephonically in a joint meeting. Present at the meeting were members of Rockwell Collins senior management and representatives from\nSkadden and J.P. Morgan. At the meeting, Rockwell Collins senior management provided an update with respect to the potential\nacquisition of B/E Aerospace, including a review of the process followed by Rockwell Collins senior management to identify suitable\nacquisition candidates and a review of B/E Aerospace\'s financial and market profile, the impact of the potential acquisition on the\ncompanies\' combined business portfolio and potential cost synergies. Representatives of J.P. Morgan discussed J.P. Morgan\'s preliminary\nfinancial analysis perspectives with respect to the potential transaction. Rockwell Collins senior management then reviewed with the\ncommittees, and obtained their concurrence on, the terms of a proposed preliminary, non-binding indication of interest for the potential\ntransaction.\n\n        Later on September 2, 2016, Rockwell Collins delivered a preliminary, non-binding indication of interest to B/E Aerospace, pursuant\nto which Rockwell Collins proposed to acquire 100% of the common stock of B/E Aerospace for a per share purchase price of between\n$58 and $60, to be paid 50% in cash and 50% in shares of Rockwell Collins common stock.\n\n        On September 5, 2016, following preliminary discussions with B/E Aerospace senior management, representatives of Citigroup and\nGoldman Sachs were directed to contact representatives of J.P. Morgan to inform J.P. Morgan that B/E Aerospace senior management\nbelieved that the B/E Aerospace Board would likely view Rockwell Collins\' proposal as not sufficiently attractive and would likely be\nunwilling to engage in further discussions based on the valuation included in the proposal.\n\n        On September 7, 2016, the B/E Aerospace Board met at the offices of Shearman & Sterling. Also present at the meeting were\nmembers of B/E Aerospace senior management and representatives from Shearman & Sterling, Citigroup and Goldman Sachs. At the\nmeeting, B/E Aerospace senior management updated the B/E Aerospace Board with respect to the performance and outlook of\nB/E Aerospace, other general market conditions that impact B/E Aerospace\'s businesses, and other factors viewed as relevant in\ndetermining whether B/E Aerospace should further consider the Rockwell Collins proposal or other strategic alternatives. Following that\ndiscussion, B/E Aerospace senior management, together with its financial advisors, provided a general summary of the September 2, 2016\nnon-binding indication of interest, and representatives of Citigroup and Goldman Sachs provided their\n\n60\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/861361/000104746917000512/a2230778zdefm14a.htm\n\n70/330\n\n\x0c8/28/2019\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/861361/000104746917000512/a2230778zdefm14a.htm\n\nTable of Contents\n\npreliminary financial analysis with respect to B/E Aerospace and Rockwell Collins and an overview of preliminary discussions with J.P.\nMorgan with respect to the proposal.\n\n        The B/E Aerospace Board, together with senior management and its advisors, then engaged in a detailed discussion on how to best\nfacilitate a process that would be in the best interests of B/E Aerospace and its stockholders. The B/E Aerospace Board and B/E Aerospace\nsenior management discussed possible strategic alternatives available to maximize stockholder value, including executing B/E Aerospace\'s\norganic business plan, alternative capital structures and capital deployment priorities, potential strategic acquisitions or an alternative\nbusiness combination. B/E Aerospace senior management and the B/E Aerospace Board then discussed the current environment in the\naerospace industry, including the trends in consolidation and competition, and the likely effect of these factors on B/E Aerospace.\nFollowing these discussions, the B/E Aerospace Board did not believe that other strategic alternatives would likely be as attractive as a\npotential transaction with Rockwell Collins (assuming more favorable terms could be negotiated).\n\n        B/E Aerospace senior management then provided an overview of its prior discussions with Party A and Party B regarding a potential\ntransaction involving B/E Aerospace, and noted that neither such discussions resulted in an express or implied indication of interest from\nParty A or Party B that such companies were prepared to pursue a potential transaction involving B/E Aerospace. The B/E Aerospace\nBoard then asked one of its directors that had a previous relationship with (and from time to time speaks to representatives of) a potential\nstrategic partner, referred to as Party C, to contact Party C to gauge its interest in a potential transaction involving B/E Aerospace.\nFollowing the meeting and in response to the inquiry made by a member of the B/E Aerospace Board, Party C advised that it was not\ninterested in pursuing a transaction with B/E Aerospace.\n\n        Representatives of Citigroup and Goldman Sachs then provided an overview of potential transaction partners (other than Rockwell\nCollins) that may have both a strategic rationale and the financial wherewithal to consummate a transaction with B/E Aerospace. These\npotential acquirers included companies currently serving the aerospace and defense markets as well as financial buyers. As part of these\ndiscussions, the B/E Aerospace Board discussed whether other parties should be contacted in light of Rockwell Collins\' proposal and\ndiscussed the likelihood that any other parties would be interested in a strategic transaction involving B/E Aerospace on the same or\nsimilar terms to the Rockwell Collins proposal. Based upon these discussions, the prior contacts with Party A and Party B (and subject to\nthe result of the inquiry to be made to Party C), and advice from the financial advisors, the B/E Aerospace Board determined that such\ntransaction partners would not likely be able to consummate a transaction with B/E Aerospace that would provide equal or greater value to\nB/E Aerospace stockholders as compared to a potential transaction with Rockwell Collins (assuming more favorable terms could be\nnegotiated). As such, the B/E Aerospace Board determined not to expand its search for strategic alternatives with other third parties to\navoid the risk of losing momentum with what was viewed as the most attractive strategic alternative.\n\n        The B/E Aerospace Board, together with B/E Aerospace senior management and its advisors, then engaged in an extensive discussion\nregarding a potential transaction with Rockwell Collins. Following these discussions, the B/E Aerospace Board determined that Rockwell\nCollins\' proposal was, as then proposed, not yet sufficiently attractive from a financial point of view, but that further discussion with\nRockwell Collins was warranted. The B/E Aerospace Board authorized Citigroup and Goldman Sachs to advise J.P. Morgan that\nB/E Aerospace found the Rockwell Collins proposal to be not sufficiently attractive and to provide guidance with respect to elements of\nthe proposal that would need to be improved.\n\n        On September 8, 2016, representatives of Citigroup and Goldman Sachs advised representatives of J.P. Morgan of the outcome of the\nB/E Aerospace Board meeting on September 7, 2016, and the need to improve the economic terms of the proposal by Rockwell Collins in\norder for B/E Aerospace to further consider a potential combination.\n\n61\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/861361/000104746917000512/a2230778zdefm14a.htm\n\n71/330\n\n\x0c8/28/2019\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/861361/000104746917000512/a2230778zdefm14a.htm\n\nTable of Contents\n\n        On September 14, 2016, the Rockwell Collins Board met in person for a regularly scheduled board meeting at Rockwell Collins\'\nheadquarters in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Present at the meeting were members of Rockwell Collins senior management and representatives\nfrom Skadden and J.P. Morgan. At the meeting, representatives of Skadden discussed with the Rockwell Collins Board, among other\nthings, its fiduciary duties under Delaware law in the context of a potential acquisition of B/E Aerospace. Rockwell Collins senior\nmanagement provided an update with respect to the potential acquisition of B/E Aerospace, including a review of the process followed by\nmanagement to identify suitable acquisition candidates and a review of B/E Aerospace\'s financial and market profile, the impact of the\npotential acquisition on the companies\' combined business portfolio and potential cost synergies. Rockwell Collins senior management\nthen presented preliminary valuation perspectives regarding B/E Aerospace and reviewed the terms of the preliminary, non-binding\nindication of interest submitted to B/E Aerospace on September 2, 2016 and B/E Aerospace\'s response to such indication of interest.\nRockwell Collins senior management then reviewed with the Rockwell Collins Board possible revisions to the terms of its indication of\ninterest. The preliminary valuation perspectives regarding B/E Aerospace presented by Rockwell Collins senior management and the\npossible revisions to the terms of the September 12, 2016 indication of interest included the merger consideration (including a cash and\nstock mix) set forth in the merger agreement.\n\n        On September 16, 2016, representatives of J.P. Morgan, at Rockwell Collins\' direction, indicated to representatives of Citigroup and\nGoldman Sachs that Rockwell Collins remained interested in a transaction and was prepared, subject to additional diligence, to negotiate a\ntransaction (i) in a price range of $61 to $62 per share, consisting of 50% cash and 50% shares of Rockwell Collins common stock, subject\nto a price collar, (ii) with termination fees payable by each company under certain circumstances of $200 million and (iii) whereby one\ndirector designated by B/E Aerospace would be appointed to the Rockwell Collins Board.\n\n        Between September 16, 2016 and September 27, 2016, each of B/E Aerospace and Rockwell Collins continued to perform additional\ndue diligence on the other party, including a telephonic due diligence session that was held on September 25, 2016 among B/E Aerospace,\nRockwell Collins and their respective financial advisors.\n\n        On September 20, 2016, members of the B/E Aerospace Board met telephonically with representatives of B/E Aerospace senior\nmanagement, Shearman & Sterling, Citigroup and Goldman Sachs, during which B/E Aerospace senior management, together with its\nfinancial advisors, provided an update on negotiations between B/E Aerospace and Rockwell Collins and reviewed the revised terms of the\nproposed transaction conveyed to Citigroup and Goldman by J.P. Morgan on September 16, 2016.\n\n        On September 21, 2016, the compensation committee of the B/E Aerospace Board, consulted with Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP,\nwhich is referred to as Gibson Dunn, regarding the possible engagement of Gibson Dunn as independent legal counsel to assist the\ncompensation committee in its evaluation of certain compensation matters related to a potential transaction. Specifically, as previously\ndisclosed in B/E Aerospace\'s public filings, since 2013, the B/E Aerospace Board and the compensation committee determined that they\nwould favorably consider the grant of transaction bonuses to the top named executive officers of B/E Aerospace in the event of a change in\ncontrol transaction, which bonuses would be in addition to amounts payable under the employment agreements with each executive. The\nfinal determination of the structure and the specific amount of such bonuses was deferred by the compensation committee until such time\nas B/E Aerospace might become involved in active transaction negotiations. The compensation committee determined to retain Gibson\nDunn, negotiated the terms of the Gibson Dunn engagement, and ultimately executed an engagement letter with Gibson Dunn on\nSeptember 30, 2016.\n\n        On September 27, 2016, representatives of B/E Aerospace and Rockwell Collins senior management, as well as representatives from\nShearman & Sterling, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, Skadden\n\n62\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/861361/000104746917000512/a2230778zdefm14a.htm\n\n72/330\n\n\x0c8/28/2019\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/861361/000104746917000512/a2230778zdefm14a.htm\n\nTable of Contents\n\nand J.P.

(ii) determined that the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the\nmerger agreement are advisable and in the best interests of B/E Aerospace and B/E Aerospace\'s stockholders; (iii) directed that the Merger\nproposal be submitted to a vote of B/E Aerospace\'s stockholders; and (iv) recommended that the stockholders of B/E Aerospace vote\n"FOR" the Merger proposal.\n\n        In evaluating the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, the B/E Aerospace Board consulted\nwith B/E Aerospace\'s management and legal and financial advisors and, in reaching its determinations, the B/E Aerospace Board\nconsidered a variety of factors with respect to the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the\nspecific reasons described above under "Risk Factors" and "\xe2\x80\x94Background of the Merger" beginning on page 46 and page 57, respectively,\nand the factors listed below.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThe merger would combine market leaders with complementary capabilities in avionics and interior products that also have\na shared reputation for innovation, quality and on-time delivery and a common customer base, including OEMs, airlines\nand lessors; \n\nThe combination of B/E Aerospace and Rockwell Collins would accelerate technological leadership in integrated digital\nairplanes in that it uniquely positions Rockwell Collins to provide a more integrated solution to meet the digital demands of\nthe commercial airplane; \n\nThe merger would substantially increase Rockwell Collins\' buyer-furnished equipment and aftermarket exposure by\nproviding it with a large revenue stream tied to passenger traffic growth and airline profitability with a substantial\naftermarket component, which would serve to balance Rockwell Collins\' current cyclical exposure to OEM production\nrates, which additional value would accrue to B/E Aerospace stockholders in connection with the stock portion of the\nconsideration to be received by B/E Aerospace stockholders; \n\nThe combination of B/E Aerospace\'s leading business jet aircraft cabin interior products with Rockwell Collins\' dealer\nnetwork and owner and maintenance databases would facilitate creation of a private aircraft interiors aftermarket, which is\na significant new opportunity; \n\nThe expectation is that the combined company would achieve approximately $160 million of identified cost synergies\nfrom, among other things, the elimination of corporate and public company costs, manufacturing consolidation,\ninformation technology consolidation and supply chain leveraging, and would have improved pre-tax earnings of\napproximately $60 to $90 million per year for the first six years after the acquisition due to certain conforming purchase\naccounting adjustments related to capitalized development costs related to seller furnished equipment contracts; \n\nThe merger would significantly enhance Rockwell Collins\' financial profile by accelerating Rockwell Collins\' free cash\nflow growth and would be accretive to Rockwell Collins\' earnings per share in the first full fiscal year following the\nacquisition, thereby adding value to the stock portion of the consideration received by B/E Aerospace stockholders; \n\nThe fact that the merger consideration consists of cash, providing B/E Aerospace stockholders with certainty of value and\nliquidity upon completion of the merger, along with a significant stock component, which would result in B/E Aerospace\nstockholders immediately prior to the merger holding approximately 20.3% of the common stock of Rockwell Collins\nimmediately following completion of the merger, thus providing B/E Aerospace stockholders with meaningful participation\nin the upside potential of a larger, more diversified company;\n\n70\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/861361/000104746917000512/a2230778zdefm14a.htm\n\n80/330\n\n\x0c8/28/2019\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/861361/000104746917000512/a2230778zdefm14a.htm\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThe fact that the stock portion of the merger consideration is based upon a floating exchange ratio and subject to a two-way\n7.5% collar, which provides protection against fluctuations in the market price of Rockwell Collins common stock between\nthe date of the merger agreement and the date of the completion of the merger; \n\nThe fact that the value of the merger consideration payable to B/E Aerospace stockholders could increase in the event that\nthe price of Rockwell Collins common stock increases more than 7.5% prior to completion of the merger; \n\nThe B/E Aerospace Board\'s knowledge of B/E Aerospace\'s business, operations, financial condition, earnings and\nprospects and its knowledge of Rockwell Collins\' business, operations, financial condition, earnings and prospects, taking\ninto account Rockwell Collins\' publicly-filed information and the results of B/E Aerospace\'s due diligence review of\nRockwell Collins;

and \n\na 28% premium to B/E Aerospace\'s trailing 90-day volume-weighted average price of 48.30 as of October 20,\n2016; \n\nThe offer price of $62 per share of B/E Aerospace stock represented a multiple of 13.6 times EV/EBITDA of\nB/E Aerospace for the last 12 months ending September 30, 2016; \n\n45% of the merger consideration would be in stock, which will allow B/E Aerospace\'s stockholders to participate in the\nfuture performance of the combined company; \n\nThe expectation that the combined company will benefit from the experienced management teams of B/E Aerospace and\nRockwell Collins; \n\nThe commitments by both B/E Aerospace and Rockwell Collins to complete the merger, as set forth in the merger\nagreement, and the belief of the B/E Aerospace Board that the transaction does not present significant regulatory concerns\nthat would impact the ability to complete the merger;

\n\nThe merger will be subject to the approval of B/E Aerospace\'s stockholders and that, in this regard, B/E Aerospace\'s\ndirectors and executive officers do not own a sufficient interest in B/E Aerospace common stock, in the aggregate, to\ninfluence substantially the outcome of such stockholder vote; and \n\nB/E Aerospace stockholders who do not vote to adopt the merger agreement and approve the merger and who follow\ncertain prescribed procedures are entitled to appraisal rights under Delaware law.\n\n        The B/E Aerospace Board also specifically considered the terms of the merger agreement, including the following:\n\nThe lack of a financing condition to Rockwell Collins\' obligation to complete the merger; \n\nThe termination fee payable by Rockwell Collins to B/E Aerospace if Rockwell Collins terminates the merger agreement to\npursue a competing transaction with a third party or in certain other circumstances; \n\nThat if B/E Aerospace were to receive a takeover proposal from a third party that provided superior value to B/E Aerospace\nand its stockholders, B/E Aerospace and the B/E Aerospace Board would be able, under certain circumstances described in\nthe merger agreement, to consider such superior proposal and the B/E Aerospace Board may change its recommendation\nthat B/E Aerospace stockholders vote in favor of the Merger proposal and/or terminate the merger agreement; \n\nB/E Aerospace\'s ability, under circumstances described in the merger agreement, to provide information to and engage in\ndiscussions or negotiations with a third party that makes an unsolicited bona fide written takeover proposal; \n\nThe ability of the B/E Aerospace Board, subject to certain conditions, to change its recommendation supporting the merger\nin response to an intervening event if the B/E Aerospace Board determines that failure to take such action would be\ninconsistent with its fiduciary duties; and \n\nThe customary nature of B/E Aerospace\'s other representations, warranties and covenants in the merger agreement.\n\n        The B/E Aerospace Board weighed the foregoing against a number of potentially negative factors, including:\n\nThe fact that the value of the merger consideration payable to B/E Aerospace stockholders could decrease in the event that\nthe price of Rockwell Collins common stock decreases more than 7.5% prior to completion of the merger;

In addition, individual members of the B/E Aerospace Board may have assigned different weights to different\nfactors.\n\n        Certain of B/E Aerospace\'s directors and executive officers have financial interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition\nto, those of B/E Aerospace\'s stockholders generally. The B/E Aerospace Board was aware of and considered these potential interests,\namong other matters, in evaluating the merger and in making its recommendation to B/E Aerospace stockholders. For a discussion of these\ninterests, see "\xe2\x80\x94Interests of Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger" beginning on page 102.\n\n        The B/E Aerospace Board unanimously determined that the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger\nagreement were advisable and in the best interests of B/E Aerospace and its stockholders and approved the merger agreement.\nAccordingly, the B/E Aerospace Board unanimously recommends that B/E Aerospace stockholders vote "FOR" the Merger proposal at the\nB/E Aerospace special meeting.\n\nOpinion of Rockwell Collins\' Financial Advisor \n\n        Pursuant to an engagement letter dated October 6, 2016, Rockwell Collins retained J.P. Morgan as its financial advisor in connection\nwith the merger.\n\n        At the meeting of the Rockwell Collins Board on October 21, 2016, J.P. Morgan rendered its oral opinion to the Rockwell Collins\nBoard that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth in its opinion, the merger consideration to\nbe paid by Rockwell Collins was fair, from a financial point of view, to Rockwell Collins. J.P. Morgan has confirmed its October 21, 2016\noral opinion by delivering its written opinion to the Rockwell Collins Board, dated October 23, 2016, that, as of such date, the merger\nconsideration to be paid by Rockwell Collins was fair, from a financial point of view, to Rockwell Collins.\n\n        The full text of the written opinion of J.P. Morgan, which sets forth the assumptions made, matters considered and limits on\nthe review undertaken, is attached as Annex B to this joint proxy statement/prospectus and is incorporated herein by reference.\nThe summary of the opinion of J.P. Morgan set forth in this joint proxy statement/prospectus is qualified in its entirety by\nreference to the full text of such opinion. Rockwell Collins stockholders are urged to read the opinion in its entirety. J.P. Morgan\'s\nopinion was addressed to the Rockwell Collins Board (in its capacity as such) in connection with and for the purposes of its\nevaluation of the merger, was directed only to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to Rockwell Collins of the merger\nconsideration to be paid by Rockwell Collins and did not address any other aspect of the merger. J.P. Morgan expressed no\nopinion as to the fairness of the merger consideration to the holders of any class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of\nRockwell Collins or as to the underlying decision by Rockwell Collins to engage in the merger. The issuance of J.P. Morgan\'s\nopinion was approved by a fairness committee of J.P. Morgan. The opinion does not constitute a recommendation to any\nstockholder of Rockwell Collins as to how such stockholder should vote with respect to the merger or any other matter.\n\n        In arriving at its opinion, J.P. Morgan, among other things:\n\nreviewed a draft dated October 23, 2016 of the merger agreement; \n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nreviewed certain publicly available business and financial information concerning B/E Aerospace and Rockwell Collins\nand the industries in which they operate;\n\n74\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/861361/000104746917000512/a2230778zdefm14a.htm\n\n85/330\n\n\x0c8/28/2019\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/861361/000104746917000512/a2230778zdefm14a.htm\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\ncompared the proposed financial terms of the merger with the publicly available financial terms of certain transactions\ninvolving companies J.P. Morgan deemed relevant and the consideration received for such companies; \n\ncompared the financial and operating performance of B/E Aerospace and Rockwell Collins with publicly available\ninformation concerning certain other companies J.P. Morgan deemed relevant and reviewed the current and historical\nmarket prices of B/E Aerospace common stock and Rockwell Collins common stock and certain publicly traded securities\nof such other companies; \n\nreviewed certain internal financial analyses and forecasts prepared by the managements of B/E Aerospace and Rockwell\nCollins relating to their respective businesses and by Rockwell Collins relating to B/E Aerospace\'s business, as well as the\nestimated amount and timing of the cost savings and related expenses and synergies expected to result from the merger,\nwhich are referred to as the Synergies; and \n\nperformed such other financial studies and analyses and considered such other information as J.P. Morgan deemed\nappropriate for the purposes of its opinion.\n\n        In addition, J.P. Morgan held discussions with certain members of the management of B/E Aerospace and Rockwell Collins with\nrespect to certain aspects of the merger, the past and current business operations of B/E Aerospace and Rockwell Collins, the financial\ncondition and future prospects and operations of B/E Aerospace and Rockwell Collins, the effects of the merger on the financial condition\nand future prospects of Rockwell Collins, and certain other matters J.P. Morgan believed necessary or appropriate to its inquiry.\n\n        In giving its opinion, J.P. Morgan relied upon and assumed the accuracy and completeness of all information that was publicly\navailable or was furnished to or discussed with J.P. Morgan by B/E Aerospace and Rockwell Collins or otherwise reviewed by or for J.P.\nMorgan, and J.P. Morgan did not independently verify (and did not assume responsibility or liability for independently verifying) any such\ninformation or its accuracy or completeness. J.P. Morgan did not conduct and was not provided with any valuation or appraisal of any\nassets or liabilities, nor did J.P. Morgan evaluate the solvency of B/E Aerospace or Rockwell Collins under any applicable laws relating to\nbankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. In relying on financial analyses and forecasts provided to J.P. Morgan or derived therefrom,\nincluding the Synergies, J.P. Morgan assumed that they were reasonably prepared based on assumptions reflecting the best currently\navailable estimates and judgments by management as to the expected future results of operations and financial condition of B/E Aerospace\nand Rockwell Collins to which such analyses or forecasts relate. J.P. Morgan expressed no view as to such analyses or forecasts (including\nthe Synergies) or the assumptions on which they were based. J.P. Morgan also assumed that the merger and the other transactions\ncontemplated by the merger agreement will have the tax consequences described in discussions with, and materials furnished to J.P.\nMorgan by, representatives of Rockwell Collins, and will be consummated as described in the merger agreement, and that the definitive\nmerger agreement would not differ in any material respects from the draft thereof furnished to J.P. Morgan. J.P. Morgan also assumed that\nthe representations and warranties made by Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace in the merger agreement and the related agreements were\nand will be true and correct in all respects material to J.P. Morgan\'s analysis. J.P. Morgan is not a legal, regulatory or tax expert and relied\non the assessments made by advisors to Rockwell Collins with respect to such issues. J.P. Morgan further assumed that all material\ngovernmental, regulatory or other consents and approvals necessary for the consummation of the merger will be obtained without any\nadverse effect on B/E Aerospace or Rockwell Collins or on the contemplated benefits of the merger.\n\n        J.P.

Furthermore, J.P. Morgan\nexpressed no opinion with respect to the amount or nature of any compensation to any officers, directors, or employees of any party to the\nmerger, or any class of such persons relative to the merger consideration to be paid by Rockwell Collins or with respect to the fairness of\nany such compensation. J.P. Morgan expressed no opinion as to the price at which Rockwell Collins common stock or B/E Aerospace\ncommon stock will trade at any future time.\n\n        The terms of the merger agreement, including the exchange ratio, were determined through arm\'s length negotiations between\nRockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace, and the decision to enter into the merger agreement was solely that of the Rockwell Collins Board\nand the B/E Aerospace board of directors. J.P. Morgan\'s opinion and financial analyses constituted only one of the many factors considered\nby the Rockwell Collins Board in its evaluation of the merger and should not be viewed as determinative of the views of the Rockwell\nCollins Board or management with respect to the merger or the merger consideration.\n\n        In accordance with customary investment banking practice, J.P. Morgan employed generally accepted valuation methodology in\nrendering its opinion to the Rockwell Collins Board and contained in the presentation delivered to the Rockwell Collins Board in\nconnection with the rendering of such opinion and does not purport to be a complete description of the analyses or data presented by\nJ.P. Morgan. Some of the summaries of the financial analyses include information presented in tabular format.

J.P. Morgan calculated a range of terminal values for B/E Aerospace at the end of the projection period by applying terminal\ngrowth rates, based on J.P. Morgan\'s professional judgment given the nature of B/E Aerospace, its business and its industry, ranging from\n2.5% to 3.5%. The unlevered free cash flows and the range of terminal values were then discounted to present values using discount rates\nranging from 7.5% to 8.5%, which were chosen by J.P. Morgan based upon an analysis of the weighted average cost of capital of B/E\nAerospace. The present values of the unlevered free cash flows and the range of terminal values were then adjusted for B/E Aerospace\'s\nnet debt and divided by the fully diluted shares outstanding of B/E Aerospace. The discounted cash flow analysis indicated an implied per\nshare equity value range for B/E Aerospace common stock, rounded to the nearest $0.25, of $53.50 to $78.25.\n\n        The range of implied per share equity values for B/E Aerospace common stock was compared to the closing price of $50.65 per share\nof B/E Aerospace common stock on October 20, 2016, and the offer price of $62.00 per share of B/E Aerospace common stock.\n\nRockwell Collins Financial Analysis\n\nDiscounted Cash Flow Analysis\n\n        J.P. Morgan conducted a discounted cash flow analysis for the purpose of determining the fully diluted equity value per share for\nRockwell Collins common stock.\n\n        J.P. Morgan calculated the unlevered free cash flows that Rockwell Collins is expected to generate (i) during fiscal years 2017\nthrough 2021 based upon the Rockwell Collins stand-alone management forecast and (ii) during fiscal years 2022 through 2026 based\nupon extrapolations from the Rockwell Collins stand-alone management forecast reviewed and approved by Rockwell Collins\nmanagement. J.P. Morgan calculated a range of terminal values for Rockwell Collins at the end of the projection period by applying\nterminal growth rates, based on J.P. Morgan\'s professional judgment given the nature of Rockwell Collins, its business and its industry,\nranging from 2.0% to 3.0% to the unlevered free cash flows excluding pension contributions, to which a 0% terminal growth rate was\napplied per Rockwell Collins management instruction. The unlevered free cash flows and the range of terminal values were then\ndiscounted to present values using discount rates ranging from 7.5% to 8.5%, which were chosen by J.P. Morgan based upon an analysis of\nthe weighted average cost of capital of Rockwell Collins. The present values of the unlevered free cash flows and the range of terminal\nvalues were then adjusted for Rockwell Collins\' net debt and divided by the fully diluted shares outstanding of Rockwell Collins. The\ndiscounted cash flow analysis indicated an implied per share equity value range for Rockwell Collins common stock, rounded to the\nnearest $0.25, of $98.25 to $136.75.\n\nPotential Value Creation Analysis\xe2\x80\x94Intrinsic Value Approach\n\n        J.P. Morgan prepared a value creation analysis that compared the implied equity value derived from J.P. Morgan\'s discounted cash\nflow analysis of Rockwell Collins on a standalone basis to Rockwell Collins stockholders\' pro forma ownership of the implied equity\nvalue of the combined company.\n\n        The pro forma combined company equity value was equal to: (i) Rockwell Collins\' standalone discounted cash flow value of\n$15.1 billion (calculated using a 2.5% terminal growth rate and 8.0% discount rate, representing the midpoint of the terminal growth rate\nand discount rate ranges, respectively, applied in the discounted cash flow analysis for Rockwell Collins described above), plus (ii) B/E\nAerospace\'s standalone discounted cash flow value of $6.5 billion (calculated using a 3.0% terminal growth rate and an 8.0% discount\nrate, representing the midpoint of the terminal growth rate\n\n79\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/861361/000104746917000512/a2230778zdefm14a.htm\n\n91/330\n\n\x0c8/28/2019\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/861361/000104746917000512/a2230778zdefm14a.htm\n\nTable of Contents\n\nand discount rate ranges, respectively, applied in the discounted cash flow analysis for B/E Aerospace described above), plus (iii) the\ndiscounted cash flow value of Rockwell Collins management expectations of after-tax synergies totaling $1.8 billion (calculated using a\n3.0% terminal growth rate and an 8.0% discount rate representing the midpoint of the terminal growth rate and discount rate ranges,\nrespectively), less (iv) cash consideration of $3.8 billion (which includes the retirement of certain B/E Aerospace restricted stock units,\ntransaction costs and change of control expenses). J.P. Morgan then calculated the implied pro forma equity value of the combined\ncompany attributable to Rockwell Collins stockholders based on the implied equity ownership percentage of 80% by Rockwell Collins\nstockholders implied by the exchange ratio in the consideration (assuming Rockwell Collins\' closing share price as of October 20, 2016)\nand the number of Rockwell Collins diluted shares outstanding on a standalone basis (based on information as of September 30, 2016 per\nRockwell Collins management). J.P. Morgan then compared the result to the implied equity value of Rockwell Collins on a standalone\nbasis indicated by the discounted cash flow analysis of Rockwell Collins (described above) whereby the discount rates used were chosen\nby J.P. Morgan based upon an analysis of the weighted average cost of capital of Rockwell Collins. The value creation analysis indicated\nan implied pro forma equity value of $15.6 billion attributable to Rockwell Collins stockholders and implied pro forma accretion in\nimplied equity value to Rockwell Collins stockholders of 3.4% higher than the implied equity value on a standalone basis indicated by the\ndiscounted cash flow analysis of Rockwell Collins.\n\nOther Information\n\nHistorical Stock Trading\n\nEquity Research Analyst Price Targets\n\n        J.P. Morgan reviewed the historical share prices of B/E Aerospace common stock for the 52-week period ended October 20, 2016. J.P.\nMorgan noted that the low and high closing share prices during this period were $37.91 and $53.11 per share of B/E Aerospace common\nstock, respectively.\n\n        J.P. Morgan reviewed the most recent publicly available research analyst price targets for B/E Aerospace common stock prepared and\npublished by selected equity research analysts. J.P. Morgan noted that the range of such price targets as of October 20, 2016 was $48.00 to\n$66.00 per share of B/E Aerospace common stock.\n\n        J.P. Morgan noted that the historical stock trading and equity research analyst price targets analyses are not valuation methodologies\nbut were presented merely for reference only.\n\nMiscellaneous\n\n        The foregoing summary of financial analyses does not purport to be a complete description of the analyses or data presented by J.P.\nMorgan. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary\ndescription. J.P. Morgan believes that the foregoing summary and its analyses must be considered as a whole and that selecting portions of\nthe foregoing summary and these analyses, without considering all of its analyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view of the\nprocesses underlying the analyses and its opinion. As a result, the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis or\ncombination of analyses described above were merely utilized to create points of reference for analytical purposes and should not be taken\nto be the view of J.P. Morgan with respect to the actual value of Rockwell Collins or B/E Aerospace. The order of analyses described does\nnot represent the relative importance or weight given to those analyses by J.P. Morgan. In arriving at its opinion, J.P. Morgan did not\nattribute any particular weight to any analyses or factors considered by it and did not form an opinion as to whether any individual analysis\nor factor (positive or negative), considered in isolation, supported or failed to support its opinion. Rather, J.P. Morgan considered the\ntotality of the factors and analyses performed in determining its opinion.\n\n80\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/861361/000104746917000512/a2230778zdefm14a.htm\n\n92/330\n\n\x0c8/28/2019\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/861361/000104746917000512/a2230778zdefm14a.htm\n\nTable of Contents\n\n        Analyses based upon forecasts of future results are inherently uncertain, as they are subject to numerous factors or events beyond the\ncontrol of the parties and their advisors. Accordingly, forecasts and analyses used or made by J.P. Morgan are not necessarily indicative of\nactual future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by those analyses. Moreover, J.P. Morgan\'s analyses\nare not and do not purport to be appraisals or otherwise reflective of the prices at which businesses actually could be acquired or sold.\nNone of the selected companies reviewed as described in the above summary is identical to B/E Aerospace, and none of the selected\ntransactions reviewed was identical to the merger. However, the companies selected were chosen because they are publicly traded\ncompanies with operations and businesses that, for purposes of J.P. Morgan\'s analysis, may be considered similar to those of B/E\nAerospace. The transactions selected were similarly chosen because their participants, size and other factors, for purposes of J.P. Morgan\'s\nanalysis, may be considered similar to the merger. The analyses necessarily involve complex considerations and judgments concerning\ndifferences in financial and operational characteristics of the companies involved and other factors that could affect the companies\ncompared to B/E Aerospace and the transactions compared to the merger.\n\n        As a part of its investment banking business, J.P. Morgan and its affiliates are continually engaged in the valuation of businesses and\ntheir securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions, investments for passive and control purposes, negotiated underwritings,\nsecondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements, and valuations for corporate and other purposes. J.P. Morgan\nwas selected to advise Rockwell Collins with respect to the merger on the basis of, among other things, such experience and its\nqualifications and reputation in connection with such matters and its familiarity with Rockwell Collins, B/E Aerospace and the industries\nin which they operate.\n\n        For services rendered in connection with the merger, Rockwell Collins agreed to pay J.P. Morgan a transaction fee of $27.5 million,\nof which $5.0 million became payable by Rockwell Collins at the time J.P. Morgan delivered its opinion, and the balance of which is\npayable upon the closing of the merger. Rockwell Collins has also agreed to pay J.P. Morgan 10% of any break-up fee received by\nRockwell Collins following or in connection with the termination, abandonment or failure of the merger, provided that such fee will not\nexceed the amount that would have been payable to J.P. Morgan if the merger had been consummated. In addition, Rockwell Collins has\nagreed to reimburse J.P. Morgan for certain of its expenses incurred in connection with its services, including the fees and expenses of\ncounsel, and will indemnify J.P. Morgan against certain liabilities arising out of J.P. Morgan\'s engagement. During the two years preceding\nthe date of J.P. Morgan\'s opinion, J.P. Morgan and its affiliates have had commercial or investment banking relationships with Rockwell\nCollins and B/E Aerospace for which J.P. Morgan and such affiliates have received customary compensation. Such services during such\nperiod have included acting as joint bookrunner and joint lead arranger on Rockwell Collins\' revolving credit facility in February 2016; as\njoint lead arranger and joint bookrunner on the B/E Aerospace credit facilities in December 2014 and in May 2016; as lead arranger and\nlead-left bookrunner on credit facilities of KLX; as lead bookrunner on an offering of debt securities of KLX in November 2014; and as\nfinancial advisor to B/E Aerospace in connection with the KLX spin-off in December 2014. J.P. Morgan and its affiliates also provided\nasset management services to Rockwell Collins during such period. In addition, J.P. Morgan\'s commercial banking affiliate is an agent\nbank and a lender under outstanding credit facilities of Rockwell Collins, B/E Aerospace and KLX, for which it receives customary\ncompensation or other financial benefits. J.P. Morgan and its affiliates have committed to provide financing to Rockwell Collins in\nconnection with the merger for customary compensation, which is expected to be approximately $20 million in fees payable to J.P. Morgan\nin connection with such financing. During the two-year period preceding delivery of its opinion, the aggregate fees received by J.P.\nMorgan from Rockwell Collins were approximately $3 million and from B/E Aerospace were approximately $10 million. In the ordinary\ncourse of their businesses, J.P. Morgan and its affiliates may actively trade the debt and equity securities or financial instruments\n(including derivatives, bank loans or other obligations) of Rockwell Collins or B/E Aerospace for their own\n\n81\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/861361/000104746917000512/a2230778zdefm14a.htm\n\n93/330\n\n\x0c8/28/2019\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/861361/000104746917000512/a2230778zdefm14a.htm\n\nTable of Contents\n\naccounts or for the accounts of customers and, accordingly, they may at any time hold long or short positions in such securities.\n\nOpinions of B/E Aerospace\'s Financial Advisors \n\nOpinion of Citigroup Global Markets Inc.\n\n        On October 23, 2016, Citigroup delivered to the B/E Aerospace Board a written opinion dated October 23, 2016, to the effect that, as\nof such date and based on and subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and limitations and qualifications\nset forth in the written opinion, the merger consideration to be received by the holders of outstanding shares of common stock of\nB/E Aerospace (other than excluded holders) in the merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.\n\n        The full text of Citigroup\'s written opinion, dated October 23, 2016, which sets forth, among other things, the assumptions\nmade, procedures followed, matters considered and limitations and qualifications on the review undertaken by Citigroup in\nrendering its opinion, is attached to this joint proxy statement/prospectus as Annex C and is incorporated into this joint proxy\nstatement/prospectus by reference in its entirety.

Citigroup\'s opinion, the\nissuance of which was authorized by Citigroup\'s fairness opinion committee, was provided to the B/E Aerospace Board (in its\ncapacity as such) in connection with its evaluation of the merger and was limited to the fairness, from a financial point of view, as\nof the date of the opinion, to the holders of outstanding shares of common stock of B/E Aerospace (other than excluded holders) of\nthe merger consideration to be received by such holders in the merger. Citigroup\'s opinion does not address any other aspects or\nimplications of the merger and does not constitute a recommendation to any stockholder as to how such stockholder should vote or\nact on any matters relating to the merger or otherwise. Citigroup\'s opinion does not address the underlying business decision of\nB/E Aerospace to effect the merger, the relative merits of the merger as compared to any alternative business strategies that might\nexist for B/E Aerospace or the effect of any other transaction in which B/E Aerospace might engage.

With respect to financial forecasts and other information and data provided to or\notherwise reviewed by or discussed with Citigroup, Citigroup was advised by the respective managements of B/E Aerospace and Rockwell\nCollins that such forecasts and other information and data were reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available\nestimates and judgments of the managements of B/E Aerospace and Rockwell Collins as to the future financial performance of\nB/E Aerospace and Rockwell Collins, the potential strategic implications and operational benefits anticipated to result from the merger and\nthe other matters covered thereby, and assumed, with B/E Aerospace\'s consent, that the financial results (including the potential strategic\nimplications and operational benefits anticipated to result from the merger) reflected in such forecasts and other information and data will\nbe realized in the amounts and at the times projected.\n\n        Citigroup also assumed, with B/E Aerospace\'s consent, that the merger will be consummated in accordance with its terms, without\nwaiver, modification or amendment of any material term, condition or agreement and that, in the course of obtaining the necessary\nregulatory or third party approvals, consents and releases for the merger, no delay, limitation, restriction or condition will be imposed that\nwould have an adverse effect on B/E Aerospace, Rockwell Collins or the contemplated benefits of the merger. Citigroup\'s opinion related\nto the relative values of B/E Aerospace and Rockwell Collins. Citigroup did not express any opinion as to what the value of Rockwell\nCollins common stock actually will be when issued pursuant to the merger or the price at which shares of Rockwell Collins common stock\nwill trade at any time. Citigroup did not make and it was not provided with an independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets or\nliabilities (contingent or otherwise) of B/E Aerospace or Rockwell Collins and Citigroup did not make any physical inspection of the\nproperties or assets of B/E Aerospace or Rockwell Collins. Citigroup\'s opinion did not address the underlying business decision of\nB/E Aerospace to effect the merger, the relative merits of the merger as compared to any alternative business strategies that might exist for\nB/E Aerospace or the effect of any other transaction in which B/E Aerospace might engage. Citigroup also expressed no view as to, and\nCitigroup\'s opinion did not address, the fairness (financial or otherwise) of the amount or nature or any other aspect of any compensation\nto any officers, directors or employees of any parties to the merger, or any class of such persons, relative to the merger consideration or\notherwise. Citigroup\'s opinion was necessarily based upon information available to it, and financial, stock market and other conditions and\ncircumstances existing, as of October 20, 2016, except as otherwise noted.\n\n        For a summary of the material financial analyses presented by Citigroup, together with Goldman Sachs, to the B/E Aerospace Board\nin connection with the delivery of Citigroup\'s opinion, see the section entitled "\xe2\x80\x94Financial Analyses by Financial Co-Advisors" beginning\non page 87.\n\n83\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/861361/000104746917000512/a2230778zdefm14a.htm\n\n95/330\n\n\x0c8/28/2019\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/861361/000104746917000512/a2230778zdefm14a.htm\n\nTable of Contents\n\n        Under the terms of Citigroup\'s engagement, B/E Aerospace has agreed to pay Citigroup, for its financial advisory services in\nconnection with the merger, an aggregate fee of approximately $27.3 million, $5 million of which was payable upon delivery by Citigroup\nof its opinion and the remainder of which is payable upon completion of the merger. Subject to certain limitations, B/E Aerospace also has\nagreed to reimburse Citigroup, subject to certain conditions, for reasonable and documented travel and other reasonable and documented\nout-of-pocket expenses incurred by Citigroup in performing its services, including reasonable and documented fees and expenses of its\nlegal counsel, and to indemnify Citigroup and related persons against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the federal securities\nlaws, arising out of its engagement.\n\n        Citigroup and its affiliates in the past have provided, and currently provide, services to B/E Aerospace unrelated to the merger, for\nwhich services Citigroup and such affiliates have received and expect to receive compensation, including, without limitation, during the\ntwo-year period prior to October 23, 2016, having acted or acting (i) as financial advisor to B/E Aerospace in connection with\nB/E Aerospace\'s spin-off of KLX Inc. in December 2014, and (ii) as lender, syndication agent, joint lead arranger and joint book-runner in\nconnection with a term loan and revolving credit facility of B/E Aerospace. During the two year period ended October 23, 2016, Citigroup\nhas received compensation for financial advisory and/or underwriting services provided by its Investment Banking Division directly to\nB/E Aerospace and/or its affiliates of approximately $18,700,000. Citigroup and its affiliates in the past have also provided, and currently\nprovide, services to Rockwell Collins unrelated to the merger, for which services Citigroup and such affiliates have received and expect to\nreceive compensation, including, without limitation, during the two-year period prior to October 23, 2016, acting as lender, syndication\nagent, joint lead arranger and joint book-runner in connection with two revolving credit facilities of Rockwell Collins, as well as acting as\nlender in connection with certain committed corporate credit card facilities of Rockwell Collins. During the two-year period ended\nOctober 23, 2016, Citigroup has received compensation for financial advisory and/or underwriting services provided by its Investment\nBanking Division directly to Rockwell Collins and/or to its affiliates of approximately $50,000. In the ordinary course of business,\nCitigroup and its affiliates may actively trade or hold the securities of B/E Aerospace and Rockwell Collins for its own account or for the\naccount of its customers and, accordingly, may at any time hold a long or short position in such securities. In addition, Citigroup and its\naffiliates (including Citigroup Inc. and its affiliates) may maintain relationships with B/E Aerospace, Rockwell Collins and their respective\naffiliates.\n\n        In response to a request by Rockwell Collins, made after the execution of the merger agreement, that Citigroup participate in the\nfinancing of the merger by Rockwell Collins, the B/E Aerospace Board granted Citigroup permission to participate in such financing.\nPursuant to such request and consent, Citigroup is now participating in such financing, including as a joint lead arranger and lender with\nrespect to certain credit facilities, and Citigroup is now actively exploring participating, and may participate as an active bookrunner with\nrespect to capital markets offerings.\n\n        The B/E Aerospace Board selected Citigroup to act as one of its financial advisors in connection with the merger based on Citigroup\'s\nreputation and experience. Citigroup is an internationally recognized investment banking firm which regularly engages in the valuation of\nbusinesses and their securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions, negotiated underwritings, competitive bids, secondary\ndistributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements and valuations for corporate and other purposes.\n\nOpinion of Goldman, Sachs & Co.\n\n        On October 23, 2016, Goldman Sachs delivered to the B/E Aerospace Board a written opinion dated October 23, 2016, to the effect\nthat, as of such date and based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth therein, the merger consideration to be paid to the\nholders (other than\n\n84\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/861361/000104746917000512/a2230778zdefm14a.htm\n\n96/330\n\n\x0c8/28/2019\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/861361/000104746917000512/a2230778zdefm14a.htm\n\nTable of Contents\n\nRockwell Collins and its affiliates) of outstanding shares of common stock of B/E Aerospace pursuant to the merger agreement was fair\nfrom a financial point of view to such holders.\n\n        The full text of the written opinion of Goldman Sachs, dated October 23, 2016, which sets forth assumptions made,\nprocedures followed, matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken in connection with the opinion, is attached as\nAnnex D. Goldman Sachs provided its opinion for the information and assistance of the B/E Aerospace Board in connection with\nits consideration of the merger. The Goldman Sachs opinion is not a recommendation as to how any holder of B/E Aerospace\'s\ncommon stock should vote with respect to the merger or any other matter.\n\n        In connection with rendering the opinion described above and performing its related financial analyses, Goldman Sachs reviewed,\namong other things:\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nthe merger agreement; \n\nannual reports to stockholders and Annual Reports on Form 10-K of B/E Aerospace and Rockwell Collins for the five\nfiscal years ended December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2015, respectively; \n\ncertain interim reports to stockholders and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q of B/E Aerospace and Rockwell Collins; \n\ncertain other communications from B/E Aerospace and Rockwell Collins to their respective stockholders; \n\ncertain publicly available research analyst reports for B/E Aerospace and Rockwell Collins; and \n\ncertain internal financial analyses and forecasts for B/E Aerospace prepared by its management and for Rockwell Collins\nprepared by its management, in each case, as approved for Goldman Sachs\' use by B/E Aerospace (which is referred to as\nthe Forecasts) and certain operating synergies projected by the managements of B/E Aerospace and Rockwell Collins to\nresult from the transaction, as approved for Goldman Sachs\' use by B/E Aerospace (which is referred to as the Synergies).\n\n        Goldman Sachs also held discussions with members of the senior managements of B/E Aerospace and Rockwell Collins regarding\ntheir assessment of the strategic rationale for, and the potential benefits of, the merger and the past and current business operations,\nfinancial condition and future prospects of B/E Aerospace and Rockwell Collins; reviewed the reported price and trading activity for\nshares of B/E Aerospace common stock and shares of Rockwell Collins common stock; compared certain financial and stock market\ninformation for B/E Aerospace and Rockwell Collins with similar information for certain other companies the securities of which are\npublicly traded; reviewed the financial terms of certain recent business combinations in the aerospace and defense industry and in other\nindustries; and performed such other studies and analyses, and considered such other factors, as it deemed appropriate.\n\n        For purposes of rendering its opinion, Goldman Sachs, with B/E Aerospace\'s consent, relied upon and assumed the accuracy and\ncompleteness of all of the financial, legal, regulatory, tax, accounting and other information provided to, discussed with or reviewed by, it,\nwithout assuming any responsibility for independent verification thereof. In that regard, Goldman Sachs assumed with B/E Aerospace\'s\nconsent that the Forecasts and Synergies were reasonably prepared on a basis reflecting the best currently available estimates and\njudgments of the management of B/E Aerospace. Goldman Sachs did not make an independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets and\nliabilities (including any contingent, derivative or other off-balance-sheet assets and liabilities) of B/E Aerospace or Rockwell Collins or\nany of their respective subsidiaries and it was not furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal. Goldman Sachs assumed that all\ngovernmental, regulatory or other consents and approvals necessary for the consummation of the merger will be obtained without any\nadverse effect on B/E Aerospace or Rockwell Collins or on the expected benefits of the merger in any way\n\n85\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/861361/000104746917000512/a2230778zdefm14a.htm\n\n97/330\n\n\x0c8/28/2019\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/861361/000104746917000512/a2230778zdefm14a.htm\n\nTable of Contents\n\nmeaningful to its analysis. Goldman Sachs has also assumed that the merger will be consummated on the terms set forth in the merger\nagreement, without the waiver or modification of any term or condition the effect of which would be in any way meaningful to its analysis.\n\n        Goldman Sachs\' opinion does not address the underlying business decision of B/E Aerospace to engage in the merger or the relative\nmerits of the merger as compared to any strategic alternatives that may be available to B/E Aerospace; nor does it address any legal,\nregulatory, tax or accounting matters. Goldman Sachs\' opinion addresses only the fairness from a financial point of view to the holders\n(other than Rockwell Collins and its affiliates) of outstanding shares of common stock of B/E Aerospace, as of the date of the opinion, of\nthe merger consideration to be paid to such holders pursuant to the Merger Agreement. Goldman Sachs\' opinion does not express any view\non, and does not address, any other term or aspect of the merger agreement or the merger or any term or aspect of any other agreement or\ninstrument contemplated by the merger agreement or entered into or amended in connection with the merger, including the fairness of the\nmerger to, or any consideration received in connection therewith by, the holders of any other class of securities, creditors, or other\nconstituencies of B/E Aerospace; nor as to the fairness of the amount or nature of any compensation to be paid or payable to any of the\nofficers, directors or employees of B/E Aerospace, or class of such persons in connection with the merger, whether relative to the merger\nconsideration to be paid to the holders (other than Rockwell Collins and its affiliates) of outstanding shares of common stock of\nB/E Aerospace pursuant to the merger agreement or otherwise. In addition, Goldman Sachs does not express any opinion as to the prices at\nwhich shares of common stock of Rockwell Collins will trade at any time or as to the impact of the merger on the solvency or viability of\nB/E Aerospace or Rockwell Collins or the ability of B/E Aerospace or Rockwell Collins to pay their respective obligations when they\ncome due. Goldman Sachs\' opinion was necessarily based on economic, monetary, market and other conditions, as in effect on, and the\ninformation made available to it as of, the date of the opinion and Goldman Sachs assumed no responsibility for updating, revising or\nreaffirming its opinion based on circumstances, developments or events occurring after the date of its opinion. Goldman Sachs\' opinion\nwas approved by a fairness committee of Goldman Sachs.\n\n        Goldman Sachs and its affiliates are engaged in advisory, underwriting and financing, principal investing, sales and trading, research,\ninvestment management and other financial and non-financial activities and services for various persons and entities. Goldman Sachs and\nits affiliates and employees, and funds or other entities in which they invest or have other economic interests or with which they co-invest,\nmay at any time purchase, sell, hold or vote long or short positions and investments in securities, derivatives, loans, commodities,\ncurrencies, credit default swaps and other financial instruments of B/E Aerospace, Rockwell Collins, any of their respective affiliates and\nthird parties, or any currency or commodity that may be involved in the merger contemplated by the merger agreement. Goldman Sachs\nacted as financial advisor to B/E Aerospace in connection with, and participated in certain of the negotiations leading to, the merger\ncontemplated by the merger agreement. Goldman Sachs has provided certain financial advisory and/or underwriting services to\nB/E Aerospace and/or its affiliates from time to time for which the Investment Banking Division of Goldman Sachs has received, and may\nreceive, compensation, including having acted as book manager with respect to a private offering of KLX, a former subsidiary of\nB/E Aerospace, 5.875% Senior Notes due 2022 (aggregate principal amount of $1,200,000,000) in November 2014; as lead arranger with\nrespect to B/E Aerospace\'s term loan (aggregate principal amount of $2,200,000,000) put in place in November 2014; as B/E Aerospace\'s\nfinancial advisor in connection with the KLX spin-off in December 2014; and as a participant in B/E Aerospace\'s revolving credit facility\n(aggregate principal amount of $600,000,000) put in place in December 2014. During the two year period ended October 23, 2016,\nGoldman Sachs has received compensation for financial advisory and/or underwriting services provided by its Investment Banking\nDivision directly to B/E Aerospace and/or to its affiliates of approximately $9,900,000.

Goldman Sachs may also in the future provide financial\nadvisory and/or underwriting services to B/E Aerospace, Rockwell Collins and their respective affiliates for which the Investment Banking\nDivision of Goldman Sachs may receive compensation.\n\n        The B/E Aerospace Board selected Goldman Sachs as its financial advisor because it is an internationally recognized investment\nbanking firm that has substantial experience in transactions similar to the merger. Pursuant to a letter agreement dated September 6, 2016,\nB/E Aerospace engaged Goldman Sachs to act as its financial advisor in connection with the merger. The engagement letter between\nB/E Aerospace and Goldman Sachs provides for a transaction fee that is estimated, based on the information available as of the date of\nannouncement, at approximately $27.3 million, $5 million of which became payable at announcement of the transaction, and the\nremainder of which is contingent upon consummation of the transaction. In addition, B/E Aerospace has agreed to reimburse Goldman\nSachs for certain of its expenses, including attorneys\' fees and disbursements, and to indemnify Goldman Sachs and related persons against\nvarious liabilities, including certain liabilities under the federal securities laws.\n\nFinancial Analyses by Financial Co-Advisors \n\n        The following is a summary of the material financial analyses delivered by Citigroup and Goldman Sachs, referred to as the financial\nco-advisors, to the B/E Aerospace Board in connection with rendering their respective opinions described above. The following summary,\nhowever, does not purport to be a complete description of the financial analyses performed by the financial co-advisors, nor does the order\nof analyses described represent relative importance or weight given to those analyses by the financial co-advisors. Some of the summaries\nof the financial analyses include information presented in tabular format. The tables must be read together with the full text of each\nsummary and are alone not a complete description of the financial co-advisors\' financial analyses. Except as otherwise noted, the following\nquantitative information, to the extent that it is based on market data, is based on market data as it existed on or before October 20, 2016,\nand is not necessarily indicative of current market conditions.\n\n        The preparation of financial opinions is a complex process involving various determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant\nmethods of financial analysis and the application of those methods to the particular circumstances and, therefore, financial opinions are not\nreadily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. Selecting portions of the analyses or of the summary set forth below,\nwithout considering the analyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view of the processes underlying each financial co-advisor\nopinion. In arriving at their respective fairness determinations, the financial co-advisors considered the results of all of their analyses and\ndid not attribute any particular weight to any factor or analysis considered by them. Rather, each financial co-advisor made its\ndetermination as to fairness on the basis of its experience and professional judgment after considering the results of all of its analyses. No\ncompany or transaction used in the above analyses as a comparison is directly comparable to B/E Aerospace or Rockwell Collins or the\ncontemplated merger.\n\n        The financial co-advisors prepared these analyses for purposes of providing their respective opinions to the B/E Aerospace Board as\nto the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders (other than Rockwell Collins and its affiliates) of outstanding shares of\ncommon stock of B/E Aerospace, as of the date of the opinions, of the merger consideration to be paid to such holders pursuant to the\nmerger agreement. These analyses do not purport to be appraisals nor do they necessarily reflect the prices at which businesses or\nsecurities actually may be sold. Analyses based upon forecasts of future results are not necessarily indicative of actual future results, which\nmay be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by these analyses. Because these analyses are inherently subject to uncertainty,\nbeing based upon numerous factors or events beyond the control of the parties or their respective advisors, none of B/E Aerospace,\nRockwell Collins, Citigroup, Goldman\n\n87\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/861361/000104746917000512/a2230778zdefm14a.htm\n\n99/330\n\n\x0c8/28/2019\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/861361/000104746917000512/a2230778zdefm14a.htm\n\nTable of Contents\n\nSachs or any other person assumes responsibility if future results are materially different from those forecast.\n\n        The merger consideration was determined through arm\'s-length negotiations between B/E Aerospace and Rockwell Collins, rather\nthan by any financial advisor, and was approved by the B/E Aerospace Board. The financial co-advisors provided advice to B/E Aerospace\nduring these negotiations. The financial co-advisors did not, however, recommend any specific amount of consideration to B/E Aerospace\nor the B/E Aerospace Board or that any specific amount of consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration for the transaction.\n\n        As described above, each financial co-advisor\'s opinion to the B/E Aerospace Board was one of many factors taken into consideration\nby the B/E Aerospace Board in making its determination to approve the merger agreement. The foregoing summary does not purport to be\na complete description of the analyses performed by the financial co-advisors in connection with their respective fairness opinions and is\nqualified in its entirety by reference to their respective written opinions attached as Annex C for Citigroup and Annex D for Goldman\nSachs.\n\n        Historical Stock Trading Analysis.    The financial co-advisors first calculated $62.00 as the implied value of the per share merger\nconsideration (which we refer to as the "implied per share consideration") by adding the cash consideration of $34.10 per share of\nB/E Aerospace common stock to $27.90, the implied value of the stock portion of the per share merger consideration based on the closing\nprice per share of Rockwell Collins common stock on October 20, 2016.\n\n        The financial co-advisors then reviewed the historical trading prices for B/E Aerospace common stock and compared the implied per\nshare consideration to the closing price per share of B/E Aerospace common stock as of October 20, 2016, the volume weighted average\nprices per share of B/E Aerospace common stock for the 30-day and 90-day periods ended October 20, 2016, the intra-day high price per\nshare of B/E Aerospace common stock for the 52-week period ended October 20, 2016, and the closing price per share of B/E Aerospace\ncommon stock as of July 20, 2016 (the date of the initial meeting between the managements of B/E Aerospace and Rockwell Collins to\ndiscuss a potential merger).\n\n        This analysis indicated that the implied per share consideration to be paid to the holders (other than Rockwell Collins and its\naffiliates) of outstanding shares of common stock of B/E Aerospace pursuant to the merger agreement represented:\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\na premium of 22.4% to the closing price of $50.65 per share of B/E Aerospace common stock as of October 20, 2016; \n\na premium of 22.5% to the volume weighted average price of $50.61 per share of B/E Aerospace common stock for the 30-\nday period ended October 20, 2016; \n\na premium of 28.4% to the volume weighted average price of $48.30 per share of B/E Aerospace common stock for the 90-\nday period ended October 20, 2016; \n\na premium of 16.4% to the 52-week intraday high price of $53.25 per share of B/E Aerospace common stock for the 52-\nweek period ended October 20, 2016; and \n\na premium of 33.8% to the closing price of $46.34 per share of B/E Aerospace common stock as of July 20, 2016.\n\n        Implied Premia Analysis for U.S. Transactions.    For each year from 2013 through 2016 (as of October 6, 2016), the financial co-\nadvisors calculated, using publicly available information, the first quartile, median and third quartile one-day unaffected stock price premia\npaid in such year for acquisition transactions announced in such year (expressed as a percentage of the merger consideration on the trading\nday prior to either (i) the announcement of the transaction or (ii) the date on which either the target confirmed a sale process or merger\ntalks in the six months leading up to the\n\n88\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/861361/000104746917000512/a2230778zdefm14a.htm\n\n100/330\n\n\x0c8/28/2019\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/861361/000104746917000512/a2230778zdefm14a.htm\n\nTable of Contents\n\ntransaction or rumors surfaced in the month leading up to the transaction).

The analysis excluded transactions in the financial institutions and real estate sectors as well as transactions with premia below\n0%.

Morgan, and to B/E Aerospace. Such projections are referred to as the Rockwell Collins management forecast. The\nRockwell Collins management forecast includes the results of projected acquisitions over the forecast period. Also, in connection with the\nproposed transaction, certain non-public, unaudited financial projections regarding Rockwell Collins\' anticipated results of operations for\nfiscal years 2017 through 2021 excluding the results of projected acquisitions were provided to the Rockwell Collins Board, J.P. Morgan\nand B/E Aerospace. Such projections are referred to as the Rockwell Collins stand-alone management forecast. The Rockwell Collins\nmanagement forecast and the Rockwell Collins stand-alone management forecast are the only financial forecasts provided by Rockwell\nCollins to B/E Aerospace.\n\n        The Rockwell Collins management forecast and Rockwell Collins stand-alone management forecast are based on numerous estimates\nand assumptions. The 2017 amounts resulted from Rockwell Collins\' operating plan process, and reflect a detailed forecast primarily\ndriven by Rockwell Collins\' original equipment manufacturer production rate projections and other market insights into expected revenues,\nas well as anticipated product line margins and discretionary spending. The 2017 amounts are consistent with the fiscal 2017 financial\nguidance provided publicly on October 23, 2016. The 2018 to 2021 amounts resulted from Rockwell Collins\' strategic and financial\nplanning process, and reflect more general market-level forecasts primarily driven by original equipment manufacturer rate projections and\nother market growth rate projections, as well as anticipated portfolio margins and discretionary spending. The underlying assumptions\nused in the strategic and financial planning process are generally based on information and market factors known to management in the\nspring of 2016.\n\n        In addition, the Rockwell Collins Board received and reviewed certain non-public, unaudited financial projections regarding\nB/E Aerospace\'s anticipated results of operations for the fiscal years 2016 through 2021, which were prepared by B/E Aerospace\'s\nmanagement as described in the section of this joint proxy statement/prospectus entitled "\xe2\x80\x94Certain Financial Projections Utilized by the\nB/E Aerospace Board of Directors and B/E Aerospace\'s Financial Advisors" beginning on page 98. Rockwell Collins\' management\nreviewed and performed due diligence regarding such projections. Rockwell Collins\' management made certain adjustments to the\nB/E Aerospace management forecast described below. Such projections, as adjusted, are referred to as the adjusted B/E Aerospace\nforecast.\n\n        As discussed below, the B/E Aerospace management forecast is based on numerous estimates and assumptions. In preparing the\nadjusted B/E Aerospace forecast, Rockwell Collins made adjustments to such forecast based on Rockwell Collins\' view of key market\ndrivers such as air traffic growth rates, original equipment manufacturer delivery rates, aircraft fleet growth, as well as Rockwell Collins\'\nviews of B/E Aerospace\'s competitiveness in each product line and its backlog levels.\n\n        The forecasted financial information contained in this section "\xe2\x80\x94Certain Financial Projections Utilized by the Rockwell Collins\nBoard of Directors and Rockwell Collins\' Financial Advisor" was not prepared for public disclosure.

B/E Aerospace avoids making public projections for extended periods due to, among other things, the unpredictability of the\nunderlying assumptions and estimates. However, in connection with its evaluation of the proposed merger, B/E Aerospace\'s senior\nmanagement prepared certain non-public, unaudited financial projections regarding B/E Aerospace\'s anticipated results of operations for\nfiscal years 2016 through 2021. Such projections were provided to B/E Aerospace\'s financial advisors, Citigroup and Goldman Sachs, and\nto Rockwell Collins. Such projections are referred to as the B/E Aerospace management forecast. The B/E Aerospace management\nforecast was not prepared for public disclosure. The B/E Aerospace management forecast is based on numerous estimates and\nassumptions. The outlook is developed in the context of assumed passenger traffic growth and sustained airline profitability. The forecasts\ntake into account awarded backlog with scheduled delivery dates, original equipment manufacturer rate projections, expected new product\nintroductions and anticipated program launches. The forecasts incorporate products produced for both new aircraft deliveries and\nrefurbishment of existing aircraft. The projections are based upon anticipated program margins with the continued benefit of cost reduction\ninitiatives and disciplined expense management. The inclusion of the B/E Aerospace management forecast in this joint proxy\nstatement/prospectus does not constitute an admission or representation by B/E Aerospace that the information is material. You should\nnote that projections included in the B/E Aerospace management forecast constitute forward-looking statements.

One such individual will serve as a member of the class of directors of the Rockwell Collins\nBoard with terms expiring in 2018, and the other will serve as a member of the class of directors of the Rockwell Collins Board with terms\nexpiring in 2020. Pursuant to this provision of the merger agreement, John T. Whates and Richard G. Hamermesh, both members of the\nB/E Aerospace Board, were selected by B/E Aerospace to be appointed to the Rockwell Collins Board and are expected to serve as\nmembers of the class of directors of the Rockwell Collins Board with terms expiring in 2018 and 2020, respectively. Other than such\nadditional directors, no changes to the Rockwell Collins Board are expected in connection with the consummation of the merger.\n\n        For a more complete description of the material interests of directors of Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace in the merger that may\nbe in addition to, or different from, their interests as\n\n101\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/861361/000104746917000512/a2230778zdefm14a.htm\n\n113/330\n\n\x0c8/28/2019\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/861361/000104746917000512/a2230778zdefm14a.htm\n\nstockholders, see "\xe2\x80\x94Interests of Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger" beginning on page 102.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nHeadquarters \n\n        Upon completion of the merger, Rockwell Collins\' headquarters will remain in Cedar Rapids, Iowa.\n\nInterests of Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger \n\nInterests of Directors and Executive Officers of B/E Aerospace in the Merger\n\n        In considering the recommendation of the B/E Aerospace Board that B/E Aerospace stockholders vote "FOR" the merger proposal,\nB/E Aerospace stockholders should be aware that B/E Aerospace\'s directors and executive officers have interests in the merger that may be\ndifferent from, or in addition to, those of B/E Aerospace stockholders generally. The B/E Aerospace Board was aware of these interests\nand considered them, among other matters, in approving the merger agreement and recommending that the B/E Aerospace stockholders\nadopt the merger agreement.\n\n        The following discussion sets forth certain of these interests in the merger of each person who has served as a non-employee director\nor executive officer of B/E Aerospace since January 1, 2015. The amounts presented in the following discussion do not reflect the impact\nof applicable withholding or other taxes.\n\nConsideration Payable for Shares Converted Pursuant to the Merger Agreement\n\n        As of January 18, 2017, the non-employee directors and executive officers of B/E Aerospace beneficially owned, in the aggregate,\n269,296 shares of B/E Aerospace common stock (or approximately .3% of the outstanding shares as of such date), which for the purposes\nof this discussion and the table immediately below does not include shares underlying outstanding unvested restricted stock awards or\nshares subject to restricted stock units. Each share of B/E Aerospace common stock issued prior to the effective time of the merger (other\nthan canceled shares and dissenting shares) will be converted into the right to receive $34.10 per share in cash, without interest, from\nRockwell Collins and a number of validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of Rockwell Collins common stock equal to the\nexchange ratio and, if applicable, cash in lieu of fractional shares of Rockwell Collins common stock. Upon the conversion of all shares of\nB/E Aerospace common stock held by the non-employee directors and executive officers of B/E Aerospace, they would receive an\naggregate of $16,696,352 in cash, which includes the value of the shares of Rockwell Collins common stock to be issued pursuant to the\nmerger agreement, assuming an exchange ratio of 0.3604 pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement.\n\n        The following table sets forth, as of January 18, 2017, the cash consideration and the value of the Rockwell Collins common stock\nbased on a presumed exchange ratio of 0.3604 that each non-employee\n\n102\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/861361/000104746917000512/a2230778zdefm14a.htm\n\n114/330\n\n\x0c8/28/2019\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/861361/000104746917000512/a2230778zdefm14a.htm\n\nTable of Contents\n\ndirector and executive officer would receive in respect of their outstanding shares of B/E Aerospace common stock upon conversion\npursuant to the merger agreement:\n\nName\nNon-Employee Directors\nJames F.

For Mr. Patch, the amount in this column represents a cash severance payment equal to\n$2,670,062 and a transaction bonus payment equal to $1,680,000. The transaction bonuses included in this column\nare single-trigger benefits and all other cash amounts included in this column are double-trigger benefits and will be\npaid upon termination of employment. However, pursuant to the employment agreements of Messrs. Khoury,\nLieberherr, Lower and Patch, termination will occur automatically upon consummation of the merger.\n\nAmounts shown reflect the value provided in respect of B/E Aerospace restricted stock awards and B/E Aerospace\nRSU Awards, as more fully described above under "\xe2\x80\x94Treatment of Restricted Stock Awards" and "\xe2\x80\x94Treatment of\nRestricted Stock Units." The amounts in this column are calculated based on a per share value of $59.53, which was\nB/E Aerospace\'s average closing market price over the first five business days following the first public\nannouncement of the merger, as required by Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K, multiplied by the number of B/E\nAerospace restricted stock awards and B/E Aerospace RSU Awards outstanding on a presumed closing date of\nJanuary 18, 2017 and that would vest on a double trigger basis at the effective time of the merger. All amounts\nincluded in this column are single-trigger benefits in that they will only be paid upon the consummation of the\nmerger. For Mr. Khoury, the amount in this column represents payments of $5,764,945 and $10,089,442 for his\nunvested and accelerated B/E Aerospace restricted stock awards and B/E Aerospace RSU awards, respectively. For\nMr. Lieberherr, the amount in this column represents payments of $3,419,879 and $12,937,417 for his unvested and\naccelerated B/E Aerospace restricted stock awards and B/E Aerospace RSU awards, respectively.

For Mr. Patch, the amount in this column represents payments of $898,605\nand $2,691,887 for his unvested and accelerated B/E Aerospace restricted stock awards and B/E Aerospace RSU\nawards, respectively. \n\nAmounts shown reflect continuation of all medical, dental and health benefits as well as the benefits under the\nAmended and Restated Medical Care Reimbursement Plan for Executives of B/E Aerospace, Inc. The amounts\nassociated with the medical, dental and health benefits are calculated using 2016 enrollment rates and severance\nagreement terms, and represent the value of coverage for one year post-termination. The amounts included in this\ncolumn are double-trigger benefits and will be paid upon termination of employment. However, pursuant to the\nemployment agreements of Messrs. Lieberherr and Patch, termination will occur automatically upon consummation\nof the merger.\n\nDirector and Officer Indemnification \n\nAccounting Treatment \n\n        Under the merger agreement, certain indemnification and insurance rights exist in favor of B/E Aerospace and its subsidiaries\' current\nand former directors and officers. See "\xe2\x80\x94Interests of Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger\xe2\x80\x94Indemnification and Insurance"\nbeginning on page 113 for information about these rights.\n\n        Rockwell Collins prepares its financial statements in accordance with GAAP. The transaction will be accounted for by applying the\nacquisition method in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 805, Business Combinations, or ASC 805, which requires the\ndetermination of the acquirer, the acquisition date, the fair value of assets and liabilities of the acquiree and the measurement of\n\n115\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/861361/000104746917000512/a2230778zdefm14a.htm\n\n127/330\n\n\x0c8/28/2019\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/861361/000104746917000512/a2230778zdefm14a.htm\n\nTable of Contents\n\ngoodwill. The accounting guidance provides that in identifying the acquiring entity in a combination effected through an exchange of\nequity interests, all pertinent facts and circumstances must be considered, including the relative voting rights of the stockholders of the\nconstituent companies in the combined entity, the composition of the board of directors and senior management of the surviving\ncorporation, the relative size of each company and the terms of the exchange of equity securities in the business combination, including\npayment of any premium.\n\n        Based on the fact that current Rockwell Collins Board members will represent a majority of the directors of the Rockwell Collins\nBoard immediately following completion of the transaction, Rockwell Collins stockholders will own approximately 80.8% of the stock of\nthe surviving corporation with B/E Aerospace stockholders receiving a premium (as of the date preceding the transaction announcement)\nover the fair market value of their shares on such date, as well as other terms of the transaction, Rockwell Collins is considered to be the\nacquirer of B/E Aerospace for accounting purposes.\n\n        Accordingly, Rockwell Collins will allocate the purchase price to the fair value of B/E Aerospace\'s assets and liabilities at the\nacquisition date. To the extent the net fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is less than the purchase price, goodwill will\nbe recognized for the difference. Currently, the preliminary purchase price allocation indicates that goodwill will be recognized because\nthe preliminary net fair value of the assets to be acquired and liabilities to be assumed is less than the preliminary purchase price.\n\n        All unaudited pro forma condensed combined consolidated financial statements contained in this joint proxy statement/prospectus\nwere prepared using the acquisition method of accounting. The final allocation of the purchase price will be determined after the\ntransaction is completed and after completion of an analysis to determine the estimated net fair value of B/E Aerospace\'s assets and\nliabilities. Accordingly, the final acquisition accounting adjustments may be materially different from the unaudited pro forma\nadjustments. Any decrease in the estimated net fair value of the assets and liabilities of B/E Aerospace as compared to the unaudited pro\nforma information included in this joint proxy statement/prospectus will have the effect of increasing the goodwill recognized related to\nthe transaction.\n\nRegulatory Approvals Required for the Merger \n\n        To complete the merger, Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace must obtain approvals or consents from, or make filings with, a\nnumber of United States federal, state and foreign antitrust regulators. We describe below the material United States federal, state and\nforeign approvals. Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace are not currently aware of any other material governmental consents, approvals or\nfilings that are required prior to the parties\' completion of the transaction other than those we describe below. If additional approvals,\nconsents and filings are required to complete the transaction, Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace intend to seek such consents and\napprovals and make such filings.\n\n        Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace expect to complete the transaction in the spring of 2017. Although Rockwell Collins and B/E\nAerospace believe that they will receive the required consents and approvals described below to complete the transaction, we cannot give\nany assurance as to the timing of these consents and approvals or as to Rockwell Collins\' and B/E Aerospace\'s ultimate ability to obtain\nsuch consents or approvals (or any additional consents or approvals which may otherwise become necessary) or that we will obtain such\nconsents or approvals on terms and subject to conditions satisfactory to Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace. The receipt of the regulatory\napprovals (as described hereinafter) is a condition to the obligation of each of Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace to complete the\nmerger. For more information about the receipt of regulatory approvals as a condition to closing under the merger agreement, see the\nsection entitled "The Merger Agreement\xe2\x80\x94Covenants and Agreements\xe2\x80\x94Appropriate Actions; Consents; Filings" beginning on page 139.\n\n116\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/861361/000104746917000512/a2230778zdefm14a.htm\n\n128/330\n\n\x0c8/28/2019\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/861361/000104746917000512/a2230778zdefm14a.htm\n\nTable of Contents\n\nHart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act\n\n        The merger is subject to the requirements of the HSR Act and the related rules and regulations, which provide that certain\ntransactions may not be completed until required information has been furnished to the DOJ and the FTC and until certain waiting periods\nhave been terminated, have expired or approval has been obtained. The HSR Act requires Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace to observe\na 30-day waiting period after the submission of their HSR filings before consummating their transaction, unless the waiting period is\nterminated early.\n\n        On November 7, 2016, each of Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace filed a Notification and Report Form under the HSR Act with\nthe DOJ and the FTC, which filings started the initial 30-day waiting period required by the HSR Act. The required 30-day waiting period\nexpired at 11:59 Eastern time on December 7, 2016.\n\nOther Regulatory Approvals\n\n        The merger is also subject to antitrust review by governmental authorities in several foreign jurisdictions in which the companies\nhave a sufficient market presence to require filings. The parties are making filings in Europe, China, the Philippines, South Korea and\nTurkey.\n\nEurope\n\nChina\n\nSouth Korea\n\n        Based on the businesses in which Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace are engaged, a merger filing with the European Commission,\nwhich is referred to as the EC, and observation of the applicable review period under the EU Merger Regulation (Council Regulation (EC)\nNo. 139/2004) is required before the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby may close. The initial review period is\n25 EC working days from filing of the EU notification, and can be extended to 35 EC working days if commitments are offered by the\nparties (Phase I) or by an additional 20 EC working days at the request of Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace. The review period may be\nfurther extended for an additional 90 EC working days or for an even longer period of time for an in-depth investigation (Phase II).\n\n        Based on the businesses in which Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace are engaged, a merger notification will be made to the Anti-\nMonopoly Bureau of the Ministry of Commerce of China. Under the anti-monopoly law, the transactions may not be consummated until\nthe expiration of a 30 calendar day review period following the complete filing of a notification concerning the merger agreement and the\ntransactions contemplated thereby (Phase I). The review period may be extended for an additional 90 calendar days (Phase II) and further\nfor an additional 60 calendar days in the event of an in-depth investigation (Phase III).\n\n        Based on the businesses in which Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace are engaged, an antitrust notification is required to the Korea\nFair Trade Commission, which is referred to as the KFTC, Under the Monopoly Regulation and Fair Trade Act, the transactions may not\nbe consummated until the expiration of a 30 calendar day review period following the complete filing of a notification concerning the\nmerger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby (Phase I). The review period may be extended for an additional 90 calendar\ndays at the KFTC\'s discretion (Phase II).\n\n117\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/861361/000104746917000512/a2230778zdefm14a.htm\n\n129/330\n\n\x0c8/28/2019\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/861361/000104746917000512/a2230778zdefm14a.htm\n\nTable of Contents\n\nPhilippines\n\nTurkey\n\n        Based on the businesses in which Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace are engaged, a merger notification must be made to the\nPhilippine Competition Commission. Under the Philippine Competition Act, the transactions may not be consummated until the expiration\nof a 30 calendar day review period following the complete filing of a notification concerning the merger agreement and the transactions\ncontemplated thereby (Phase I). The review period may be extended for an additional 60 calendar days for an in-depth investigation\n(Phase II).\n\n        Based on the businesses in which Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace are engaged, Turkish competition law requires notification of\nand approval by the Turkish Competition Authority because the merger exceeds certain thresholds. The transactions may not be\nconsummated until the expiration of a 30 calendar day review period following receipt of the complete notification (Phase I). The review\nperiod may be extended for an additional 6 months at the Authority\'s discretion (Phase II).\n\nTreatment of B/E Aerospace\'s Existing Debt; Financing\n\n        In connection with the merger, the parties intend to terminate B/E Aerospace\'s existing revolving credit facility and term loan facility.\nRockwell Collins\' obligation to complete the merger is not conditioned upon its obtaining financing. Rockwell Collins anticipates that\napproximately $3.6 billion will be required to pay the aggregate cash portion of the merger consideration to the B/E Aerospace\nstockholders. Rockwell Collins intends to fund the cash component of the merger through sources of debt financing.\n\n        For a more complete description of sources of funding for the merger, see "\xe2\x80\x94Source of Funding for the Merger" beginning on page\n123.\n\nTreatment of B/E Aerospace Stock-Based Awards \n\nTreatment of B/E Aerospace Restricted Stock Awards and RSU Awards\n\n        Upon completion of the merger, each outstanding award of B/E Aerospace restricted stock and each B/E Aerospace restricted stock\nunit award that in each case was granted prior to the date of the merger agreement will (i) become fully vested and, to the extent such\naward is subject to performance conditions, such performance conditions will be deemed satisfied at the maximum level and (ii) be\ncancelled and converted into the right to receive a lump sum cash payment per share of B/E Aerospace common stock underlying such\naward equal to the value of the per share merger consideration less any applicable withholding taxes. Upon completion of the merger,\nexcept for outstanding restricted stock unit awards granted to the executive officers of B/E Aerospace in November 2016, consistent with\npast practice, which will be cancelled and converted into a cash payment pursuant to their terms, each outstanding award of B/E Aerospace\nrestricted stock and each B/E Aerospace restricted stock unit award that in each case was granted on or following the date of the merger\nagreement will be assumed by Rockwell Collins and converted into a Rockwell Collins award of restricted stock or restricted stock unit\naward, as applicable, which will vest subject to the grantee\'s continued service with Rockwell Collins or its affiliates through each\napplicable vesting date (with any performance conditions that were applicable to the B/E Aerospace award deemed satisfied at target level\nperformance and following the closing, the converted Rockwell Collins award subject only to time-based vesting) covering a number of\nshares of Rockwell Collins common stock (rounded down to the nearest whole share) determined by multiplying the number of shares of\nB/E Aerospace that were subject to the B/E Aerospace award by a ratio of the value of the merger consideration divided by the Rockwell\nCollins stock price (with the value of the stock consideration portion of the merger consideration determined by multiplying the number of\nsuch shares of Rockwell Collins common stock by the Rockwell Collins stock price).\n\n118\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/861361/000104746917000512/a2230778zdefm14a.htm\n\n130/330\n\n\x0c8/28/2019\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/861361/000104746917000512/a2230778zdefm14a.htm\n\nTable of Contents\n\nTreatment of B/E Aerospace Stock Units\n\n        Each stock unit credited to the account of any current or former director under the B/E Aerospace Amended and Restated Non-\nEmployee Directors Stock and Deferred Compensation Plan that is outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger,\nwhich is referred to as the effective time, will be converted into the right to receive the merger consideration.\n\n        For a more complete description of the treatment of outstanding restricted stock unit awards granted to the executive officers of B/E\nAerospace in November 2016, see "\xe2\x80\x94Interests of Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger" beginning on page 102.\n\n        Any applicable withholding taxes resulting from this treatment will be satisfied by reducing the amount of cash, if any, that would\notherwise be provided to holders of such awards. If no cash is to be provided to a holder of such an award or if the amount of cash that\nwould otherwise be provided to a holder of such awards is not sufficient to cover the applicable withholding taxes, then the number of\nshares of Rockwell Collins common stock that would otherwise be provided to the holder in accordance with the terms described above\nwill be reduced to the extent necessary to cover the shortfall.\n\nAppraisal Rights \n\nRockwell Collins Stockholders Appraisal Rights\n\nB/E Aerospace Stockholders Appraisal Rights\n\n        Under Delaware law, Rockwell Collins stockholders will not be entitled to any appraisal rights in connection with the merger or any\nother transactions described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus.\n\n        Record holders of B/E Aerospace common stock who comply with the procedures summarized below will be entitled to appraisal\nrights if the merger is completed. Under Section 262 of the General Corporation Law, which is referred to as Section 262, holders of shares\nof B/E Aerospace common stock with respect to which appraisal rights are properly demanded and perfected and not withdrawn or lost are\nentitled, in lieu of receiving the merger consideration, to have the "fair value" of their shares (exclusive of any element of value arising\nfrom the accomplishment or expectation of the merger) at the effective time, judicially determined and paid to them in cash by complying\nwith the provisions of Section 262. B/E Aerospace is required to send a notice to that effect to each stockholder not less than 20 days prior\nto the B/E Aerospace special meeting. This joint proxy statement/prospectus constitutes that notice to the record holders of B/E Aerospace\ncommon stock.\n\n        The following is a brief summary of Section 262, which sets forth the procedures for demanding statutory appraisal rights. This\nsummary, however, is not a complete statement of the applicable requirements, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to Section 262,\na copy of the text of which is attached to this joint proxy statement/prospectus as Annex E. If you wish to consider exercising your\nappraisal rights, you should carefully review the text of Section 262 contained in Annex E. Failure to comply timely and properly with the\nrequirements of Section 262 may result in the loss of your appraisal rights under the DGCL. The following summary does not constitute\nany legal or other advice nor does it constitute a recommendation that stockholders exercise their appraisal rights under Section 262.\n\n        Stockholders of record who desire to exercise their appraisal rights must do all of the following: (i) not vote in favor of the adoption\nof the merger agreement, (ii) deliver in the manner set forth below a written demand for appraisal of the stockholder\'s shares to the\nSecretary of B/E Aerospace before the vote on the adoption of the merger agreement at the B/E Aerospace special meeting,\n(iii) continuously hold the shares of record from the date of making the demand through completion of the merger and (iv) otherwise\ncomply with the requirements of Section 262.\n\n119\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/861361/000104746917000512/a2230778zdefm14a.htm\n\n131/330\n\n\x0c8/28/2019\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/861361/000104746917000512/a2230778zdefm14a.htm\n\nTable of Contents\n\n        Only a holder of record of B/E Aerospace common stock is entitled to demand an appraisal of the shares registered in that holder\'s\nname. A demand for appraisal must be executed by or for the stockholder of record. The demand should set forth, fully and correctly, the\nstockholder\'s name as it appears on the certificates representing shares. If shares are owned of record in a fiduciary capacity, such as by a\ntrustee, guardian or custodian, such demand must be executed by the fiduciary. If shares are owned of record by more than one person, as\nin a joint tenancy or tenancy in common, the demand must be executed by or on behalf of all joint owners. An authorized agent, including\nan agent of two or more joint owners, may execute the demand for appraisal for a stockholder of record; however, the agent must identify\nthe record owner and expressly disclose that, in exercising the demand, the agent is acting as agent for the record owner.\n\n        A record owner, such as a broker, who holds shares as a nominee for others may exercise appraisal rights with respect to the shares\nheld for all or less than all beneficial owners of shares as to which the holder is the record owner. In that case, the written demand must set\nforth the number of shares covered by the demand. Where the number of shares is not expressly stated, the demand will be presumed to\ncover all shares outstanding in the name of the record owner.\n\n        Beneficial owners who are not record owners and who intend to exercise appraisal rights should consult with the record owner to\ndetermine the appropriate procedures for having the record holder make a demand for appraisal with respect to the beneficial owner\'s\nshares. Any holder of shares held in "street name" who desires appraisal rights with respect to those shares must take such actions as may\nbe necessary to ensure that a timely and proper demand for appraisal is made by the record owner of the shares. Shares held through\nbrokerage firms, banks and other financial institutions are frequently deposited with and held of record in the name of a nominee of a\ncentral security depository, such as Cede & Co., The Depository Trust Company\'s nominee. A demand for appraisal with respect to such\nshares must be made by or on behalf of the depository nominee and it must identify the depository nominee as the record owner. Any\nbeneficial holder of shares desiring appraisal rights with respect to such shares which are held through a brokerage firm, bank or other\nfinancial institution is responsible for ensuring that the demand for appraisal is made by the record holder.\n\n        As required by Section 262, a demand for appraisal must be in writing and must reasonably inform B/E Aerospace of the identity of\nthe record holder (which might be a nominee as described above) and of such holder\'s intention to seek appraisal of the holder\'s shares.\n\n        Stockholders of record who elect to demand appraisal of their shares must mail or deliver their written demand to: B/E\nAerospace, Inc., 1400 Corporate Center Way, Wellington, Florida 33414, Attention: Ryan M. Patch, Vice President\xe2\x80\x94Law, General\nCounsel and Secretary. The written demand for appraisal should specify the stockholder\'s name and mailing address. The written demand\nmust reasonably inform B/E Aerospace that the stockholder intends thereby to demand an appraisal of his, her or its shares. The written\ndemand must be received by B/E Aerospace prior to the vote on the Merger proposal at the B/E Aerospace special meeting. Neither voting\n(in person or by proxy) against, abstaining from voting on or failing to vote on the adoption of the merger agreement will alone suffice to\nconstitute a written demand for appraisal within the meaning of Section 262. In addition, the stockholder must not vote its shares of B/E\nAerospace common stock in favor of adoption of the merger agreement. An executed proxy that does not contain voting instructions will,\nunless revoked, be voted in favor of adoption of the merger agreement and will cause the stockholder\'s right of appraisal to be lost.\nTherefore, a stockholder who desires to exercise appraisal rights should either (i) refrain from executing and submitting the enclosed proxy\ncard or (ii) vote by proxy against the adoption of the merger agreement or affirmatively register an abstention with respect thereto.\n\n        Notwithstanding a stockholder\'s compliance with the foregoing requirements, Section 262 provides that, because immediately prior to\nthe merger B/E Aerospace common stock was listed on a national securities exchange, the Delaware Chancery Court will dismiss the\nproceedings as to all holders of\n\n120\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/861361/000104746917000512/a2230778zdefm14a.htm\n\n132/330\n\n\x0c8/28/2019\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/861361/000104746917000512/a2230778zdefm14a.htm\n\nTable of Contents\n\nshares of B/E Aerospace common stock who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless (i) the total number of shares of B/E\nAerospace common stock entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of B/E Aerospace common stock or (ii) the value of\nthe consideration provided in the merger for such total number of shares of B/E Aerospace common stock entitled to appraisal exceeds\n$1 million.\n\n        Within 120 days after completion of the merger, but not thereafter, either the surviving corporation in the merger or any stockholder\nwho has timely and properly demanded appraisal of such stockholder\'s shares and who has complied with the requirements of Section 262\nand is otherwise entitled to appraisal rights, or any beneficial owner for which a demand for appraisal has been properly made by the\nrecord holder, may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery, with a copy served on the\nsurviving corporation in the case of a petition filed by a stockholder, demanding a determination of the fair value of the shares of all\nstockholders who have properly demanded appraisal. There is no present intent on the part of B/E Aerospace as the surviving corporation\nto file an appraisal petition and stockholders seeking to exercise appraisal rights should not assume that the surviving corporation will file\nsuch a petition or that the surviving corporation will initiate any negotiations with respect to the fair value of such shares. Accordingly,\nstockholders who desire to have their shares appraised should initiate any petitions necessary for the perfection of their appraisal rights\nwithin the time periods and in the manner prescribed in Section 262.\n\n        Within 120 days after completion of the merger, any stockholder who has complied with the applicable provisions of Section 262 will\nbe entitled, upon written request, to receive from the surviving corporation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares of B/E\nAerospace common stock not voting in favor of the merger and with respect to which demands for appraisal were received by the\nsurviving corporation and the number of holders of such shares. A person who is the beneficial owner of shares held in a voting trust or by\na nominee on behalf of such person may, in such person\'s own name, file a petition or request from the surviving corporation for the\nstatement described in the previous sentence. Such statement must be mailed within 10 days after the written request therefor has been\nreceived by the surviving corporation.\n\n        If a petition for appraisal is duly filed by a B/E Aerospace stockholder and a copy of the petition is delivered to the surviving\ncorporation, then the surviving corporation will be obligated, within 20 days after receiving service of a copy of the petition, to file with\nthe Delaware Register in Chancery a duly verified list containing the names and addresses of all stockholders who have demanded an\nappraisal of their shares of B/E Aerospace common stock and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares of B/E Aerospace\ncommon stock have not been reached. After notice to stockholders who have demanded appraisal, if such notice is ordered by the\nDelaware Court of Chancery, the Delaware Court of Chancery will conduct a hearing upon the petition and determine those stockholders\nwho have complied with Section 262 and who have become entitled to appraisal rights. The Delaware Court of Chancery may require the\nstockholders who have demanded an appraisal for their shares and who hold stock represented by certificates to submit their certificates of\nstock to the Delaware Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings; and if any stockholder fails\nto comply with such direction, the Delaware Court of Chancery may dismiss the proceedings as to such stockholder. Where proceedings\nare not dismissed, the appraisal proceeding will be conducted, as to the shares of B/E Aerospace common stock owned by such\nstockholders, in accordance with the rules of the Delaware Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically governing appraisal\nproceedings.\n\n        After a hearing on such petition, the Delaware Court of Chancery will determine which stockholders are entitled to appraisal rights\nand thereafter will appraise the shares owned by those stockholders, determining the fair value of the shares exclusive of any element of\nvalue arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, together with interest to be paid, if any, upon the amount determined\nto be the fair value.

Notwithstanding the\nforegoing, at any time before the entry of judgment in the proceedings, the surviving corporation may pay to each stockholder entitled to\nappraisal an amount in cash (which will be treated as an advance against the payment due to such stockholder), in which case interest shall\naccrue after such payment only upon the sum of (i) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair value of the shares as\ndetermined by the Delaware Court of Chancery and (ii) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time. When the fair value is\ndetermined, the Delaware Court of Chancery will direct the payment of such value, together with interest, if any, on the amount\ndetermined to be fair value, to the stockholders entitled to receive the same upon the surrender by such holders of the certificates\nrepresenting their shares, if any, or, immediately in the case of any uncertificated shares. The parties have made no determination as to\nwhether such a payment will be made if the merger is consummated, and B/E Aerospace reserves the right to make such a payment upon\nthe consummation of the merger.\n\n        In determining fair value, the Delaware Court of Chancery is to take into account all relevant factors. In Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., et\nal., the Delaware Supreme Court stated that "proof of value by any techniques or methods which are generally considered acceptable in\nthe financial community and otherwise admissible in court" should be considered in an appraisal proceeding and that "[f]air price\nobviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of a company." The Delaware Supreme Court has stated that in\nmaking this determination of fair value the court must consider market value, asset value, dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the\nenterprise and any other facts which could be ascertained as of the date of the merger which throw any light on future prospects of the\nmerged corporation. Section 262 provides that fair value is to be determined "exclusive of any element of value arising from the\naccomplishment or expectation of the merger." In Cede & Co. v. Technicolor,  Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court stated that such exclusion\nis a "narrow exclusion [that] does not encompass known elements of value," but which rather applies only to the speculative elements of\nvalue arising from such accomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger, the Delaware Supreme Court construed Section 262 to mean that\n"elements of future value, including the nature of the enterprise, which are known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the merger and\nnot the product of speculation, may be considered."\n\n        Stockholders considering seeking appraisal should bear in mind that the fair value of their shares determined under Section 262 could\nbe more than, the same as, or less than the merger consideration they are entitled to receive pursuant to the merger agreement if they do not\nseek appraisal of their shares, and that opinions of investment banking firms as to the fairness from a financial point of view of the\nconsideration payable in a transaction are not opinions as to fair value under Section 262. Each of Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace\nreserves the right to assert, in any appraisal proceeding, that for purposes of Section 262, the "fair value" of a share of B/E Aerospace\ncommon stock is less than the applicable merger consideration.\n\n        The cost of the appraisal proceeding may be determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery and charged upon the parties as the\nDelaware Court of Chancery deems equitable in the circumstances. However, costs do not include attorneys\' and expert witness fees. The\nDelaware Court of Chancery may order that all or a portion of the expenses incurred by such stockholder in connection with the appraisal\nproceeding, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys\' fees and the fees and expenses of experts, be charged pro rata against the\nvalue of all shares entitled to appraisal. In the absence of such a determination of assessment, each party bears its own expenses.\n\n        From and after the date of completion of the merger, any stockholder who has duly demanded appraisal in compliance with\nSection 262 will not, after completion of the merger, be entitled to vote\n\n122\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/861361/000104746917000512/a2230778zdefm14a.htm\n\n134/330\n\n\x0c8/28/2019\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/861361/000104746917000512/a2230778zdefm14a.htm\n\nTable of Contents\n\nfor any purpose any shares subject to such demand or to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on such shares, except for\ndividends or distributions payable to stockholders of record at a date prior to completion of the merger.\n\n        Within 10 days after the effective time, the surviving corporation must give notice of the date that the merger became effective to\neach of B/E Aerospace\'s stockholders who has properly filed a written demand for appraisal, who did not vote in favor of the proposal to\nadopt the merger agreement and who has otherwise complied with Section 262. At any time within 60 days after completion of the merger,\nany stockholder who has demanded appraisal and who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named\nparty will have the right to withdraw such stockholder\'s demand for appraisal and to accept the cash and Rockwell Collins common stock\nto which the stockholder is entitled pursuant to the merger. After this period, the stockholder may withdraw such stockholder\'s demand for\nappraisal only with the written approval of the surviving corporation. If no petition for appraisal is filed with the Delaware Court of\nChancery within 120 days after completion of the merger, stockholders\' rights to appraisal will cease and all stockholders will be entitled\nonly to receive the merger consideration as provided for in the merger agreement. No petition timely filed in the Delaware Court of\nChancery demanding appraisal will be dismissed as to any stockholders without the approval of the Delaware Court of Chancery, and that\napproval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems just. However, the preceding sentence will not\naffect the right of any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined the proceeding as a named party to withdraw\nsuch stockholder\'s demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the merger within 60 days after completion of the merger.\n\n        The foregoing is a brief summary of Section 262 that sets forth the procedures for demanding statutory appraisal rights. This\nsummary, however, is not a complete statement of all applicable requirements and is qualified in its entirety by reference to Section 262, a\ncopy of the text of which is attached as Annex E to this joint proxy statement/prospectus.\n\n        Failure to comply strictly with all the procedures set forth in Section 262 may result in the loss of a stockholder\'s statutory\nappraisal rights. Consequently, if you wish to exercise your appraisal rights, you are strongly urged to consult a legal advisor\nbefore attempting to exercise your appraisal rights.\n\nSource of Funding for the Merger \n\n        Rockwell Collins\' obligation to complete the merger is not conditioned upon its obtaining financing.\n\n        Rockwell Collins anticipates that approximately $3.6 billion will be required to pay the aggregate cash portion of the merger\nconsideration to the B/E Aerospace stockholders. Rockwell Collins expects to issue up to $4.35 billion in aggregate principal amount of its\nsenior unsecured notes in one or more public offerings or private placements and borrow up to $1.5 billion under a new senior unsecured\nsyndicated term loan facility. Rockwell Collins has entered into a committed bridge loan credit facility of $4.35 billion that would be\nfunded only to the extent some or all of the senior unsecured notes described above are not issued prior to the consummation of the\nacquisition. Rockwell Collins expects to fund approximately $3.6 billion (based on the outstanding shares of B/E Aerospace common\nstock on January 26, 2017) for the aggregate cash portion of the merger consideration payable to the B/E Aerospace stockholders through\nthe debt financing described above.\n\nNYSE Listing of Rockwell Collins Common Stock; Delisting and Deregistration of B/E Aerospace Common Stock \n\n        Prior to the completion of the merger, Rockwell Collins has agreed to use its reasonable best efforts to cause the shares of Rockwell\nCollins common stock to be issued in connection with the merger to be approved for listing on the NYSE.

The\nlawsuits were captioned The Vladimir Gusinsky Living Trust v. B/E Aerospace, et. al., C.A. No. 12957-VCS (Del. Ch.) (filed December 1,\n2016) and Sharon Klein v. B/E Aerospace, et. al., C.A. No. 12969-VCS (Del. Ch.) (filed December 8, 2016). On December 21, 2016, the\ntwo lawsuits were consolidated under the caption In re B/E Aerospace, Inc. Stockholder Litigation, Consol. C.A. No. 12957-VCS, with the\ncomplaint filed on December 1, 2016 in the Gusinsky action as the operative complaint. The defendants in the consolidated action are\nB/E Aerospace, the members of the B/E Aerospace Board, Rockwell Collins and Merger Sub. The defendants filed motions to dismiss on\nDecember 23, 2016. On January 9, 2017, following Rockwell Collins\' and B/E Aerospace\'s agreement to make certain supplemental\ndisclosures, plaintiffs informed the Court of Chancery that they were withdrawing their motion to expedite proceedings.\n\n        The complaint in the consolidated action alleges, among other things, that the directors of B/E Aerospace breached their fiduciary\nduties by misstating and/or omitting material information from the Form S-4 filed by Rockwell Collins on November 23, 2016, and that\nthe corporate defendants aided and abetted such alleged breaches of fiduciary duties.\n\n        In connection with the merger, one purported B/E Aerospace stockholder filed one putative class action lawsuit in the United States\nDistrict Court for the Southern District of Florida seeking to enjoin the merger and other relief. The lawsuit is captioned Kipp Dodds v. B/E\nAerospace, et. al., Case 1:16-cv-25038-KMM (S.D. Fla.) (filed December 5, 2016). The defendants are B/E Aerospace and the members\nof the B/E Aerospace Board. The defendants have not yet responded to the complaint in this lawsuit.\n\n        The complaint in the Dodds action alleges, among other things, that the Form S-4 filed by Rockwell Collins on November 23, 2016\nmisstates and/or omits material information under Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, SEC Rule 14a-9\nand 17 C.F.R. \xc2\xa7 244.100. On January 5, 2017, plaintiff filed a motion for preliminary injunction to enjoin the B/E Aerospace shareholder\nvote on the merger. On January 20, 2017, following Rockwell Collins\' and B/E Aerospace\'s agreement to make certain supplemental\ndisclosures, plaintiff withdrew his motion for preliminary injunction on the basis that the supplemental disclosures mooted the disclosure\nclaims asserted in the Dodds action, and the court entered an electronic order denying the motion for preliminary injunction as moot.\n\n        The outcome of these lawsuits and any additional lawsuits filed in the future is uncertain. One of the conditions to the closing of the\nmerger is that no governmental authority has issued or entered any order after the date of the merger agreement having the effect of\nenjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the merger or the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, and\nthese lawsuits seek an order enjoining consummation of the merger. If the cases are not resolved, these lawsuits could prevent or delay\ncompletion of the merger and result in substantial costs to Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace, including, but not limited to, costs\nassociated with the indemnification of directors and officers.

The summary is based on the Code, the U.S. Treasury Regulations issued under the Code, and administrative\nrulings and court decisions in effect as of the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, all of which are subject to change at any time,\npossibly with retroactive effect. Because holders of Rockwell Collins common stock will retain their shares of Rockwell Collins common\nstock in the merger, the transaction should have no tax consequences for such stockholders.\n\n        For purposes of this discussion, the term "U.S. holder" means a beneficial owner of B/E Aerospace common stock that is for U.S.\nfederal income tax purposes (1) a citizen or individual resident of the United States, (2) a corporation (or other entity taxable as a\ncorporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) created or organized in the United States, (3) an estate the income of which is includible\nin gross income for U.S. federal income tax purposes regardless of its source or (4) a trust if (A) a court within the United States is able to\nexercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial\ndecisions of the trust, or (B) the trust has a valid election in effect under applicable Treasury regulations to be treated as a U.S. person for\nU.S. federal income tax purposes. A "non-U.S. holder" means a beneficial owner of B/E Aerospace common stock that is neither a U.S.\nholder nor a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\n\n        This summary is not a complete description of all the tax consequences of the merger and, in particular, may not address United\nStates federal income tax considerations applicable to holders of B/E Aerospace common stock who are subject to special treatment under\nU.S. federal income tax law (including, for example, partnerships (or an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal\nincome tax purposes) and partners therein, financial institutions, dealers in securities, insurance companies or tax-exempt entities, U.S.\nexpatriates, former long-term residents of the United States, holders who acquired B/E Aerospace common stock pursuant to the exercise\nof an employee stock option or right or otherwise as compensation, and holders who hold B/E Aerospace common stock as part of a\nhedge, straddle or conversion transaction). Also, this summary does not address U.S. federal income tax considerations applicable to\nholders of options or warrants to purchase B/E Aerospace common stock, or holders of debt instruments convertible into B/E Aerospace\ncommon stock. In addition, no information is provided with respect to the tax consequences of the merger under the U.S. federal estate,\ngift, Medicare, and alternative minimum tax laws, or any applicable state, local, or foreign tax laws. This summary does not address the\ntax consequences of any transaction other than the merger.\n\n        The tax consequences of the merger will depend on your specific situation. You should consult your own tax advisor as to the\ntax consequences of the merger in your particular circumstances, including the applicability and effect of the alternative minimum\ntax and any state, local, non-U.S. or other tax laws and of changes in those laws.\n\nTax Consequences to U.S. Holders\n\n        The receipt of the merger consideration by U.S. holders in exchange for shares of B/E Aerospace common stock pursuant to the\nmerger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

Long-term capital gains of certain non-corporate holders,\nincluding individuals, are generally subject to U.S. federal income tax at preferential rates. The deductibility of a capital loss recognized\non the exchange is subject to limitations. If a U.S. holder acquired different blocks of B/E Aerospace common stock at different times or\ndifferent prices, such U.S. holder must determine its adjusted tax basis and holding period separately with respect to each block of B/E\nAerospace common stock.\n\n        A U.S. holder\'s aggregate tax basis in Rockwell Collins common stock received in the merger will equal the fair market value of the\nRockwell Collins common stock as of the effective time. The holding period of the Rockwell Collins common stock received in the\nmerger will begin on the day after the merger.\n\nTax Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders\n\n        Payments made to a non-U.S. holder in exchange for shares of B/E Aerospace common stock pursuant to the merger generally will\nnot be subject to U.S. federal income tax unless:\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nthe gain, if any, on such shares of B/E Aerospace common stock is effectively connected with a trade or business of the\nnon-U.S. holder in the United States (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to the non-U.S.\nholder\'s permanent establishment in the United States); \n\nthe non-U.S. holder is an individual who is present in the U.S. for 183 days or more in the taxable year of the exchange of\nshares of B/E Aerospace common stock for the merger consideration pursuant to the merger and certain other conditions\nare met; or \n\nthe non-U.S. holder owned, directly or under certain constructive ownership rules of the Code, more than 5% of B/E\nAerospace common stock at any time during the five-year period preceding the merger, and B/E Aerospace is or has been a\n"U.S. real property holding corporation" within the meaning of Section 897(c)(2) of the Code for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes at any time during the shorter of the five-year period preceding the merger or the period that the non-U.S. holder\nheld B/E Aerospace common stock.\n\n        Gain described in the first bullet point above will be subject to tax at generally applicable U.S. federal income tax rates. Any gain\ndescribed in the first bullet point above of a non-U.S. holder that is a corporation may also be subject to an additional "branch profits tax"\nat a 30% rate (or lower applicable treaty rate). A non-U.S. holder described in the second bullet point immediately above will be subject to\ntax at a rate of 30% (or a lower applicable treaty rate) on any gain realized, which may be offset by U.S.-source capital losses recognized\nin the same taxable year. If the third bullet point above applies to a non-U.S. holder, gain recognized by such holder will be subject to tax\nat generally applicable U.S. federal income tax rates. B/E Aerospace believes that it has not been a "U.S. real property holding\ncorporation" for U.S. federal income tax purposes at any time during the five-year period preceding the merger.\n\n126\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/861361/000104746917000512/a2230778zdefm14a.htm\n\n138/330\n\n\x0c8/28/2019\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/861361/000104746917000512/a2230778zdefm14a.htm\n\nTable of Contents\n\nInformation Reporting and Backup Withholding\n\n        Payments made in exchange for shares of B/E Aerospace common stock pursuant to the merger may be subject, under certain\ncircumstances, to information reporting and backup withholding. To avoid backup withholding, a U.S. holder that does not otherwise\nestablish an exemption should complete and return an Internal Revenue Service Form W-9, certifying under penalties of perjury that such\nU.S. holder is a "United States person" (within the meaning of the Code), that the taxpayer identification number provided is correct and\nthat such U.S. holder is not subject to backup withholding.\n\n        A non-U.S. holder may be subject to information reporting and backup withholding on the merger consideration received in exchange\nfor B/E Aerospace common stock unless the Non-U.S. Holder establishes an exemption, for example, by properly certifying its non-U.S.\nstatus on an appropriate version of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8.\n\n        Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be refunded or credited\nagainst a holder\'s U.S. federal income tax liability, if any, provided that such holder furnishes the required information to the Internal\nRevenue Service in a timely manner.\n\n        Holders of B/E Aerospace common stock are urged to consult their own tax advisors with respect to the tax consequences of\nthe merger in their particular circumstances, including the applicability and effect of the alternative minimum tax and any state,\nlocal, non-U.S. or other tax laws and of changes in those laws.\n\nRestrictions on Sales of Shares of Rockwell Collins Common Stock Received in the Merger \n\n        All shares of Rockwell Collins common stock received by B/E Aerospace stockholders in the merger will be freely tradable for\npurposes of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, except for shares of Rockwell Collins common stock received by any B/E Aerospace\nstockholder who becomes an "affiliate" of Rockwell Collins after completion of the merger (such as B/E Aerospace directors or executive\nofficers who become directors or executive officers of Rockwell Collins after the merger).

You are urged to read the full text of the merger agreement because it is the\nlegal document that governs the merger.\n\n        The merger agreement contains representations, warranties and covenants by each of the parties thereto, which were made only for\npurposes of the merger agreement, as of specified dates. The representations, warranties and covenants in the merger agreement were\nmade solely for the benefit of the parties thereto; may be subject to limitations agreed upon by the contracting parties, including being\nqualified by confidential disclosures made for the purposes of allocating contractual risk between the parties to such agreement instead of\nestablishing these matters as facts; and may be subject to standards of materiality applicable to the contracting parties that differ from\nthose applicable to investors. Investors should not rely on representations, warranties and covenants or any descriptions thereof as\ncharacterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of Rockwell Collins, Merger Sub, B/E Aerospace or any of their respective\nsubsidiaries or affiliates. Investors are not entitled to rely on the representations and warranties, which are only for the benefit of the\nparties to the merger agreement. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the representations, warranties and covenants\nmay change after the date of the merger agreement, which subsequent information may or may not be fully reflected in Rockwell Collins\'\nor B/E Aerospace\'s public disclosures. Each such agreement should not be read alone, but should instead be read in conjunction with the\nother information regarding the merger agreement, the merger, Rockwell Collins, B/E Aerospace and their respective affiliates and\nbusinesses, which is contained in or incorporated by reference into this joint proxy statement/prospectus, as well as in the Forms 10-K,\nForms 10-Q and other filings that each of Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace have made or will make with the SEC.\n\nStructure of the Merger \n\n        The merger agreement provides that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the merger agreement, and in\naccordance with the DGCL, at the effective time, Merger Sub will be merged with and into B/E Aerospace. As a result of the merger, the\nseparate corporate existence of Merger Sub will cease, and B/E Aerospace will continue as the surviving corporation and a direct or\nindirect, wholly owned subsidiary of Rockwell Collins. The certificate of incorporation of B/E Aerospace, as in effect immediately prior to\nthe effective time, will be amended in its entirety as set forth in Exhibit A to the merger agreement and, as so amended will be the\ncertificate of incorporation of the surviving corporation. The bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the effective time,\nwill be the bylaws of the surviving corporation, except as to the name of the surviving corporation, which shall be "B/E Aerospace, Inc."\n\nMerger Consideration to be Received by B/E Aerospace Stockholders \n\n        At the effective time, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the merger agreement, each share of B/E Aerospace\ncommon stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time (other than (i) shares of B/E Aerospace common stock that\nare owned, directly or indirectly, by Rockwell Collins, B/E Aerospace (including as treasury stock) or Merger Sub, which will be cancelled\nimmediately prior to the effective time, and (ii) shares of B/E Aerospace common stock with respect to which appraisal rights are properly\ndemanded and not withdrawn under Section 262 of\n\n128\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/861361/000104746917000512/a2230778zdefm14a.htm\n\n140/330\n\n\x0c8/28/2019\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/861361/000104746917000512/a2230778zdefm14a.htm\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nthe DGCL, both of which are collectively referred to as the B/E Aerospace excluded shares) will be converted into the right to receive the\nmerger consideration, which is:\n\n$34.10 in cash, without interest, from Rockwell Collins; and \n\na fraction of a validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of Rockwell Collins common stock, having a value equal\nto $27.90, subject to adjustment based upon a two-way collar mechanism described below.\n\n        The exchange ratio will be calculated based upon the volume-weighted average price per share of Rockwell Collins common stock on\nthe NYSE (as reported by Bloomberg L.P. or, if not reported on Bloomberg L.P., in another authoritative source mutually selected by\nRockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace) on each of the 20 consecutive trading days ending with the trading day immediately prior to the\nclosing date, which is referred to as the Rockwell Collins stock price. If the Rockwell Collins stock price is greater than or equal to $77.41\nand less than or equal to $89.97, the exchange ratio will be equal to the quotient of (i) $27.90 divided by (ii) the Rockwell Collins stock\nprice, which, in each case, will result in the stock consideration having a value equal to $27.90. If the Rockwell Collins stock price is less\nthan $77.41 or greater than $89.97, then a two-way collar mechanism will apply pursuant to which, (a) if the Rockwell Collins stock price\nis greater than $89.97, the exchange ratio will be fixed at 0.3101 and the value of the stock consideration will be more than $27.90, and\n(b) if the Rockwell Collins stock price is less than $77.41, the exchange ratio will be fixed at 0.3604 and the value of the stock\nconsideration will be less than $27.90.\n\n        The following table sets forth an illustrative range of the potential merger consideration based on various Rockwell Collins stock\nprices, ranging from $65.00 to $110.00, which reflect the 52-week stock price range for Rockwell Collins common stock as of January 26,\n2017, plus or minus approximately 10 percent, as applicable.

It is impossible to accurately predict the market price of Rockwell Collins common stock at\nthe effective time or during the period over which the Rockwell Collins stock price is calculated, and therefore impossible to accurately\npredict the number or value of the shares of Rockwell Collins common stock that B/E Aerospace stockholders will receive in the merger.\nYou should obtain current market quotations for shares of Rockwell Collins common stock.\n\n        All fractional shares of Rockwell Collins common stock that would otherwise be issued to a B/E Aerospace stockholder as part of the\nmerger consideration will be aggregated to create whole shares of Rockwell Collins common stock that will be issued to B/E Aerospace\nstockholders as part of the merger consideration. If a fractional share of Rockwell Collins common stock remains payable to a\nB/E Aerospace stockholder after aggregating all fractional shares of Rockwell Collins common stock payable to such B/E Aerospace\nstockholder, then such B/E Aerospace stockholder will be paid, in lieu of such remaining fractional share of Rockwell Collins common\nstock, an amount in cash, without interest, rounded down to the nearest cent, equal to the product of (x) the amount of the fractional share\ninterest in a share of Rockwell Collins common stock to which such holder would otherwise be entitled (rounded to three decimal places)\nand (y) the Rockwell Collins stock price.\n\n        Rockwell Collins stockholders will continue to own their existing shares of common stock of Rockwell Collins, the form of which\nwill not be changed by the transaction.\n\nTreatment of B/E Aerospace Stock-Based Awards \n\nB/E Aerospace\n\nTreatment of B/E Aerospace Restricted Stock Awards and RSU Awards\n\n        Upon completion of the merger, each outstanding award of B/E Aerospace restricted stock and each B/E Aerospace restricted stock\nunit award that in each case was granted prior to the date of the merger agreement will (i) become fully vested and, to the extent such\naward is subject to performance conditions, such performance conditions will be deemed satisfied at the maximum level and (ii) be\ncancelled and converted into the right to receive a lump sum cash payment per share of B/E Aerospace common stock underlying such\naward equal to the value of the per share merger consideration less any applicable withholding taxes. Upon completion of the merger,\nexcept for outstanding restricted stock unit awards granted to the executive officers of B/E Aerospace in November 2016, consistent with\npast practice, which will be cancelled and converted into a cash payment pursuant to their terms, each outstanding award of B/E Aerospace\nrestricted stock and each B/E Aerospace restricted stock unit award that in each case was granted on or following the date of the merger\nagreement will be assumed by Rockwell Collins and converted into a Rockwell Collins award of restricted stock or restricted stock unit\naward, as applicable, which will vest subject to the grantee\'s continued service with Rockwell Collins or its affiliates through each\napplicable vesting date (with any performance conditions that were applicable to the B/E Aerospace award deemed satisfied at target level\nperformance and following the closing, the converted Rockwell Collins award subject only to time-based vesting) covering a number of\nshares of Rockwell Collins common stock (rounded down to the nearest whole share) determined by multiplying the number of shares of\nB/E Aerospace that were subject to the B/E Aerospace award by a ratio of the value of the merger consideration divided by the Rockwell\nCollins stock price (with the value of the stock consideration portion of the merger consideration determined by multiplying the number of\nsuch shares of Rockwell Collins common stock by the Rockwell Collins stock price).\n\nTreatment of B/E Aerospace Stock Units\n\n        Each stock unit credited to the account of any current or former director under the B/E Aerospace Amended and Restated Non-\nEmployee Directors Stock and Deferred Compensation Plan that is outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger,\nwhich is referred to as the effective time, will be converted into the right to receive the merger consideration.\n\n130\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/861361/000104746917000512/a2230778zdefm14a.htm\n\n142/330\n\n\x0c8/28/2019\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/861361/000104746917000512/a2230778zdefm14a.htm\n\nTable of Contents\n\n        For a more complete description of the treatment of outstanding restricted stock unit awards granted to the executive officers of B/E\nAerospace in November 2016, see "The Merger\xe2\x80\x94Interests of Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger" beginning on page 102.\n\n        Any applicable withholding taxes resulting from this treatment will be satisfied by reducing the amount of cash, if any, that would\notherwise be provided to holders of such awards. If no cash is to be provided to a holder of such an award or if the amount of cash that\nwould otherwise be provided to a holder of such awards is not sufficient to cover the applicable withholding taxes, then the number of\nshares of Rockwell Collins common stock that would otherwise be provided to the holder in accordance with the terms described above\nwill be reduced to the extent necessary to cover the shortfall.\n\nClosing \n\nEffective Time \n\n        Unless another time, date or place is agreed to in writing by Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace, the closing of the merger will\noccur on a date to be specified by Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace, but no later than the second business day after the satisfaction or\nwaiver of the closing conditions set forth in the merger agreement (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the\nclosing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions).\n\n        The merger will become effective at the time the certificate of merger has been duly filed with the Delaware Secretary of State or at\nsuch other date and time as is agreed between Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace and specified in the certificate of merger.\n\nConversion of Shares; Exchange of Certificates; No Fractional Shares \n\nConversion and Exchange of B/E Aerospace Common Stock\n\n        The conversion of shares of B/E Aerospace common stock, other than the B/E Aerospace excluded shares, into the right to receive the\nmerger consideration will occur automatically at the effective time. As promptly as practicable after the effective time, but in no event later\nthan 5 business days after such time, Rockwell Collins\' exchange agent will mail a letter of transmittal to each holder of record of a\ncertificate or book-entry share, in each case, representing shares of B/E Aerospace common stock, whose shares of B/E Aerospace\ncommon stock were converted into the right to receive the merger consideration. The letter of transmittal will specify that delivery will be\neffected and risk of loss and title to such certificates or book-entry shares, as applicable, will pass only upon proper delivery of such\ncertificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of such certificates) or book-entry shares to the exchange agent. The letter of transmittal will be\naccompanied by instructions for surrendering such certificates or book-entry shares in exchange for the merger consideration, any\ndividends or distributions payable pursuant to the merger agreement and cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Rockwell Collins common\nstock payable as part of the merger consideration. No interest will be paid or will accrue on any cash payable upon surrender of a\ncertificate or book-entry share. B/E Aerospace stockholders should not return stock certificates with the enclosed proxy card.\n\n        At the effective time, shares of B/E Aerospace common stock will no longer be outstanding, will be automatically cancelled and will\ncease to exist, and each certificate or book-entry share that represented shares of B/E Aerospace common stock immediately prior to the\neffective time will cease to have any rights with respect to such B/E Aerospace common stock other than the right to receive, upon\nsurrender of such certificate or book-entry share, the merger consideration as described above and subject to the terms and conditions set\nforth in the merger agreement.\n\n        Following surrender by holders of certificates or book-entry shares previously representing B/E Aerospace common stock to the\nexchange agent for exchange, such holders will receive any\n\n131\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/861361/000104746917000512/a2230778zdefm14a.htm\n\n143/330\n\n\x0c8/28/2019\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/861361/000104746917000512/a2230778zdefm14a.htm\n\nTable of Contents\n\ndividends or other distributions with a record date after the effective time and a payment date on or prior to the date of such surrender with\nrespect to shares of Rockwell Collins common stock they receive as merger consideration, without interest.\n\n        Rockwell Collins and the exchange agent will be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any\nperson under the merger agreement such amounts as Rockwell Collins and the exchange agent are required to deduct and withhold from\nsuch consideration under the Code or under any provision of state, local or foreign tax law.\n\n        All shares of Rockwell Collins common stock issued pursuant to the merger agreement will be issued in book-entry form unless a\nphysical certificate is requested.\n\nRepresentations and Warranties; Material Adverse Effect \n\n        The merger agreement contains a number of representations and warranties made by the parties thereto that are subject in some cases\nto exceptions and qualifications (including exceptions that have not had, and would not reasonably be expected to have, a "material\nadverse effect").

B/E Aerospace will bear\nthe entire cost of the solicitation of proxies, including preparation, assembly and delivery, as applicable, of this joint proxy\nstatement/prospectus, the proxy card and any additional materials furnished to stockholders. Proxies may be solicited by directors, officers\nand a small number of B/E Aerospace\'s regular employees personally or by mail, telephone or facsimile, but such persons will not be\nspecially compensated for such service. B/E Aerospace has retained Georgeson LLC to assist in the solicitation of proxies for a fee of\napproximately $15,000 plus reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses. As appropriate, copies of solicitation material will be furnished\nto brokerage houses, fiduciaries and custodians that hold shares of B/E Aerospace common stock of record for beneficial owners for\nforwarding to such beneficial owners. B/E Aerospace may also reimburse persons representing beneficial owners for their costs of\nforwarding the solicitation material to such owners.\n\n        If you need assistance with voting via the Internet, voting by telephone or completing your proxy card, or have questions regarding\nthe B/E Aerospace special meeting, please contact B/E Aerospace\'s Investor Relations department at (561) 791-5000.\n\n        Your vote is very important regardless of the number of shares of B/E Aerospace common stock that you own.

Computershare will independently tabulate affirmative and negative votes and\nabstentions.\n\n        The B/E Aerospace special meeting may be adjourned to allow additional time for obtaining additional proxies. No notice of an\nadjourned meeting need be given if the time and place thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment was taken unless:\n\nthe adjournment is for more than 30 days, in which case a notice of the adjourned meeting will be given to each\nstockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting; or \n\nif after the adjournment, a new record date for determination of stockholders entitled to vote is fixed for the adjourned\nmeeting, in which case the B/E Aerospace Board will fix as the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice\nof such adjourned meeting the same or an earlier date as that fixed for determination of stockholders entitled to vote at the\nadjourned meeting, and will give notice of the adjourned meeting to each stockholder of record as of such record date.\n\n        At any adjourned meeting, all proxies will be voted in the same manner as they would have been voted at the original convening of\nthe special meeting, except for any proxies that have been effectively revoked or withdrawn prior to the adjourned meeting.\n\n171\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/861361/000104746917000512/a2230778zdefm14a.htm\n\n184/330\n\n\x0c8/28/2019\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/861361/000104746917000512/a2230778zdefm14a.htm\n\nTable of Contents\n\nB/E AEROSPACE PROPOSALS \n\nItem 1.    The Merger Proposal \n\n        (Item 1 on B/E Aerospace Proxy Card)\n\n        In the Merger proposal, B/E Aerospace is asking its stockholders to adopt the merger agreement. Approval of the Merger proposal by\nB/E Aerospace stockholders is required for completion of the merger.\n\nThe B/E Aerospace Board unanimously recommends a vote "FOR" the Merger proposal (Item 1).\n\nItem 2.    The Merger-Related Compensation Proposal \n\n        (Item 2 on B/E Aerospace Proxy Card)\n\n        In the Merger-Related Compensation proposal, B/E Aerospace is asking its stockholders to approve, on an advisory basis, the merger-\nrelated compensation arrangements of B/E Aerospace\'s named executive officers.\n\n        Because the vote on the Merger-Related Compensation proposal is advisory only, it will not be binding on either B/E Aerospace or\nRockwell Collins. Accordingly, if the Merger proposal is approved and the merger is completed, the merger-related compensation will be\npayable to B/E Aerospace\'s named executive officers, subject only to the conditions applicable thereto, regardless of the outcome of the\napproval of the Merger-Related Compensation proposal.\n\n        The B/E Aerospace Board unanimously recommends a vote "FOR" the Merger-Related Compensation proposal (Item 2).\n\nItem 3.    The B/E Aerospace Adjournment Proposal \n\n        (Item 3 on B/E Aerospace Proxy Card)\n\n        The B/E Aerospace special meeting may be adjourned to another time or place from time to time, if necessary or appropriate, to\npermit further solicitation of proxies in the event there are not sufficient votes at the time of the B/E Aerospace Special Meeting to approve\nthe Merger proposal.\n\n        If, at the B/E Aerospace special meeting, the number of shares of B/E Aerospace common stock present or represented and voting in\nfavor of the Merger proposal is insufficient to approve the Merger proposal, B/E Aerospace intends to adjourn the B/E Aerospace special\nmeeting in order to enable the B/E Aerospace Board to solicit additional proxies for approval of the Merger proposal.\n\n        In the B/E Aerospace Adjournment proposal, B/E Aerospace is asking its stockholders to authorize the holder of any proxy solicited\nby the B/E Aerospace Board to vote in favor of granting authority to the proxy holders, and each of them individually, to adjourn the B/E\nAerospace special meeting to another time and place for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies. If the B/E Aerospace stockholders\napprove the B/E Aerospace Adjournment proposal, B/E Aerospace could adjourn the B/E Aerospace special meeting and any adjourned\nsession of the B/E Aerospace special meeting and use the additional time to solicit additional proxies, including the solicitation of proxies\nfrom B/E Aerospace stockholders who have previously voted.\n\n        The B/E Aerospace Board unanimously recommends a vote "FOR" the B/E Aerospace Adjournment proposal (Item 3).\n\n172\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/861361/000104746917000512/a2230778zdefm14a.htm\n\n185/330\n\n\x0c8/28/2019\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/861361/000104746917000512/a2230778zdefm14a.htm\n\nTable of Contents\n\nUNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\n        The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements have been prepared to illustrate the estimated effects of\nthe merger and the related financing transactions. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as of September 30, 2016 is\nbased on the individual historical consolidated balance sheets of Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace, and has been prepared to reflect the\nmerger as if it occurred on September 30, 2016, which was the end of Rockwell Collins 2016 fiscal year. The unaudited pro forma\ncondensed combined statement of income for the year ended September 30, 2016 combines the historical results of operations of Rockwell\nCollins and B/E Aerospace, and has been prepared to reflect the merger as if it occurred on October 1, 2015, the first day of Rockwell\nCollins 2016 fiscal year.\n\n        Rockwell Collins operates on a 52/53 week fiscal year ending on the Friday closest to September 30. Fiscal year 2016 was a 52-week\nyear. For ease of presentation, September 30 is utilized consistently throughout these unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial\nstatements and notes to represent the fiscal year-end date. All date references contained herein relate to Rockwell Collins\' fiscal year\nunless otherwise stated. B/E Aerospace\'s fiscal year ends on December 31. As a result of Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace\'s different\nfiscal years:\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThe unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as of September 30, 2016 combines Rockwell Collins\'\nhistorical consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2016, which was the end of Rockwell Collins\' 2016 fiscal year,\nand B/E Aerospace\'s historical unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2016, which was the\nend of its third fiscal quarter; and \n\nThe unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of income for the year ended September 30, 2016 combines\nRockwell Collins\' historical results of operations for the year ended September 30, 2016, which was the end of Rockwell\nCollins\' 2016 fiscal year, and B/E Aerospace\'s historical unaudited results of operations for the 12 months ended\nSeptember 30, 2016, which have been derived from B/E Aerospace\'s condensed consolidated statement of operations for\nthe three months ended December 31, 2015 and from B/E Aerospace\'s condensed consolidated statement of operations for\nthe nine months ended September 30, 2016.\n\n        The historical consolidated financial information in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements has been\nadjusted to give effect to pro forma events that are (1) directly attributable to the merger, (2) factually supportable and (3) with respect to\nthe unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of income, expected to have a continuing impact on the combined results of\nRockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements do not give effect to any cost\nsavings, operating synergies or revenue synergies that may result from the merger or the costs to achieve any such cost savings, operating\nsynergies and revenue synergies, except for adjustments to reflect the net decrease in compensation expense related to certain B/E\nAerospace executives and B/E Aerospace Board members for whom employment terminates immediately upon change in control in\naccordance with existing employment arrangements.\n\n        The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements are for informational purposes only and are not necessarily\nindicative of what the actual financial results of Rockwell Collins would have been had the merger occurred on the dates or for the periods\nindicated, nor do they purport to project the financial results of Rockwell Collins for any future periods or as of any date. The unaudited\npro forma combined financial statements contain estimated adjustments, which are based on information available to management;\naccordingly, such adjustments are subject to change and the impact of such changes may be material. Although Rockwell Collins and\nB/E Aerospace have entered into the merger agreement, there is no guarantee that the merger will be completed on the terms set forth\ntherein or at all.\n\n173\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/861361/000104746917000512/a2230778zdefm14a.htm\n\n186/330\n\n\x0c8/28/2019\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/861361/000104746917000512/a2230778zdefm14a.htm\n\nTable

of Contents\n\nNOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\nNOTE 1: Description of the Transaction and Basis of Presentation \n\n        On October 23, 2016, Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace announced that the board of directors of both companies reached an\nagreement under which Rockwell Collins will acquire B/E Aerospace. Upon completion of the merger, each issued and outstanding share\nof B/E Aerospace common stock will be converted into the right to receive the $62.00 per share merger consideration, including $34.10 in\ncash and a number of Rockwell Collins shares equal to the exchange ratio, which depends on the Rockwell Collins stock price. If the\nRockwell Collins stock price is greater than or equal to $77.41 and less than or equal to $89.97 per share, the exchange ratio will be the\nquotient of $27.90 divided by the Rockwell Collins stock price. If the Rockwell Collins stock price is greater than $89.97, the exchange\nratio will be 0.3101. If the Rockwell Collins stock price is less than $77.41, the exchange ratio will be 0.3604. Accordingly, the actual\nnumber of shares and the value of Rockwell Collins common stock delivered to B/E Aerospace stockholders will depend on the Rockwell\nCollins stock price, and the value of the shares of Rockwell Collins common stock delivered for each such share of B/E Aerospace\ncommon stock may be greater than, less than or equal to $27.90. A 10% increase or decrease in the price of Rockwell Collins common\nstock from the closing price of Rockwell Collins common stock as of January 26, 2017 of $91.26 per share would increase the value of\nmerger consideration to be paid by approximately $283 million or decrease the value of merger consideration to be paid by approximately\n$40 million, respectively.\n\n        Rockwell Collins anticipates that approximately $3.560 billion will be required to pay the aggregate cash portion of the merger\nconsideration to the B/E Aerospace stockholders. Rockwell Collins expects to issue up to $4.35 billion in aggregate principal amount of its\nsenior unsecured notes in one or more public offerings and/or private placements and borrow up to $1.5 billion under a new senior\nunsecured syndicated term loan facility. Rockwell Collins has obtained a bridge loan commitment of $4.35 billion that would be funded\nonly to the extent some or all of the senior unsecured notes described above are not issued prior to the consummation of the acquisition.\nThere can be no assurance that Rockwell Collins will finance the merger in the manner and amount as anticipated.\n\n        The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements were prepared using the acquisition method of accounting in\naccordance with Accounting Standards Codification 805, Business Combinations, or ASC 805, which requires the determination of the\nacquirer, the acquisition date, the fair value of assets and liabilities of the acquiree and the measurement of goodwill. Rockwell Collins is\nconsidered to be the acquirer of B/E Aerospace for accounting purposes.\n\n        To prepare the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements, Rockwell Collins adjusted B/E Aerospace\'s assets and\nliabilities to their estimated fair values based on preliminary valuation work. As of the date of this joint proxy statement/ prospectus,\nRockwell Collins has not completed the detailed valuation work necessary to finalize the required estimated fair values of the B/E\nAerospace assets to be acquired and liabilities to be assumed and the related allocation of purchase price. The final allocation of the\npurchase price will be determined after the transaction is completed and after completion of an analysis to determine the estimated net fair\nvalue of B/E Aerospace\'s assets and liabilities. Accordingly, the final acquisition accounting adjustments may be materially different from\nthe unaudited pro forma adjustments. Also, as of the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, Rockwell Collins has not identified all\nadjustments necessary to conform B/E Aerospace\'s accounting policies to Rockwell Collins accounting policies. Rockwell Collins will\nconduct a final review of B/E Aerospace\'s accounting policies as of the date of the completion of the merger in an effort to determine if\ndifferences in accounting policies require adjustment or reclassification of B/E Aerospace\'s results of operations or reclassification of\nassets or liabilities to conform to Rockwell Collins\' accounting policies and classifications. As a result of this review, the final acquisition\naccounting adjustments may be materially different from the unaudited pro forma\n\n177\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/861361/000104746917000512/a2230778zdefm14a.htm\n\n190/330\n\n\x0c8/28/2019\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/861361/000104746917000512/a2230778zdefm14a.htm\n\nTable of Contents\n\nadjustments. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements do not give effect to any cost savings, operating synergies\nor revenue synergies that may result from the merger or the costs to achieve any such cost savings, operating synergies and revenue\nsynergies, except for adjustments to reflect the net decrease in compensation expense related to certain B/E Aerospace executives and\nB/E Aerospace Board members for whom employment terminates immediately upon change in control in accordance with existing\nemployment arrangements. There were no material transactions between Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace during the periods\npresented in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements that would need to be eliminated except as detailed in\nNote 3p below.\n\nNOTE 2: Preliminary Consideration Transferred and Preliminary Fair Value of Net Assets Acquired \n\n        The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet has been adjusted to reflect the estimated fair values of the\nB/E Aerospace identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The excess of consideration over these fair values is recorded to\ngoodwill. The preliminary unaudited pro forma purchase price allocation was based on discussions with B/E Aerospace\'s management,\nRockwell Collins historical experience, data that was available through the public domain, Rockwell Collins due diligence review of\nB/E Aerospace\'s business, and reviews of publicly disclosed allocations for other acquisitions in the industry. Until the merger is\ncompleted, Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace are limited in their ability to share information with each other. Upon completion of the\nmerger, additional valuation work will be performed and any increases or decreases in the fair value of assets acquired or liabilities\nassumed will result in adjustments to the balance sheet and/or statement of income until the purchase price allocation is finalized.

Revenue for the SFE contracts is recognized on percentage of completion (units of delivery) basis by\nB/E Aerospace but is expected to be recognized when realizable and earned, consistent with the guidance in Staff Accounting Bulletin 104\n(SAB 104), after the merger in order to conform with Rockwell Collins\' accounting policies. The transition from percentage of completion\nto SAB 104 revenue recognition for the SFE programs is not expected to have a material impact on the timing of revenue recognition\nrelated to those programs, but will have an impact on the timing of costs as reflected in Note 3r.\n\n        The adjustment reflects the elimination of $814 million of historical B/E Aerospace goodwill, offset by the addition of new goodwill\nresulting from the merger. The $6.146 billion of estimated merger-related goodwill is based on the preliminary estimates and information\nsummarized in Note 2.\n\n        The adjustment reflects the elimination of $221 million of historical B/E Aerospace intangible assets, offset by a preliminary fair\nvalue estimate of identifiable intangible assets acquired. The intangible assets to be acquired primarily consist of the following:\n\n(in millions, except estimated life)\nAcquired airline customer relationships\nAcquired OEM customer relationships\nAcquired developed technology\nPro forma adjustment, Intangible assets\n\nEstimated\nFair Value\n\n \n\n1,490 \n259 \n709 \n2,458 \n\n \n  $\n \n \n \n \n  $\n\nEstimated\nLife\n10 years\n13 years\n12 years\n \n\n        The net adjustment of $733 million, comprised of a $219 million reduction of deferred tax assets and a $514 million increase in\ndeferred tax liabilities, is primarily due to recording the deferred tax impact of the acquired intangibles which are not tax deductible and\nthe impact of the inventory adjustments related to the SFE contracts.\n\nf.\n\nDeferred income taxes\n\ng.\n\nOther assets\n\n        Adjustments reflect changes in capitalized debt issuance costs due to the following:\n\n(in millions)\nRockwell Collins new bridge loan funding fees\nRockwell Collins new revolving credit facility fees\nRockwell Collins new term loan fees\nElimination of Rockwell Collins costs related to existing revolving credit facility\nPro forma adjustment, Other assets\n\n \n\n  Amount\n  $\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  $\n\n22 \n2 \n2 \n(1)\n25 \n\n        See Note 3h for additional discussion of the related changes in short and long-term debt associated with the merger.\n\n182\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/861361/000104746917000512/a2230778zdefm14a.htm\n\n195/330\n\n\x0c8/28/2019\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/861361/000104746917000512/a2230778zdefm14a.htm\n\nTable of Contents\n\nh.\n\nShort-term debt and Long-term debt, net\n\n        Adjustments to Short-term debt and Long-term debt, net include the following:\n\n(in millions)\nRockwell Collins borrowings pursuant to bridge financing\nRockwell Collins borrowings pursuant to term loan facility\nRepayment of B/E Aerospace existing term loan facility\nElimination of unamortized issuance costs on repayment of B/E Aerospace\n\nexisting term loan facility\n\nTotal\nLess current portion of new term loan facility\nPro forma adjustment, Long-term debt, net\n\n \n\n  Amount\n  $\n \n \n \n \n\n4,350 \n1,500 \n(2,064)\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  $\n\n28 \n3,814 \n(150)\n3,664 \n\n        Rockwell Collins expects to fund the cash component of the acquisition consideration and refinance debt acquired with the\ntransaction by issuing up to $4.35 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes in one or more public offerings and/or\nprivate placements and borrowing up to $1.5 billion under a new senior unsecured syndicated term loan facility. Rockwell Collins has\nobtained a bridge loan commitment of $4.35 billion that would be drawn only to the extent some or all of the senior unsecured notes\ndescribed above are not issued prior to consummation of the acquisition. Rockwell Collins also plans to enter into an agreement to extend\nthe duration of its current five-year revolving credit facility by approximately three years and increase the amount available under the\nfacility to $1.5 billion from $1.2 billion currently available under its five-year and 364-day facilities. There can be no assurance that\nRockwell Collins will finance the merger in the manner and amounts as anticipated.\n\n        Rockwell Collins has assumed, for purposes of the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements, that it will borrow\n$4.35 billion under the bridge facility and $1.5 billion under a new term loan facility. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined\nbalance sheet as of September 30, 2016 has been adjusted to reflect the merger as if it occurred on September 30, 2016, and consequently,\nin connection with obtaining the committed debt financing on such date, approximately $28 million of financing costs were recorded in\nOther Assets on the unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet.\n\n        As noted above, Rockwell Collins anticipates that some or all of the bridge facility will be replaced prior to funding by the issuance\nof debt securities. Further, at or shortly after completion of the merger, Rockwell Collins expects to repay the outstanding $2.064 billion\nprincipal amount of B/E Aerospace\'s existing term loan facility, which includes $28 million unamortized issuance costs. Based on this\nanticipated debt financing and repayment of debt, Rockwell Collins estimates that the debt issuance costs (including underwriting fees and\nrelated expenses) related to the $4.35 billion senior unsecured notes, rather than the bridge facility, would increase from $22 million to\napproximately $40 million, and that the amortization, recorded as interest expense, would decrease from $22 million to approximately\n$4 million for the year ended September 30, 2016.

Shares of stock of the corporation surviving or resulting from such merger or consolidation, or depository\nreceipts in respect thereof;\n\n        b.     Shares of stock of any other corporation, or depository receipts in respect thereof, which shares of stock (or\ndepository receipts in respect thereof) or depository receipts at the effective date of the merger or consolidation will be\neither listed on a national securities exchange or held of record by more than 2,000 holders;\n\n        c.     Cash in lieu of fractional shares or fractional depository receipts described in the foregoing paragraphs (b)(2)a.\nand b. of this section; or\n\n        d.

If the certificate of\nincorporation contains such a provision, the provisions of this section, including those set forth in subsections (d), (e), and (g) of this\nsection, shall apply as nearly as is practicable.\n\n        (d)   Appraisal rights shall be perfected as follows:\n\n        (1)   If a proposed merger or consolidation for which appraisal rights are provided under this section is to be submitted for\napproval at a meeting of stockholders, the corporation, not less than 20 days prior to the meeting, shall notify each of its\nstockholders who was such on the record date for notice of such meeting (or such members who received notice in accordance\nwith \xc2\xa7 255(c) of this title) with respect to shares for which appraisal rights are available pursuant to subsection (b) or (c) of this\nsection that appraisal rights are available for any or all of the shares of the constituent corporations, and shall include in such notice\na copy of this section and, if 1 of the constituent corporations is a nonstock corporation, a copy of \xc2\xa7 114 of this title. Each\nstockholder electing to demand the appraisal of such stockholder\'s shares shall deliver to the corporation, before the taking of the\nvote on the merger or consolidation, a written demand for appraisal of such stockholder\'s shares. Such demand will be sufficient if\nit reasonably informs the corporation of the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to demand the\nappraisal of such stockholder\'s shares. A proxy or vote against the merger or consolidation shall not constitute such a demand. A\nstockholder electing to take such action must do so by a separate written demand as herein provided. Within 10 days after the\neffective date of such merger or consolidation, the surviving or resulting corporation shall notify each stockholder of each\nconstituent corporation who has complied with this subsection and has not voted in favor of or consented to the merger or\nconsolidation of the date that the merger or consolidation has become effective; or\n\n        (2)   If the merger or consolidation was approved pursuant to \xc2\xa7 228, \xc2\xa7 251(h), \xc2\xa7 253, or \xc2\xa7 267 of this title, then either a\nconstituent corporation before the effective date of the merger or consolidation or the surviving or resulting corporation within\n10 days thereafter shall notify each of the holders of any class or series of stock of such constituent corporation who are entitled to\nappraisal rights of the approval of the merger or consolidation and that appraisal rights are available for any or all shares of such\nclass or series of stock of such constituent corporation, and shall include in such notice a copy of this section and, if 1 of the\nconstituent corporations is a nonstock corporation, a copy of \xc2\xa7 114 of this title. Such notice may, and, if given on or after the\neffective date of the merger or consolidation, shall, also notify such stockholders of the effective date of the merger or\nconsolidation. Any stockholder entitled to appraisal rights may, within 20 days after the date of mailing of such notice or, in the\ncase of a merger approved pursuant to \xc2\xa7 251(h) of this title, within the later of the consummation of the offer contemplated by\n\xc2\xa7 251(h) of this title and 20 days after the date of mailing of such notice, demand in writing from the surviving or resulting\ncorporation the appraisal of such holder\'s shares. Such demand will be sufficient if it reasonably informs the corporation of the\nidentity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to demand the appraisal of such holder\'s shares.

An affidavit of the secretary or assistant secretary or of the transfer agent of the\ncorporation that is required to give either notice that such notice has been given shall, in the absence of fraud, be prima facie\nevidence of the facts stated therein. For purposes of determining the stockholders entitled to receive either notice, each constituent\ncorporation may fix, in advance, a record date that shall be not more than 10 days prior to the date the notice is given, provided,\nthat if the notice is given on or after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, the record date shall be such effective date. If\nno record date is fixed and the notice is given prior to the effective date, the record date shall be the close of business on the day\nnext preceding the day on which the notice is given.\n\n        (e)   Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, the surviving or resulting corporation or any stockholder\nwho has complied with subsections (a) and (d) of this section hereof and who is otherwise entitled to appraisal rights, may commence an\nappraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Court of Chancery demanding a determination of the value of the stock of all such\nstockholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, any\nstockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party shall have the right to withdraw\nsuch stockholder\'s demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the merger or consolidation. Within 120 days after the\neffective date of the merger or consolidation, any stockholder who has complied with the requirements of subsections (a) and (d) of this\nsection hereof, upon written request, shall be entitled to receive from the corporation surviving the merger or resulting from the\nconsolidation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the merger or consolidation and with respect to\nwhich demands for appraisal have been received and the aggregate number of holders of such shares. Such written statement shall be\nmailed to the stockholder within 10 days after such stockholder\'s written request for such a statement is received by the surviving or\nresulting corporation or within 10 days after expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal under subsection (d) of this\nsection hereof, whichever is later. Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, a person who is the beneficial owner of shares of such\nstock held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person may, in such person\'s own name, file a petition or request from\nthe corporation the statement described in this subsection.\n\n        (f)    Upon the filing of any such petition by a stockholder, service of a copy thereof shall be made upon the surviving or resulting\ncorporation, which shall within 20 days after such service file in the office of the Register in Chancery in which the petition was filed a\nduly verified list containing the names and addresses of all stockholders who have demanded payment for their shares and with whom\nagreements as to the value of their shares have not been reached by the surviving or resulting corporation. If the petition shall be filed by\nthe surviving or resulting corporation, the petition shall be accompanied by such a duly verified list. The Register in Chancery, if so\nordered by the Court, shall give notice of the time and place fixed for the hearing of such petition by registered or certified mail to the\nsurviving or resulting corporation and to the stockholders shown on the list at the addresses therein stated. Such notice shall also be given\nby 1 or more publications at least 1 week before the day of the hearing, in a newspaper of general circulation published in the City of\nWilmington, Delaware or such\n\nE-3\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/861361/000104746917000512/a2230778zdefm14a.htm\n\n326/330\n\n\x0c8/28/2019\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/861361/000104746917000512/a2230778zdefm14a.htm\n\nTable of Contents\n\npublication as the Court deems advisable. The forms of the notices by mail and by publication shall be approved by the Court, and the\ncosts thereof shall be borne by the surviving or resulting corporation.\n\n        (g)   At the hearing on such petition, the Court shall determine the stockholders who have complied with this section and who have\nbecome entitled to appraisal rights. The Court may require the stockholders who have demanded an appraisal for their shares and who hold\nstock represented by certificates to submit their certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the\nappraisal proceedings; and if any stockholder fails to comply with such direction, the Court may dismiss the proceedings as to such\nstockholder. If immediately before the merger or consolidation the shares of the class or series of stock of the constituent corporation as to\nwhich appraisal rights are available were listed on a national securities exchange, the Court shall dismiss the proceedings as to all holders\nof such shares who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless (1) the total number of shares entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the\noutstanding shares of the class or series eligible for appraisal, (2) the value of the consideration provided in the merger or consolidation for\nsuch total number of shares exceeds $1 million, or (3) the merger was approved pursuant to \xc2\xa7 253 or \xc2\xa7 267 of this title.\n\n        (h)   After the Court determines the stockholders entitled to an appraisal, the appraisal proceeding shall be conducted in accordance\nwith the rules of the Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings. Through such proceeding the\nCourt shall determine the fair value of the shares exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the\nmerger or consolidation, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. In determining such fair\nvalue, the Court shall take into account all relevant factors. Unless the Court in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown,\nand except as provided in this subsection, interest from the effective date of the merger through the date of payment of the judgment shall\nbe compounded quarterly and shall accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time\nto time during the period between the effective date of the merger and the date of payment of the judgment. At any time before the entry of\njudgment in the proceedings, the surviving corporation may pay to each stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which case\ninterest shall accrue thereafter as provided herein only upon the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair\nvalue of the shares as determined by the Court, and (2) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time. Upon application by the\nsurviving or resulting corporation or by any stockholder entitled to participate in the appraisal proceeding, the Court may, in its discretion,\nproceed to trial upon the appraisal prior to the final determination of the stockholders entitled to an appraisal. Any stockholder whose\nname appears on the list filed by the surviving or resulting corporation pursuant to subsection (f) of this section and who has submitted\nsuch stockholder\'s certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery, if such is required, may participate fully in all proceedings until it is\nfinally determined that such stockholder is not entitled to appraisal rights under this section.\n\n        (i)    The Court shall direct the payment of the fair value of the shares, together with interest, if any, by the surviving or resulting\ncorporation to the stockholders entitled thereto. Payment shall be so made to each such stockholder, in the case of holders of uncertificated\nstock forthwith, and the case of holders of shares represented by certificates upon the surrender to the corporation of the certificates\nrepresenting such stock. The Court\'s decree may be enforced as other decrees in the Court of Chancery may be enforced, whether such\nsurviving or resulting corporation be a corporation of this State or of any state.\n\n        (j)    The costs of the proceeding may be determined by the Court and taxed upon the parties as the Court deems equitable in the\ncircumstances. Upon application of a stockholder, the Court may order all or a portion of the expenses incurred by any stockholder in\nconnection with the appraisal proceeding, including, without limitation, reasonable attorney\'s fees and the fees and expenses of experts, to\nbe charged pro rata against the value of all the shares entitled to an appraisal.\n\nE-4\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/861361/000104746917000512/a2230778zdefm14a.htm\n\n327/330\n\n\x0c8/28/2019\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/861361/000104746917000512/a2230778zdefm14a.htm\n\nTable of Contents\n\n        (k)   From and after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, no stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights as provided\nin subsection (d) of this section shall be entitled to vote such stock for any purpose or to receive payment of dividends or other\ndistributions on the stock (except dividends or other distributions payable to stockholders of record at a date which is prior to the effective\ndate of the merger or consolidation); provided, however, that if no petition for an appraisal shall be filed within the time provided in\nsubsection (e) of this section, or if such stockholder shall deliver to the surviving or resulting corporation a written withdrawal of such\nstockholder\'s demand for an appraisal and an acceptance of the merger or consolidation, either within 60 days after the effective date of the\nmerger or consolidation as provided in subsection (e) of this section or thereafter with the written approval of the corporation, then the\nright of such stockholder to an appraisal shall cease. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no appraisal proceeding in the Court of Chancery\nshall be dismissed as to any stockholder without the approval of the Court, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the\nCourt deems just; provided, however that this provision shall not affect the right of any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal\nproceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such stockholder\'s demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered\nupon the merger or consolidation within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, as set forth in subsection (e) of this\nsection.\n\n        (l)    The shares of the surviving or resulting corporation to which the shares of such objecting stockholders would have been\nconverted had they assented to the merger or consolidation shall have the status of authorized and unissued shares of the surviving or\nresulting corporation.\n\nE-5\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/861361/000104746917000512/a2230778zdefm14a.htm\n\n328/330\n\n\x0c8/28/2019\n\n \n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/861361/000104746917000512/a2230778zdefm14a.htm\n\n.
