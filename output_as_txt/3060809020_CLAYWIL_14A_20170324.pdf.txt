March 23, 2017
PROPOSED MERGER—YOUR VOTE IS VERY IMPORTANT

Dear Stockholders:

Each of the boards of directors of Noble Energy, Inc. (“Noble”) and Clayton Williams Energy, Inc. (“CWEI”) has unanimously approved a transaction
for the combination of Noble and CWEI, as described below (the “merger”). CWEI is sending you this proxy statement/prospectus to invite you to attend a
special meeting of CWEI stockholders being held to vote on the merger (the “CWEI special meeting”) and to ask you to vote at the CWEI special meeting
in favor of adopting the agreement and plan of merger.

Noble and CWEI entered into an agreement and plan of merger on January 13, 2017 (as it may be amended from time to time, the “merger
agreement”) pursuant to which, subject to CWEI stockholder approval and certain other customary closing conditions, Noble and CWEI will combine their
businesses through the merger of CWEI with a newly formed, indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of Noble, with CWEI thereupon becoming an indirect,
wholly owned subsidiary of Noble and, after completion of the merger, but as part of the same transaction, the merger of CWEI with an indirect, wholly
owned subsidiary of Noble, with such subsidiary continuing as the surviving entity.

If the merger is completed, at the effective time of the merger (the “effective time”), each share of common stock, par value $0.10 per share, of CWEI
(each, a “CWEI common share”) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time (other than CWEI common shares held in treasury and
CWEI common shares held by stockholders who properly comply in all respects with the provisions of Section 262 of the General Corporation Law of the
State of Delaware (the “DGCL”) as to appraisal rights) and each unexercised warrant to purchase or otherwise acquire CWEI common shares (each, a
“CWEI warrant”) issued and outstanding as of the effective time, will be cancelled and extinguished and automatically converted into the right to receive,
at the election of the stockholder or warrant holder, as applicable, but subject to proration as described below, one of the following forms of consideration
(the “merger consideration”):

•for each CWEI common share, one of (i) 3.7222 (the “share-election exchange ratio”) shares, par value $0.01, of common stock of Noble (each, a “Noble
common share,” and such consideration, the “share-election consideration”); (ii)(A) $34.75 in cash (subject to applicable withholding tax), without
interest and (B) 2.7874 (the “mixed-election exchange ratio”) Noble common shares (the “mixed-election consideration”); or (iii) $138.39 in cash
(subject to applicable withholding tax), without interest (the “cash-election consideration”); and

•for each CWEI warrant, either (i) the share-election consideration in respect of the number of CWEI common shares that would be issued upon a cashless
exercise of such CWEI warrant immediately prior to the effective time (“warrant notional common shares”); (ii) the mixed-election consideration in
respect of the number of warrant notional common shares represented by such CWEI warrant; or (iii) the cash-election consideration in respect of the
number of warrant notional common shares represented by such CWEI warrant.

The merger consideration is subject to proration so that the aggregate merger consideration paid in respect of all CWEI common shares and CWEI
warrants consists of 75% Noble common shares and 25% cash, based on the closing sale price for the Noble common shares on January 12, 2017. No
fractional Noble common shares will be issued in the merger, and holders of CWEI common shares and CWEI warrants will, instead, receive cash in lieu of
fractional Noble common shares, if any. The merger consideration will also be adjusted appropriately to fully reflect the effect of any subdivisions,
reclassifications, splits, share distributions, combinations or exchanges of CWEI common shares or Noble common shares.

At the effective time, each share of preferred stock, par value $0.10 per share, of CWEI (each, a “CWEI preferred share”) issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the effective time will be converted into the right to receive cash in an amount equal to $1.00 (subject to applicable withholding tax),
without interest.

Upon completion of the merger, CWEI’s former stockholders will own approximately 11% of the then outstanding Noble common shares, based on
the number of shares, warrants and equity awards of Noble and CWEI outstanding on March 22, 2017. The value of the merger consideration (except for
the cash-election consideration and the cash portion of the mixed-election consideration) to be received in exchange for each CWEI common share will
fluctuate with the market value of the Noble common shares until the merger is completed.

Based on the closing sale price for the Noble common shares on January 13, 2017, the last trading day before public announcement of the merger, the
share-election consideration represented approximately $139.17 in value for each CWEI common share and the mixed-election consideration represented
approximately $138.97 in value for each CWEI common share.

Noble common shares are listed on the New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”) under the symbol “NBL.” CWEI common shares are listed on the
NYSE under the symbol “CWEI.” We urge you to obtain current market quotations for the shares of common stock of Noble and CWEI.

Your vote is very important regardless of the number of CWEI common shares you own. The merger cannot be completed unless CWEI
stockholders adopt the merger agreement at the CWEI special meeting. Information about this meeting, the merger and the other business to be
considered by CWEI stockholders at the CWEI special meeting is contained in this proxy statement/prospectus. We urge you to read this proxy
statement/prospectus carefully. You should also carefully consider the risks that are described in the “Risk Factors” section beginning on page 16.

Whether or not you plan to attend the CWEI special meeting, please submit your proxy as soon as possible to make sure that your shares are
represented at that meeting.

The CWEI board of directors recommends that CWEI stockholders vote “FOR” the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, which is
necessary to complete the merger.

Clayton W. Williams, Jr.
Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer
Clayton Williams Energy, Inc.

Neither the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) nor any state securities commission has approved or disapproved of the
merger or the other transactions described in this proxy statement/prospectus or the securities to be issued in connection with the merger or
determined if this proxy statement/prospectus is accurate or complete. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense.

This proxy statement/prospectus is dated March 23, 2017, and is first being mailed to stockholders of CWEI on or about March 27, 2017.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE CWEI SPECIAL MEETING

The following questions and answers briefly address some commonly asked questions about the CWEI special meeting. They
may not include all the information that is important to CWEI stockholders. CWEI stockholders should carefully read this entire
proxy statement/prospectus, including the annexes and the other documents referred to herein.

Q: Why am I receiving this proxy statement/prospectus?

A: Noble and CWEI have agreed to a merger, pursuant to which CWEI will become an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of
Noble, as more fully described below. CWEI is sending this proxy statement/prospectus to its stockholders to help them decide
how to vote their CWEI common shares with respect to the merger and other matters to be considered at the CWEI special
meeting.

The merger cannot be completed unless CWEI stockholders adopt the merger agreement. Information about the CWEI special
meeting, the merger and the other business to be considered by stockholders at the CWEI special meeting is contained in this
proxy statement/prospectus.

This document constitutes both a proxy statement of CWEI and a prospectus of Noble. It is a proxy statement because the
board of directors of CWEI (the “CWEI board”) is soliciting proxies from its stockholders. It is a prospectus because Noble
will issue shares of its common stock in exchange for outstanding CWEI common shares in the merger.

Q: What will happen in the merger?

A: Under the merger agreement, at the effective time, Wild West Merger Sub Inc. (“Merger Sub”), an indirect, wholly owned
subsidiary of Noble, will merge with and into CWEI in the merger, with CWEI continuing as the surviving entity and an
indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of Noble (such entity sometimes referred to herein as the “surviving corporation”). After
completion of the merger, but as part of the same plan as the merger, CWEI, as the surviving corporation in the merger, will
merge with and into its parent, NBL Permian LLC (“NBL Permian”), with NBL Permian continuing as the surviving entity and
an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of Noble (such entity sometimes referred to herein as the “surviving company”), in a
transaction that is referred to as the “second merger.”

Q: What will I receive in the merger?

A: Upon completion of the merger, each CWEI common share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time
(other than CWEI common shares held in treasury and CWEI common shares held by stockholders who properly comply in all
respects with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL as to appraisal rights) will be cancelled and extinguished and
automatically converted into the right to receive, at the election of the stockholder, but subject to proration as described below,
one of (i) 3.7222 Noble common shares (such election, a “share election”); (ii)(A) $34.75 in cash (subject to applicable
withholding tax), without interest and (B) 2.7874 Noble common shares (such election, a “mixed election”); or (iii) $138.39 in
cash (subject to applicable withholding tax), without interest (such election, a “cash election”).

The merger consideration is subject to proration so that the aggregate merger consideration paid in respect of all CWEI
common shares and CWEI warrants consists of 75% Noble common shares and 25% cash, based on the closing sale price for
the Noble common shares on January 12, 2017. You may elect to receive the share-election consideration, the mixed-election
consideration, or the cash-election consideration. However, the ability to receive the merger consideration of your choice will
depend on the elections of other CWEI stockholders and CWEI warrant holders. The proration of the merger consideration
payable to CWEI stockholders and CWEI warrant holders in the merger will not be known until Noble tallies the results of the
elections made by CWEI stockholders and CWEI warrant holders, which will not occur until near or after the closing of the
merger.

No fractional Noble common shares will be issued in the merger, and holders of CWEI common shares and CWEI warrants
will, instead, receive cash in lieu of fractional Noble common shares, if any. The merger consideration will also be adjusted
appropriately to fully reflect the effect of any subdivisions, reclassifications, splits, share distributions, combinations or
exchanges of CWEI common shares or Noble common shares.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Q: What will holders of CWEI equity awards receive in the merger?

A: Stock Options. Each option to purchase CWEI common shares (each, a “CWEI option”) that is outstanding immediately prior
to the effective time will vest and be exchanged for the number of Noble common shares, rounded down to the nearest whole
share, equal to the quotient of (i) the product of (A) the number of CWEI common shares subject to the CWEI option,
multiplied by (B) the amount, if any, by which the per share closing trading price of CWEI common shares on the business day
immediately before the effective time exceeds the exercise price per CWEI common share otherwise purchasable pursuant to
the CWEI option immediately prior to the effective time, divided by (ii) the average of the closing sale prices of a Noble
common share as reported on the NYSE for the ten consecutive full trading days, ending at the close of trading on the full
trading day immediately preceding the date on which the effective time occurs. If such calculation results in zero or a negative
number, the applicable CWEI option shall be forfeited for no consideration.

Restricted Shares. At the effective time, the restricted CWEI common shares (each, a “CWEI restricted share”) outstanding
immediately prior to the effective time will be converted into a number of restricted Noble common shares equal to the number
of CWEI restricted shares multiplied by the share-election exchange ratio of 3.7222, rounded up to the nearest whole share, and
subject to the same vesting, repurchase and other restrictions as the CWEI restricted shares.

Q: What will holders of CWEI warrants receive in the merger?

A: Upon completion of the merger, each unexercised CWEI warrant issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time
will be cancelled and extinguished and automatically converted into the right to receive, at the election of the warrant holder,
but subject to proration as described below, either (i) 3.7222 Noble common shares in respect of the number of warrant notional
common shares (the number of CWEI common shares that would be issued upon a cashless exercise of such CWEI warrant
immediately prior to the effective time) represented by such CWEI warrant; (ii)(A) $34.75 in cash (subject to applicable
withholding tax), without interest and (B) 2.7874 Noble common shares in respect of the number of warrant notional common
shares represented by such CWEI warrant; or (iii) $138.39 in cash (subject to applicable withholding tax), without interest, in
respect of the number of warrant notional common shares represented by such CWEI warrant.

The merger consideration is subject to proration so that the aggregate merger consideration paid in respect of all CWEI
common shares and CWEI warrants consists of 75% Noble common shares and 25% cash, based on the closing sale price for
the Noble common shares on January 12, 2017. No fractional Noble common shares will be issued in the merger, and holders
of CWEI warrants will, instead, receive cash in lieu of fractional Noble common shares, if any. The merger consideration will
also be adjusted appropriately to fully reflect the effect of any subdivisions, reclassifications, splits, share distributions,
combinations or exchanges of CWEI common shares or Noble common shares.

Q: What will holders of CWEI preferred shares receive in the merger?

A: Upon completion of the merger, each CWEI preferred share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time will
be converted into the right to receive cash in an amount equal to $1.00 (subject to applicable withholding tax), without interest.

Q: Will I receive the form of merger consideration that I elect?

A: Even if you make a valid election, you may not receive the exact form of merger consideration that you elect. If you make no
valid election with respect to your CWEI common shares (and do not exercise appraisal rights), you will receive such merger
consideration as is determined in accordance with the proration provisions of the merger agreement.

The merger consideration is subject to proration so that the aggregate merger consideration paid in respect of all CWEI
common shares and CWEI warrants consists of 75% Noble common shares and 25% cash, based on the closing sale price for
the Noble common shares on January 12, 2017. The ability to receive the merger consideration of your choice will depend on
the elections of other CWEI stockholders and CWEI warrant holders. You may not receive the form of merger consideration
that you elect in the merger, and you may instead receive a pro-rata amount of cash, Noble common shares or both.

The greater the oversubscription of the share-election consideration, if any, the fewer Noble common shares and more cash a
CWEI stockholder or CWEI warrant holder making the share election will receive. Reciprocally,

TABLE OF CONTENTS

the greater the oversubscription of the cash-election consideration, if any, the less cash and more Noble common shares a
CWEI stockholder or CWEI warrant holder making the cash election will receive. The proration of the merger consideration
payable to CWEI stockholders and CWEI warrant holders in the merger will not be known until Noble tallies the results of the
elections made by CWEI stockholders and CWEI warrant holders, which will not occur until near or after the closing of the
merger. See “The Merger Agreement—Proration Procedures” beginning on page 60.

Q: When do Noble and CWEI expect to complete the merger?

A: Noble and CWEI are working to complete the merger as soon as practicable. If CWEI stockholders approve the merger
proposal, we currently expect that the merger will be completed by April 25, 2017. Neither Noble nor CWEI can predict,
however, the actual date on which the merger will be completed because it is subject to conditions beyond each company’s
control, including the approval of the merger proposal by CWEI stockholders. See “The Merger Agreement—Conditions to
Completion of the Merger” beginning on page 63.

Q: What happens if the merger is not completed?

A: If the merger proposal is not approved by CWEI stockholders or if the merger is not completed for any other reason, you will
not receive any form of consideration for your CWEI common shares in connection with the merger. Instead, CWEI will
remain an independent publicly traded corporation and its common stock will continue to be listed and traded on the NYSE. If
the merger agreement is terminated under specified circumstances, including in certain circumstances in connection with an
alternative proposal, or if there is a change in recommendation by the CWEI board, CWEI will be required to pay Noble a
termination fee in the amount of $87 million. Following payment of the termination fee, CWEI will not have any further
liability to Noble in respect of the merger agreement (other than liability for any willful breach or fraud). See “The Merger
Agreement—Effect of Termination; Termination Fees” beginning on page 75.

Q: What am I being asked to vote on and why is this approval necessary?

A: CWEI stockholders are being asked to vote on the following proposals:

1. Merger Proposal: To consider and vote on a proposal to adopt the merger agreement, a copy of which is attached as
Annex A to this proxy statement/prospectus;

2. Adjournment Proposal: To consider and vote on a proposal to approve the adjournment of the CWEI special meeting, if
necessary to solicit additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes to approve the merger proposal at the time of the
CWEI special meeting; and

3. Advisory Compensation Proposal: To consider and vote on a proposal to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the
payments that will or may be paid to CWEI’s named executive officers in connection with the merger.

Approval of the merger proposal is required for completion of the merger. Neither the adjournment proposal nor the advisory
compensation proposal is a condition to the obligations of Noble or CWEI to complete the merger.

Q: What vote is required to approve each proposal at the CWEI Special Meeting?

A: The following vote is needed for each proposal:

1. Merger Proposal: The affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the outstanding CWEI common shares entitled to vote
on the merger proposal.

2. Adjournment Proposal: The affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the CWEI common shares represented at the
CWEI special meeting (in person or by proxy) and entitled to vote on the adjournment proposal.

3. Advisory Compensation Proposal: The affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the CWEI common shares represented
at the CWEI special meeting (in person or by proxy) and entitled to vote on the advisory compensation proposal.

Q: Are there any stockholders already committed to voting in favor of the merger agreement?

A: Yes. Certain CWEI stockholders affiliated with Ares Management LLC (collectively with its affiliates, “Ares Management,”
and such stockholders, the “Ares stockholders”) entered into a support agreement (the “support agreement”), pursuant to which
the Ares stockholders agreed, among other things, not to exercise or assert any appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL
in connection with the merger. The Ares stockholders have also agreed, among other things, during the period from January 13,
2017 to and including the date of termination of the merger agreement, if any, to vote all of the CWEI common shares and, if
applicable, the CWEI preferred shares, they beneficially own as of the record date of the CWEI special meeting in favor of the
merger proposal. See “The Merger—Share Ownership of Certain Stockholders; Support and Non-Dissent Agreements—
Support Agreement” beginning on page 47.

In addition, Clayton W. Williams, Jr. and The Williams Children’s Partnership Ltd., each a stockholder of CWEI (together, the
“non-dissenting parties”), entered into agreements (the “non-dissent agreements”), pursuant to which the non-dissenting parties
agreed, among other things, not to exercise or assert any appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL in connection with
the merger. The non-dissenting parties have also agreed, among other things, during the period from January 13, 2017 to and
including the date of termination of the merger agreement, if any, to vote all of the CWEI common shares they beneficially
own as of the record date of the CWEI special meeting against any alternative proposal and against any amendment of CWEI’s
certificate of incorporation or by-laws or other proposal or transaction involving CWEI or any of its subsidiaries, which
amendment or other proposal or transaction would in any manner delay, impede, frustrate, prevent or nullify the merger, the
merger agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement or change in any manner the voting rights
of any outstanding class of capital stock of CWEI. See “The Merger—Share Ownership of Certain Stockholders; Support and
Non-Dissent Agreements—Non-Dissent Agreements” beginning on page 48.

Q: What constitutes a quorum?

A: A quorum requires the holders of a majority of the CWEI common shares issued and outstanding and entitled to vote,
represented in person or by proxy. Any abstentions will be treated as present for the purposes of determining whether a quorum
exists at the CWEI special meeting. Any broker non-votes will not be treated as present for the purposes of determining
whether a quorum exists.

Q: How does the CWEI board recommend that I vote?

A: The CWEI board recommends that CWEI stockholders vote “FOR” the merger proposal, “FOR” the adjournment proposal, if
necessary to solicit additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes to approve the merger proposal at the time of the CWEI
special meeting, and “FOR” the advisory compensation proposal.

Q: What do I need to do now?

A: After carefully reading and considering the information contained in this proxy statement/prospectus, please submit a proxy or
voting instructions for your shares by following the instructions set forth on the proxy card or on the voting instruction form
provided by the record holder if your shares are held in the name of your broker, bank or other nominee.

Q: How do I vote?

A: If you are a stockholder of record of CWEI as of the record date (March 23, 2017), you may vote by proxy before the CWEI
special meeting in one of the following ways:

• By Telephone: By dialing the toll-free number specified on the proxy card and following the instructions on the proxy
card;

TABLE OF CONTENTS

• Via the Internet: By accessing the website specified on the proxy card and following the instructions on the proxy card;
or

• By Mail: By completing and returning the proxy card in the enclosed envelope. The envelope requires no additional
postage if mailed in the United States.

You may also cast your vote in person at the CWEI special meeting.

If your shares are held in “street name” through a broker or other nominee, that institution will send you separate instructions
describing the procedure that you must follow in order to have your shares voted.

Q: When and where is the CWEI special meeting of stockholders?

A: The CWEI special meeting will be held at ClayDesta Conference Center, 6 Desta Drive, Suite 6550, Midland, Texas 79705 on
April 24, 2017. Subject to space availability, all CWEI stockholders as of the record date, or their duly appointed proxies, may
attend the meeting. Since seating is limited, admission to the meeting will be on a first-come, first-served basis. Registration
and seating will begin at 9:30 a.m., Central time on the day of the CWEI special meeting.

Q: If my shares are held in “street name” by a broker, bank or other nominee, will my broker, bank or other nominee vote
my shares for me?

A: No. If your shares are held in “street name” in a stock brokerage account or by a bank or other nominee, you must provide the
record holder of your shares with instructions on how to vote your shares. Please follow the voting instructions provided by
your broker, bank or other nominee. Please note that you may not vote shares held in street name by returning a proxy card
directly to CWEI or by voting in person at the CWEI special meeting unless you provide a “legal proxy,” which you must
obtain from your broker, bank or other nominee.

If you do not provide voting instructions to your broker, bank or other nominee, your shares will not be voted on any proposal
on which your broker or other nominee does not have discretionary authority to vote. This is referred to in this proxy
statement/prospectus and in general as a broker non-vote. In these cases, the broker or other nominee cannot register your
shares as being present at the CWEI special meeting for purposes of determining a quorum, and will not be able to vote your
shares on those matters for which specific authorization is required. Under the current NYSE rules, brokers do not have
discretionary authority to vote on any of the proposals, including the merger proposal. As a result, a broker non-vote of a
CWEI common share will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the merger proposal. Broker non-votes will not be
considered entitled to vote on the adjournment proposal or the advisory compensation proposal, and will have no effect on the
outcome of the vote on those proposals (assuming in the case of the advisory compensation proposal that a quorum is present).

Q: What if I do not vote or abstain?

A: For purposes of the CWEI special meeting, an abstention occurs when a stockholder attends the CWEI special meeting in
person and does not vote or returns a proxy with an “abstain” vote. If you fail to vote, or if you respond with an “abstain” vote
on the merger proposal, your proxy will have the same effect as a vote cast “AGAINST” the merger proposal. If you attend the
CWEI special meeting and fail to vote, or if you respond with an “abstain” vote on the adjournment proposal or the advisory
compensation proposal, your proxy will have the same effect as a vote cast “AGAINST” that proposal.

If you fail to instruct your broker, bank or other nominee how to vote on the merger proposal, it will have the same effect as a
vote “AGAINST” the merger proposal. If you fail to instruct your broker, bank or other nominee how to vote on the
adjournment proposal or the advisory compensation proposal, it will have no effect on the outcome of the vote on that proposal
(assuming in the case of the advisory compensation proposal that a quorum is present).

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Q: What will happen if I return my proxy or voting instruction card without indicating how to vote?

A: If you sign and return your proxy or voting instruction card without indicating how to vote on any particular proposal, the
CWEI common shares represented by your proxy will be voted as recommended by the CWEI board with respect to that
proposal. Unless a CWEI stockholder checks the box on its proxy card to withhold discretionary authority, the proxyholders
may use their discretion to vote on other matters relating to the CWEI special meeting.

The CWEI board recommends that CWEI stockholders vote “FOR” the merger proposal, “FOR” the adjournment proposal, if
necessary to solicit additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes to approve the merger proposal at the time of the CWEI
special meeting, and “FOR” the advisory compensation proposal.

Q: May I revoke my proxy or change my vote after I have delivered my proxy or voting instruction card?

A: Yes. You may revoke your proxy and/or change your voting instructions at any time before your CWEI common shares are
voted at the CWEI special meeting. You may do this by:

• sending a written notice, which is received prior to your vote being cast at the CWEI special meeting, to Clayton Williams
Energy, Inc., 6 Desta Drive, Suite 6500, Midland, Texas 79705, Attention: Secretary, that bears a date later than the date of
the proxy and states that you revoke your proxy;

• submitting a valid, later-dated proxy by mail, telephone or via the internet that is received prior to your vote being cast at
the CWEI special meeting; or

• attending the CWEI special meeting and voting by ballot in person (your attendance at the CWEI special meeting will not,
by itself, revoke any proxy that you have previously given).

If you hold your CWEI common shares through a broker, bank or other nominee, you must follow the directions you receive
from your broker, bank or other nominee in order to revoke your proxy or change your voting instructions.

Q: What does it mean if I receive more than one proxy card or vote instruction card?

A: Your receipt of more than one proxy card or vote instruction card may mean that you have multiple accounts with CWEI’s
transfer agent or with a broker, bank or other nominee. If voting by proxy by mail, you will need to sign and return all proxy
cards or vote instruction cards to ensure that all of your CWEI common shares are voted. Each proxy card or vote instruction
card represents a distinct number of CWEI common shares and it is the only means by which those particular CWEI common
shares may be voted by proxy.

Q: How do I make an election as to the form of merger consideration I wish to receive in the merger?

A: At the time of mailing of this proxy statement/prospectus, each record holder of CWEI common shares is also separately being
sent an election form and letter of transmittal (an “election form”). The election form contains instructions for making a
selection of merger consideration and for surrendering your CWEI common shares in exchange for the merger consideration.
Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (the “exchange agent”), the exchange agent for the merger, must receive your properly completed and
signed election form and your stock certificates or book-entry shares, or an appropriate and customary guarantee of delivery
thereof, and any additional documents specified in the election form, by no later than the election deadline in order for your
choice as to the form of merger consideration to be considered with those timely made by the other CWEI stockholders and
CWEI warrant holders. Noble and CWEI currently anticipate that the “election deadline” will be 5:00 p.m. Central time
on April 24, 2017. Noble and CWEI will issue a joint press release announcing the anticipated date of the election deadline not
more than 15 business days before, and at least five business days prior to, the anticipated date of the election deadline. Noble
and CWEI will also issue a joint press release if the election deadline changes. See “The Merger Agreement—Election
Procedures” beginning on page 58.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Q: What happens if I don’t make a valid election as to the form of merger consideration before the election deadline?

A: If you do not make a valid election as to the form of merger consideration before the election deadline, you will receive such
merger consideration as is determined in accordance with the proration provisions of the merger agreement. If the merger is
completed, the exchange agent will send any CWEI stockholder who does not make a valid election a new letter of transmittal
that such stockholder can use to surrender its CWEI common shares in exchange for the merger consideration.

Q: Can I change my election as to the form of merger consideration?

A: Yes. You can change your election as to the form of merger consideration by submitting a properly completed and signed
revised election form. For a change of election to be effective, the exchange agent must receive your signed revised election
form before the election deadline. See “The Merger Agreement—Election Procedures” beginning on page 58.

Q: Should CWEI stockholders send in their stock certificates with the enclosed proxy?

A: No. CWEI stockholders should not send in any stock certificates with the enclosed proxy. At the time of mailing of this proxy
statement/prospectus, each record holder of CWEI common shares is also separately being sent an election form. The election
form contains instructions for surrendering your CWEI common shares to the exchange agent in exchange for the merger
consideration. For information regarding delivery of your stock certificates, if any, see “The Merger Agreement—Exchange
and Payment Procedures” and “The Merger Agreement—Election Procedures” beginning on pages 57 and 58, respectively.

Q: What happens if I sell my CWEI common shares after the record date but before the CWEI special meeting?

A: The record date for the CWEI special meeting is earlier than the date of the CWEI special meeting and earlier than the date on
which the merger is expected to be completed. If you sell or otherwise transfer your CWEI common shares after the record date
but before the date of the CWEI special meeting, you will retain your right to vote at the CWEI special meeting. However, you
will not have the right to receive the merger consideration to be received by CWEI stockholders in the merger. In order to
receive the merger consideration, you must hold your CWEI common shares through completion of the merger.

Q: What are the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger?

A: The merger and the second merger, considered together, are intended to constitute a single integrated transaction that qualifies
as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”).
The holders of CWEI common shares are not expected to recognize any gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes on
the exchange of CWEI common shares for Noble common shares in the merger, except that such holders will recognize gain
(but not loss) to the extent such holders receive cash. The holders of CWEI common shares that receive the entirety of their
merger consideration in the form of cash, however, are expected to recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between the
amount of cash received and the basis in the CWEI common shares exchanged. The obligations of Noble and CWEI to
complete the merger are subject to, among other conditions described in this proxy statement/prospectus, the receipt by each of
Noble and CWEI of an opinion of counsel to the effect that the merger and the second merger, considered together, will qualify
as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

You should read “U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences” beginning on page 53 for a more complete discussion of the United
States federal income tax consequences of the merger. Tax matters can be complicated and the tax consequences of the merger
to you will depend on your particular tax situation. You should consult your tax advisor to determine the tax consequences
of the merger to you.

Q: Do I have appraisal rights in connection with the merger?

A: Yes. As a holder of CWEI common shares, you are entitled to seek appraisal or dissenters’ rights under the DGCL in
connection with the merger if you (i) do not vote in favor of the merger proposal and (ii) comply with the other statutory
requirements for demanding appraisal. Failure to follow precisely any of the statutory requirements could result in the loss of
your appraisal rights.

Q: Whom should I contact if I have any questions about the proxy materials or voting?

Information About Noble (See Page 77)

Noble is a leading independent crude oil and natural gas exploration and production company with a diversified high-quality
portfolio spanning three continents and consisting of both U.S. unconventional and global offshore conventional assets. Founded
in 1932, Noble is a Delaware corporation, incorporated in 1969, and has been publicly traded on the NYSE since 1980. Noble has
a unique history of growth, evolving from a regional crude oil and natural gas producer to a global exploration and production
company included in the Standard & Poor’s 500.

Noble’s purpose, Energizing the World, Bettering People’s Lives®, reflects its commitment to find and deliver energy
through crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquid (“NGL”) exploration and production while living its commitment to
contribute to the betterment of people’s lives in the communities in which it operates. Noble strives to build trust through
stakeholder engagement, act on its values, provide a safe work environment, respect its environment and care for its employees
and the communities where it operates.

Noble’s portfolio of assets is diversified through U.S. and international projects and a production mix among crude oil,
natural gas, and NGLs. In particular, Noble’s business is focused on both U.S. unconventional basins and certain global
conventional basins. Noble endeavors to maintain a high-quality, growth-oriented portfolio of assets that are well-positioned on
the global industry cost supply curve. In addition, Noble’s asset portfolio offers operational and investment flexibility.

In U.S. unconventional basins, Noble has demonstrated competence in applying geological capabilities, drilling and
completion expertise and midstream synergies to deliver incremental value. In onshore U.S., Noble typically applies a major
project development concept to a U.S. unconventional basin by utilizing an integrated development plan approach. In the global
offshore, Noble has had notable exploration successes over the past decade, which have led to Noble’s entry into new
conventional offshore basins. Noble has executed several major offshore development projects both on schedule and within
budget which have provided long-lived cash flows to its business.

Approximately 75% of Noble’s capital program is allocated to U.S. onshore development, primarily focused on liquids-rich
opportunities in the DJ Basin, Delaware Basin and Eagle Ford Shale. Eastern Mediterranean capital expenditures, including
initial development costs associated with the Leviathan project, represent over 20% of the total. As Noble manages its asset
portfolio, it will consider expanding the portfolio to include additional long-term and/or large-scale exploration opportunities.

In addition, the majority of Noble’s assets are held by production, which provides for further investment and financial
flexibility. Occasional strategic acquisitions of producing or non-producing properties, combined with the periodic divestment of
assets, have allowed Noble to pursue its objective of a well-diversified, growing portfolio delivering attractive financial returns.

Noble manages its operations by region. Its segments, each of which is primarily in the business of crude oil, natural gas and
NGL exploration, development, production and acquisition, include:

• United States, including the DJ Basin, Permian Basin, Eagle Ford Shale, Marcellus Shale, and deepwater Gulf of
Mexico, as well as the consolidated accounts of Noble Midstream Partners LP (“Noble Midstream”), which completed
its initial public offering of common units in 2016;

• Eastern Mediterranean, including offshore Israel and Cyprus;

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Consideration to be Received in the Merger by CWEI Stockholders (See Page 56)

If the merger is completed, at the effective time, each CWEI common share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
effective time (other than CWEI common shares held in treasury and CWEI common shares held by stockholders who properly
comply in all respects with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL as to appraisal rights) and each CWEI warrant issued and
outstanding as of the effective time, will be cancelled and extinguished and automatically converted into the right to receive, at
the election of the stockholder or warrant holder, as applicable, but subject to proration as described below, one of the following
forms of merger consideration:

• for each CWEI common share, one of (i) 3.7222 Noble common shares; (ii)(A) $34.75 in cash (subject to applicable
withholding tax), without interest and (B) 2.7874 Noble common shares; or (iii) $138.39 in cash (subject to applicable
withholding tax), without interest; and

• for each CWEI warrant, either (i) the share-election consideration in respect of the number of warrant notional common
shares (the number of CWEI common shares that would be issued upon a cashless exercise of such CWEI warrant
immediately prior to the effective time) represented by such CWEI warrant; (ii) the mixed-election consideration in
respect of the number of warrant notional common shares represented by such CWEI warrant; or (iii) the cash-election
consideration in respect of the number of warrant notional common shares represented by such CWEI warrant.

The merger consideration is subject to proration so that the aggregate merger consideration paid in respect of all CWEI
common shares and CWEI warrants consists of 75% Noble common shares and 25% cash, based on the closing sale price for the
Noble common shares on January 12, 2017. No fractional Noble common shares will be issued in the merger, and holders of
CWEI common shares and CWEI warrants will, instead, receive cash in lieu of fractional Noble common shares, if any. The
merger consideration will also be adjusted appropriately to fully reflect the effect of any subdivisions, reclassifications, splits,
share distributions, combinations or exchanges of CWEI common shares or Noble common shares. For a more complete
description of the merger consideration, see “The Merger Agreement—Terms of the Merger” beginning on page 56.

At the effective time, each CWEI preferred share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time will be
converted into the right to receive cash in an amount equal to $1.00 (subject to applicable withholding tax), without interest.

Election Procedures (See Page 58)

At the time of mailing of this proxy statement/prospectus, each record holder of CWEI common shares is also separately
being sent an election form. The election form contains instructions for making a selection of merger consideration and for
surrendering CWEI common shares in exchange for the merger consideration. The exchange agent must receive a properly
completed and signed election form and related stock certificates or book-entry shares, or an appropriate and customary guarantee
of delivery thereof, and any additional documents specified in the election form, by no later than the election deadline in order for
a choice as to the form of merger consideration to be considered with those timely made by the other CWEI stockholders and
CWEI warrant holders. Noble and CWEI currently anticipate that the “election deadline” will be 5:00 p.m. Central time on
April 24, 2017. Noble and CWEI will issue a joint press release announcing the anticipated date of the election deadline not more
than 15 business days before, and at least five business days prior to, the anticipated date of the election deadline. Noble and
CWEI will also issue a joint press release if the election deadline changes.

For a more completed discussion of the election procedures, see “The Merger Agreement—Election Procedures” beginning
on page 58.

Proration Procedures (See Page 60)

Even if a valid election is made, a CWEI stockholder may not receive the exact form of merger consideration that it elects. If
a CWEI stockholder does not make a valid election with respect to such holder’s CWEI common shares (and does not exercise
appraisal rights), such holder will receive such merger consideration as is determined in accordance with the proration provisions
of the merger agreement.

The merger consideration is subject to proration so that the aggregate merger consideration paid in respect of all CWEI
common shares and CWEI warrants consists of 75% Noble common shares and 25% cash, based on the closing sale price for the
Noble common shares on January 12, 2017. The ability to receive the merger consideration

TABLE OF CONTENTS

of a holder’s choice will depend on the elections of other CWEI stockholders and CWEI warrant holders. A CWEI stockholder or
CWEI warrant holder may not receive the form of merger consideration that it elects in the merger, and may instead receive a
pro-rata amount of cash, Noble common shares or both.

The greater the oversubscription of the share-election consideration, if any, the fewer Noble common shares and more cash a
CWEI stockholder or CWEI warrant holder making the share election will receive. Reciprocally, the greater the oversubscription
of the cash-election consideration, if any, the less cash and more Noble common shares a CWEI stockholder or CWEI warrant
holder making the cash election will receive. See “The Merger Agreement—Proration Procedures” beginning on page 60.

CWEI Board Recommendation and Its Reasons for the Merger (See Page 30)

The CWEI board recommends that CWEI stockholders vote “FOR” the merger proposal, “FOR” the adjournment proposal,
if necessary to solicit additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes to approve the merger proposal at the time of the CWEI
special meeting, and “FOR” the advisory compensation proposal.

In the course of reaching its decision to approve the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, the CWEI
board considered a number of factors. For a more complete discussion of these factors, see “The Merger—Rationale for the
Merger” and “The Merger—CWEI Board Recommendation and Its Reasons for the Merger” beginning on pages 29 and 30,
respectively.

Opinion of CWEI’s Financial Advisor (See Page 33)

On January 13, 2017, Goldman, Sachs & Co. (“Goldman Sachs”) delivered its opinion to the CWEI board that, as of such
date, and based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth therein, the merger consideration to be paid to the
holders (other than Noble and its affiliates) of CWEI common shares pursuant to the merger agreement was fair from a financial
point of view to such holders.

The full text of the written opinion of Goldman Sachs, dated January 13, 2017, which sets forth assumptions made,
procedures followed, matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken in connection with the opinion, is
attached as Annex B and is incorporated by reference into this proxy statement/prospectus. The summary of the opinion
of Goldman Sachs in this proxy statement/prospectus is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the opinion.

Goldman Sachs provided advisory services and its opinion for the information and assistance of the CWEI board in
connection with its consideration of the merger. The Goldman Sachs opinion is not a recommendation as to how any
holder of CWEI common shares should vote with respect to the merger or any other matter. Pursuant to an engagement
letter between CWEI and Goldman Sachs, CWEI has agreed to pay Goldman Sachs a transaction fee that is estimated,
based on information available as of the date of public announcement of the merger, at approximately $14 million, all of
which is payable upon consummation of the merger.

For a more complete discussion of the opinion of Goldman Sachs, see “The Merger—Opinion of CWEI’s Financial
Advisor” beginning on page 33.

Board of Directors and Executive Officers After Completion of the Merger (See Page 42)

Upon completion of the merger, the board of directors of the combined company will consist of the then-current Noble
directors. All Noble directors are elected annually to serve until the next annual meeting and until their successors are elected.
The current directors of Noble are: Jeffrey L. Berenson, Michael A. Cawley, Edward F. Cox, James E. Craddock, Thomas J.
Edelman, Eric P. Grubman, Kirby L. Hedrick, David L. Stover, Scott D. Urban, William T. Van Kleef and Molly K. Williamson.
Mr. Grubman has informed Noble that he will not stand for re-election at Noble’s 2017 annual meeting of stockholders. Mr.
Grubman’s decision not to stand for re-election is not as a result of any disagreement with Noble or its board of directors. The
executive officers of Noble are expected to continue serving as executive officers of the combined company, except for Susan M.
Cunningham, who has notified Noble of her plans to retire, effective March 24, 2017.

For a more complete discussion of the directors and officers of Noble, see “The Merger—Board of Directors and Executive
Officers After Completion of the Merger” beginning on page 42.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Interests of CWEI Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger (See Page 42)

Some of CWEI’s directors and executive officers have financial interests in the merger that may be different from, or in
addition to, those of CWEI stockholders generally. The CWEI board was aware of these interests and considered them, among
other matters, in approving the merger agreement and making its recommendation that the CWEI stockholders approve the
merger proposal. These interests include the following:

• The merger agreement provides for the vesting of CWEI’s outstanding option awards immediately prior to the effective
time and the exchange of such awards for the number of Noble common shares, rounded down to the nearest whole
share, determined by dividing (i) the product of (A) the number of CWEI common shares subject to the CWEI option
and (B) the amount, if any, by which the per share closing price of CWEI common shares on the business day
immediately prior to the date on which the effective time occurs exceeds the per share exercise price of the CWEI
option by (ii) the average per share closing price of Noble common shares over the 10 trading days immediately prior to
the date on which the effective time occurs.

• The merger agreement also provides for the conversion of CWEI’s outstanding restricted stock awards into
corresponding awards denominated in restricted Noble common shares equal to the number of CWEI restricted shares
subject to the award multiplied by the share-election exchange ratio of 3.7222, rounded up to the nearest whole share
and subject to the same vesting, repurchase and other restrictions as the CWEI restricted shares.

• Each executive officer of CWEI is party to an employment agreement with CWEI which entitles the executive officer
to certain change-in-control severance benefits in the event the executive officer experiences a qualifying termination of
employment within two years following the merger. These double-trigger benefits consist of a lump sum severance
payment, continued healthcare coverage and accelerated vesting of outstanding equity awards.

• Certain CWEI directors are affiliated with Ares Management. In connection with the merger, Ares Management will
receive a make-whole payment under its term loan to CWEI.

CWEI’s directors and executive officers are also entitled to continued indemnification/expense advancement and directors’
and officers’ liability insurance coverage under the merger agreement. For a further discussion of the interests of directors and
executive officers in the merger, see “The Merger—Interests of CWEI Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger” beginning
on page 42.

Share Ownership of Certain Stockholders; Support and Non-Dissent Agreements (See Page 47)

The Ares stockholders (certain CWEI stockholders affiliated with Ares Management) entered into the support agreement,
pursuant to which the Ares stockholders agreed, among other things, not to exercise or assert any appraisal rights under Section
262 of the DGCL in connection with the merger. The Ares stockholders have also agreed, among other things, during the period
from January 13, 2017 to and including the date of termination of the merger agreement, if any, to vote all of the CWEI common
shares and, if applicable, the CWEI preferred shares, they beneficially own as of the record date of the CWEI special meeting in
favor of the merger proposal. See “The Merger—Share Ownership of Certain Stockholders; Support and Non-Dissent
Agreements—Support Agreement” beginning on page 47.

In addition, the non-dissenting parties (Clayton W. Williams, Jr. and The Williams Children’s Partnership Ltd., each a
stockholder of CWEI), entered into the non-dissent agreements, pursuant to which the non-dissenting parties agreed, among other
things, not to exercise or assert any appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL in connection with the merger. The non-
dissenting parties have also agreed, among other things, during the period from January 13, 2017 to and including the date of
termination of the merger agreement, if any, to vote all of the CWEI common shares they beneficially own as of the record date
of the CWEI special meeting against any alternative proposal and against any amendment of CWEI’s certificate of incorporation
or by-laws or other proposal or transaction involving CWEI or any of its subsidiaries, which amendment or other proposal or
transaction would in any manner delay, impede, frustrate, prevent or nullify the merger, the merger agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement or change in any manner the voting rights of any outstanding class of capital
stock of CWEI. See “The Merger—Share Ownership of Certain Stockholders; Support and Non-Dissent Agreements—Non-
Dissent Agreements” beginning on page 48.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Accounting Treatment of the Merger (See Page 48)

The merger will be accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting according to U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles (“GAAP”) with Noble being considered the acquirer of CWEI for accounting purposes. For a more
complete description of the accounting treatment of the merger, see “The Merger— Accounting Treatment of the Merger”
beginning on page 48.

Regulatory Approvals Required for the Merger (See Page 48)

To complete the merger, Noble and CWEI must make filings with and obtain authorizations, approvals or consents from a
number of regulatory authorities. For a more complete discussion of regulatory matters relating to the merger, see “The Merger—
Regulatory Approvals Required for the Merger” beginning on page 48.

Treatment of CWEI Equity Awards (See Page 48)

Stock Options. In connection with the merger, each CWEI option that is outstanding immediately prior to the effective time
will vest and be exchanged for the number of Noble common shares, rounded down to the nearest whole share, equal to the
quotient of (i) the product of (A) the number of CWEI common shares subject to the CWEI option, multiplied by (B) the amount,
if any, by which the per share closing trading price of CWEI common shares on the business day immediately before the effective
time exceeds the exercise price per CWEI common share otherwise purchasable pursuant to the CWEI option immediately prior
to the effective time, divided by (ii) the average of the closing sale prices of a Noble common share as reported on the NYSE for
the ten consecutive full trading days, ending at the close of trading on the full trading day immediately preceding the date on
which the effective time occurs. If such calculation results in zero or a negative number, the applicable CWEI option shall be
forfeited for no consideration.

Restricted Shares. In connection with the merger, the CWEI restricted shares outstanding immediately prior to the effective
time will be converted into a number of restricted Noble common shares equal to the number of CWEI restricted shares
multiplied by the share-election exchange ratio of 3.7222, rounded up to the nearest whole share, and subject to the same vesting,
repurchase and other restrictions as the CWEI restricted shares.

For a more complete discussion of the treatment of CWEI options, restricted shares and other stock-based awards, see “The
Merger Agreement—Treatment of CWEI Equity Awards” beginning on page 48. For further discussion of the treatment of CWEI
options, restricted shares and other stock-based awards held by certain directors and executive officers of CWEI, see “The
Merger—Interests of CWEI Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger” beginning on page 42.

Appraisal Rights (See Page 49)

The holders of CWEI common shares are entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the merger under Delaware law.
CWEI common shares held by stockholders that (i) do not vote for approval of the merger proposal and (ii) make a demand for
appraisal in accordance with Delaware law will not be converted into the merger consideration, but will be converted into the
right to receive from the combined company the “fair value” of such CWEI common shares, in cash, as determined in accordance
with Delaware law. For a more complete discussion of the appraisal rights available to holders of CWEI common, see “The
Merger—Appraisal Rights—CWEI” beginning on page 49.

The holders of Noble common shares are not entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the merger under Delaware law.

U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences (See Page 53)

The merger and the second merger, considered together, are intended to constitute a single integrated transaction that
qualifies as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. The holders of CWEI common shares are not
expected to recognize any gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes on the exchange of CWEI common shares for Noble
common shares in the merger, except that such holders will recognize gain (but not loss) to the extent such holders receive cash.
The holders of CWEI common shares that receive the entirety of their merger consideration in the form of cash, however, are
expected to recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount of cash received and the basis in the CWEI
common shares exchanged. The obligations of Noble and

CWEI to complete the merger are subject to, among other conditions described in this proxy statement/prospectus, the receipt by
each of Noble and CWEI of an opinion of counsel to the effect that the merger and the second merger, considered together, will
qualify as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

You should read “U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences” beginning on page 53 for a more complete discussion of the
United States federal income tax consequences of the merger. Tax matters can be complicated and the tax consequences of the
merger to you will depend on your particular tax situation. You should consult your tax advisor to determine the tax
consequences of the merger to you.

Completion of the Merger (See Page 63)

The merger is expected to be completed by April 25, 2017, subject to the receipt of necessary regulatory approvals and the
satisfaction or waiver of other closing conditions. For a discussion of the timing of the merger, see “The Merger Agreement—
Completion of the Merger” beginning on page 63.

Conditions to Completion of the Merger (See Page 63)

The parties expect to complete the merger after all of the conditions to the merger in the merger agreement are satisfied or
waived, including after Noble and CWEI receive all required regulatory approvals, and after CWEI receives stockholder approval
at its special meeting. The parties currently expect to complete the merger by April 25, 2017. However, it is possible that factors
outside of each company’s control could require them to complete the merger at a later time or not to complete it at all.

the following conditions:

• approval of the merger proposal by vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding CWEI common shares;

Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, (the “HSR Act”);

• absence of any law, order, judgment or injunction prohibiting consummation of the merger;

• the representations and warranties of the other party in the merger agreement being true and correct both when made
and as of the closing of the merger, subject to certain materiality and material adverse effect qualifications;

• receipt of a certificate signed by the chief executive officer of the other party, dated as of the closing date, certifying
that the two preceding conditions have been satisfied;

• the number of CWEI common shares as to which holders shall have properly complied in all respects with the

set forth or referred to in such opinion, the merger and the second merger, considered together, will qualify for U.S.
federal income tax purposes as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

The conditions set forth in the merger agreement may be waived by Noble or CWEI, subject to applicable law and the

TABLE OF CONTENTS

No Solicitation of Other Offers (See Page 68)

Pursuant to the merger agreement, CWEI has agreed that neither it nor its subsidiaries nor any of its or its subsidiaries’
respective officers, directors, employees or other representatives will, directly or indirectly:

• initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate any inquiries or the making or the submission of any
proposal that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, an alternative proposal;

• participate or engage in any discussions or negotiations with, or disclose any non-public information or data or afford
access to CWEI’s or its subsidiaries’ properties, books or records to any third party that has made an alternative
proposal;

• approve, endorse or recommend any alternative proposal or publicly propose to do the same;

• enter into any letter of intent, term sheet, memorandum of understanding, merger agreement, acquisition agreement,
exchange agreement or any other agreement with respect to an alternative proposal or requiring CWEI to abandon,
terminate or fail to consummate the merger;

• amend or grant any waiver, release or modification under, or fail to enforce, any standstill or similar agreement with
respect to any class of equity securities; or

• resolve or agree to do any of the foregoing.

The merger agreement does not, however, prohibit CWEI from considering an unsolicited alternative proposal from a third
party if certain specified conditions are met. For a discussion of the prohibition on solicitation of acquisition proposals from third
parties, see “The Merger Agreement—No Solicitation of Other Offers” beginning on page 68.

CWEI Debt and Termination of Liens (See Page 74)

CWEI has agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to, concurrently with or before the closing of the merger, (i) obtain
customary payoff letters to terminate CWEI’s term loan credit agreement, (ii) coordinate with Noble and hedge providers to make
arrangements with respect to derivative transactions, and (iii) make arrangements satisfactory to Noble for the release of all liens
arising from or granted in connection with CWEI’s term loan credit agreement.

CWEI has also agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to, concurrently with or before the closing of the merger, pay
in full any amounts then borrowed or currently outstanding under its revolving credit facility, and take all such actions as may be
necessary to terminate or cause to be terminated the revolving credit facility and all applicable commitments related to or under
the revolving credit facility, and make arrangements satisfactory to Noble for the release of all liens arising from or granted in
connection with the revolving credit facility. CWEI and Noble will cooperate with one another in good faith to cause the issuing
institution for certain letters of credit to release CWEI or its subsidiaries, as applicable, and install Noble or one of its
subsidiaries, as obligor for each such letter of credit prior to the termination of the revolving credit facility.

In connection with the merger, in the event that Noble desires to consummate an exchange offer, tender offer, repurchase
offer, consent solicitation, discharge, defeasance, redemption or similar transaction, or any combination thereof, with respect to
CWEI’s 7.75% Senior Notes due 2019, each of CWEI, Noble and Merger Sub have agreed to use its respective reasonable best
efforts to, and to cause its respective subsidiaries and representatives (and, in the case of the CWEI, the trustee) to, cooperate with
one another in good faith to permit such debt transactions to be effected on such terms, conditions and timing as reasonably
requested by Noble, including if so requested by Noble, causing those debt transactions to be consummated substantially
concurrently with the closing of the merger.

For a more complete discussion of the treatment of debt and the termination of liens pursuant to the merger agreement, see
“The Merger Agreement—Other Covenants and Agreements—CWEI Debt and Termination of Liens” beginning on page 74.

Termination of the Merger Agreement (See Page 75)

• if there is in effect a final nonappealable order of a governmental authority of competent jurisdiction restraining,
enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the merger; provided that this termination right is not available to a party whose
failure to perform its obligations under the merger agreement is the primary cause of such order;

representations or warranties become untrue, in a way that the related condition to closing would not be satisfied,
and this breach is either incurable or not cured within 30 days;

• if the closing does not occur on or before July 17, 2017; provided that this termination right will not be available to
a party whose failure to perform and comply in all material respects with the covenants and agreements is the
cause of the failure of the closing;

• if the CWEI special meeting has occurred and the CWEI stockholders have not approved the merger proposal;

• by Noble, if the CWEI board makes a change in recommendation; or

• by CWEI, if CWEI is terminating the merger agreement to enter into a definitive agreement relating to a superior
proposal in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement.

The merger agreement provides that, upon a termination of the merger agreement under specified circumstances, CWEI may
be required to pay Noble a termination fee of $87 million. See “The Merger Agreement—Termination of the Merger Agreement”
and “The Merger Agreement—Effect of Termination; Termination Fees,” each beginning on page 75.

Purpose of the CWEI Special Meeting; Required Vote (See Pages 86 and 87)

At the CWEI special meeting, CWEI stockholders will be asked to consider and vote upon:

1. Merger Proposal: To consider and vote on a proposal to adopt the merger agreement, a copy of which is attached as
Annex A to this proxy statement/prospectus;

2. Adjournment Proposal: To consider and vote on a proposal to approve the adjournment of the CWEI special meeting,
if necessary to solicit additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes to approve the merger proposal at the time of
the CWEI special meeting; and

3. Advisory Compensation Proposal: To consider and vote on a proposal to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis,
the payments that will or may be paid to CWEI’s named executive officers in connection with the merger.

Approval of the merger proposal is required for completion of the merger.

The affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the outstanding CWEI common shares entitled to vote is required to approve
the merger proposal. The affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the CWEI common shares represented at the CWEI special
meeting (in person or by proxy) and entitled to vote is required to approve the adjournment proposal and the advisory
compensation proposal.

The CWEI board unanimously recommends that CWEI stockholders vote “FOR” each of the proposals set forth above, as
more fully described in the section entitled “CWEI Special Meeting” beginning on page 86.

Voting by CWEI Directors and Executive Officers (See Page 88)

As of March 22, 2017, directors and executive officers of CWEI and their affiliates owned and were entitled to vote
6,595,569 CWEI common shares, or approximately 37% of the CWEI common shares outstanding on that date.

$37.39 on the NYSE and the closing sale price per CWEI common share was $103.98 on the NYSE. On March 22, 2017, the last
practicable date before the date of this proxy statement/prospectus, the last sales price per Noble common share was $33.51 on
the NYSE and the last sales price per CWEI common share was $129.47 on the NYSE. The equivalent share election per share
prices set forth below for Noble common shares were determined, for CWEI common shares in respect of which a share election
is made, by multiplying the closing price of Noble common shares by the share-election exchange ratio of 3.7222 and, for CWEI
common shares in respect of which a mixed election is made, by multiplying the closing price of Noble common shares by the
mixed-election exchange ratio of 2.7874 and adding $34.75 to such amount.

CWEI stockholders are advised to obtain current market quotations for Noble common shares. The market price of Noble
common shares will fluctuate between the date of this proxy statement/prospectus and the completion of the merger. No
assurance can be given concerning the market price of Noble common shares before or after the effective date of the merger.

CWEI has never paid or declared any dividends on its common shares. CWEI’s ability to pay dividends is restricted by the
terms of its revolving credit facility, its term loan credit agreement and the indenture governing its 7.75% Senior Notes due 2019.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

RISK FACTORS

In addition to the other information included or incorporated by reference in this proxy statement/prospectus, including the
matters addressed in “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” beginning on page 23, you should carefully
consider the following risks before deciding how to vote. In addition, you should read and carefully consider the risks associated
with each of Noble and CWEI and their respective businesses. These risks can be found in Noble’s and CWEI’s respective Annual
Reports on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, which are filed with the SEC and incorporated by reference into this
proxy statement/prospectus. For further information regarding the documents incorporated into this proxy statement/prospectus by
reference, please see the section titled “Where You Can Find More Information.” Realization of any of the risks described below,
any of the events described under “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” or any of the risks or events
described in the documents incorporated by reference could have a material adverse effect on Noble’s, CWEI’s or the combined
company’s businesses, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations and could result in a decline in the trading prices of
their respective shares of common stock.

Risks Relating to the Merger

Because the share-election exchange ratio and the mixed-election exchange ratio will not be adjusted for stock price changes
and the market price of Noble common shares will fluctuate, CWEI stockholders cannot be sure of the value of the merger
consideration they will receive.

Upon completion of the merger, each CWEI common share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time
(other than CWEI common shares held in treasury and CWEI common shares held by stockholders who properly comply in all
respects with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL as to appraisal rights) will be cancelled and extinguished and automatically
converted into the right to receive, at the election of the stockholder, one of (i) 3.7222 Noble common shares; (ii)(A) $34.75 in cash
(subject to applicable withholding tax), without interest and (B) 2.7874 Noble common shares; or (iii) $138.39 in cash (subject to
applicable withholding tax), without interest.

Neither the share-election exchange ratio nor the mixed-election exchange ratio will change to reflect changes in the market
prices of Noble and CWEI common shares. The market price of Noble common shares at the time of completion of the merger may
vary significantly from the market price of Noble common shares on the date the merger agreement was executed, the date of this
proxy statement/prospectus and the date of the CWEI special meeting. In addition, as discussed below, the merger consideration will
be subject to proration. Accordingly, CWEI stockholders will not know or be able to calculate at the time of the CWEI special
meeting the market value of the merger consideration they will receive upon completion of the merger.

In addition, the merger might not be completed until a significant period of time has passed after the CWEI special meeting.
Because the share-election exchange ratio and mixed-election exchange ratio will not be adjusted to reflect any changes in the
market values of Noble common shares and CWEI common shares, the market value of the Noble common shares issued in
connection with the merger and the CWEI common shares surrendered in connection with the merger may be higher or lower than
the values of those shares on earlier dates. Stock price changes may result from, among other things, changes in the business,
operations or prospects of Noble or CWEI prior to or following the merger, litigation or regulatory considerations, general business,
market, industry or economic conditions and other factors both within and beyond the control of Noble and CWEI. For additional
information on risks related to Noble common shares, see “—Risks Inherent in an Investment in Noble” beginning on page 21.
Neither Noble nor CWEI is permitted to terminate the merger agreement solely because of changes in the market price of either
company’s common stock.

Holders may not receive the form of merger consideration that they elect.

The merger consideration is subject to proration so that the aggregate merger consideration paid in respect of all CWEI
common shares and CWEI warrants consists of 75% Noble common shares and 25% cash, based on the closing sale price for the
Noble common shares on January 12, 2017. Accordingly, there is no assurance that CWEI stockholders will receive the form of
consideration that they elect with respect to all CWEI common shares they hold. There is a risk that CWEI stockholders will receive
a portion of the merger consideration in the form that they do not elect, which could result in, among other things, tax consequences
that differ from those that would have resulted from receipt of the form of merger consideration elected, including with respect to
the recognition of taxable gain to the extent cash is received. For more information on the proration procedures, see “The Merger
Agreement—Proration Procedures” beginning on page 60.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Current CWEI stockholders will have a reduced ownership and voting interest after the merger and will exercise less influence
over management.

Noble will issue approximately 55 million Noble common shares to CWEI stockholders in the merger (including Noble
common shares to be issued in connection with outstanding CWEI warrants and equity awards). As a result of these issuances,
current Noble and CWEI stockholders and warrant holders are expected to hold approximately 89% and 11%, respectively, of
Noble’s outstanding common stock immediately following completion of the merger.

CWEI stockholders currently have the right to vote for their respective directors and on other matters affecting the company.
When the merger occurs, the Noble common shares that each CWEI stockholder receives in exchange for its CWEI common shares
will represent a percentage ownership of the combined company that is significantly smaller than the CWEI stockholder’s
percentage ownership of CWEI. As a result of these reduced ownership percentages, former CWEI stockholders will have less
influence on the management and policies of Noble than they now have with respect to CWEI.

The merger agreement contains provisions that limit CWEI’s ability to pursue alternatives to the merger, which could discourage
a potential acquirer of CWEI from making an alternative transaction proposal and, in certain circumstances, could require
CWEI to pay to Noble a termination fee.

The merger agreement contains “no shop” provisions that, subject to limited exceptions, prohibit CWEI, its subsidiaries and
their respective representatives from, directly or indirectly, initiating, soliciting, knowingly encouraging, knowingly facilitating any
inquiry in respect of, making or submitting proposals in respect of, discussing, negotiating, approving, endorsing or recommending,
or entering into any letter of intent, term sheet, memorandum of understanding, merger agreement, acquisition agreement or any
other agreement in respect of, a competing third-party proposal for the acquisition of CWEI’s stock or assets. In addition, the parties
are generally required to negotiate in good faith to modify the terms of the merger in response to any competing acquisition
proposals before the CWEI board may withdraw or qualify its recommendation with respect to the merger. In some circumstances,
upon termination of the merger agreement, CWEI may be required to pay Noble a termination fee of $87 million.

In addition, the Ares stockholders (certain CWEI stockholders affiliated with Ares Management), who collectively own 42% of
the outstanding CWEI common shares as of March 22, 2017, the last practicable date before the date of this proxy
statement/prospectus, and the non-dissenting parties (Clayton W. Williams, Jr. and The Williams Children’s Partnership Ltd.), who
collectively beneficially own approximately 35% of the outstanding CWEI common shares as of March 22, 2017, have agreed,
under certain circumstances, to vote their shares against any alternative acquisition transaction for a period of 180 days following
termination of the merger agreement.

See “The Merger Agreement—No Solicitation of Other Offers” beginning on page 68; “The Merger Agreement—Termination
of the Merger Agreement” beginning on page 75; “The Merger Agreement—Effect of Termination; Termination Fees” beginning on
page 75; and “The Merger—Share Ownership of Certain Stockholders; Support and Non-Dissent Agreements” beginning on page
47.

These provisions could discourage a potential third-party acquirer that might have an interest in acquiring all or a significant
portion of CWEI’s stock or assets from considering or proposing that acquisition, even if it were prepared to pay consideration with
a higher per share cash or market value than the market value proposed to be received or realized in the merger. Similarly, these
provisions might result in a potential third-party acquirer proposing to pay a lower price to CWEI stockholders than it might
otherwise have proposed to pay because of the added expense of the termination fee that may become payable in certain
circumstances. If the merger agreement is terminated and CWEI determines to seek another business combination, it may not be
able to negotiate a transaction with another party on terms comparable to, or better than, the terms of the merger.

CWEI will be subject to various uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the merger is pending that could adversely affect
its financial results.

Uncertainty about the effect of the merger on employees, suppliers and customers may have an adverse effect on CWEI. These
uncertainties may impair CWEI’s ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the merger is completed, and could cause
customers, suppliers and others that deal with CWEI to seek to change existing business relationships with CWEI. Employee
retention and recruitment for CWEI may be particularly challenging prior to completion of the merger, as employees and
prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined company.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

The pursuit of the merger and the preparation for the integration may place a significant burden on CWEI’s management and
internal resources. Any significant diversion of management attention away from ongoing business and any difficulties encountered
in the transition and integration process could affect CWEI’s financial results.

In addition, the merger agreement restricts CWEI, without Noble’s consent, from making certain acquisitions and dispositions
and taking other specified actions while the merger is pending. These restrictions may prevent CWEI from pursuing attractive
business opportunities and making other changes to its business prior to completion of the merger or termination of the merger
agreement. See “The Merger Agreement—Conduct of Business Prior to Closing” beginning on page 65.

The merger and related transactions are subject to approval by CWEI stockholders.

In order for the merger to be completed, the CWEI stockholders must approve the merger proposal, which requires the
approval of the holders of a majority of the outstanding CWEI common shares entitled to vote on the merger proposal as of the
record date for the CWEI special meeting.

The merger is subject to conditions, including certain conditions that may not be satisfied, or completed on a timely basis, if at
all.

The merger is subject to a number of other conditions beyond Noble’s and CWEI’s control that may prevent, delay or otherwise
materially adversely affect its completion, including the approval of the merger proposal by CWEI’s stockholders. Neither Noble
nor CWEI can predict whether and when these other conditions will be satisfied. Any delay in completing the merger could cause
the combined company not to realize some or all of the synergies expected to be achieved if the merger is successfully completed
within its expected time frame. See “The Merger Agreement—Conditions to Completion of the Merger” beginning on page 63.

Failure to complete the merger could negatively affect CWEI’s stock price, its future business and financial results.

If the merger is not completed, CWEI’s ongoing businesses may be adversely affected and CWEI will be subject to several
risks and consequences, including the following:

• under the merger agreement, CWEI may be required, under certain circumstances, to pay Noble a termination fee of $87
million;

• CWEI will be required to pay certain costs relating to the merger, whether or not the merger is completed, such as legal,
accounting, financial advisor and printing fees;

• CWEI would not realize the expected benefits of the merger;

• under the merger agreement, CWEI is subject to certain restrictions on the conduct of its business prior to completing the
merger, which may adversely affect its ability to execute certain of its business strategies;

• matters relating to the merger may require substantial commitments of time and resources by CWEI management, which
could otherwise have been devoted to other opportunities that may have been beneficial to CWEI as an independent
company; and

• CWEI may lose key employees during the period in which CWEI and Noble are pursuing the merger, which may
adversely affect CWEI in the future if it is not able to hire and retain qualified personnel to replace departing employees.

In addition, if the merger is not completed, CWEI may experience negative reactions from the financial markets and from its
customers and employees. CWEI also could be subject to litigation related to any failure to complete the merger or to enforcement
proceedings commenced against CWEI to attempt to force it to perform its obligations under the merger agreement.

Noble and CWEI will incur substantial transaction fees and merger-related costs in connection with the merger.

Noble and CWEI expect to incur non-recurring transaction fees totaling approximately $83 million, which includes legal and
advisory fees and substantial merger-related costs associated with completing the merger, combining the operations of the two
companies and achieving desired synergies. Additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the course of the integration of the
businesses of Noble and CWEI. The companies cannot be certain that the realization of other benefits related to the integration of
the two businesses will offset the transaction and merger-related costs in the near term, or at all.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Certain directors and executive officers of CWEI have interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, those of
other CWEI stockholders, which could have influenced their decisions to support or approve the merger.

In considering whether to approve the proposals at the CWEI special meeting, CWEI stockholders should recognize that
certain directors and executive officers of CWEI have interests in the merger that differ from, or that are in addition to, their
interests as stockholders of CWEI. These interests include, among others, ownership interests in the combined company, the
accelerated vesting of certain equity awards and/or certain severance benefits and the payment of a make-whole fee, in connection
with the merger. These interests, among others, may influence the directors and executive officers of CWEI to support or approve
the merger proposal. See the sections entitled “The Merger—Interests of CWEI Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger”
beginning on page 42.

Completion of the merger may trigger change in control or other provisions in certain agreements to which CWEI is a party.

The completion of the merger may trigger change in control or other provisions in certain agreements to which CWEI is a
party. If Noble and CWEI are unable to negotiate waivers of those provisions, the counterparties may exercise their rights and
remedies under the agreements, potentially terminating the agreements or seeking monetary damages. Even if Noble and CWEI are
able to negotiate waivers, the counterparties may require a fee for such waivers or seek to renegotiate the agreements on terms less
favorable to CWEI or the combined company.

Risks Relating to the Combined Company Following the Merger

Noble may need to obtain new financing in connection with the termination of CWEI’s term loan credit agreement or revolving
credit facility or to redeem CWEI’s senior notes, which new financing may be costly or time-consuming to obtain.

In connection with the merger, Noble may determine to terminate CWEI’s term loan credit agreement or revolving credit
facility or consummate an exchange offer, tender offer, repurchase offer, consent solicitation, discharge, defeasance, redemption or
similar transaction, or any combination thereof, with respect to CWEI’s 7.75% Senior Notes due 2019. Noble intends to finance any
such transaction or transactions with respect to the notes, and the related fees, commissions and expenses, with a combination of
funds available at Noble (including funds available under Noble’s existing credit facilities) and, to the extent necessary, new
financing. There is no assurance that any new financing will be obtained on desired terms and within a desired timeframe or will not
contain terms, conditions or restrictions that would be detrimental to Noble after the completion of the merger. There are no
financing conditions to the merger and the merger is not conditioned upon the completion of any such transactions with respect to
the notes or the CWEI credit agreement.

For a more complete discussion of the treatment of debt and the termination of liens pursuant to the merger agreement, see
“The Merger Agreement—Other Covenants and Agreements—CWEI Debt and Termination of Liens” beginning on page 74.

If completed, the merger may not achieve its intended results, and Noble and CWEI may be unable to successfully integrate their
operations.

Noble and CWEI entered into the merger agreement with the expectation that the merger will result in various benefits,
including, among other things, expanding Noble’s asset base and creating synergies. Achieving the anticipated benefits of the
merger is subject to a number of uncertainties, including whether the businesses of Noble and CWEI can be integrated in an efficient
and effective manner.

It is possible that the integration process could take longer than anticipated and could result in the loss of valuable employees,
the disruption of each company’s ongoing businesses, processes and systems or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures,
practices, policies and compensation arrangements, any of which could adversely affect the combined company’s ability to achieve
the anticipated benefits of the merger. The combined company’s results of operations could also be adversely affected by any issues
attributable to either company’s operations that arise or are based on events or actions that occur prior to the closing of the merger.
The companies may have difficulty addressing possible differences in corporate cultures and management philosophies. The
integration process is subject to a number of uncertainties, and no assurance can be given that the anticipated benefits will be
realized or, if realized, the timing of their realization. Failure to achieve these anticipated benefits could result in increased costs or
decreases in the amount of expected revenues and could adversely affect the combined company’s future business, financial
condition, operating results and prospects.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

The market price of the shares of the combined company and the results of operations of the combined company after the
merger may be affected by factors different from those affecting CWEI or Noble currently.

The businesses of Noble and CWEI differ in some respects and, accordingly, the results of operations of the combined
company and the market price of the combined company’s shares of common stock following the merger may be affected by factors
different from those currently affecting the independent results of operations and market prices of Noble and CWEI. For a
discussion of the businesses of Noble and CWEI and of certain factors to consider in connection with those businesses, see the
documents incorporated by reference in this document and referred to under “Where You Can Find More Information.”

The future results of the combined company will suffer if the combined company does not effectively manage its expanded
operations following the merger.

Following the merger, the size of the business of the combined company and the basins in which it operates will increase
beyond the current size of either Noble’s or CWEI’s business or the respective basins in which they currently operate. The combined
company’s future success depends, in part, upon its ability to manage this expanded business, which will pose challenges for
management, including challenges related to the management and monitoring of new operations. There can be no assurances that
the combined company will be successful or that it will realize the expected operating efficiencies, cost savings, revenue
enhancements and other benefits currently anticipated from the merger.

The combined company is expected to incur expenses related to the integration of Noble and CWEI.

The combined company is expected to incur expenses in connection with the integration of Noble and CWEI. There are a large
number of processes, policies, procedures, operations, technologies and systems that must be integrated, including purchasing,
accounting and finance, sales, billing, payroll, pricing, revenue management, maintenance, marketing and benefits. While Noble and
CWEI have assumed that a certain level of expenses will be incurred, there are many factors beyond their control that could affect
the total amount or the timing of the integration expenses. Moreover, many of the expenses that will be incurred are, by their nature,
difficult to estimate accurately. These integration expenses likely will result in the combined company taking charges against
earnings following the completion of the merger, and the amount and timing of such charges are uncertain at present.

Uncertainties associated with the merger may cause a loss of management personnel and other key employees, which could
adversely affect the future business and operations of the combined company.

Noble and CWEI are dependent on the experience and industry knowledge of their officers and other key employees to execute
their business plans. Each company’s success until the merger and the combined company’s success after the merger will depend in
part upon the ability of Noble and CWEI to retain key management personnel and other key employees. Current and prospective
employees of Noble and CWEI may experience uncertainty about their roles within the combined company following the merger,
which may have an adverse effect on the ability of Noble and CWEI to attract or retain key management and other key personnel.
Accordingly, no assurance can be given that the combined company will be able to attract or retain key management personnel and
other key employees of Noble and CWEI to the same extent that Noble and CWEI have previously been able to attract or retain
their own employees.

The pro forma financial statements included in this proxy statement/prospectus are presented for illustrative purposes only and
may not be an indication of the combined company’s financial condition or results of operations following the merger.

The pro forma financial statements contained in this proxy statement/prospectus are presented for illustrative purposes only, are
based on various adjustments, assumptions and preliminary estimates and may not be an indication of the combined company’s
financial condition or results of operations following the merger for several reasons. See “Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed
Combined Financial Information” beginning on page 91. The actual financial condition and results of operations of the combined
company following the merger may not be consistent with, or evident from, these pro forma financial statements. In addition, the
assumptions used in preparing the pro forma financial information may not prove to be accurate, and other factors may affect the
combined company’s financial condition or results of operations following the merger. Any potential decline in the combined
company’s financial condition or results of operations may cause significant variations in the stock price of the combined company.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Following the closing of the merger, Noble will incorporate CWEI’s hedging activities into Noble’s business, and Noble may be
exposed to additional commodity price risks arising from such hedges.

To mitigate its exposure to changes in commodity prices, CWEI hedges oil, natural gas and NGL prices from time to time,
primarily through the use of certain derivative instruments, including fixed price swaps, basis swaps and costless collars. Noble will
bear the economic impact of all of CWEI’s current hedges following the closing of the merger. Actual crude oil, natural gas and
NGL prices may differ from the combined company’s expectations and, as a result, such hedges may or may not have a negative
impact on Noble’s business.

Risks Inherent in an Investment in Noble

The market price of Noble common shares may be volatile and Noble’s stock price could decline.

The market price of Noble common shares, as with all stocks, fluctuates from time to time and will be subject to similar
fluctuations in the future. As an example, during the year ended December 31, 2016, the market price of Noble common shares
ranged from a low of $23.77 per share to a high of $42.03 per share. The market price of Noble common shares may be affected by
a number of factors, including the volatility of crude oil, natural gas and NGL prices, Noble’s operating results, changes in Noble’s
earnings estimates, additions or departures of key personnel, Noble’s financial condition, drilling activities, legislative and
regulatory changes, general conditions in the oil and natural gas exploration and development industry, general economic
conditions, and general conditions in the securities markets. In particular, a significant or extended decline in crude oil and natural
gas prices could have a material adverse effect on the market price of Noble common shares. Other risks described elsewhere under
“Risk Factors” in this proxy statement/prospectus and the documents incorporated by reference in this proxy statement/prospectus
could also materially and adversely affect the market price of Noble common shares.

Although Noble’s board of directors has declared quarterly dividends on Noble common shares in recent years, Noble may not
pay cash dividends in the future.

Although Noble has paid cash dividends on Noble common shares in the past, Noble’s board of directors may determine not to
declare dividends in the future or may reduce the amount of dividends paid in the future. Any payment of future dividends will be at
the discretion of Noble’s board of directors and will depend on Noble’s results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements,
future prospects and other considerations that Noble’s board of directors deems relevant.

Noble is able to issue shares of preferred stock with greater rights than Noble common shares.

Noble’s board of directors is authorized to issue one or more series of preferred stock from time to time without any action on
the part of Noble’s stockholders. Noble’s board of directors also has the power, without stockholder approval, to set the terms of any
such series of preferred stock that may be issued, including voting rights, dividend rights, and preferences over Noble common
shares with respect to dividends and other terms. If Noble issues preferred stock in the future that has a preference over Noble
common shares with respect to the payment of dividends or other terms, or if Noble issues preferred stock with voting rights that
dilute the voting power of Noble common shares, the rights of holders of Noble common shares or the market price of Noble
common shares could be adversely affected.

There may be future dilution of Noble common shares, which could adversely affect the market price of Noble common shares.

Noble is not restricted from issuing additional Noble common shares. Noble may also issue securities convertible into, or
exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, Noble common shares. In the future, Noble may issue Noble common shares
to raise cash for future drilling and development activities or acquisitions. Noble regularly evaluates acquisition opportunities as part
of Noble’s overall business strategy and may periodically pursue opportunistic prospects as they arise. Noble may pay the purchase
price for any such acquisition by using cash, common stock, or a combination of both. Any of these events may dilute holders’
ownership interest in Noble, reduce Noble’s earnings per share and have an adverse effect on the price of Noble common shares.

Provisions in Noble’s certificate of incorporation and Delaware law may inhibit a takeover of Noble, which could limit the price
investors might be willing to pay in the future for Noble common shares.

Under Noble’s Certificate of Incorporation, Noble’s board of directors is authorized to issue shares of Noble’s common or
preferred stock without approval of its stockholders. Issuance of these shares could make it more difficult to acquire Noble without
the approval of its board of directors as more shares would have to be acquired to gain

control. In addition, Delaware law imposes restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between Noble and any holder
of 15% or more of its outstanding common stock. These provisions may deter hostile takeover attempts that could result in an
acquisition of Noble that would have been financially beneficial to its stockholders.

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

This proxy statement/prospectus and the documents incorporated by reference include “forward-looking statements” within the
meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the
Exchange Act. The statements contained in this proxy statement/prospectus that are not historical facts are forward-looking
statements that represent management’s beliefs and assumptions based on currently available information. These statements may be
made directly in this proxy statement/prospectus or may be incorporated by reference to other documents and may include
statements for the period after completion of the merger. These forward-looking statements relate to outlooks or expectations for
earnings, revenues, expenses, asset quality or other future financial or business performance, strategies or expectations, or the effect
of legal, regulatory or supervisory matters on business, results of operations or financial condition, and include, among others:

• statements about the benefits of the proposed merger, including future financial and operating results, Noble’s and CWEI’s

THE MERGER

The following is a discussion of the merger and the material terms of the merger agreement between Noble and CWEI. You are
urged to read carefully the merger agreement in its entirety, a copy of which is attached as Annex A to this proxy
statement/prospectus and incorporated by reference herein.

Background of the Merger

As part of their ongoing evaluation of CWEI’s business, the CWEI board and CWEI’s senior management, with the assistance
of financial and legal advisors, regularly review and assess CWEI’s strategic and financial alternatives in light of developments in
CWEI’s business, in the sectors in which it competes, in the economy generally and in the financial markets.

On October 17, 2016, Mel G. Riggs, president and a director of CWEI, was approached by the chief executive officer of
another exploration and production (“E&P”) company (“Party A”) to indicate that Party A would be interested in a strategic
transaction involving CWEI and Party A if CWEI decided to move forward with a transaction. On October 20, 2016, Mr. Riggs was
approached by the chief executive officer of another E&P company (“Party B”) to indicate that Party B would be interested in a
strategic transaction involving CWEI and Party B if CWEI decided to move forward with a transaction. In both instances, Mr. Riggs
indicated that CWEI would take such interest under advisement. Mr. Riggs informed members of the CWEI board of those
unsolicited approaches.

Given these approaches, as well as several recent transactions involving the sale of assets in the Permian Basin and specifically
in the Delaware Basin by other E&P companies, CWEI senior management met with representatives from Evercore Group L.L.C.
(“Evercore”) on November 8, 2016 to discuss the potential market interest for and valuation of CWEI. In connection with these
discussions, CWEI senior management, in consultation with Evercore, began to identify parties who might consider a transaction
with CWEI and provide further information regarding CWEI’s value in the market. CWEI senior management instructed Evercore
to engage in public information-based dialogue with six specified public companies, including Noble and Party A, on a confidential
basis to obtain a general level of market interest in a strategic transaction with CWEI. Representatives of Evercore contacted
representatives of Noble on November 11, 2016 and the other five companies between November 10, 2016 and November 14, 2016.
Between November 21, 2016 and November 30, 2016, CWEI executed short-form confidentiality agreements with four of these
companies and subsequently provided them with limited confidential information summarizing certain of CWEI’s leases and
midstream operations.

On November 11, 2016, Mr. Riggs met with the chief executive officer of Party A and discussed Party A’s potential interest in
CWEI, the rationale of a potential combination and an analysis of the combined company. On November 17, 2016, representatives
of CWEI and Evercore likewise met with the chief executive officer of Party A to discuss the rationale of a potential combination
and an analysis of the combined company.

On December 1, 2016, Mr. Riggs and other representatives of CWEI met with David L. Stover, chairman, president and chief
executive officer of Noble, and other representatives of Noble to discuss a potential combination. On December 7, 2016, Mr. Stover
called Mr. Riggs to state that an indication of interest would be forthcoming later that week.

On December 9, 2016, Mr. Stover sent a non-binding indication of interest to Mr. Riggs regarding a merger whereby each
outstanding CWEI common share would be converted into $51.20 of cash and 1.9413 Noble common shares. Noble stated that its
proposal represented an implied value of $128 per CWEI common share and stated that it would be willing to explore structuring
alternatives, including an election mechanism that would allow each CWEI stockholder to choose, subject to proration, the
appropriate mix of cash and stock as consideration.

Party A and the other companies that Evercore approached declined to submit indications of interest at that time.

On December 13, 2016, at a meeting of the CWEI board, senior management of CWEI and representatives of Evercore
provided a summary of the various companies who had been contacted and the feedback received from each with respect to CWEI’s
value and strategic alternatives. Representatives of Evercore also summarized Noble’s written indication of interest and provided an
overview of recent upstream transactions in the Delaware Basin. At the meeting, while not determining to engage in a sales process,
the CWEI board authorized CWEI senior management to continue discussions with potential counterparties, including Noble, and to
contact additional companies as a check of CWEI’s value in the market. The CWEI board authorized the engagement of Evercore
and Goldman Sachs as financial advisors. The CWEI board also asked CWEI senior management to prepare a standalone valuation
of CWEI and to utilize Evercore and Goldman Sachs with that valuation where helpful.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

On December 14, 2016, representatives of Evercore contacted representatives of Petrie Partners, financial advisor to Noble,
and updated them on the results of the board meeting and potential next steps. Representatives of Evercore indicated that Noble
would likely need to increase its proposed price in order for the CWEI board to consider proceeding any further in the evaluation of
strategic alternatives.

Between December 15, 2016 and December 21, 2016, representatives of Evercore contacted eight additional public companies,
including Party B which had initially approached Mr. Riggs in October 2016 about a potential transaction. Of the 14 total parties
that Evercore approached, five companies signed short-form confidentiality agreements and received limited CWEI non-public
information, and only Noble and Party B submitted written indications of interest.

Party B signed a short-form confidentiality agreement on December 17, 2016 and management of CWEI provided limited non-
public information to Party B. On December 21, 2016, Mr. Riggs and other representatives from CWEI and Evercore met with the
chief executive officer of Party B to discuss the merits of a combined entity and the chief executive officer of Party B expressed
interest in a potential combination.

On December 21, 2016, representatives of Noble presented an overview of Noble’s business and operations and proposed
integration plan to representatives of CWEI, Evercore and Goldman Sachs. Also on December 21, 2016, Noble executed a long-
form confidentiality agreement and was granted access to an electronic dataroom. The long-form confidentiality agreement included
a customary “standstill” provision that would automatically terminate if, among other things, CWEI entered into a definitive merger
agreement with another party.

On December 23, 2016, the chief executive officer of Party B submitted a non-binding indication of interest to Mr. Riggs
regarding a merger whereby Party B would acquire all of the CWEI common shares in exchange for a mix of cash (50%) and Party
B stock (50%), which Party B calculated at an implied value of $135 per CWEI common share. Party B would require primary
equity and debt offerings to finance the transaction and would also require a meeting of and approval by the Party B stockholders.

From December 21, 2016 through January 13, 2017, CWEI conducted extensive due diligence of Noble and Party B, and
Noble and Party B continued to conduct extensive due diligence of CWEI.

On December 27, 2016, the CWEI board held a telephonic board meeting whereby a representative of Evercore updated the
CWEI board with respect to the various parties that had been contacted, which parties had expressed interest in a potential
transaction with CWEI and the feedback received from each of the parties. The CWEI board reviewed Noble’s and Party B’s
indications of interest and the CWEI board authorized CWEI senior management to continue discussions with Noble and Party B
with respect to a potential strategic transaction and to request revised proposals from Noble and Party B with respect to a potential
strategic transaction by January 5, 2017.

On December 29, 2016, Party B executed a long-form confidentiality agreement and was granted access to an electronic
dataroom. The long-form confidentiality agreement included a customary “standstill” provision that would automatically terminate
if, among other things, CWEI entered into a definitive merger agreement with another party.

On January 4, 2017, representatives of Party B presented an overview of Party B’s business and operations and pro forma
combination analysis to representatives of CWEI, Evercore and Goldman Sachs.

On January 5, 2017, both Noble and Party B submitted revised written proposals to Mr. Riggs. Noble reaffirmed its interest in a
potential transaction and changed its proposed consideration for each CWEI common share from $51.20 of cash and 1.9413 Noble
common shares to $32.75 of cash and 2.5747 Noble common shares, an increase in the implied value of each CWEI common share
from $128 to $131. Party B likewise reaffirmed its indicative proposal and increased its proposed total consideration by $5.38 per
share. Although based on different assumptions than its earlier proposal, Party B’s per share bid price remained at $135 per CWEI
common share. Party B’s proposed offer remained at 50% cash and 50% stock consideration, continued to rely on the availability of
the capital markets to fund a significant portion of the cash consideration and continued to be conditioned on obtaining Party B
stockholder approval. The parties also delivered comments on a draft merger agreement to Latham & Watkins LLP (“Latham &
Watkins”), CWEI’s legal advisor.

On January 6, 2017, the CWEI board held a meeting whereby CWEI senior management and representatives of Evercore and
Goldman Sachs provided an update on the transaction’s progress. The directors were briefed on Noble’s and Party B’s revised
proposals. The directors discussed their belief that Noble’s stock was more liquid than Party B’s stock due to a larger market
capitalization and higher daily trading volume, and that Noble’s bid had less deal

risk due to the lack of a required stockholder vote and financing contingency. Representatives of Latham & Watkins also
commented on the merger agreement markups and how, other than Party B’s financing contingency and stockholder approval
requirements, the drafts were materially similar. Representatives of Richards, Layton & Finger, PA (“Richards, Layton & Finger”),
CWEI’s Delaware legal counsel, and Latham & Watkins provided an overview of the fiduciary duties governing transactions of this
nature. Various deal protection provisions, such as go shop, no shop and termination provisions, were also discussed. A
representative of Richards, Layton & Finger also discussed a general preview of potential conflicts that could arise in a potential
transaction and the need to assess the existence of any board member conflicts of interest. Members of CWEI senior management
discussed a standalone valuation of CWEI that they had prepared and the underlying assumptions used to prepare the standalone
valuation. After further consultation with CWEI senior management and CWEI’s financial and legal advisors, the CWEI board
authorized CWEI senior management to continue discussions with both parties and requested that they deliver their final and best
proposals by January 9, 2017.

On January 6, 2017, representatives of Evercore contacted Party B and on January 7, 2017, representatives of Evercore
contacted Noble and informed them they were each one of two remaining potential counterparties identified by the CWEI board
regarding a potential transaction and conveyed the request for final and best proposals by January 9, 2017. It was also conveyed to
Party B that the CWEI board had concerns with respect to Party B’s financing contingency and asked Party B to provide more detail
with respect to its financing plan.

On January 9, 2017, both Noble and Party B submitted updated written proposals to Mr. Riggs. Noble increased its proposed
consideration for each CWEI common share from $32.75 of cash and 2.5747 Noble common shares to $34.75 of cash and 2.7874
Noble common shares, an increase in the implied value of each CWEI common share from $131 to $139. Party B increased its
proposed total consideration by $3.00 per share, with an implied per share offer of $138 per CWEI common share. Party B’s
proposed offer continued to rely on the availability of the capital markets to fund a significant portion of the cash consideration and
remained subject to approval by Party B’s stockholders. In addition, Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP (“Skadden,
Arps”), Noble’s outside counsel, delivered to Latham & Watkins a proposed form of support agreement for the proposed transaction.

On January 9, 2017 and January 10, 2017, the Audit Committee of the CWEI board held telephonic meetings to discuss
potential conflicts of interest relating to the proposed transaction, including a potential make-whole payment to be received by Ares
Management in connection with its term loan to CWEI and a change of control transaction, the form of consideration Ares
Management would receive with respect to its warrants to purchase CWEI common shares, Mr. Ronald D. Scott’s role as chief
executive officer of an affiliate of Ares Management and the compensation to be received by directors and officers in connection
with a change of control. The CWEI Audit Committee determined that none of these potential conflicts should preclude the
applicable directors from participating in the deliberations regarding a potential transaction. Further, the Audit Committee
confirmed that it was not aware of anything that would limit the ability of Evercore and Goldman Sachs to fulfill their respective
responsibilities as financial advisors to CWEI in connection with their respective engagements.

On January 10, 2017, representatives from Evercore, Goldman Sachs and Latham & Watkins had a telephone call with
representatives of Party B to discuss its financing contingency and plan to access the capital markets. Party B represented that it had
not yet contacted potential investors, but was confident that it could raise $1.4 billion in the equity capital markets within one week
after announcement and an additional $500 million in the debt capital markets within four to six weeks after announcement.

On January 10, 2017, the CWEI board held a telephonic meeting whereby CWEI senior management and representatives of
Evercore and Goldman Sachs provided an update on the transaction’s progress and a summary of the revised proposals. The
directors were briefed on Noble’s and Party B’s best and final proposals as well as the telephone conversation regarding Party B’s
financing contingency and plan to access the capital markets. The directors concluded that Noble’s higher per share proposal, lack
of financing contingency and lack of stockholder vote requirement, and greater liquidity in its stock resulted in Noble’s proposal
being superior to Party B’s proposal. In addition, the directors concluded that in light of risks associated with CWEI’s ability to
implement its standalone business plan, Noble’s proposal was superior to what CWEI was likely to achieve on a standalone basis.
The CWEI board authorized CWEI senior management to continue discussions with Noble and to negotiate final transaction
documents. Evercore was instructed by CWEI senior management to notify Party B that the CWEI board had concerns over its
financing contingency and plan to access the capital markets.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

On January 10, 2017, representatives from Evercore spoke with representatives of Petrie Partners and Noble and stated that
Latham & Watkins would contact Skadden, Arps to finalize the merger agreement and other documentation. On that same date,
representatives from Latham & Watkins sent a revised merger agreement to Skadden, Arps.

On January 11, 2017, representatives from Evercore spoke with representatives of Party B and explained that the CWEI board
continued to be concerned with the financing plan and contingency.

On January 12, 2017, CWEI senior management distributed the draft merger agreement and a summary of the key terms to the
CWEI board.

On January 12, 2017, the Audit Committee of the CWEI board held a telephonic meeting to discuss potential conflicts of
interest, including a potential make-whole payment to be received by Ares Management in connection with its term loan to CWEI
and a change of control transaction, Mr. Scott’s role as chief executive officer of an affiliate of Ares Management and the
compensation to be received by Mr. Riggs upon a change of control pursuant to the terms of his employment agreement. The Audit
Committee determined that none of these potential conflicts would affect the ability of any member of the CWEI board to
participate in the deliberations and to vote regarding the potential transaction. The Audit Committee also approved certain aspects of
ancillary agreements to the transaction involving affiliates of CWEI.

On January 12, 2017, the Compensation Committee of the CWEI board held a telephonic meeting to discuss certain aspects of
the transaction and approved the retention and severance plan arrangements contemplated by the proposed transaction.

On January 13, 2017, the CWEI board held a special meeting, together with members of CWEI senior management and
representatives of Evercore, Goldman Sachs, Latham & Watkins and Richards, Layton & Finger, to consider the proposed
transaction. CWEI senior management provided an update on the status of negotiations with Noble, and representatives of Goldman
Sachs provided certain financial analyses of the proposed merger consideration. Representatives of Latham & Watkins provided an
updated draft of the merger agreement and reviewed the terms thereof and the terms of ancillary agreements related thereto with the
CWEI board. Goldman Sachs then rendered its oral opinion, which was subsequently confirmed in writing, to the CWEI board that,
as of that date, and based upon and subject to the factors, assumptions and limitations set forth in such written opinion, the
aggregate consideration to be paid to the holders (other than Noble and its affiliates) of CWEI common shares pursuant to the
merger agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. Following additional discussion, the CWEI board
unanimously determined that the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger, were advisable
and in the best interests of CWEI and its stockholders, and to recommend that CWEI’s stockholders adopt the merger agreement.

On January 13, 2017, the board of directors of Noble approved the merger agreement. Later in the evening on January 13,
2017, the parties executed the merger agreement and, on January 16, 2017, issued a joint press release announcing the transaction.

In the months following the announcement of the merger, the Audit Committee of the CWEI board, acting on behalf of the
CWEI board, consented in advance to the entrance by Goldman Sachs into the ETF transaction (as defined below) with affiliates of
Ares Management (the “Ares parties”), to any future entrance by Goldman Sachs or its affiliates into substantially similar hedging
transactions with other CWEI stockholders, including Mr. Williams and The Williams Children’s Partnership, Ltd., and to the Ares
parties and other CWEI stockholders, including Mr. Williams and The Williams Children’s Partnership, Ltd., and Goldman Sachs
discussing and negotiating prior to the closing of the merger post-closing hedge transactions (as defined below) with Goldman
Sachs as counterparty. The ETF transaction and the post-closing hedge transactions are further described in the section entitled “—
Opinion of CWEI’s Financial Advisor—The Hedge Transactions” beginning on page 38. The Audit Committee of the CWEI board
discussed the general structure of the proposed hedging transactions, Goldman Sachs’ earlier presentations to the Ares parties about
the opportunity to hedge exposure to the Noble common shares included in the merger consideration, and the representation by
Goldman Sachs to CWEI that, if CWEI were to request additional services from Goldman Sachs under the engagement letter
between CWEI and Goldman Sachs before the closing of the merger and either Goldman Sachs or CWEI determined in good faith
that Goldman Sachs was no longer able to fulfill its responsibilities as financial advisor to CWEI in connection with the engagement
under such engagement letter as a result of the ETF transaction, such other hedging transactions with Goldman Sachs or its affiliates
or such discussions and negotiations regarding any post-closing hedging transaction, Goldman Sachs and CWEI would

negotiate in good faith appropriate modifications to such engagement letter, including a reduction of the fees payable to Goldman
Sachs under such engagement letter to offset the retention of a different financial advisor by CWEI to fulfill the responsibilities that
Goldman Sachs was no longer in a position to fulfill.

Rationale for the Merger

In the course of their discussions, both Noble and CWEI identified substantial potential strategic and financial benefits of the
proposed merger. This section summarizes the principal potential strategic and financial benefits that the parties expect to realize in
the merger. For a discussion of various factors that could prevent or limit the parties from realizing some or all of these benefits, see
“Risk Factors” beginning on page 16.

Both Noble and CWEI think that the merger will enhance stockholder value through, among other things, enabling Noble and
CWEI to capitalize on the following strategic advantages and opportunities:

• Diversification; Scale and Scope. The merger will enhance the regional and commodity diversity of the combined
company, as compared to Noble and CWEI individually, providing greater portfolio balance, diversity and investment
optionality. The addition of the CWEI assets will strengthen Noble’s portfolio in the Southern Delaware Basin, creating
the industry’s second largest Southern Delaware Basin acreage position and provides more than 4,200 drilling locations on
approximately 120,000 net acres, with over 2 billion barrels of oil equivalent in net unrisked resource, including 71,000
highly contiguous net acres in the core of the Southern Delaware Basin in Reeves and Ward counties in Texas (directly
adjacent to Noble’s existing 47,200 net acres). In addition, there are over 100,000 net acres in other areas of the Permian
Basin.

• Accelerated Asset Development. The merger is expected to accelerate value delivery from the CWEI asset base. The
CWEI assets provide a core area of materiality to the combined company with room for growth and expansion. Noble has
the strong financial position and robust liquidity required to fully develop the CWEI assets, including a strong balance
sheet and financial capacity. Noble’s outlook is to increase production on the acquired assets from 10 MBoe/d currently
(70% oil) to approximately 60 MBoe/d in 2020 in Noble’s base plan.

• Technical Synergies. The merger will bring together two complementary companies, creating synergies that capitalize on
the experienced management and technical expertise of both Noble and CWEI. The merger will allow the combined
company to leverage Noble’s existing United States onshore expertise.

• Ability to Participate in Future Growth of the Combined Company. The Noble common shares issued pursuant to the
merger will allow both Noble and CWEI stockholders to participate in the substantial upside of the combined company.

The actual synergistic benefits from the merger could be different from the foregoing estimates and these differences could be
material. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that any of the potential benefits described above or included in the factors
considered by the Noble board of directors described under “—Noble’s Reasons for the Merger” beginning on page 30 or by the
CWEI board described under “—CWEI Board Recommendation and Its Reasons for the Merger” beginning on page 30 will be
realized. See “Risk Factors” and “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” beginning on pages 16 and 23,
respectively.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Noble’s Reasons for the Merger

In evaluating the merger, in addition to the specific reasons described under “—Rationale for the Merger” beginning on page
29, Noble considered a variety of factors, including:

• Noble’s knowledge of CWEI’s business, operations, financial condition, earnings and prospects, taking into account the
results of Noble’s due diligence review of CWEI.

• The prevailing macroeconomic conditions, and the economic environment of the industries in which Noble and CWEI
operate, which Noble viewed as supporting the rationale for seeking a strategic transaction that should create a stronger,
more diversified combined company that will be better positioned to benefit from future growth in the general U.S.
economy and the potential for higher future crude oil and natural gas prices.

• Noble’s technical evaluation of CWEI assets, which included the following:

• geologic analysis and interpretations of Delaware Wolfcamp to identify undeveloped inventory by geologic horizon;

• analysis of existing wells and other operators’ offset performance to prepare forecasts for all CWEI producing wells;

• development of normalized type curves for Wolfcamp to create cases for long lateral wells; and

• development of an economic model to perform discounted cash flow analysis of CWEI properties and calculated
present value for numerous potential development scenarios at a variety of product, price and cost scenarios.

• The strong commitment on the part of both parties to complete the merger pursuant to their respective obligations under
the terms of the merger agreement.

• The expectation that the merger and the second merger, considered together, will qualify as a “reorganization” within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and the likelihood of completing the merger on the anticipated schedule.

CWEI Board Recommendation and Its Reasons for the Merger

At a meeting on January 13, 2017, the CWEI board, by unanimous vote, (i) determined that the merger agreement and the
transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger, are advisable and in the best interests of CWEI and its stockholders, (ii)
approved the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the second merger, and (iii) determined to
recommend that the holders of CWEI common shares vote to adopt the merger agreement.

In evaluating the merger, the CWEI board consulted with CWEI’s management, as well as CWEI’s legal and financial advisors,
and, in reaching its conclusion, considered the following factors in addition to the specific reasons described under “—Rationale for
the Merger” beginning on page 29:

• The CWEI board’s knowledge of CWEI’s business, operations, financial condition, earnings and prospects and of Noble’s
business, operations, financial condition, earnings and prospects, taking into account the results of CWEI’s due diligence
review of Noble.

• Subject to the election rights of CWEI stockholders and CWEI warrant holders and subject to proration, the merger
agreement provides that each CWEI stockholder and CWEI warrant holder will have the right to receive, in the aggregate,
2.7874 Noble common shares and $34.75 in cash for each CWEI common share held, which the CWEI board noted
constituted an improvement over Noble’s initial proposal of 1.9413 Noble common shares and $51.20 in cash per CWEI
common share.

• The merger consideration, with an implied value of $138.39 per CWEI common share based on the closing price of Noble
common shares on January 12, 2017, represents a:

• 30.1% premium to the closing price of CWEI common shares on January 12, 2017; and

TABLE OF CONTENTS

• The share-election exchange ratio and the mixed-election exchange ratio are fixed and therefore the value of the
consideration payable to CWEI stockholders will increase or decrease in the event that the market price of Noble common
shares increases or decreases prior to the closing of the merger. Following the merger, former CWEI stockholders who
continue to hold Noble common shares will participate in future increases or decreases in the market price of Noble
common shares.

• Based on the implied value of the merger consideration as of January 13, 2017, CWEI stockholders would own
approximately 11% of the combined company on a pro forma basis.

• CWEI had explored a variety of strategic alternatives, including CWEI’s prospects on a standalone basis and discussions
regarding a potential strategic transaction with a number of parties identified by CWEI, and, following discussions with its
financial advisors, concluded that the transaction with Noble offered the greatest potential for CWEI to engage in a
strategic transaction at that time.

• The CWEI board retained financial and legal advisors with knowledge and experience with respect to public merger and
acquisition transactions, CWEI’s and Noble’s industry generally and CWEI particularly, as well as substantial experience
advising other E&P companies with respect to transactions similar to the merger.

• The financial analyses and presentations of Evercore and Goldman Sachs to the CWEI board with respect to CWEI and
Noble, and Goldman Sachs’ related written opinion, dated as of January 13, 2017, to the effect that, as of January 13,
2017, and based upon and subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and limitations on
the review undertaken in connection with the opinion, the merger consideration to be paid to the holders (other than Noble
and its affiliates) of CWEI common shares pursuant to the merger agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to
such holders. See “—Opinion of CWEI’s Financial Advisor” and Annex B to this proxy statement/prospectus, which set
forth assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken in connection
with the opinion. The full text of the written opinion of Goldman Sachs opinion is attached as Annex B and is incorporated
by reference into this section of the proxy statement/prospectus.

• The potential stockholder value that might result from other alternatives available to CWEI, including the alternative of
remaining as an independent public company, considering, in particular, the potential for CWEI stockholders to share in
future revenues, costs, earnings and cash flows and risks and uncertainties associated with continuing to operate as a
public company.

• The CWEI board’s view that the merger provides CWEI stockholders with equity ownership in an entity with a diversified
platform of assets, a lower cost of capital than CWEI and an investment grade credit rating and that the resulting combined
company’s lower cost of capital is expected to allow CWEI’s stockholders to benefit from the investment grade rating of
the combined company and reduce the cost of funding, in a depressed commodity price environment, the capital program
for the CWEI assets which will be part of the combined company.

• The CWEI board’s review, in consultation with CWEI’s legal advisors, of the structure of the merger and the financial and
other terms and conditions of the merger agreement, including the merger consideration, the CWEI board’s expectation
that the merger and the second merger, considered together, will qualify as a “reorganization” within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code and the CWEI board’s view of the likelihood of completing the merger on the anticipated
schedule.

• The terms of the merger agreement, principally:

• the provisions allowing the CWEI board to withdraw or change its recommendation of or to terminate the merger
agreement, subject to the payment of a specified termination fee upon termination under certain circumstances, in the
event of a superior proposal, or to change its recommendation in the event of certain intervening events, if the CWEI
board makes a good faith determination that the failure to change its recommendation or terminate the merger
agreement would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law;

• the fact that the provisions do not provide for a vote of Noble’s stockholders to approve the merger; and

• the fact that the consummation of the merger is not conditioned on financing.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

• The CWEI board’s understanding of, and management’s review of, overall market conditions, including then-current and
prospective commodity prices and the current and historical trading prices for CWEI and Noble common stock, and the
CWEI board’s determination that, in light of these factors, the timing of the potential transaction was favorable to CWEI.

• The complementary nature of CWEI’s and Noble’s assets in the Delaware Basin. In this regard, the CWEI board also
considered the prospects of the combined company.

• CWEI management’s recommendation in favor of the merger.

The CWEI board also considered potential risks and potentially negative factors concerning the merger in connection with its
deliberations of the proposed transaction, including:

• The fact that the share-election exchange ratio and the mixed-election exchange ratio are fixed and therefore the value of
the consideration payable to CWEI stockholders will decrease in the event that the market price of Noble common shares
decreases prior to the closing of the merger.

• The fact that, depending on the elections made by the CWEI stockholders, there may be a proration of the share-election
consideration and the cash-election consideration to ensure that aggregate number of Noble common shares and the
aggregate amount of cash paid in the merger will be the same as if all CWEI stockholders received 2.7874 Noble common
shares and $34.75 in cash per CWEI common share held (or warrant notional common share held), which may deprive
some CWEI stockholders of the immediate certainty of the cash-election consideration or may deprive some CWEI
stockholders of the opportunity to participate fully in the value of the combined company.

• The possibility that the merger may not be completed, or that completion may be unduly delayed, for reasons beyond the
control of CWEI and Noble, which could result in significant costs and disruption to CWEI’s normal business.

• Certain terms of the merger agreement, principally:

• restrictions on the ability of CWEI to solicit offers for alternative proposals or to engage in discussions regarding
such proposals, subject to exceptions, which could have the effect of discouraging such proposals from being made or
pursued. The CWEI board understood that these provisions, which the CWEI board was advised were fairly standard,
may have the effect of discouraging alternative proposals and may make it less likely that the transactions related to
such proposals would be negotiated or pursued, even if potentially more favorable to the CWEI stockholders than the
merger;

• the termination fee that would be payable by CWEI in connection with a termination of the merger agreement as a
result of a superior proposal for CWEI, which, although within the range of such fees normally seen in similar
transactions, could have the effect of discouraging an alternative proposal for CWEI; and

• restrictions on the conduct of CWEI’s business during the period between the signing of the merger agreement and
completion of the merger.

• The fact that CWEI’s stockholders will be foregoing the potential benefits, if any, that could be realized by remaining as
stockholders of CWEI as a standalone entity.

• The potential for diversion of management and employee attention and for increased employee attrition during the period
prior to completion of the merger, and the potential effect of the merger on CWEI’s business and relations with customers,
suppliers and regulators.

• The substantial costs to be incurred in connection with the merger, including the costs of integrating the businesses of
CWEI and Noble and the transaction expenses arising from the merger.

• The risks of the type and nature described under “Risk Factors” beginning on page 16, and the matters described under
“Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” beginning on page 23.

The foregoing discussion is not intended to be exhaustive, but is intended to address the material information and principal
factors considered by the CWEI board in considering the merger. In view of the number and variety of factors and the amount of
information considered, the CWEI board did not find it practicable to, and did not make specific assessments of, quantify or
otherwise assign relative weights to, the specific factors considered in reaching

its determination. In addition, the CWEI board did not undertake to make any specific determination as to whether any particular
factor, or any aspect of any particular factor, was favorable or unfavorable to its ultimate determination, and individual members of
the CWEI board may have given different weights to different factors.

The CWEI board made its recommendation based on the totality of information presented to, and the investigation conducted
by, the CWEI board. It should be noted that certain statements and other information presented in this section are forward-looking in
nature and, therefore, should be read in light of the factors discussed under the heading “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-
Looking Statements” beginning on page 23.

The CWEI board recommends that CWEI stockholders vote “FOR” the merger proposal, “FOR” the adjournment
proposal, if necessary to solicit additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes to approve the merger proposal at the time
of the CWEI special meeting, and “FOR” the advisory compensation proposal.

Opinion of CWEI’s Financial Advisor

On January 13, 2017, Goldman Sachs delivered its opinion to the CWEI board that, as of such date and based upon and subject
to the factors and assumptions set forth therein, the merger consideration to be paid to the holders (other than Noble and its
affiliates) of CWEI common shares pursuant to the merger agreement was fair from a financial point of view to such holders.

The full text of the written opinion of Goldman Sachs, dated January 13, 2017, which sets forth assumptions made,
procedures followed, matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken in connection with the opinion, is
attached as Annex B and is incorporated by reference into this proxy statement/prospectus. The summary of the opinion of
Goldman Sachs in this proxy statement/prospectus is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the opinion.

Goldman Sachs provided advisory services and its opinion for the information and assistance of the CWEI board in
connection with its consideration of the merger. The Goldman Sachs opinion is not a recommendation as to how any holder
of CWEI common shares should vote with respect to the merger or any other matter.

In connection with rendering the opinion described above and performing its related financial analyses, Goldman Sachs
reviewed, among other things:

• the merger agreement;

• annual reports to stockholders and annual reports on Form 10-K of CWEI and Noble for the five fiscal years ended
December 31, 2015;

• certain interim reports to stockholders and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q of CWEI and Noble;

• certain other communications from CWEI and Noble to their respective stockholders;

• certain publicly available research analyst reports for CWEI and Noble; and

• certain internal financial analyses and forecasts for CWEI prepared by its management (the “CWEI forecasts”), certain
internal financial analyses and forecasts for Noble standalone prepared by its management (the “Noble standalone
forecasts”), and certain financial analyses and forecasts for Noble pro forma for the merger prepared by the management
of CWEI (the “Noble pro forma forecasts” and, together with the CWEI forecasts and the Noble standalone forecasts, the
“forecasts”), in each case, as approved for Goldman Sachs’ use by CWEI, including certain operating synergies projected
by the management of CWEI to result from the merger (the “synergies”), as approved for Goldman Sachs’ use by CWEI.

Goldman Sachs also held discussions with members of the senior managements of CWEI and Noble regarding their assessment
of the strategic rationale for, and the potential benefits of, the merger and the past and current business operations, financial
condition, and future prospects of Noble and with members of the senior management of CWEI regarding their assessment of the
past and current business operations, financial condition and future prospects of CWEI; reviewed the reported price and trading
activity for the CWEI common shares and the Noble common shares; compared certain financial and stock market information for
CWEI and Noble with similar information for certain other companies the securities of which are publicly traded; reviewed the
financial terms of certain recent business combinations in the oil and gas industry; and performed such other studies and analyses,
and considered such other factors, as it deemed appropriate.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

For purposes of rendering this opinion, Goldman Sachs, with CWEI’s consent, relied upon and assumed the accuracy and
completeness of all of the financial, legal, regulatory, tax, accounting and other information provided to, discussed with or reviewed
by, it, without assuming any responsibility for independent verification thereof. In that regard, Goldman Sachs assumed with
CWEI’s consent that the forecasts, including the synergies, were reasonably prepared on a basis reflecting the best currently
available estimates and judgments of the management of CWEI. Goldman Sachs did not make an independent evaluation or
appraisal of the assets and liabilities (including any contingent, derivative or other off-balance-sheet assets and liabilities) of CWEI,
Noble or any of their respective subsidiaries and it was not furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal. Goldman Sachs
assumed that all governmental, regulatory or other consents and approvals necessary for the consummation of the merger will be
obtained without any adverse effect on CWEI or Noble or on the expected benefits of the merger in any way meaningful to its
analysis. Goldman Sachs has also assumed that the merger will be consummated on the terms set forth in the merger agreement,
without the waiver or modification of any term or condition the effect of which would be in any way meaningful to its analysis.

Goldman Sachs’ opinion does not address the underlying business decision of CWEI to engage in the merger or the relative
merits of the merger as compared to any strategic alternatives that may be available to CWEI; nor does it address any legal,
regulatory, tax or accounting matters. Goldman Sachs’ opinion addresses only the fairness from a financial point of view, as of the
date of the opinion, of the merger consideration to be paid to the holders (other than Noble and its affiliates) of CWEI common
shares pursuant to the merger agreement. Goldman Sachs’ opinion does not express any view on, and does not address, any other
term or aspect of the merger agreement or the merger or any term or aspect of any other agreement or instrument contemplated by
the merger agreement or entered into or amended in connection with the transaction, including the fairness of the merger to, or any
consideration received in connection therewith by, the holders of any other class of securities, creditors, or other constituencies of
CWEI; nor as to the fairness of the amount or nature of any compensation to be paid or payable to any of the officers, directors or
employees of CWEI, or class of such persons in connection with the merger, whether relative to the merger consideration to be paid
to the holders (other than Noble and its affiliates) of CWEI common shares pursuant to the merger agreement or otherwise. In
addition, Goldman Sachs does not express any opinion as to the prices at which Noble common shares will trade at any time or as to
the impact of the merger on the solvency or viability of CWEI or Noble or the ability of CWEI or Noble to pay their respective
obligations when they come due. Goldman Sachs’ opinion was necessarily based on economic, monetary market and other
conditions, as in effect on, and the information made available to it as of the date of the opinion and Goldman Sachs assumed no
responsibility for updating, revising or reaffirming its opinion based on circumstances, developments or events occurring after the
date of its opinion. Goldman Sachs’ opinion was approved by a fairness committee of Goldman Sachs.

The following is a summary of the material financial analyses delivered by Goldman Sachs to the board of directors of CWEI
in connection with rendering the opinion described above. The following summary, however, does not purport to be a complete
description of the financial analyses performed by Goldman Sachs, nor does the order of analyses described represent relative
importance or weight given to those analyses by Goldman Sachs. Some of the summaries of the financial analyses include
information presented in tabular format. The tables must be read together with the full text of each summary and are alone not a
complete description of Goldman Sachs’ financial analyses. Except as otherwise noted, the following quantitative information, to
the extent that it is based on market data, is based on market data as it existed on or before January 12, 2017, and is not necessarily
indicative of current market conditions.

Historical Stock Trading Analysis. Goldman Sachs analyzed the $138.39 implied consideration per CWEI common share
represented by the merger consideration (which implied consideration was obtained by multiplying the 2.7874 mixed-election
exchange ratio by the $37.18 closing price of Noble common shares on January 12, 2017 and adding to the product thereof the
$34.75 in mixed-election cash consideration) in relation to (i) the closing price of CWEI common shares on January 12, 2017, (ii)
the volume weighted average price per CWEI common share over the one-month and twelve-month periods ended January 12, 2017
and (iii) the highest and lowest closing price per CWEI common share over the 52-week period ended January 12, 2017.

This analysis indicated that the implied price per share to be paid to CWEI stockholders pursuant to the merger agreement
represented:

• a premium of 30.1% based on the closing price of $106.40 per share as of January 12, 2017;

TABLE OF CONTENTS

• a premium of 23.5% based on the volume weighted average price of $112.08 per share for the one-month period ended
January 12, 2017;

• a premium of 193.1% based on the volume weighted average price of $47.21 per share for the twelve-month period ended
January 12, 2017;

• a premium of 12.6% based on the high closing price of $122.87 per share for the 52-week period ended January 12, 2017;
and

• a premium of 1,838.2% based on the low closing price of $7.14 per share for the 52-week period ended January 12, 2017.

Illustrative Net Asset Value Analysis. Goldman Sachs performed an illustrative net asset value analysis of CWEI. Goldman
Sachs calculated indications of the present value of the after-tax future cash flows that CWEI could be expected to generate from its
existing proved developed reserves, developed non-producing reserves and undeveloped resources as of December 31, 2016 using
the CWEI forecasts. Goldman Sachs calculated indications of net present values of the after-tax cash flows for CWEI using discount
rates ranging from 10.5% to 12.5%, reflecting an estimate of CWEI’s weighted average cost of capital. Goldman Sachs then
calculated indications of CWEI’s illustrative net asset value by adding (i) the illustrative discounted after-tax cash flows calculated
above, plus (ii) (A) the value of net undeveloped acreage owned by CWEI in Ward County, Texas and Eddy and Lea Counties, New
Mexico and (B) the value of midstream facilities owned by CWEI, in each case, using value estimates provided by the management
of CWEI for Goldman Sachs’ use, minus (iii) (A) the present value of general and administrative costs, (B) the present value of
estimated mark to market commodity hedges, (C) the face value of CWEI’s net debt as of December 31, 2016 (pro forma for $44
million acquisition per the management of CWEI) and (D) the present value of taxes payable by Clayton Williams, calculated using
the CWEI forecasts and CWEI’s net debt provided by the management of CWEI for Goldman Sachs’ use and by applying discount
rates ranging from 10.5% to 12.5%, reflecting an estimate of CWEI’s weighted average cost of capital. This analysis implied an
illustrative range of net asset values per CWEI common share from $93.43 to $124.59.

Illustrative Present Value of Future Share Price Analysis. Goldman Sachs performed an illustrative analysis of the implied
present value of the future value per CWEI common share on a standalone basis and the Noble common shares pro forma for the
merger, which is designed to provide an indication of the present value of a theoretical future value of CWEI’s equity on a
standalone basis and Noble’s equity pro forma for the merger as a function of estimated future EBITDA and one-year forward
EV/EBITDA multiples.

CWEI. For the analysis of CWEI common shares on a standalone basis, Goldman Sachs used the CWEI forecasts for each of
the fiscal years ending December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2020. Goldman Sachs first calculated the implied values per CWEI
common share as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2019 on a standalone basis by applying one-year forward EV/EBITDA
multiples ranging from 7.5x to 9.5x to estimated EBITDA for fiscal years 2019 and 2020 as reflected in the CWEI forecasts.
Goldman Sachs then discounted to present value as of December 31, 2016, using an illustrative discount rate of 14.1%, reflecting an
estimate of CWEI’s cost of equity, the theoretical future value of CWEI common shares as of December 31, 2018 and December 31,
2019. This analysis resulted in a range of implied present values of $62.44 to $144.53 per CWEI common share.

Noble Pro Forma. For the analysis of the Noble common shares pro forma for the merger, Goldman Sachs used the Noble pro
forma forecasts for each of the fiscal years ending December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2020. Goldman Sachs first calculated the
implied values per Noble common share as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2019 pro forma for the merger, by applying
one-year forward EV/EBITDA multiples ranging from 6.0x to 8.5x to estimated EBITDA for fiscal years 2019 and 2020 as
reflected in the Noble pro forma forecasts. Goldman Sachs then added to the implied values per share an aggregate amount of per
share dividends estimated to be paid by Noble through December 31, 2018 or December 31, 2019, as applicable, as reflected in the
Noble pro forma forecasts. Goldman Sachs then discounted to present value as of December 31, 2016, using an illustrative discount
rate of 11.1%, reflecting an estimate of Noble’s cost of equity pro forma for the merger, the theoretical value of the Noble common
shares pro forma for the merger as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2019. This analysis resulted in a range of implied
present values of $24.73 to $51.86 per Noble common share pro forma for the merger.

Goldman Sachs then calculated an illustrative range of implied values per CWEI common share, taking into account the
mixed-election exchange ratio and mixed-election cash consideration, of Noble pro forma for the merger

TABLE OF CONTENTS

using the illustrative CWEI and Noble pro forma for the merger present value of future stock price analyses described above.
Goldman Sachs discounted to present value as of December 31, 2016, using an illustrative discount rate of 11.1%, reflecting an
estimate of Noble’s cost of equity pro forma for the merger, these illustrative implied per share values. This analysis resulted in an
illustrative range of $103.68 to $179.32 per CWEI common share.

Selected Transactions Analysis. Goldman Sachs analyzed certain information relating to the following selected transactions
involving oil and gas-related assets in the Delaware Basin region since July 2016 for aggregate consideration greater than $100
million:

• Silver Run Acquisition Corporation’s acquisition of an 89% interest in Centennial Resource Production, LLC (announced
July 2016);

• Diamondback Energy Inc.’s acquisition of certain assets from Luxe Energy LLC (announced July 2016);

• PDC Energy Inc.’s acquisition of certain companies managed by Kimmeridge Energy Management Company (announced
August 2016);

• Resolute Energy Corporation’s acquisition of certain assets from Firewheel Energy, LLC (announced October 2016);

• RSP Permian Inc.’s acquisition of Silver Hill Energy Partners, LLC and Silver Hill E&P II, LLC (announced October
2016);

• Occidental Petroleum Corp.’s acquisition of certain assets from an undisclosed seller (announced in October 2016);

• Concho Resources Inc., acquisition of certain assets from an undisclosed seller (announced November 2016);

• Centennial Resource Development, Inc.’s acquisition of certain assets of Silverback Exploration, LLC (announced
November 2016);

• Callon Petroleum Company’s acquisition of certain assets of American Resource Development LLC (announced
December 2016);

• Diamondback Energy Inc.’s acquisition of Brigham Resources Operating, LLC (announced December 2016); and

• Parsley Energy, Inc.’s acquisition of certain assets from an undisclosed seller (announced January 2017).

While none of the companies or assets that were sold in the selected transactions are directly comparable to CWEI or its assets,
the companies or assets sold in the selected transactions, for the purposes of analysis, may be considered similar to certain of
CWEI’s assets.

For each of the selected transactions, Goldman Sachs calculated adjusted price per acre multiples by subtracting the estimated
value of current production at an illustrative $30,000 per flowing barrel of oil equivalent per day from the transaction value for such
selected transaction and then dividing the remaining value by the estimated net acreage acquired in the selected transaction as
provided by the management of CWEI for Goldman Sachs’ use. This analysis resulted in illustrative adjusted price per acre
multiples ranging from $21,429 to $47,561. Goldman Sachs then applied the illustrative adjusted price per acre multiples to the
estimate of 73,591 total net acres owned by CWEI in the Delaware Basin region provided by management of CWEI for Goldman
Sachs’ use, which resulted in an illustrative range of prices per CWEI common share of $78.16 to $176.57.

Illustrative Noble Pro Forma Discounted Cash Flow Analysis. Goldman Sachs performed an illustrative discounted cash flow
analysis of Noble pro forma for the merger. In performing this analysis, Goldman Sachs used the Noble pro forma forecasts. For
purposes of this analysis, Goldman Sachs discounted to present value (i) estimates of unlevered free cash flows for the years ending
on December 31, 2017 through December 31, 2021 for Noble pro forma for the merger and (ii) the terminal enterprise value of
Noble pro forma for the merger as of December 31, 2016 derived by multiplying estimated 2021 EBITDA by multiples ranging
from 7.00x to 10.00x. The estimated unlevered free cash flows and terminal enterprise value were discounted to present value using
discount rates ranging from 7.5% to 9.5%, reflecting an estimate of the weighted average cost of capital for Noble pro forma for the
merger. Goldman Sachs derived ranges of illustrative enterprise values for Noble pro forma for the merger by adding the ranges of
present values it derived above. Goldman Sachs then subtracted from the range of illustrative enterprise

values it derived for Noble pro forma for the merger net debt of Noble pro forma for the merger as of December 31, 2016, as set
forth in the Noble pro forma forecasts to derive a range of illustrative equity values for Noble pro forma for the merger. Goldman
Sachs then divided the range of illustrative equity values it derived by the number of fully diluted outstanding shares of Noble pro
forma for the merger as set forth in the Noble pro forma forecasts. Goldman Sachs then calculated an implied equity value per
CWEI common share based on the mixed-election exchange ratio and the mixed-election cash consideration, resulting in a range of
$150.58 to $228.79.

General

The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary
description. Selecting portions of the analyses or of the summary set forth above, without considering the analyses as a whole, could
create an incomplete view of the processes underlying Goldman Sachs’ opinion. In arriving at its fairness determination, Goldman
Sachs considered the results of all of its analyses and did not attribute any particular weight to any factor or analysis considered by
it. Rather, Goldman Sachs made its determination as to fairness on the basis of its experience and professional judgment after
considering the results of all of its analyses. No company or transaction used in the above analyses as a comparison is directly
comparable to CWEI.

Goldman Sachs prepared these analyses for purposes of Goldman Sachs’ providing its opinion to the CWEI board as to the
fairness from a financial point of view of the merger consideration to be paid to the holders (other than Noble and its affiliates) of
CWEI common shares pursuant to the merger agreement. These analyses do not purport to be appraisals nor do they necessarily
reflect the prices at which businesses or securities actually may be sold. Analyses based upon forecasts of future results are not
necessarily indicative of actual future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by these analyses.
Because these analyses are inherently subject to uncertainty, being based upon numerous factors or events beyond the control of the
parties or their respective advisors, none of CWEI, Noble, Goldman Sachs or any other person assumes responsibility if future
results are materially different from those forecast.

The merger consideration was determined through arm’s-length negotiations between CWEI and Noble and was approved by
the CWEI board. Goldman Sachs provided advice to CWEI during these negotiations. Goldman Sachs did not, however,
recommend any specific amount of consideration to CWEI or the CWEI board or that any specific amount of consideration
constituted the only appropriate consideration for the merger.

As described above, Goldman Sachs’ opinion to the CWEI board was one of many factors taken into consideration by the
CWEI board in making its determination to approve the merger agreement. The foregoing summary does not purport to be a
complete description of the analyses performed by Goldman Sachs in connection with the fairness opinion and is qualified in its
entirety by reference to the written opinion of Goldman Sachs included as Annex B to this proxy statement/prospectus.

Goldman Sachs and its affiliates are engaged in advisory, underwriting and financing, principal investing, sales and trading,
research, investment management and other financial and non-financial activities and services for various persons and entities.
Goldman Sachs and its affiliates and employees, and funds or other entities they manage or in which they invest or have other
economic interests or with which they co-invest, may at any time purchase, sell, hold or vote long or short positions and investments
in securities, derivatives, loans, commodities, currencies, credit default swaps and other financial instruments of CWEI, Noble, any
of their respective affiliates and third parties, including Ares Management, a significant stockholder of CWEI, or any currency or
commodity that may be involved in the transaction contemplated by the merger agreement. Goldman Sachs acted as financial
advisor to CWEI in connection with, and participated in certain of the negotiations leading to, the merger. Goldman Sachs has
provided certain financial advisory and/or underwriting services to CWEI and/or its affiliates from time to time for which the
Investment Banking Division of Goldman Sachs has received, and may receive, compensation, including having acted as sole
arranger with respect to CWEI’s term loan (aggregate principal amount $350 million) in March 2016, financial advisor to CWEI in
connection with its private placement of 5,051,100 CWEI common shares in July 2016 and financial advisor to CWEI in connection
with its sale of assets in the Giddings area in December 2016. Goldman Sachs also has provided certain financial advisory and/or
underwriting services to Noble and/or its affiliates from time to time for which the Investment Banking Division of Goldman Sachs
has received, and may receive, compensation, including having acted as joint book-running manager with respect to the issuance of
24,150,000 Noble common shares in February 2015. Goldman Sachs also has provided certain financial advisory and/or
underwriting services to Ares Management and/or its affiliates and portfolio companies from time to time for which the Investment
Banking Division of Goldman Sachs has received, and may receive, compensation, including having

acted as joint lead arranger with respect to a term loan (aggregate principal amount $720 million) for American Tire Distributors
Inc., a portfolio company of Ares Management, in March 2015, as joint lead arranger with respect to a term loan (aggregate
principal amount $200 million) for CHG Healthcare Services, a portfolio company of Ares Management, in May 2015, as co-
manager with respect to a public offering by Ares Management of its 5.25% Senior Notes due 2025 (aggregate principal amount
$325 million) in August 2015, as financial advisor to Ares Management on its sale of the Allegheny Lock & Dam 8 and Allegheny
Lock & Dam 9 hydro plants in September 2015 and as book runner with respect to a term loan (aggregate principal amount $990
million) for CHG Healthcare Services in May 2016. During the two year period ended January 13, 2017, Goldman Sachs has
received compensation for financial advisory and/or underwriting services provided by its Investment Banking Division to CWEI
and/or its affiliates of approximately $12.4 million, has received compensation for financial advisory and/or underwriting services
provided by its Investment Banking Division to Noble and/or its affiliates of approximately $11.4 million and has received
compensation for financial advisory and/or underwriting services provided by its Investment Banking Division to Ares Management
and/or its affiliates and portfolio companies of approximately $22.9 million. Goldman Sachs may also in the future provide
investment banking services to CWEI and Noble and their respective affiliates and Ares Management and its affiliates and portfolio
companies for which the Investment Banking Division of Goldman Sachs may receive compensation. Affiliates of Goldman Sachs
also may have co-invested with Ares Management and its affiliates from time to time and may have invested in limited partnership
units of affiliates of Ares Management from time to time and may do so in the future.

The CWEI board selected Goldman Sachs as its financial advisor because it is an internationally recognized investment
banking firm that has substantial experience in transactions similar to the merger. Pursuant to a letter agreement dated January 5,
2017, CWEI engaged Goldman Sachs to act as its financial advisor in connection with the contemplated transaction. The
engagement letter between CWEI and Goldman Sachs provides for a transaction fee that is estimated, based on the information
available as of the date of public announcement of the merger, at approximately $14 million, all of which is contingent upon
consummation of the merger. In addition, CWEI has agreed to reimburse Goldman Sachs for certain of its expenses, including
attorneys’ fees and disbursements, and to indemnify Goldman Sachs and related persons against various liabilities, including certain
liabilities under the federal securities laws.

The Hedge Transactions

On February 22, 2017, after the receipt of the consent from CWEI described in “—Background of the Merger” beginning on
page 25, the Ares parties purchased a number of cash-settled only European put options with respect to an exchange traded fund that
tracks the energy sector (the “ETF” and such puts, collectively, the “ETF transaction”) from Goldman Sachs (the “put
counterparty”). At expiration of these put options, the put counterparty would owe the Ares parties cash in an amount equal to the
excess, if any, of the strike price over the market price of the ETF shares at expiration, as determined under the terms of the ETF
transaction. The Ares parties entered into the ETF transaction to help protect against volatility in their energy portfolio, including
with respect to the Noble common shares included in the merger consideration. As of the date of the ETF transactions, less than
1.5% by value of the component securities of the index tracked by the ETF consisted of Noble common shares and the index was
not sponsored by Goldman Sachs or any of its affiliates.

The terms of the ETF transaction are consistent with the put counterparty’s ordinary practices for trades in indexes or exchange
traded funds and do not explicitly include rights to adjust or terminate the ETF transaction based on the occurrence of events
relating to the merger or that are specific to Noble or its securities. The put counterparty is obligated to negotiate in good faith an
early unwind of the ETF transaction at the Ares parties’ request, in which case the put counterparty would unwind any related
internal hedge positions it may have at that time.

The put counterparty entered into, and will be acting as principal under, the ETF transaction for its own account. Therefore, the
put counterparty’s interests may differ from those of CWEI, the Ares parties, CWEI’s other stockholders and Noble, depending on
the occurrence of certain events and market conditions that have a material effect on the price, volatility or other characteristics of
the ETF and its component securities. Accordingly, the put counterparty will look to its own interests and objectives in entering into
and managing the ETF transaction and any related hedging activities, and neither the put counterparty nor any of its affiliates has or
will advise CWEI (or any other person, including the Ares parties) with respect to the ETF transaction.

The put counterparty generally hedges its exposure in transactions such as the ETF transaction in a manner designed so that it
does not take a directional view on the securities underlying such transaction. This hedging may

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/880115/000156761917000509/s001558x6_defm14a.htm 60/224

TABLE OF CONTENTS

include purchasing or selling various securities on a “long” or “short” basis, and entering into and unwinding derivative transactions
with respect to the underlying securities or related securities. This hedging is intended to substantially neutralize the put
counterparty’s exposure to changes in the price of the shares of the underlying securities, is at the put counterparty’s own risk, and
may result in a loss or gain to it in an amount that may be less than or greater than the expected contractual benefit to the put
counterparty under the ETF transaction being hedged, the amount of which will not be known until the ETF transaction has been
exercised or expired and the put counterparty has completed its hedge unwind activities.

In accordance with industry practice, the individuals at the put counterparty who engage in these hedging transactions are
generally separated by institutional information barriers from the Goldman Sachs team that provides financial advisory services to
CWEI. It is the practice of the put counterparty to share a portion of any gain or loss that the put counterparty makes under the ETF
transaction (and any related hedging transactions) with Goldman Sachs’ Investment Banking Division (which division includes the
Goldman Sachs team that provides financial advisory services to CWEI) as representatives of Goldman Sachs’ Investment Banking
Division have been involved in structuring and negotiating the ETF transaction.

The put counterparty or its affiliates may enter into hedging transactions including in a form substantially similar to the ETF
transaction with other CWEI stockholders, including Mr. Williams and The Williams Children’s Partnership, Ltd., prior to the
consummation of the merger. In the event the put counterparty or any of its affiliates enters into such other hedging transactions, it
would be doing so for its own account and under circumstances similar to those described above.

The put counterparty or its affiliates and the Ares parties or other CWEI stockholders, including Mr. Williams and The
Williams Family Partnership Ltd., may enter into discussions and negotiations prior to the closing of the merger regarding hedging
transactions that the Ares parties or such other CWEI stockholders may enter into with the put counterparty or its affiliates as
counterparty after the closing of the merger with respect to the Noble common shares received by such stockholders as merger
consideration (each, a “post-closing hedge transaction”). The put counterparty or its affiliates would generally hedge its exposure in
transactions such as the post-closing hedge transactions in a manner similar to that of the ETF transaction, except that in connection
with the post-closing hedge transactions the put counterparty or its affiliates would likely borrow and sell and/or purchase Noble
securities and/or enter into or unwind derivative transactions with respect to Noble securities.

As described under “—Background of the Merger” beginning on page 25, the Audit Committee of the CWEI board, acting on
behalf of the CWEI board, reviewed and consented in advance to the entrance by the put counterparty and its affiliates into the ETF
transaction and any substantially similar hedging transactions with any CWEI stockholder, including Mr. Williams and The
Williams Children’s Partnership, Ltd., and to the put counterparty and its affiliates and the Ares parties and such other CWEI
stockholders entering into discussions and negotiations prior to the closing of the merger regarding any post-closing hedge
transactions. Goldman Sachs represented to CWEI that, if CWEI were to request additional services from Goldman Sachs under the
engagement letter between CWEI and Goldman Sachs before the closing of the merger and either Goldman Sachs or CWEI
determined in good faith that Goldman Sachs was no longer able to fulfill its responsibilities as financial advisor to CWEI in
connection with the engagement under such engagement letter as a result of the ETF transaction, such other hedging transactions
with Goldman Sachs or its affiliates or such discussions and negotiations regarding any post-closing hedge transaction, Goldman
Sachs and CWEI would negotiate in good faith appropriate modifications to such engagement letter, including a reduction of the
fees payable to Goldman Sachs under such engagement letter to offset the retention of a different financial advisor by CWEI to
fulfill the responsibilities that Goldman Sachs was no longer in a position to fulfill.

Certain Unaudited Financial and Operating Forecasts

CWEI does not, as a matter of course, publicly disclose long-term forecasts or internal projections as to its future performance,
revenues, production, earnings or other results due to, among other reasons, the uncertainty of the underlying assumptions and
estimates. However, CWEI is including the following summaries of certain unaudited financial and operating forecasts of CWEI
and unaudited pro forma financial and operating forecasts of Noble because they were made available to the CWEI board and
Goldman Sachs in connection with their respective evaluations of the merger.

The inclusion of the unaudited financial and operating forecasts in this proxy statement/prospectus should not be regarded as an
indication that CWEI, Noble or any of their respective advisors or representatives considered or

consider such forecasts to be accurate predictions of future events, and the unaudited financial and operating forecasts should not be
relied upon as such. None of CWEI, Noble or their respective advisors or representatives has made or makes any representation
regarding the information contained in the unaudited financial and operating forecasts.

CWEI stockholders are urged to review Noble’s and CWEI’s SEC filings for a description of risk factors with respect to
Noble’s business and CWEI’s business, respectively, as well as the section of this proxy statement/prospectus entitled “Risk
Factors” beginning on page 16. See also “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and “Where You Can
Find More Information” beginning on pages 23 and 112, respectively. The unaudited financial and operating forecasts were not
prepared with a view toward public disclosure, nor were they prepared with a view toward compliance with GAAP, published
guidelines of the SEC or the guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation and
presentation of prospective financial information. In addition, the unaudited financial and operating forecasts require significant
estimates and assumptions that make them inherently less comparable to the similarly titled GAAP measures in the historical GAAP
financial statements of Noble and CWEI. The unaudited financial and operating forecasts included in this proxy
statement/prospectus have been prepared by, and are the responsibility of, management of CWEI. None of Noble’s independent
registered public accounting firm, CWEI’s independent registered public accounting firm or any other independent accountant, has
compiled, examined or performed any procedures with respect to the unaudited financial and operating forecasts contained herein,
nor have they expressed any opinion or any other form of assurance on such information. The report of the independent registered
public accounting firm to each of Noble and CWEI contained in each such party’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2016, each of which is incorporated by reference into this proxy statement/prospectus, relates to the applicable party’s
historical financial information. Those reports do not extend to the unaudited financial and operating forecasts and should not be
read to do so. Furthermore, the following unaudited financial and operating forecasts do not take into account any circumstances or
events occurring after the dates on which they were prepared. For the purposes of the tables set forth below, EBITDA is generally
the amount of the respective company’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, depletion, amortization and exploration
expenses for a specified time period.

In addition to being used by the CWEI board in connection with its evaluation of the merger, the unaudited financial and
operating forecasts were also provided to Goldman Sachs, CWEI’s financial advisor. As discussed below, the unaudited financial
and operating forecasts were prepared for use only by the CWEI board and Goldman Sachs and do not, and were not intended to, act
as public guidance regarding CWEI’s or Noble’s future financial performance.

Unaudited Standalone Financial and Operating Forecasts of CWEI and Unaudited Pro Forma Financial and Operating
Forecasts of Noble

CWEI prepared and provided the CWEI forecasts and the Noble pro forma forecasts to Goldman Sachs, its financial advisor.
Summaries of the material financial and operating forecasts that were included in the CWEI forecasts and Noble pro forma forecasts
are set forth below.

The financial and operating forecasts that were included in the CWEI forecasts and Noble pro forma forecasts were prepared
utilizing the following NYMEX strip pricing assumptions with respect to future commodity prices for crude oil and natural gas as of
December 28, 2016:
 2017E 2018E 2019E 2020E 2021E
Crude oil (WTI)($/Bbl) $ 56.16 $ 56.60 $ 56.04 $ 55.86 $ 55.96 
Natural gas (Henry Hub) ($/MMbtu) $ 3.70 $ 3.14 $ 2.87 $ 2.88 $ 2.90 

The financial and operating information summarized below represents the CWEI forecasts of annual results for 2017 through
2021 based on the above-referenced assumptions (in millions of dollars, other than operating data):

The inclusion of information about the unaudited financial and operating forecasts in this proxy statement/prospectus should
not be regarded as an indication that CWEI or any other recipient of this information considered, or now considers, it to be
predictive of actual future results due to, among other factors, the inherent risks and uncertainties associated with such forecasts.
The information about the unaudited financial and operating forecasts included in this proxy statement/prospectus is presented
solely to give CWEI stockholders access to the information that was made available to the CWEI board and CWEI’s financial
advisor. The unaudited financial and operating forecasts are each subjective in many respects and thus subject to interpretation.
While presented with numerical specificity, the unaudited financial and operating forecasts reflect numerous assumptions and
estimates as to future events and matters specific to CWEI’s and Noble’s businesses, including the factors listed under “Risk
Factors” beginning on page 16, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond CWEI’s or Noble’s control and
will be beyond the control of the combined company following the merger.

In particular, the unaudited financial and operating forecasts prepared by the management of CWEI were prepared solely for
CWEI’s internal use and are subjective in many respects. Neither CWEI nor Noble can provide any assurance that the assumptions
underlying the unaudited financial and operating forecasts will be realized, and there can be no assurance that the prospective results
in the forecasts will be realized or that actual results will not be significantly higher or lower than estimated. Since the unaudited
financial and operating forecasts cover multiple years, such information by its nature becomes less predictive with each successive
year. No assurances can be given that the assumptions made in preparing the above unaudited financial and operating forecasts will
accurately reflect future conditions. The estimates and assumptions underlying the unaudited financial and operating forecasts
involve judgments with respect to, among other things, future economic, competitive, regulatory and financial market conditions
and future business decisions that may not be realized and that are inherently subject to significant business, economic, competitive
and regulatory uncertainties and contingencies, including, among others, risks and uncertainties described under “Risk Factors” and
“Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,” beginning on pages 16 and 23, respectively, all of which are
difficult to predict and many of which are beyond the control of Noble and CWEI and will be beyond the control of the combined
company following the merger. There can be no assurance that the underlying assumptions will prove to be accurate or that the
projected results will be realized, and actual results likely will differ, and may differ materially, from those reflected in the unaudited
financial and operating forecasts, whether or not the merger is completed.

CWEI stockholders are urged to review (i) Noble’s most recent SEC filings for a description of Noble’s reported results of
operations and financial condition and capital resources during 2016, including “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Noble’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016,
which is incorporated by reference into this proxy statement/prospectus, and (ii) CWEI’s most recent SEC filings for a description
of CWEI’s reported results of operations and financial condition and capital resources during 2016, including “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in CWEI’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2016, which is incorporated by reference into this proxy statement/prospectus.

Readers of this proxy statement/prospectus are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the unaudited financial and operating
forecasts set forth above. No representation is made by Noble, CWEI, their respective financial advisors or any other person to any
CWEI stockholder regarding the ultimate performance of Noble or CWEI compared to the information included in the above
unaudited financial and operating forecasts. The inclusion of unaudited financial and operating forecasts in this proxy
statement/prospectus should not be regarded as an indication that such unaudited financial and operating forecasts will be an
accurate prediction of future events, and such information should not be relied on as such.

Board of Directors and Executive Officers After Completion of the Merger

Board of Directors. Upon completion of the merger, the board of directors of the combined company will consist of the then-
current Noble directors. All Noble directors are elected annually to serve until the next annual meeting and until their successors are
elected. The current directors of Noble are: Jeffrey L. Berenson, Michael A. Cawley, Edward F. Cox, James E. Craddock, Thomas J.
Edelman, Eric P. Grubman, Kirby L. Hedrick, David L. Stover, Scott D. Urban, William T. Van Kleef and Molly K. Williamson. Mr.
Grubman has informed Noble that he will not stand for re-election at Noble’s 2017 annual meeting of stockholders. Mr. Grubman’s
decision not to stand for re-election is not as a result of any disagreement with Noble or its board of directors.

Executive Officers. Upon completion of the merger, the executive officers of Noble are expected to continue serving as
executive officers of the combined company, except for Susan M. Cunningham, who has notified Noble of her plans to retire,
effective March 24, 2017.

Interests of CWEI Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger

In considering the recommendation of the CWEI board that CWEI stockholders vote “FOR” the merger proposal, CWEI
stockholders should be aware that some of CWEI’s directors and executive officers have financial interests in the merger that may
be different from, or in addition to, those of CWEI stockholders generally. The CWEI board was aware of these interests and
considered them, among other matters, in approving the merger agreement and making its recommendation that the CWEI
stockholders approve the merger proposal. For purposes of all of the CWEI agreements and plans described below, the completion
of the merger will constitute a change in control.

Equity Compensation Awards

Pursuant to the merger agreement, equity compensation awards held by CWEI’s directors and executive officers as of the
effective time will be treated as follows:

Options. Prior to the effective time, each CWEI option that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time will vest
immediately prior to the effective time and will be exchanged for the number of Noble common shares, rounded down to the nearest
whole share, determined by dividing (i) the product of (A) the number of CWEI common shares subject to the CWEI option and (B)
the amount, if any, by which the per share closing price of CWEI common shares on the business day immediately prior to the date
on which the effective time occurs exceeds the per share exercise price of the CWEI option by (ii) the average per share closing
price of Noble common shares over the 10 trading days immediately prior to the date on which the effective time occurs. For more
information, see “The Merger Agreement—Treatment of CWEI Equity Awards” beginning on page 62.

The following table sets forth the number of CWEI options held by each CWEI executive officer as of March 22, 2017,
including the exercise price applicable to each CWEI option. CWEI’s non-employee directors do not hold any CWEI options:

Restricted Shares. At the effective time, each CWEI restricted share that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective
time will be converted into the number of restricted Noble common shares, subject to the same restrictions as were applicable to
such CWEI restricted share immediately prior to the effective time, determined by multiplying the number of CWEI restricted
shares subject to the award by the share-election exchange ratio of 3.7222, rounded up to the nearest whole share, and subject to the
same vesting, repurchase and other restrictions as the CWEI restricted shares. For more information, see “The Merger Agreement—

For each CWEI executive officer, the CWEI restricted shares set forth in the table above will vest on a double-trigger basis in
the event such executive officer is terminated without cause, resigns for good reason or CWEI or Noble provides notice of non-
renewal of the executive officer’s employment agreement, in each case, within two years following the merger. For each director,
the CWEI restricted shares set forth in the table above will vest upon the closing of the merger.

Executive Employment Agreements

Each of CWEI’s executive officers is party to an employment agreement with CWEI pursuant to which, in the event that the
employment of the executive officer is terminated without cause, the executive officer resigns for good reason, or CWEI or Noble
provides notice of non-renewal of the employment agreement, in each case, within two years following the merger (each, a
“qualifying termination”), then, subject to the executive officer signing and not revoking a release of claims in favor of CWEI and
Noble, the executive officer will be entitled to the compensation and benefits described below.

• Severance Payment. Upon a qualifying termination, the executive officer will become entitled to receive a lump sum
payment equal to the sum of (i) two times (or three times with respect to Messrs. Williams, Riggs, Casas and Cooke) the
executive officer’s annual base salary in effect as of the date of the qualifying termination; (ii) two times (or three times
with respect to Messrs. Williams, Riggs, Casas and Cooke) the average bonus amount actually paid to the executive
officer for the three years ending prior to the date of the qualifying termination or, if shorter, the number of full calendar
years preceding the date of termination during which the executive officer was employed; (iii) the car allowance the
executive officer would have received had he remained employed for an additional two years (or three years with respect
to Messrs. Williams, Riggs, Casas and Cooke); and (iv) the matching contributions that would have been made on behalf
of the executive officer pursuant to CWEI’s 401(k) plan if he had continued participation in such plan for an additional
two years (or three years with respect to Messrs. Williams, Riggs, Casas and Cooke), payable no later than the earlier of
(x) March 15 following the calendar year in which the qualifying termination occurs and (y) 90 days following the date of
the qualifying termination. In addition, in connection with the merger, the compensation committee of the CWEI board
approved an additional cash severance payment to Mr. Tisdale of $1.5 million payable in the event he incurs a qualifying

TABLE OF CONTENTS

• Medical Benefits Continuation. The executive officer, his spouse and eligible dependents will continue to be eligible to
participate in the group health plans offered by CWEI or Noble for a period of 18 months following termination or the
executive officer will be reimbursed for the amounts necessary to obtain similar benefits.

• Accelerated Vesting of Equity Compensation Awards. In connection with the merger, the compensation committee of the
CWEI board determined to accelerate the vesting of equity awards held by each of CWEI’s executive officers such that,
upon a qualifying termination, the executive officers will become entitled to full and immediate vesting of all outstanding
CWEI options and CWEI restricted shares held by the executive officer as of the date of the qualifying termination. For
more information regarding the treatment of the equity compensation awards held by CWEI’s executive officers in
connection with the merger, see “—Equity Compensation Awards” beginning on page 43.

APO Incentive Plans

CWEI’s executive officers have historically participated in certain after-payout, or APO, incentive plans (the “APO incentive
plans”). The APO incentive plans were created to incentivize CWEI’s executives to find, acquire, develop and produce oil and gas
reserves in a cost-effective manner, and to reward those executives for the successful management of projects that produced value to
CWEI’s stockholders. All of the executive officers’ interests in the APO incentive plans are currently fully vested. Prior to the
closing of the merger, CWEI expects to terminate and make final payments under the APO incentive plans based on the aggregate
value of the interests held by the plan participants.

The following table sets forth the estimated aggregate payments each executive officer would have received upon termination
of the APO incentive plans on January 1, 2017:

Indemnification; Expense Advancements; Directors’ and Officers’ Insurance

From and after the effective time, Noble and the surviving company, jointly and severally, will (i) indemnify and hold harmless
each present and former director and officer of CWEI and its subsidiaries determined as of the effective time (the “indemnified
parties”) from and against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees),
judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement arising out of or in connection with any claim or action, suit, proceeding
or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of matters existing or occurring at or prior to the
effective time, in their capacity as a director or officer of CWEI or its subsidiaries, to the fullest extent authorized or permitted under
applicable law; and (ii) promptly pay on behalf of or advance to each of the indemnified parties any expenses incurred in defending,
serving as a witness or otherwise participating with respect to any claims or action in advance of the final disposition of such claim
or action, in each case, without the requirement of any bond or other security, which such officer or director shall repay the advance
if it is ultimately determined that such officer or director is not entitled to be indemnified under applicable law. In addition, for a
period of six years after the effective time, Noble and the surviving company or their successors or assigns will maintain directors’
and officers’ insurance policies covering CWEI’s present and former directors and executive officers determined as of the effective
time that generally provide the same coverage amounts and no less advantageous terms and conditions as CWEI’s current coverage.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Make-Whole Payment

Certain of CWEI’s directors, P. Scott Martin, Nathan W. Walton and Ronald D. Scott, are affiliated with Ares Management, a
significant stockholder of CWEI and a lender under CWEI’s second lien term loan, which is expected to be repaid in connection
with the consummation of the merger. Under the term loan credit agreement, if the term loan is repaid prior to the third anniversary
of its availability date, CWEI is required to pay, in addition to the principal and any accrued but unpaid interest on the term loan, a
“make-whole amount” equal to the discounted value of all future interest payments from the date of repayment through such third
anniversary and a 12.5% call premium.

Expense Reimbursement in Connection with Support and Non-Dissent Agreements

As described under “—Share Ownership of Certain Stockholders; Support and Non-Dissent Agreements,” contemporaneously
with the execution of the merger agreement, Noble and CWEI (solely for certain specified purposes) entered into a support
agreement with the Ares stockholders, entities affiliated with Ares Management and three of CWEI’s directors, and non-dissent
agreements with Clayton W. Williams, Jr., CWEI’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and The Williams Children’s Partnership
Ltd., which was organized for the benefit of the adult children of Mr. Williams and whose trustee is Mel G. Riggs, CWEI’s
President. Under the support and non-dissent agreements, CWEI agreed to reimburse each of the Ares stockholders, Mr. Williams
and The Williams Children’s Partnership Ltd. for up to $750,000 of reasonable fees and out-of-pocket third party expenses,
including reasonable attorneys’ fees, incurred in connection with such agreements.

Quantification of Payments and Benefits to CWEI’s Named Executive Officers

The following table sets forth the information required by Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K regarding the compensation that is
based on or otherwise relates to the merger and that may be paid or become payable to CWEI’s named executive officers, which is
referred to as the “golden parachute” compensation. The information set forth in the table below is intended to comply with Item
402(t) of Regulation S-K, which requires disclosure of information about certain compensation for each of CWEI’s named executive
officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the merger.

The amounts indicated below are estimates based on the material assumptions described in the notes to the table below, which
may or may not actually occur. Some of these assumptions are based on information not currently available and, as a result, the
actual amounts, if any, that may be paid or become payable to a named executive officer of CWEI may differ materially from the
amounts set forth below. Furthermore, for purposes of calculating such amounts, CWEI has assumed the following:

• the relevant price per CWEI common share is $146.43, which is the average closing market price per CWEI common
share as quoted on the NYSE over the first five business days following the first public announcement of the merger on
January 16, 2017;

• the relevant price per Noble common share is $34.00, which is the average closing market price per Noble common share
as quoted on the NYSE over the last ten business days prior to March 22, 2017, the last practicable date prior to the date of
this proxy statement/prospectus;

• the merger will close on March 22, 2017, the last practicable date prior to the date of this proxy statement/prospectus; and

• the named executive officers experience a qualifying termination immediately following the merger on March 22, 2017,
the last practicable date prior to the date of this proxy statement/prospectus.

(1) Pursuant to the employment agreements with each of the named executive officers, the double-trigger cash severance amounts are payable in the event the
named executive officer is terminated without cause, the executive resigns for good reason or CWEI or Noble provides notice of non-renewal of the
employment agreement, in each case, within two years following the merger. The amounts reported will be paid, subject to the named executive officer signing
and not revoking a release of claims in favor of CWEI and Noble, no later than the earlier of (a) March 15 following the calendar year in which the qualifying
termination occurs and (b) 90 days following the date of the qualifying termination. For more information, see “—Executive Employment Agreements”
beginning on page 44.

(2) Amounts reported consist of three times (or two times with respect to Mr. Lyssy) the named executive officer’s annual base salary in effect as of the date of the
qualifying termination.

(3) Amounts reported consist of three times (or two times with respect to Mr. Lyssy) the average bonus amount actually paid to the named executive officer for the
three years ending prior to the date of the qualifying termination or, if shorter, the number of full calendar years preceding the date of termination during which
the named executive officer was employed.

(4) Amounts reported consist of the car allowance the named executive officer would have received had he remained employed for an additional three years (or
two years with respect to Mr. Lyssy).

(5) Amounts reported consist of the matching contributions that would have been made on behalf of the named executive officer pursuant to CWEI’s 401(k) plan if
he had continued participation in such plan for an additional three years (or two years with respect to Mr. Lyssy).

(6) Amounts reported represent the value of Noble common shares that will be received in respect of CWEI options held by the named executive officers that are
unvested. Pursuant to the merger agreement, each CWEI option that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time will vest immediately prior to
the effective time and will be converted into the right to receive Noble common shares. For more information, see “The Merger Agreement—Treatment of
CWEI Equity Awards” beginning on page 62.

(7) Amounts reported represent the value of the accelerated vesting of all outstanding CWEI restricted shares held by the named executive officers. In connection
with the merger, the compensation committee of the CWEI board determined to accelerate the vesting of CWEI restricted shares held by each of CWEI’s
executive officers such that, upon a qualifying termination, all outstanding CWEI restricted shares held by the executive officer as of the date of the qualifying
termination will vest on a double trigger basis.

(8) Amounts reported consist of the cost of providing healthcare coverage to the executive officer, his spouse and his eligible dependents for a period of 18
months. Pursuant to each executive officer’s employment agreement, this double-trigger health care coverage is provided in the event the named executive
officer is terminated without cause, the executive resigns for good reason or CWEI or Noble provides notice of non-renewal of the employment agreement, in
each case, within two years following the merger. For more information, see “—Executive Employment Agreements” beginning on page 44.

Share Ownership of Certain Stockholders; Support and Non-Dissent Agreements

Support Agreement

Contemporaneously with the execution of the merger agreement, Noble, CWEI (solely for certain specified purposes) and the
Ares stockholders (certain CWEI stockholders affiliated with Ares Management) entered into the support agreement, pursuant to
which the Ares stockholders agreed, among other things, not to exercise or assert any appraisal rights under Section 262 of the
DGCL in connection with the merger. The Ares stockholders have also agreed, among other things, during the period from January
13, 2017 to and including the date of termination of the merger agreement, if any (the “applicable period”), to vote all of the CWEI
common shares and, if applicable, the CWEI preferred shares, they beneficially own as of the record date of the CWEI special
meeting (i) in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement, (ii) against any alternative proposal, and (iii) against any amendment
of CWEI’s certificate of incorporation or by-laws or other proposal or transaction involving CWEI or any of its subsidiaries which
amendment or other proposal or transaction would in any manner delay, impede, frustrate, prevent or nullify the merger, the merger
agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement or change in any manner the voting rights of any
outstanding class of capital stock of CWEI. The support agreement will automatically terminate upon the earliest to occur of: (a) the
termination of the merger agreement; (b) the effectiveness of the merger; (c) the date certain material modifications of or waivers
under the merger agreement are effected without the Ares stockholders' consent; (d) the mutual written consent of the parties
thereto; and (e) July 17, 2017. As of March 22, 2017, the last practicable date before the date of this proxy statement/prospectus, the
Ares stockholders owned approximately 42% of the outstanding CWEI common shares.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Non-Dissent Agreements

In addition, contemporaneously with the execution of the merger agreement, Noble and CWEI (solely for certain specified
purposes) entered into the non-dissent agreements with the non-dissenting parties (Clayton W. Williams, Jr. and The Williams
Children’s Partnership Ltd., each a stockholder of CWEI), pursuant to which the non-dissenting parties agreed, among other things,
not to exercise or assert any appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL in connection with the merger. The non-dissenting
parties have also agreed, among other things, during the applicable period, to vote all of the CWEI common shares they beneficially
own as of the record date of the CWEI special meeting against any alternative proposal and against any amendment of CWEI’s
certificate of incorporation or by-laws or other proposal or transaction involving CWEI or any of its subsidiaries, which amendment
or other proposal or transaction would in any manner delay, impede, frustrate, prevent or nullify the merger, the merger agreement
or any of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement or change in any manner the voting rights of any outstanding class
of capital stock of CWEI. If the merger agreement is terminated by Noble in certain circumstances, including if the CWEI
stockholders do not approve the merger proposal, then the term of the applicable period under the non-dissent agreements will be
extended for an additional 180 days following the termination of the merger agreement. The non-dissent agreements will
automatically terminate upon the earliest to occur of: (a) the expiration of the applicable period; (b) the effectiveness of the merger;
(c) the date certain material modifications of or waivers under the merger agreement are effected without the applicable non-
dissenting party’s consent; (d) the mutual written consent of the parties thereto; and (e) July 17, 2017. As of March 22, 2017, the last
practicable date before the date of this proxy statement/prospectus, the non-dissenting parties owned approximately 35% of the
outstanding CWEI common shares.

Accounting Treatment of the Merger

Noble prepares its financial statements in accordance with GAAP. The merger will be accounted for using the acquisition
method of accounting with Noble being considered the acquirer of CWEI for accounting purposes. This means that Noble will
allocate the purchase price to the fair value of CWEI’s tangible and intangible assets and liabilities at the acquisition date, with the
excess purchase price, if any, being recorded as goodwill. Under the acquisition method of accounting, goodwill is not amortized but
is tested for impairment at least annually.

Regulatory Approvals Required for the Merger

To complete the merger, Noble and CWEI must make filings with and obtain authorizations, approvals or consents from a
number of regulatory authorities. The merger is subject to requirements of the HSR Act, and on February 6, 2017, CWEI and Noble
received notice of the early termination of the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act. In addition, the new Noble common
shares issued to former CWEI stockholders must be approved for listing on the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance.

Treatment of CWEI Stock Options and Other Equity Based Awards

Stock Options. In connection with the merger, each CWEI option that is outstanding immediately prior to the effective time will
vest and be exchanged for the number of Noble common shares, rounded down to the nearest whole share, equal to the quotient of
(i) the product of (A) the number of CWEI common shares subject to the CWEI option, multiplied by (B) the amount, if any, by
which the per share closing trading price of CWEI common shares on the business day immediately before the effective time
exceeds the exercise price per CWEI common share otherwise purchasable pursuant to the CWEI option immediately prior to the
effective time, divided by (ii) the average of the closing sale prices of a Noble common share as reported on the NYSE for the ten
consecutive full trading days, ending at the close of trading on the full trading day immediately preceding the date on which the
effective time occurs. If such calculation results in zero or a negative number, the applicable CWEI option shall be forfeited for no
consideration.

Restricted Shares. In connection with the merger, the CWEI restricted shares outstanding immediately prior to the effective
time will be converted into a number of restricted Noble common shares equal to the number of CWEI restricted shares multiplied
by the share-election exchange ratio of 3.7222, rounded up to the nearest whole share, and subject to the same vesting, repurchase
and other restrictions as the CWEI restricted shares.

Restrictions on Sales of Noble Common Shares Received in the Merger

All Noble common shares received by CWEI stockholders in the merger will be freely tradable for purposes of the Securities
Act and the Exchange Act, except for Noble common shares received by any CWEI stockholder who becomes an “affiliate” of
Noble after completion of the merger (such as CWEI executive officers who become

executive officers of Noble after the merger). This proxy statement/prospectus does not cover resales of Noble common shares
received by any person upon completion of the merger, and no person is authorized to make any use of this proxy
statement/prospectus in connection with any resale.

Appraisal Rights

CWEI

Under Delaware law, CWEI stockholders have the right to demand appraisal of their CWEI common shares in connection with
the merger and to receive payment in cash for the fair value of their CWEI common shares as determined by the Delaware Court of
Chancery, together with interest, if any, as determined by the court, in lieu of the consideration CWEI stockholders would otherwise
be entitled to pursuant to the merger agreement. These rights are known as appraisal rights. CWEI stockholders electing to exercise
appraisal rights must comply with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL in order to perfect their rights. CWEI will require
strict compliance with the statutory procedures.

The following is intended as a brief summary of the material provisions of the Delaware statutory procedures required to be
followed by a CWEI stockholder in order to perfect appraisal rights. This summary, however, is not a complete statement of all
applicable requirements and is qualified in its entirety by reference to Section 262 of the DGCL, the full text of which appears in
Annex C to this joint proxy statement/prospectus. Failure to precisely follow any of the statutory procedures set forth in Section 262
of the DGCL may result in a termination or waiver of appraisal rights. All references in this summary to a “stockholder” are to the
record holder of CWEI common shares unless otherwise indicated.

Section 262 requires that stockholders for whom appraisal rights are available be notified not less than 20 days before the
stockholders’ meeting to vote on the merger that appraisal rights will be available. A copy of Section 262 must be included with
such notice. This joint proxy statement/prospectus constitutes notice to CWEI stockholders of the availability of appraisal rights in
connection with the merger in compliance with the requirements of Section 262. If a CWEI stockholder wishes to consider
exercising appraisal rights, such stockholder should carefully review the text of Section 262 contained in Annex C to this joint
proxy statement/prospectus because failure to timely and properly comply with the requirements of Section 262 will result in the
loss of appraisal rights under Delaware law.

If you elect to demand appraisal of your CWEI common shares, you must satisfy each of the following conditions:

• You must deliver to CWEI a written demand for appraisal of your CWEI common shares before the vote with respect to
the merger is taken. This written demand for appraisal must be in addition to and separate from any proxy or vote
abstaining from or voting against the approval of the merger proposal. Voting against or failing to vote for the approval of
the merger proposal by itself does not constitute a demand for appraisal within the meaning of Section 262.

• You must not vote in favor of, or consent in writing to, the approval of the merger proposal. A vote in favor of the
approval of the merger proposal, by proxy or in person, will constitute a waiver of your appraisal rights in respect of the
shares so voted and will nullify any previously filed written demands for appraisal. A proxy which does not contain voting
instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the approval of the merger proposal. Therefore, a CWEI stockholder
who votes by proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights must vote against the merger proposal or abstain from
voting on the merger proposal.

• You must continue to hold your CWEI common shares through the effective date of the merger. Therefore, a CWEI
stockholder who is the record holder of CWEI common shares on the date the written demand for appraisal is made but
who thereafter transfers the shares prior to the effective date of the merger will lose any right to appraisal with respect to
such shares.

If you fail to comply with any of these conditions and the merger is completed, you will be entitled to receive the merger
consideration, but you will have no appraisal rights with respect to your CWEI common shares.

All demands for appraisal should be addressed to Clayton Williams Energy, Inc., 6 Desta Drive, Suite 6500, Midland, TX
79705, Attention: Secretary, and must be delivered before the vote on the merger agreement is taken at the CWEI special meeting
and should be executed by, or on behalf of, the record holder of the CWEI common shares. The demand must reasonably inform
CWEI of the identity of the stockholder and the intention of the stockholder to demand appraisal of his, her, her or its shares.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

To be effective, a demand for appraisal by a holder of CWEI common shares must be made by, or in the name of, such
registered stockholder, fully and correctly, as the stockholder’s name appears on his, her or its stock certificate(s). Beneficial owners
who do not also hold the shares of record may not directly make appraisal demands to CWEI. The beneficial holder must, in such
cases, have the registered owner, such as a broker, bank or other nominee, submit the required demand in respect of those shares. If
shares are owned of record in a fiduciary capacity, such as by a trustee, guardian or custodian, execution of a demand for appraisal
should be made by or for the fiduciary; and if the shares are owned of record by more than one person, as in a joint tenancy or
tenancy in common, the demand should be executed by or for all joint owners. An authorized agent, including an authorized agent
for two or more joint owners, may execute the demand for appraisal for a CWEI stockholder of record; however, the agent must
identify the record owner or owners and expressly disclose the fact that, in executing the demand, he or she is acting as agent for the
record owner. A record owner, such as a broker or bank who holds shares as a nominee for others, may exercise his or her right of
appraisal with respect to the shares held for one or more beneficial owners, while not exercising this right for other beneficial
owners. In that case, the written demand should state the number of shares as to which appraisal is sought. Where no number of
shares is expressly mentioned, the demand will be presumed to cover all CWEI common shares held in the name of the record
owner.

If a CWEI stockholder holds CWEI common shares in a brokerage account or in other nominee form and wishes to exercise
appraisal rights, such stockholder should consult with his, her or its broker, bank or the other nominee to determine the appropriate
procedures for the making of a demand for appraisal by the nominee.

Within 10 days after the effective time, NBL Permian, as the surviving company, must give written notice that the merger has
become effective to each former CWEI stockholder who has properly filed a written demand for appraisal and who did not vote in
favor of the merger proposal. Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger, any stockholder who has complied with Section
262 will, upon written request to NBL Permian as the surviving company, be entitled to receive a written statement setting forth the
aggregate number of CWEI common shares not voted in favor of the merger proposal and with respect to which demands for
appraisal rights have been received and the aggregate number of holders of such shares. A person who is the beneficial owner of
CWEI common shares held of record in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person may, in such person’s own name,
request from the surviving corporation the statement described in the previous sentence. Such written statement will be mailed to the
requesting CWEI stockholder within 10 days after such written request is received by the surviving company or within 10 days after
expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal, whichever is later.

Within 120 days after the effective time, either the surviving company or any CWEI stockholder who has complied with the
requirements of Section 262 and who is otherwise entitled to appraisal rights may file a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery
demanding a determination of the fair value of the CWEI common shares held by all CWEI stockholders entitled to appraisal. A
person who is the beneficial owner of CWEI common shares held of record in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such
person may, in such person’s own name, file the petition described in the previous sentence. Upon the filing of the petition by a
CWEI stockholder, service of a copy of such petition shall be made upon NBL Permian, as the surviving company. There is no
present intent on the part of NBL Permian to file an appraisal petition, and CWEI stockholders seeking to exercise appraisal rights
should not assume that NBL Permian will file such a petition or that NBL Permian will initiate any negotiations with respect to the
fair value of such shares. Accordingly, the failure of a CWEI stockholder to file such a petition within the period specified could
nullify the CWEI stockholder’s previously written demand for appraisal, and CWEI stockholders who desire to have their CWEI
common shares appraised should initiate any petitions necessary for the perfection of their appraisal rights within the time periods
and in the manner prescribed in Section 262.

If a petition for appraisal is duly filed by a CWEI stockholder and a copy of the petition is delivered to the surviving company,
the surviving company will then be obligated, within 20 days after receiving service of a copy of the petition, to provide the
Delaware Court of Chancery with a duly verified list containing the names and addresses of all CWEI stockholders who have
demanded an appraisal of their shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares have not been reached by the
surviving company. After notice to dissenting stockholders who demanded appraisal of their shares, the Delaware Court of
Chancery is empowered to conduct a hearing upon the petition, and to determine those CWEI stockholders who have complied with
Section 262 and who have become entitled to the appraisal rights provided thereby. The Delaware Court of Chancery may require
the CWEI

TABLE OF CONTENTS

stockholders who have demanded appraisal for their CWEI common shares to submit their stock certificates, if any, to the Register
in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings; and if any CWEI stockholder fails to comply with
that direction, the Delaware Court of Chancery may dismiss the proceedings as to that stockholder.

After determination of the CWEI stockholders entitled to appraisal of their CWEI common shares, the Delaware Court of
Chancery will appraise the shares, determining their fair value exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment
or expectation of the merger, together with interest, if any. Unless the Delaware Court of Chancery in its discretion determines
otherwise for good cause shown, interest from the effective date of the merger through the date of payment of the judgment shall be
compounded quarterly and shall accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from
time to time during the period between the effective date of the merger and the date of payment of the judgment. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, at any time before the entry of judgment in the proceedings, NBL Permian may pay to each CWEI stockholder
entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which case interest shall accrue thereafter as provided herein only upon the sum of (i) the
difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair value of the shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery,
and (ii) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time. When the value is determined, the Delaware Court of Chancery will
direct the payment of such value, with interest thereon accrued during the pendency of the proceeding, if the Delaware Court of
Chancery so determines, to the CWEI stockholders entitled to receive the same, upon surrender by such holders of such stock
certificates or book-entry shares.

In determining fair value, and, if applicable, interest, the Delaware Court of Chancery is required to take into account all
relevant factors. In Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court discussed the factors that could be considered in
determining fair value in an appraisal proceeding, stating that “proof of value by any techniques or methods which are generally
considered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court” should be considered, and that “fair price
obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of a company.” Section 262 provides that fair value is to
be “exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger.” In Cede & Co. v. Technicolor,
Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court stated that such exclusion is a “narrow exclusion [that] does not encompass known elements of
value,” but which rather applies only to the speculative elements of value arising from such accomplishment or expectation. In
Weinberger, the Delaware Supreme Court construed Section 262 to mean that “elements of future value, including the nature of the
enterprise, which are known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the merger and not the product of speculation, may be
considered.”

CWEI stockholders should be aware that the fair value of CWEI common shares as determined under Section 262 could be
more than, the same as, or less than the value that such CWEI stockholder is entitled to receive under the terms of the merger
agreement.

Costs of the appraisal proceeding may be imposed upon the surviving company and the CWEI stockholders participating in the
appraisal proceeding by the Delaware Court of Chancery as the Court deems equitable in the circumstances. Upon the application of
a CWEI stockholder, the Delaware Court of Chancery may order all or a portion of the expenses incurred by any CWEI stockholder
in connection with the appraisal proceeding, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees and the fees and expenses of
experts, to be charged pro rata against the value of all shares entitled to appraisal. Any CWEI stockholder who has demanded
appraisal rights will not, after the effective time, be entitled to vote shares subject to that demand for any purpose or to receive
payments of dividends or any other distribution with respect to those shares, other than with respect to payment as of a record date
prior to the effective time; however, if no petition for appraisal is filed within 120 days after the effective time, or if the CWEI
stockholder delivers a written withdrawal of such stockholder’s demand for appraisal and an acceptance of the terms of the merger
within 60 days after the effective time, then the right of that CWEI stockholder to appraisal will cease and that CWEI stockholder
will be entitled to receive $34.75 in cash (subject to applicable withholding tax), without interest, and 2.7874 Noble common shares
for each CWEI common share pursuant to the merger agreement. No appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery will
be dismissed as to any CWEI stockholder without the prior approval of the Court, and such approval may be conditioned upon such
terms as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems just; provided, however, that any CWEI stockholder who has not commenced an
appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party will have the right to withdraw its demand for appraisal within 60
days after the effective date of the merger and to accept the consideration that such holder would have received pursuant to the
merger agreement.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Notwithstanding the above, the Court shall dismiss the appraisal proceedings as to all holders of shares who are otherwise
entitled to appraisal rights unless (i) the total number of shares entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the outstanding CWEI common
shares eligible for appraisal, or (ii) the value of the consideration otherwise payable under the merger agreement in respect of such
total number of shares entitled to appraisal exceeds $1 million.

In view of the complexity of Section 262, CWEI stockholders who may wish to dissent from the merger and pursue appraisal
rights should consult their legal advisors.

Noble

The holders of Noble common shares are not entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the merger under Delaware law.

NYSE Listing of Noble Common Stock; Delisting and Deregistration of CWEI Common Stock

Before completion of the merger, Noble has agreed to use all commercially reasonable to cause the Noble common shares to be
issued in the merger and reserved for issuance under any equity awards to be approved for listing on the NYSE. The listing of the
Noble common shares is also a condition to completion of the merger. If the merger is completed, CWEI common shares will cease
to be listed on NYSE and will be deregistered under the Exchange Act.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES

The following is a general discussion of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger to U.S. holders (as defined
below) of CWEI common shares that exchange their CWEI common shares for Noble common shares and cash in the merger. The
following discussion is based upon the Code, the U.S. Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder and judicial and administrative
authorities, rulings and decisions, all as in effect as of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus. These authorities may change,
possibly with retroactive effect, and any such change could affect the accuracy of the statements and conclusions set forth in this
discussion. This discussion assumes that the merger will be completed in accordance with the merger agreement and as further
described in this proxy statement/prospectus. This discussion is not a complete description of all of the tax consequences of the
merger and, in particular, does not address any tax consequences arising under the unearned income Medicare contribution tax
pursuant to the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, nor does it address any tax consequences arising under the
laws of any state, local or foreign jurisdiction, or under any U.S. federal laws other than those pertaining to the income tax.

The following discussion applies only to U.S. holders of CWEI common shares who hold such shares as a capital asset within
the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment). Further, this discussion does not purport to
consider all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that might be relevant to U.S. holders in light of their particular circumstances
and does not apply to U.S. holders subject to special treatment under the U.S. federal income tax laws (such as, for example, dealers
or brokers in securities, commodities or foreign currencies, traders in securities that elect to apply a mark-to-market method of
accounting, banks and certain other financial institutions, insurance companies, mutual funds, tax-exempt organizations, holders
subject to the alternative minimum tax provisions of the Code, partnerships, S corporations or other pass-through entities or
investors in partnerships, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, controlled foreign corporations, passive
foreign investment companies, former citizens or residents of the United States, U.S. expatriates, holders whose functional currency
is not the U.S. dollar, holders who hold CWEI common shares as part of a hedge, straddle, constructive sale or conversion
transaction or other integrated investment, holders who acquired CWEI common shares pursuant to the exercise of employee stock
options, through a tax qualified retirement plan or otherwise as compensation, holders who exercise appraisal rights, or holders who
actually or constructively own more than 5% of the CWEI common shares).

For purposes of this discussion, the term “U.S. holder” means a beneficial owner of CWEI common shares that is for U.S.
federal income tax purposes (1) an individual citizen or resident of the United States, (2) a corporation, or entity treated as a
corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, organized in or under the laws of the United States or any state thereof or the
District of Columbia, (3) a trust if (a) a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration
of the trust and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (b) such trust has made
a valid election to be treated as a U.S. person for U.S. federal income tax purposes or (4) an estate, the income of which is includible
in gross income for U.S. federal income tax purposes, regardless of its source.

If an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds CWEI common shares, the tax
treatment of a partner in such partnership generally will depend on the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. Any
entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes that holds CWEI common shares, and any partners in such
partnership, should consult their own independent tax advisors regarding the tax consequences of the merger to their specific
circumstances.

Determining the actual tax consequences of the merger to you may be complex and will depend on your specific
situation and on factors that are not within our control. You should consult your own independent tax advisor as to the
specific tax consequences of the merger in your particular circumstances, including the applicability and effect of the
alternative minimum tax and any state, local, foreign and other tax laws and of changes in those laws.

Consequences of the Merger

Noble and CWEI intend for the merger and the second merger, considered together, to be treated as a “reorganization” within
the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code for U.S. federal income tax purposes. It is a condition to the obligation of Noble to
complete the merger that Noble receive an opinion from its tax counsel, dated the closing date of the merger, to the effect that, on
the basis of facts, representations, assumptions and exclusions set forth or referred to in such opinion, the merger and the second
merger, considered together, will qualify for U.S.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

federal income tax purposes as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. It is a condition to the
obligation of CWEI to complete the merger that CWEI receive an opinion from its tax counsel dated the closing date of the merger,
to the effect that, on the basis of facts, representations, assumptions and exclusions set forth or referred to in such opinion, the
merger and the second merger, considered together, will qualify for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a “reorganization” within
the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. In connection with the filing of this proxy statement/prospectus, Noble’s tax counsel and
CWEI’s tax counsel have delivered opinions with respect to the foregoing matters. These opinions and the opinions required to be
delivered at the closing of the merger are and will be based on representations, warranties and covenants contained in representation
letters provided by Noble and CWEI and on customary factual assumptions, including the assumption tht the merger will be
completed in the manner described in the merger agreement and this proxy statement/prospectus. Neither of the opinions described
above will be binding on the Internal Revenue Service (which we refer to as the “IRS”) or any court. Noble and CWEI have not
sought and will not seek any ruling from the IRS regarding any matters relating to the merger or the second merger, and as a result,
there can be no assurance that the IRS will not assert, or that a court would not sustain, a position contrary to any of the conclusions
set forth below. In addition, if any of the representations, warranties, covenants or assumptions upon which those opinions are based
are inconsistent with the actual facts, the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger and the second merger could be
adversely affected. Assuming that, in accordance with the opinions described above, the merger and the second merger, considered
together, qualify as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, upon the exchange of CWEI common
shares for Noble common shares and cash, the U.S. federal income tax consequences will be as follows:

• Except as discussed below with respect to cash received in lieu of a fractional Noble common share, no gain or loss will
be recognized by U.S. holders who exchange all of their CWEI common shares solely for Noble common shares.

• Upon exchanging CWEI common shares for both Noble common shares and cash, U.S. holders will recognize gain (but
not loss) in an amount equal to the lesser of: (i) the amount, if any, by which the sum of the cash and the fair market value
of the Noble common shares received by such U.S. holder exceeds such U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in such U.S.
holder’s CWEI common shares exchanged therefor and (ii) the amount of cash received by such U.S. holder (except with
respect to cash received in lieu of a fractional Noble common share, as discussed below).

• Such gain will be capital gain (except for gain treated as a dividend, as discussed below) and will be long-term capital gain
if the U.S. holder’s holding period in their surrendered CWEI common shares exceeds one year at the effective time.

• The aggregate tax basis of the Noble common shares received by a U.S. holder of CWEI common shares in the merger
(including fractional Noble common shares deemed received and sold as described below) will be the same as the
aggregate adjusted tax basis of such U.S. holder’s CWEI common shares exchanged therefore, decreased by the cash
received (other than cash received in lieu of a fractional Noble common share) and increased by the amount of any gain
recognized by the holder, other than with respect to cash received in lieu of a fractional Noble common share.

• The holding period of the Noble common shares received in exchange for CWEI common shares will include the holding
period of the CWEI common shares exchanged for such Noble common shares.

If you acquired different blocks of CWEI common shares at different times or at different prices, you should consult your own
tax advisor regarding the manner in which cash and Noble common shares should be allocated among different blocks of CWEI
common shares. Any recognized gain will generally be long-term capital gain if your holding period in the surrendered CWEI
common shares exceeds one year at the effective time.

At the time a U.S. holder makes a cash election or stock election pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, such U.S.
holder will not know whether, and to what extent, the proration provisions of the merger agreement might alter the mix of merger
consideration such U.S. holder will receive. As a result, the U.S. federal income tax consequences to such U.S. holder will not be
ascertainable with certainty until such U.S. holder knows the precise amount of cash and Noble common shares that such U.S.
holder will receive in the merger.

If you receive the entirety of your merger consideration in the form of cash pursuant to the cash-election consideration, you
will generally recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount of cash received and the basis in your CWEI
common shares exchanged therefor. In addition, if you receive cash in lieu of a fractional

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Noble common share, you will be treated as having received such fractional Noble common share pursuant to the merger and then
as having sold such fractional Noble common share for cash. As a result, you generally will recognize gain or loss equal to the
difference between the amount of cash received for such fractional Noble common share and your basis in such fractional Noble
common share as set forth above. The gain or loss recognized by U.S. holders described in this paragraph will generally be capital
gain or loss, and will be long-term capital gain or loss if, as of the effective date of the merger, the U.S. holder’s holding period for
the relevant CWEI common shares is greater than one year. Long-term capital gains of individuals are generally eligible for reduced
rates of taxation. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.

Under certain circumstances, cash received by a U.S. holder that is also the beneficial owner of Noble common shares may be
treated as a dividend for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, the determination of whether any gain recognized will be
treated as capital gain or has the effect of a distribution of a dividend depends upon whether and to what extent the exchange
reduces the U.S. holder’s deemed percentage stock ownership of Noble (as calculated for U.S. federal income tax purposes). In
general, such treatment generally will not apply to a stockholder in a publicly held corporation, such as Noble, whose relative stock
interest is minimal and who exercises no control with respect to corporate affairs. These rules are complex and depend upon the
specific factual circumstances particular to each U.S. holder. Consequently, each U.S. holder that may be subject to these rules
should consult its tax advisor as to the application of these rules to its particular facts.

Information Reporting and Backup Withholding

U.S. holders may be subject to information reporting and backup withholding on any cash payments they receive in the merger.
A U.S. holder generally will not be subject to backup withholding, however, if such holder (1) timely furnishes its correct taxpayer
identification number, certifies that such holder is not subject to backup withholding on IRS Form W-9 or successor form included
in the letter of transmittal and otherwise complies with all applicable requirements of the backup withholding rules; or (2) provides
proof that such holder is otherwise exempt from backup withholding. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules are
not additional tax and will generally be allowed as a refund or credit against a U.S. holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability,
provided such holder timely furnishes the required information to the IRS.

This discussion of certain material U.S. federal income tax consequences is not intended to be, and should not be
construed as, tax advice. Holders of CWEI common shares are urged to consult their independent tax advisors with respect
to the application of U.S. federal income tax laws to their particular situations as well as any tax consequences arising under
the U.S. federal estate or gift tax rules, or under the laws of any state, local, foreign or other taxing jurisdiction or under any
applicable tax treaty.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE MERGER AGREEMENT

This section of this proxy statement/prospectus describes the material provisions of the merger agreement, but does not
describe all of the terms of the merger agreement and may not contain all of the information about the merger agreement that is
important to you. The following summary is qualified by reference to the complete text of the merger agreement, which is attached
as Annex A to this proxy statement/prospectus and incorporated by reference herein. You are urged to read the full text of the merger
agreement because it is the legal document that governs the merger.

The merger agreement and this summary of its terms have been included to provide you with information regarding the terms
of the merger agreement. Factual disclosures about Noble, CWEI or any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates contained in
this proxy statement/prospectus or their respective public reports filed with the SEC may supplement, update or modify the factual
disclosures contained in the merger agreement and described in this summary. The representations, warranties, and covenants
contained in the merger agreement were made only for purposes of the merger agreement, as of a specific date. These
representations were made solely for the benefit of the parties to the merger agreement and may be subject to important
qualifications and limitations agreed upon by the contracting parties, including being qualified by confidential disclosures made for
the purpose of allocating risk between parties to the merger agreement rather than the purpose of establishing these matters as
facts, and may apply standards of materiality in ways that are different from those generally applicable to reports filed with the SEC
or from what may be viewed as material by investors. These representations do not survive completion of the merger. For the
foregoing reasons, one should not read these representations or any description thereof as characterizations of the actual state of
facts or condition of Noble or CWEI, which are disclosed in the other information provided elsewhere in this proxy
statement/prospectus or incorporated by reference herein.

Terms of the Merger

The merger agreement provides that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the merger agreement, and in accordance
with the DGCL and the DLLCA, (i) at the effective time, Merger Sub will merge with and into CWEI in the merger, with CWEI
continuing as the surviving corporation and an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of Noble, and (ii) after completion of the merger,
but as part of the same plan as the merger, CWEI, as the surviving corporation in the merger, will merge with and into its parent,
NBL Permian, in the second merger, with NBL Permian continuing as the surviving company and an indirect, wholly owned
subsidiary of Noble.

At the completion of the merger, each CWEI common share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time
(other than CWEI common shares held in treasury and CWEI common shares held by stockholders who properly comply in all
respects with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL as to appraisal rights) and each unexercised CWEI warrant issued and
outstanding as of the effective time, will be cancelled and extinguished and automatically converted into the right to receive, at the
election of the stockholder or warrant holder, as applicable, but subject to proration as described below, one of the following forms
of consideration:

• for each CWEI common share with respect to which a share election has been validly made and not revoked (each, a
“share-election share”), 3.7222 Noble common shares, and for each CWEI warrant with respect to which a share election
has been validly made and not revoked (each, a “share-election warrant”), the share-election consideration in respect of
the number of warrant notional common shares (the number of CWEI common shares that would be issued upon a
cashless exercise of such CWEI warrant immediately prior to the effective time) represented by such warrant, in each case,
which Noble common shares will be duly authorized and validly issued in accordance with applicable laws and Noble’s
charter;

• for each CWEI common share with respect to which a mixed election has been validly made and not revoked (each, a
“mixed-election share”), (A) cash in an amount (subject to applicable withholding tax) equal to $34.75 and (B) 2.7874
Noble common shares, and for each CWEI warrant with respect to which a mixed election has been validly made and not
revoked (each, a “mixed-election warrant”), the mixed-election consideration in respect of the number of warrant notional
common shares represented by such warrant, in each case, which Noble common shares will be duly authorized and
validly issued in accordance with applicable laws and Noble’s charter;

• for each CWEI common share with respect to which a cash election has been validly made and not revoked (each, a “cash-
election share”), cash in an amount (subject to applicable withholding tax) equal to $138.39,

TABLE OF CONTENTS

and for each CWEI warrant with respect to which a cash election has been validly made and not revoked (each, a “cash-
election warrant”), the cash-election consideration in respect of the number of warrant notional common shares
represented by such warrant; and

• for each CWEI common share (each, a “non-election share”) or CWEI warrant (each, a “non-election warrant”), as
applicable, for which a merger consideration election has not been validly made and not revoked, such merger
consideration as is determined in accordance with the proration provisions of the merger agreement (see “—Proration
Procedures” beginning on page 60 for further information).

The merger consideration is subject to proration so that the aggregate merger consideration paid in respect of all CWEI
common shares and CWEI warrants consists of 75% Noble common shares and 25% cash, based on the closing sale price for the
Noble common shares on January 12, 2017. The merger consideration will also be adjusted appropriately to fully reflect the effect of
any subdivisions, reclassifications, splits, share distributions, combinations or exchanges of CWEI common shares or Noble
common shares. Any CWEI common shares owned directly or indirectly by CWEI or any of its wholly owned subsidiaries or by
Noble or any of its wholly owned subsidiaries as of immediately prior to the completion of the merger (other than those held in a
fiduciary capacity) will be cancelled and will receive no consideration.

Noble will not issue fractional Noble common shares in the merger. Each holder of CWEI common shares who would
otherwise be entitled to receive fractional Noble common shares in the merger will, instead, be entitled to a cash payment (without
interest rounded up to the nearest whole cent) in lieu of such fractional Noble common shares equal to the product of (i) the average
of the closing sale prices of Noble common shares as reported on the New York Stock Exchange for the ten (10) consecutive full
trading days (in which such Noble common shares are traded on the New York Stock Exchange), ending at the close of trading on
the full trading day immediately prior to the day on which the merger is completed, multiplied by (ii) the fraction of a Noble
common Share that the holder would otherwise have been entitled to receive in the merger. As soon as practicable after the
determination of the amount of cash, if any, to be paid to CWEI stockholders in lieu of any fractional Noble common shares, the
exchange agent will forward payments of such amounts to such CWEI stockholders without interest.

Noble, CWEI, Merger Sub, NBL Permian and the exchange agent are entitled to deduct and withhold from any amount payable
pursuant to the merger agreement to any holder of CWEI common shares, CWEI warrants, CWEI options or CWEI restricted shares
such amounts or securities as Noble, CWEI, Merger Sub, NBL Permian or the exchange agent reasonably deems to be required to
deduct and withhold under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law, with respect to the making of such payment
or issuance.

Noble has agreed to cause the exchange agent to invest the cash in the trust held by the exchange agent as directed by Noble on
a daily basis, in Noble’s sole discretion. Further, any portion of the trust held by the exchange agent that remains undistributed to the
CWEI stockholders after 180 days following the date on which the effective time occurs will be delivered to Noble, and after such
delivery, any former CWEI stockholders, CWEI warrant holders or holders of CWEI preferred shares who have not complied with
the steps described below under “—Exchange and Payment Procedures” will thereafter look only to Noble for the merger
consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional Noble common shares, or any distributions with respect to Noble common shares, in
each case, without any interest thereon.

Exchange and Payment Procedures

Prior to the completion of the merger, Noble will appoint an exchange agent for the purpose of receiving elections and
exchanging CWEI common shares and warrants for the merger consideration. Promptly after the completion of the merger, Noble
will deposit with the exchange agent sufficient cash and Noble common shares to be exchanged as the merger consideration in
accordance with the merger agreement. Such cash and Noble common shares are referred to as the “exchange fund.”

At the time of mailing of this proxy statement/prospectus each record holder of CWEI common shares is also separately being
sent an election form. The election form contains instructions for making a selection of merger consideration and for surrendering
your CWEI common shares in exchange for the merger consideration. The exchange agent must receive your properly completed
and signed election form and your stock certificates or book-entry shares, or an appropriate and customary guarantee of delivery
thereof, and any additional documents specified in the election form, by no later than the election deadline in order for your choice
as to the form of merger consideration to be considered with those timely made by the other CWEI stockholders and CWEI warrant
holders.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Noble and CWEI currently anticipate that the “election deadline” will be 5:00 p.m. Central time on April 24, 2017. Noble
and CWEI will issue a joint press release announcing the anticipated date of the election deadline not more than 15 business days
before, and at least five business days prior to, the anticipated date of the election deadline. Noble and CWEI will also issue a joint
press release if the election deadline changes. See “—Election Procedures” below.

Promptly after the completion of the merger, the exchange agent will mail a letter of transmittal to each holder of CWEI
common shares or CWEI warrants who has not surrendered all of its CWEI common shares or CWEI warrants, as applicable, prior
to the election deadline pursuant to a properly completed and signed election form. The letter of transmittal will contain instructions
for use in effecting the surrender of CWEI common shares (including any stock certificates, if shares are held in certificated form)
or CWEI warrants in exchange for the merger consideration and cash in lieu of any fractional Noble common shares and
distributions. When you surrender your CWEI common shares (including any stock certificates, if you hold shares in certificated
form) or CWEI warrants for cancellation after the election deadline (other than pursuant to the guaranteed delivery procedures set
forth in the election form), together with the letter of transmittal and any other required documents (including in respect of book-
entry shares), you will be entitled to receive the merger consideration, but you will not be entitled to make an election with respect
to the form of merger consideration you wish to receive. The form of merger consideration you receive may be in the form of Noble
common shares and/or a check for cash that you have the right to receive in lieu of any fractional Noble common shares, in respect
of any cash distributions on Noble common shares, or subject to proration of the merger consideration as described in “—Proration
Procedures” beginning on page 60.

Holders of CWEI common shares and CWEI warrants will not receive physical stock certificates for the Noble common shares
they are entitled to receive in the merger. Rather, they will receive statements indicating book-entry ownership of Noble common
shares.

CWEI STOCKHOLDERS SHOULD NOT SEND IN ANY STOCK CERTIFICATES WITH THE ENCLOSED
PROXY. THE ELECTION FORM CONTAINS, AND THE LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL WILL CONTAIN,
INSTRUCTIONS FOR SURRENDERING YOUR CWEI COMMON SHARES TO THE EXCHANGE AGENT IN
EXCHANGE FOR THE MERGER CONSIDERATION.

If you hold CWEI stock certificates, you will not be entitled to receive any dividends or other distributions on Noble common
shares until the merger is completed and you have surrendered your CWEI stock certificates, if any, together with a validly
completed letter of transmittal and any other required documents, in exchange for Noble common shares. If Noble effects any
dividend or other distribution on Noble common shares with a record date occurring after the time the merger is completed and a
payment date before the date you surrender your CWEI stock certificates, if any, you will receive the dividend or distribution,
without interest, with respect to the whole Noble common shares issued to you after you surrender your CWEI stock certificates, if
any, together with a validly completed letter of transmittal and any other required documents, and the Noble common shares are
issued in exchange. If Noble effects any dividend or other distribution on Noble common shares with a record date after the time the
merger is completed and a payment date after the date you surrender your CWEI stock certificates, you will receive the dividend or
distribution, without interest, on that payment date with respect to the whole Noble common shares issued to you. The exchange
agent may deduct and withhold amounts required under federal, state or local tax law.

Election Procedures

Each holder of record of a CWEI common share or CWEI warrant issued and outstanding immediately prior to the election
deadline (referred to as a “company holder”) shall have the right, subject to the limitations set forth in the merger agreement, to
submit an election on or prior to the election deadline in accordance with the following procedures:

• At the time of mailing of this proxy statement/prospectus, each company holder is also separately being sent an election
form, so as to permit the company holders to exercise their right to make an election as to merger consideration prior to
the election deadline. The exchange agent will make available one or more election forms as may reasonably be requested
from time to time by all persons who become holders of record of CWEI common shares or CWEI warrants during the
period following the record date for the CWEI special meeting and prior to the election deadline.

• Each company holder may specify on the election form in accordance with the provisions of the merger agreement and the
instructions on such form, (i) the number of CWEI common shares with respect to which

TABLE OF CONTENTS

such company holder desires to make a share election, (ii) the number of CWEI common shares with respect to which
such company holder desires to make a mixed election, (iii) the number of CWEI common shares with respect to which
such company holder desires to make a cash election and (iv) with respect to each CWEI warrant held by such company
holder, whether such company holder desires to make a share election, a mixed election or a cash election with respect to
such CWEI warrant. Any holder of CWEI common shares who makes an election shall be required to waive all appraisal
rights in connection with the CWEI common shares subject to such election.

• Any election will have been made properly only if the exchange agent shall have received, prior to the election deadline, a
properly completed and signed election form and certificates for (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the certificates), duly
endorsed in blank or otherwise in form acceptable for transfer on the books of CWEI, or book-entry delivery of, the CWEI
common shares or the CWEI warrants to which such election form relates, or an appropriate and customary guarantee of
delivery thereof from a firm that is an eligible guarantor institution (as defined in Rule 17Ad-15 under the Exchange Act)
as set forth in such election form, provided that such certificates, book-entry shares or warrants are in fact delivered to the
exchange agent by the time required in such guarantee of delivery, and any additional documents specified in election
form. Failure to deliver CWEI common shares or CWEI warrants, as applicable, covered by such guarantee of delivery
within the time set forth on such notice will be deemed to invalidate any otherwise properly made election, unless
otherwise determined by Noble, in its sole and absolute discretion.

• Any company holder may, at any time prior to the election deadline, change such election by written notice received by
the exchange agent prior to the election deadline accompanied by a properly completed and signed revised election form.
Any company holder may, at any time prior to the election deadline, revoke such election by written withdrawal prior to
the election deadline of such company holder’s stock certificates or warrants, as applicable, or of the guarantee of delivery
of such certificates or warrants, or any documents in respect of CWEI common shares in book-entry form, previously
deposited with the exchange agent. After an election is validly made with respect to any CWEI common shares or CWEI
warrants, any subsequent transfer of such CWEI common shares or CWEI warrants will automatically revoke such
election. All elections will be automatically deemed revoked upon receipt by the exchange agent of written notification
from CWEI that the merger agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms.

• The exchange agent will have reasonable discretion to determine if any election is not properly made with respect to any
CWEI common shares or CWEI warrants (none of the parties to the merger agreement or the exchange agent being under
any duty to notify any company holder of any such defect). In the event the exchange agent makes such a determination,
such election will be deemed to be not in effect, and the CWEI common shares or CWEI warrants covered by such
election will be deemed to be non-election shares or non-election warrants, as applicable, unless a proper election is
thereafter timely made with respect to such CWEI common shares or CWEI warrants. In the event that any CWEI warrant
in respect of which an election shall have been made is subsequently exercised, such election will automatically be
deemed to have been withdrawn as to such warrant.

• Noble, in the exercise of its reasonable discretion, will have the right to make all determinations, not inconsistent with the
terms of the merger agreement, governing the manner and extent to which elections are to be taken into account in making
the determinations with respect to proration.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Noble and CWEI currently anticipate that the “election deadline” will be 5:00 p.m. Central time on April 24, 2017.
Noble and CWEI will issue a joint press release announcing the anticipated date of the election deadline not more than 15 business
days before, and at least five business days prior to, the anticipated date of the election deadline. Noble and CWEI will also issue a
joint press release if the election deadline changes. Any CWEI common shares or CWEI warrants for which the exchange agent has
not received a properly completed and signed election form and related stock certificates, book-entry shares or warrants, or an
appropriate and customary guarantee of delivery thereof, and any additional documents specified in the election form, prior to the
election deadline (other than any CWEI common shares that constitute dissenting shares as of such time) will be deemed to be non-
election shares or non-election warrants.

Proration Procedures

As promptly as practicable after the completion of the merger, Noble will cause the exchange agent to effect the allocation of
merger consideration among the holders of CWEI common shares and CWEI warrants. The ability to elect to receive cash or Noble
common shares in exchange for CWEI common shares or CWEI warrants in the merger is subject to proration procedures set forth
in the merger agreement. Notwithstanding any elections made by holders of CWEI common shares and CWEI warrants, these
procedures are designed to ensure that, as nearly as practicable, the aggregate merger consideration paid in respect of all CWEI
common shares and CWEI warrants consists of 25% cash and 75% Noble common shares, based on the closing sale price for the
Noble common shares on January 12, 2017. The ability to receive the merger consideration of your choice will depend on the
elections of other CWEI stockholders and CWEI warrant holders. You may not receive the form of merger consideration that you
elect in the merger, and you may instead receive a pro-rata amount of cash, Noble common shares or both.

The greater the oversubscription of the share-election consideration, if any, the fewer Noble common shares and more cash a
holder of CWEI common shares or CWEI warrants making the share election will receive. Reciprocally, the greater the
oversubscription of the cash-election consideration, if any, the less cash and more Noble common shares a holder of CWEI common
shares or CWEI warrants making the cash election will receive. The proration of the merger consideration payable to CWEI
stockholder and CWEI warrant holders in the merger will not be known until Noble tallies the results of the elections made by
CWEI stockholders and CWEI warrant holders, which will not occur until near or after the closing of the merger.

Cash Conversion Number

The aggregate cash consideration will be approximately $665 million. The merger agreement sets forth the formula to calculate
the aggregate number of CWEI common shares and warrant notional common shares to be converted into the right to receive the
cash-election consideration (the “cash conversion number”).

The “cash conversion number” will be equal to the quotient of (i)(A) the cash component (as calculated below), minus (B) the
product of (x) the sum of the number of mixed-election shares plus the number of warrant notional common shares represented by
mixed-election warrants, multiplied by (y) $34.75, divided by (ii) $138.39.

The “cash component” will be equal to the difference of (i)(A) the sum of the number of CWEI common shares issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the completion of the merger (excluding treasury shares) plus the number of warrant notional
common shares represented by CWEI warrants outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the completion of the merger,
multiplied by (B) $34.75, minus (ii) the product of (x) the number of dissenting shares, multiplied by (y) $138.39.

No Proration Adjustment if Neither Cash election consideration nor Share election consideration is Oversubscribed

Notwithstanding the proration provisions in the merger agreement, a holder of CWEI common shares or CWEI warrants may
receive the merger consideration they elect if neither the cash-election consideration nor share-election consideration are
oversubscribed, which will occur if the sum of cash-election shares and warrant notional common shares represented by cash-
election warrants (together, the “total cash election number”) equals the cash conversion number.

Proration Adjustment if Cash election consideration is Oversubscribed

Share election consideration may be issued to holders of CWEI common shares or CWEI warrants who make cash elections if
the cash-election consideration is oversubscribed, which will occur if the total number of

TABLE OF CONTENTS

cash-election shares and warrant notional common shares represented by each cash-election warrant exceeds the cash conversion
number. If the cash-election consideration is oversubscribed, then:

(a) all share-election shares, share-election warrants, non-election shares and non-election warrants will be converted into the
right to receive the share-election consideration;

(b) all mixed-election shares and mixed-election warrants will be converted into the right to receive the mixed-election
consideration;

(c) all cash-election shares held by each holder will be converted into the right to receive (i) the cash-election consideration in
respect of the number of shares equal to the product of (A) the number of cash-election shares held by such holder,
multiplied by (B)(x) the cash conversion number, divided by (y) the total cash election number (with the exchange agent to
determine whether fractions of cash-election shares shall be rounded up or down) and (ii) the share-election consideration
in respect of such holder’s remaining number of cash-election shares; and

(d) each cash-election warrant will be converted into the right to receive (i) the cash-election consideration in respect of the
number of warrant notional common shares equal to the product of (A) the number of warrant notional common shares
represented by such cash-election warrant, multiplied by (B)(x) the cash conversion number, divided by (y) the total cash
election number (with the exchange agent to determine whether fractions of warrant notional common shares shall be
rounded up or down) and (ii) the share-election consideration in respect of the remaining warrant notional common shares
represented by such cash-election warrant.

Proration Adjustment if Cash election consideration is Undersubscribed

Cash election consideration may be issued to holders of CWEI common shares or CWEI warrants who make share elections if
the cash-election consideration is undersubscribed, which will occur if the total number of cash-election shares and warrant notional
common shares represented by each cash-election warrant is less than the cash conversion number (the amount by which the cash
conversion number exceeds the total cash election number being referred to herein as the “shortfall number”). If the cash-election
consideration is undersubscribed, then:

(a) all cash-election shares and cash-election warrants will be converted into the right to receive the cash-election
consideration;

(b) all mixed-election shares and mixed-election warrants will be converted into the right to receive the mixed-election
consideration; and

(c) the share-election shares, share-election warrants, no-election shares and no-election warrants will be treated in the
following manner:

(i) if the shortfall number is less than or equal to the sum of the number of non-election shares plus the number of
warrant notional common shares represented by non-election warrants (such sum, the “aggregate non-election
number”):

(A) all share-election shares and share-election warrants shall be converted into the right to receive the share-
election consideration;

(B) the non-election shares of each holder thereof shall be converted into the right to receive the cash-election
consideration in respect of that number of non-election shares equal to the product of (x) the number of non-
election shares held by such holder, multiplied by (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the shortfall number
and the denominator of which is the aggregate non-election number (with the exchange agent to determine
whether fractions of non-election shares shall be rounded up or down), with the remaining number of such
holder’s non-election shares being converted into the right to receive the share-election consideration; and

TABLE OF CONTENTS

(C) each non-election warrant shall be converted into the right to receive:

(x) the cash-election consideration in respect of that portion of the warrant notional common shares represented
by such warrant equal to the product of (I) the total number of warrant notional common shares represented
by such non-election warrant, multiplied by (II) a fraction, the numerator of which is the shortfall number
and the denominator of which is the aggregate non-election number (with the exchange agent to determine
whether fractions of warrant notional common shares shall be rounded up or down); and

(y) the share-election consideration with respect to the remaining portion of warrant notional common shares
represented by such non-election warrant.

(ii) if the shortfall number exceeds the aggregate non-election number:

(A) all non-election shares and non-election warrants shall be converted into the right to receive the cash-election
consideration;

(B) the share-election shares of each holder thereof shall be converted into the right to receive the cash-election
consideration in respect of that number of share-election shares equal to the product obtained of (x) the number
of share-election shares held by such holder, multiplied by (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount
by which the shortfall number exceeds the aggregate non-election number, and the denominator of which is the
sum of the number of share-election shares plus warrant notional common shares represented by share-election
warrants (with the exchange agent to determine whether fractions of share-election shares shall be rounded up or
down), with the remaining number of such holder’s share-election shares being converted into the right to
receive the share-election consideration; and

(C) each share-election warrant will be converted into the right to receive:

(x) the cash-election consideration in respect of that portion of the warrant notional common shares represented
by such warrant equal to the product of (I) the total number of warrant notional common shares represented
by such share-election warrant, multiplied by (II) a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount by which
the shortfall number exceeds the aggregate non-election number, and the denominator of which is the sum
of the number of share-election shares and warrant notional common shares represented by the share-
election warrants (with the exchange agent to determine whether fractions of warrant notional common
shares shall be rounded up or down); and

(y) the share-election consideration with respect to the remaining portion of warrant notional common shares
represented by such share-election warrant.

Treatment of CWEI Equity Awards

Stock Options. In connection with the merger, each CWEI option that is outstanding immediately prior to the effective time will
vest and be exchanged for the number of Noble common shares, rounded down to the nearest whole share, equal to the quotient of
(i) the product of (A) the number of CWEI common shares subject to the CWEI option, multiplied by (B) the amount, if any, by
which the per share closing trading price of CWEI common shares on the business day immediately before the effective time
exceeds the exercise price per CWEI common share otherwise purchasable pursuant to the CWEI option immediately prior to the
effective time, divided by (ii) the average of the closing sale prices of a Noble common share as reported on the NYSE for the ten
consecutive full trading days, ending at the close of trading on the full trading day immediately preceding the date on which the
effective time occurs. If such calculation results in zero or a negative number, the applicable CWEI option shall be forfeited for no
consideration.

Restricted Shares. In connection with the merger, the CWEI restricted shares outstanding immediately prior to the effective
time will be converted into a number of restricted Noble common shares equal to the number of CWEI restricted shares multiplied
by the share-election exchange ratio of 3.7222, rounded up to the nearest whole share, and subject to the same vesting, repurchase
and other restrictions as the CWEI restricted shares.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Completion of the Merger

Unless Noble and CWEI agree otherwise to another date, completion of the merger will occur on (a) the later of (i) April 8,
2017 and (ii) the third business day after satisfaction or waiver of all the conditions described under “—Conditions to Completion of
the Merger” below. The merger will be effective at the time the certificate of merger is filed with the Secretary of State of the State
of Delaware or at such later time as may be specified therein.

Conditions to Completion of the Merger

Each party’s obligation to consummate the merger is conditioned upon the satisfaction (or waiver by such party) at or prior to
the closing of the merger of each of the following:

• approval of the merger proposal by vote of the holders of a majority of outstanding CWEI common shares;

• termination or expiration of any waiting period (and any extension thereof) applicable to the merger under the HSR Act;

• absence of any law, order, judgment or injunction prohibiting consummation of the merger;

• effectiveness of the registration statement of which this proxy statement/prospectus is a part under the Securities Act and
no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the registration statement having been issued and no proceedings for that
purpose having been initiated or threatened by the SEC;

• approval of the new Noble common shares deliverable to the holders of CWEI common shares for listing on the NYSE,
subject to official notice of issuance;

• (i) the truth and correctness of the representations and warranties of the other party with respect to certain fundamental
matters (organization, general authority and standing, certain capitalization matters, required power and authority, and
board approval) as of the date of the merger agreement and as of the closing of the merger, as if made as of such date
(except to the extent expressly made as of an earlier date, in which case as of such date), (ii) with respect to Noble, the
truth and correctness of certain representations and warranties of CWEI with respect to capitalization as of the date of the
merger agreement and as of the closing date, except for any de minimis inaccuracies, and (iii) the truth and correctness of
all other representations and warranties of the other party as of the date of the merger agreement and as of the closing of
the merger, as if made as of such date (except to the extent expressly made as of an earlier date, in which case as of such
date), except where the failure to be so true and correct (without giving effect to any limitation as to “materiality” or
“material adverse effect” set forth in any individual such representation or warranty) would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on the other party;

• performance of and compliance with, in all material respects, each and all of the agreements and covenants of the other
party required to be performed and complied with by such other party pursuant to the merger agreement;

• receipt of a certificate signed by the chief executive officer of the other party, dated as of the closing date, certifying that
the two preceding conditions have been satisfied; and

• receipt of a legal opinion of counsel to the effect that, on the basis of facts, representations, assumptions, and exclusions
set forth or referred to in such opinion, the merger and the second merger, considered together, will qualify for U.S. federal
income tax purposes as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

operate the business as presently constituted;

• capital structure;

• corporate authority to enter into and perform the merger agreement, enforceability of the merger agreement, and approval

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Additionally, the merger agreement contains representations and warranties made only by Noble and Merger Sub regarding,
among other things:

• operations of Merger Sub; and

• neither Noble nor Merger Sub, nor any of their respective “affiliates” and “associates,” being or in the past three years
having been an “interested stockholder” of CWEI, as defined in Section 203 of the DGCL.

Many of the representations and warranties in the merger agreement are qualified by a “materiality” or “material adverse
effect” standard (that is, they will not be deemed to be untrue or incorrect unless their failure to be true or correct, individually or in
the aggregate, would be material or reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect). For purposes of the merger
agreement, a “material adverse effect” means, when used with respect to a party to the merger agreement (1) a material adverse
effect on the ability of such party to perform or comply with any material obligation under the merger agreement or to consummate
the merger, or (2) any change, event, development, circumstance, condition, occurrence, effect, or combination of the foregoing that
has or would be reasonably expected to have a material adverse effect on the business, operations, condition (financial or
otherwise), or results of operations of such party and its subsidiaries taken as a whole; provided, however, in no event will any of the
following be taken into account, individually or in the aggregate, when determining whether there has been or would reasonably be
expected to be a “material adverse effect” with respect to a party to the merger agreement:

• changes in the general economic, financial, credit or securities markets, including prevailing interest rates or currency
rates, or regulatory or political conditions and changes in oil, natural gas, condensate or natural gas liquids prices or the
prices of other commodities, including changes in price differentials;

• changes in general economic conditions in: (a) the oil and gas exploration and production industry; (b) the oil and natural
gas gathering, compressing, treating, processing and transportation industry generally; (c) the natural gas liquids
fractionating and transportation industry generally; (d) the crude oil and condensate logistics and marketing industry
generally; and (e) the natural gas marketing and trading industry generally (including in each case changes in law affecting
such industries);

• the outbreak or escalation of hostilities or acts of war or terrorism;

• any hurricane, tornado, flood, earthquake or other natural disaster;

• with respect to CWEI only, the identity of, or actions or omissions of, Noble, Merger Sub or their respective affiliates or
any action taken pursuant to or in accordance with the merger agreement or at the request of or with the consent of Noble;

• the announcement or pendency of the merger agreement;

• any change in the market price or trading volume of such party’s common stock;

• any failure to meet any financial projections or estimates or forecasts of revenues, earnings or other financial metrics for
any period;

• any downgrade in rating of any indebtedness or debt securities of such party;

• changes in any laws or regulations applicable to such party;

• changes in applicable accounting regulations or the interpretations thereof; and

• any legal proceedings commenced by or involving any current or former member, director, partner or stockholder of such
party (on their own behalf or on behalf of such party) arising out of or related to the merger agreement, merger or other
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement;

except that, with respect to the first through fourth bullets above, any such change, event, development, circumstance, condition,
occurrence or effect will be taken into account if and to the extent that it disproportionately adversely effects such party, as
compared to other similarly situated persons operating in the industries in which such party operates.

Conduct of Business Prior to Closing

Each of Noble and CWEI has undertaken customary covenants in the merger agreement restricting the conduct of its respective
business between the date of the merger agreement and the completion of the merger.

businesses with a value of less than $10,000,000 in the aggregate and sales of hydrocarbons and equipment in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice; acquire, directly or indirectly, or lease any assets (including any intangible
assets), securities, properties, interests or businesses other than the acquisition or lease in the ordinary course of business

transaction with any other party; convert to any other business entity; or become a non-consenting party in any operation
proposed with respect to any of the oil and gas properties;

understanding or commitment with respect to the voting of the equity or voting securities;

• amend, adopt or propose any amendment to the CWEI charter or bylaws or any organizational documents of any of
CWEI’s subsidiaries;

CWEI has agreed that neither it nor its subsidiaries nor any of its or its subsidiaries’ respective officers, directors, employees or
other representatives will, directly or indirectly:

• initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate any inquiries or the making or the submission of any
proposal that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, an alternative proposal (as defined below);

• participate or engage in any discussions or negotiations with, or disclose any non-public information or data or afford

TABLE OF CONTENTS

subsidiaries whose business constitutes 20% or more of the net revenues, net income or assets of CWEI and its subsidiaries, taken as
a whole, (iii) tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any person or “group” (as defined in Section 13(d)
of the Exchange Act) beneficially owning 20% or more of the outstanding CWEI common shares, or (iv) merger, consolidation,

such person or group to acquire beneficial ownership of at least 20% of the consolidated assets of CWEI and its subsidiaries or at
least 20% of any class of equity securities or capital stock of CWEI or any of its subsidiaries whose business constitutes 20% or
more of the net revenues, net income or assets of CWEI and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

Notwithstanding the restrictions described above, if at any time prior to approval of the merger proposal by CWEI’s
stockholders, (i) CWEI receives an unsolicited, written alternative proposal from a third party, that the CWEI board believes in good
faith is bona fide, (ii) the CWEI board, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, determines in good
faith that such alternative proposal constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to or result in a superior proposal (as defined
below), and (iii) the CWEI board determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel,
that the failure to participate in such negotiations or discussions or to furnish such information or data to such third party would be
inconsistent with the CWEI board’s fiduciary duties under applicable law, then CWEI may, subject to the requirements described
below, furnish information, including confidential information, and participate in discussions or negotiations regarding such
alternative proposal.

The merger agreement requires CWEI to promptly, and in no event later than 24 hours after receipt, provide notice to Noble of
any alternative proposal, or any inquiry or request for discussions or negotiations regarding any alternative proposal. The required
notice must include a copy of the alternative proposal and any draft agreements, if in writing, and, if oral, a reasonably detailed
summary of the alternative proposal and the identity of the third party making the alternative proposal. CWEI is obligated to keep
Noble reasonably informed of material developments with respect to any alternative proposal (and to inform Noble in no event later
than 24 hours following any such development). Furthermore, CWEI will not, and will cause its subsidiaries and its and their
respective directors, officers and employees not to, disclose any non-public information to the third party unless CWEI has entered
into a confidentiality agreement with the third party with confidentiality provisions that are not materially less restrictive to such
third party than the provisions of the confidentiality agreement between CWEI and Noble are to Noble, a copy of which must be
promptly provided to Noble. Further, prior to providing to a third party any non-public information that was not previously provided
or made available to Noble, CWEI must provide such non-public information to Noble.

Board Recommendation

Under the merger agreement, the CWEI board has agreed to recommend that CWEI stockholders vote in favor of the merger
proposal, which is referred to as the CWEI board recommendation. Subject to the provisions described below, the merger agreement
provides that the CWEI board, directly or indirectly, will not:

• withhold, withdraw, modify, qualify or fail to make, or publically propose to withhold, withdraw, modify, qualify or fail to
make, in any manner adverse to Noble, the CWEI board recommendation;

• publicly approve, adopt or recommend, or publicly propose to approve, adopt or recommend, any alternative proposal;

• approve, adopt or recommend, or publicly propose to approve, adopt or recommend, or allow CWEI or any of its
subsidiaries to execute or enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger
agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement or other similar contract or any tender or
exchange offer providing for, with respect to, or in connection with, any alternative proposal;

• approve any transaction under, or any third party becoming an “interested stockholder” under, Section 203 of the DGCL;
or

• resolve, propose, agree or publicly announce an intention to do any of the foregoing.

Each of the foregoing actions is referred to as a “change in recommendation.”

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Notwithstanding these restrictions, before CWEI obtains its stockholder approval, the CWEI board may make a change in
recommendation and terminate the merger agreement if:

• CWEI receives a written alternative proposal that the CWEI board believes in good faith is bona fide and such alternative
proposal was not initiated, solicited, encouraged or facilitated;

• the CWEI board, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, concludes that such alternative
proposal constitutes a superior proposal;

• following consultation with outside legal counsel, the CWEI board determines that the failure of the CWEI board to make
a change in recommendation would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law; and

• prior to or simultaneous with such termination, CWEI has paid Noble the termination fee, as further described below.

The merger agreement further provides that the CWEI board may not make a change in recommendation and terminate the
merger agreement unless: (i) CWEI has provided prior written notice to Noble specifying in reasonable detail the reasons for such
action at least four calendar days in advance of its intention to take such action with respect to a change in recommendation; (ii)
CWEI has negotiated with Noble in good faith to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of the merger agreement; and
(iii) the CWEI board again concludes in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, and
taking into account any adjustment or modification to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement proposed by Noble, that the
alternative proposal continues to constitute a superior proposal and that the failure of the CWEI board to effect a change in
recommendation or to terminate the merger agreement with respect to such superior proposal would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable law.

A “superior proposal” means a written offer, obtained after the date of the merger agreement, to acquire, directly or indirectly,
more than 50% of the outstanding CWEI common shares or more than 50% of the consolidated assets of CWEI and its subsidiaries,
made by a third party, which is on terms and conditions which the CWEI board determines in good faith to be more favorable to the
CWEI stockholders (in their capacity as stockholders), than the merger, taking into account at the time of determination all financial,
legal and regulatory terms and conditions of the alternative proposal and the merger agreement, including any changes to the terms
of the merger agreement that as of that time had been committed to by Noble in writing in response to such superior proposal,
including any conditions to and expected timing of consummation, and any risks of non-consummation, of such alternative
proposal.

Notwithstanding these restrictions, before CWEI obtains its stockholder approval, the CWEI board may make a change in
recommendation in response to an intervening event (as defined below) to the extent that the CWEI board determines in good faith,
after consultation with the outside legal counsel, that the failure of the CWEI board to effect a change in recommendation would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law, and:

• CWEI provides Noble four calendar days written notice of its intention to take such action and the reasons for such action;

• CWEI negotiates in good faith with Noble during such four day period to make such revisions to the terms of the merger
agreement as would permit the CWEI board not to make a change in recommendation; and

• the CWEI board has considered in good faith any changes to the merger agreement offered in writing by Noble, and
following such the four day period, has determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and
financial advisors, that the CWEI board’s fiduciary duties under applicable law would continue to require a change in
recommendation with respect to such intervening event.

An “intervening event” means a material event, fact, circumstance, development or occurrence that is not known or reasonably
foreseeable (or if known or reasonably foreseeable, the probability or magnitude of consequences of which were not known or
reasonably foreseeable) to or by the CWEI board, which event, fact, circumstance, development or occurrence becomes known to or
by the CWEI board prior to obtaining the CWEI stockholder approval.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Notwithstanding the restrictions described above, the merger agreement does not prohibit CWEI from (i) taking and disclosing
to its respective stockholders a position required by Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act or (ii) complying with Rule 14d-9 under the
Exchange Act.

Reasonable Best Efforts to Obtain Required Stockholder Approval

CWEI has agreed to, as soon as reasonably practicable after the date of the merger agreement, establish a record date for and,
as soon as reasonably practicable after the effectiveness of the registration statement of which this proxy statement/prospectus is a
part, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders to consider the merger proposal. Without the prior
written consent of Noble, the adoption of the merger agreement by CWEI stockholders, approval of any adjournment of the CWEI
Special meeting, if necessary to solicit additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes to approve the merger proposal at the time
of the CWEI Special meeting and an advisory vote on compensation payable to executive officers of CWEI are the only proposals
permitted to be submitted to, or voted on by, the CWEI stockholders. Unless a change in recommendation occurs in compliance
with the terms of the merger agreement, the CWEI board will recommend approval of the merger proposal to its stockholders and
use its reasonable best efforts to solicit and obtain adoption of the merger agreement.

Agreement to Take Further Action and to Use Reasonable Best Efforts

Each of Noble, Merger Sub, and CWEI are required to cooperate with each other and use their reasonable best efforts to (i)
take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do, or cause to be done, promptly and to assist and cooperate with the other parties to the
merger agreement in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to cause the conditions to the closing to be satisfied as promptly
as practicable (and in any event no later than July 17, 2017) and to consummate and make effective the merger, including preparing
and filing all documentation to effect all necessary filings, notifications, notices, petitions, statements, registrations, applications and
other documents (including any required or recommended filings under applicable antitrust laws), (ii) obtain promptly (and in any
event no later than July 17, 2017) all approvals, consents, clearances, expirations or terminations of waiting periods, registrations,
permits and other confirmations from any governmental authority or third party necessary or advisable to consummate the merger,
(iii) defend any lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging the merger agreement or the
merger, (iv) obtain all necessary third party consents, approvals or waivers, and (v) execute and deliver any additional instruments
necessary to consummate the merger.

Each party must file the notification and report form pursuant to the HSR Act as promptly as practicable, and in any event
within 10 business days after the date of the merger agreement, and supply as promptly as practicable any additional information
and documentary material that may be requested by any governmental authority pursuant to the HSR Act or any other antitrust law
and use its reasonable best efforts to take all other actions necessary to cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting
periods under the HSR Act as soon as practicable (and in any event no later than July 17, 2017).

Furthermore, each party must use its reasonable best efforts to (i) cooperate in all respects with the other party in connection
with any filing or submission with a governmental authority in connection with the merger and in connection with any investigation
or other inquiry relating to the merger, (ii) promptly inform the other party of, and supply to the other party, any communication
received from the Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice, or any other governmental
authority and any material communication received or given in connection with any proceeding by a private party, in each case
regarding the merger, (iii) permit the other party to review in advance and incorporate the other party’s reasonable comments in any
communication to be given by it to any governmental authority with respect to obtaining any clearances required under any antitrust
law, and (iv) consult with the other party in advance of any meeting or teleconference with any governmental authority or, in
connection with any proceeding by a private party, with any other person, and give the other party the opportunity to attend and
participate in such meetings and teleconferences.

Employee Benefits Matters

From the completion of the merger through December 31, 2017, Noble will provide or will cause to be provided to each
employee who remains in the active employment of Noble (referred to in this proxy statement/prospectus as a “continuing
employee”) with a base salary or wages that are no less than the continuing employee’s base salary or wages as of the completion of
the merger, and a target bonus opportunity that is no less favorable than the opportunity provided to such continuing employee as of
the completion of the merger.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Noble will or will cause to be honored all obligations under each CWEI employee benefit plan that remains in effect after the
completion of the merger, including any rights or benefits arising as a result of the merger (either alone or in combination with any
other event, including termination of employment). Noble agreed and acknowledged that the consummation of the merger
constitutes a “change of control” or a “change in control” or similar term, as the case may be, for all purposes under each CWEI
employee benefit plan.

As of the completion of the merger, Noble will use or will cause to be used commercially reasonable efforts to cause each
material Noble employee benefit plan (including all applicable vacation, severance and defined contribution retirement benefit plans
and programs) in which any continuing employee becomes eligible to participate to treat the prior service of such continuing
employee with CWEI and its affiliates as service rendered to Noble for all purposes (including vesting, eligibility, level of benefit
and benefit accrual purposes, but other than for purposes of benefit accrual under any defined benefit plan or vesting under any
equity compensation plan) to the extent that such service crediting does not violate any applicable law or result in duplication of
benefits for the same period of service.

Noble will use or will cause to be used commercially reasonable efforts to (i) waive any limitation on health and welfare
coverage of any continuing employee and his or her eligible dependents due to pre-existing conditions and/or waiting periods, active
employment requirements, and requirements to show evidence of good health under the applicable health and welfare plan of Noble
or any affiliate of Noble to the extent such continuing employee and his or her eligible dependents are covered under a health and
welfare benefit plan of CWEI or any of its affiliates (as the case may be), and such conditions, periods or requirements are satisfied
or waived under such plan, immediately prior to the completion of the merger and (ii) credit each continuing employee and his or
her eligible dependents with all deductible payments, co-payments and co-insurance paid by such employee and covered dependents
under the medical employee benefit plan of CWEI or any of its affiliates (as the case may be) prior to the completion of the merger
during the year in which the completion of the merger occurs for the purpose of determining the extent to which any such employee
and his or her dependents have satisfied their deductible and whether they have reached the out-of-pocket maximum under any
medical plan of Noble or any affiliate of Noble for such year.

For purposes of determining the number of vacation days and other paid time off to which each continuing employee is entitled
during the calendar year in which the completion of merger occurs, Noble will assume and honor or will cause to be assumed and
honored all vacation and other paid time off days accrued or earned but not yet taken by such employee as of the completion of the
merger to the extent reflected on CWEI’s books and records.

Other Covenants and Agreements

The merger agreement contains additional agreements relating to, among other matters:

Access to Information; Confidentiality

Until completion of the merger, each of Noble and CWEI have agreed to afford the other party and its representatives
reasonable access, during normal business hours and on certain conditions, to all of its and its subsidiaries’ respective properties,
books, contracts, commitments, personnel and records. Also, each of Noble and CWEI have agreed to keep confidential any
nonpublic information in accordance with the terms of the confidentiality agreement.

State Takeover Laws

Neither Noble nor CWEI will take any action that would cause the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement to be
subject to requirements imposed by any takeover laws, and each of them will take all reasonable steps within its control to exempt
(or ensure the continued exemption of) the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement from the takeover laws of any state
that purport to apply to the merger agreement or the merger.

Indemnification, Expense Advancement and Insurance

After the closing of the merger, Noble and the surviving company, jointly and severally, will (i) indemnify and hold harmless
officers or directors of CWEI or any of its subsidiaries or a director, officer, employee, member, trustee or fiduciary of another
corporation, foundation, partnership, joint venture, trust, pension or other employee benefit plan or enterprise if such service was at
the request or for the benefit of the CWEI or any of its subsidiaries, together with such party’s heirs, executors, trustees, fiduciaries
and administrators, which are referred to collectively as the

TABLE OF CONTENTS

indemnified parties, to the fullest extent authorized or permitted by applicable law from and against any losses, claims, damages,
liabilities, costs, indemnification expenses, judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement arising out of or in connection
with any claim or action, and (ii) promptly pay on behalf of or advance to each of the indemnified parties, any expenses incurred in
defending, serving as a witness with respect to or otherwise participating with respect to any claim or action in advance.

Pursuant to the merger agreement, for a period of six years from the date on which the effective time occurs, the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of the surviving company and the organizational documents of CWEI’s subsidiaries will contain
provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses, exculpation and limitations on liability of
directors and officers than are set forth in the CWEI charter and bylaws, and Noble and the surviving company will maintain in
effect directors’ and officers’ liability and fiduciary liability insurance policies which will cover the indemnified parties with respect
to matters occurring on or before the closing of the merger on substantially the same terms and conditions as the policies currently
maintained by CWEI, with annual premiums not to exceed 300% of the last annual premiums paid for such insurance policies.

Certain Tax Matters

All parties to the merger agreement agreed to adopt the merger agreement as a “plan of reorganization” within the meaning of
Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-2(g). The parties must cooperate and use their respective reasonable efforts in order for CWEI
and Noble to obtain tax opinions from their respective counsel.

Any liability arising out of any real estate transfer tax with respect to interests in real property owned directly or indirectly by
CWEI or any of its subsidiaries immediately prior to the closing of the merger will be borne by CWEI.

Section 16 Matters

Prior to the completion of the merger, Noble and CWEI have agreed to take all steps as may be required to cause any
dispositions of CWEI common shares resulting from the merger by each individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to CWEI, or will become subject to such reporting requirements with respect to the
surviving company, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

Public Statements

Noble and CWEI will not issue any public announcements or make other public disclosures regarding the merger or the merger
agreement, without the prior written approval of the other party; provided, however, that each of Noble and CWEI may make a
public statement or other public disclosure required by law or any applicable stock exchange, provided that the disclosing party has
used reasonable best efforts to consult with the other party before issuing, and provide the other party with the reasonable
opportunity to review and provide reasonable comment regarding, any press release or any public announcement primarily relating
to the merger agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby. Either party may make public statements or presentations in
connection with industry conferences, investor meetings, analyst or investor conference calls, or in response to questions from
investors, analysts, press or other media, so long as such statements or presentations are not materially inconsistent with public
statements or presentations previously approved by the other party.

Listing

Noble has agreed to use its commercially reasonable efforts to list the Noble common shares to be issued in connection with
the merger on the NYSE, prior to the completion of the merger, subject to official notice of issuance.

Third Party Approvals

Noble and CWEI and their respective subsidiaries will cooperate and use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to
prepare all documentation, to effect all filings, to obtain all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all governmental
authorities and third parties necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and to comply with
the terms and conditions of such permits, consents, approvals and authorizations and to cause the merger to be consummated as
expeditiously as practicable. Each of Noble and CWEI has the right to review in advance, and to the extent practicable each will
consult with the other,

INFORMATION ABOUT NOBLE

Business

Noble is a leading independent crude oil and natural gas exploration and production company with a diversified high-quality
portfolio spanning three continents and consisting of both U.S. unconventional and global offshore conventional assets. Founded in
1932, Noble is a Delaware corporation, incorporated in 1969, and has been publicly traded on the NYSE since 1980. Noble has a
unique history of growth, evolving from a regional crude oil and natural gas producer to a global exploration and production
company included in the Standard & Poor’s 500.

Noble’s purpose, Energizing the World, Bettering People’s Lives®, reflects its commitment to find and deliver energy through
crude oil, natural gas and NGL exploration and production while living its commitment to contribute to the betterment of people’s
lives in the communities in which it operates. Noble strives to build trust through stakeholder engagement, act on its values, provide
a safe work environment, respect its environment and care for its employees and the communities where it operates.

Noble’s portfolio of assets is diversified through U.S. and international projects and a production mix among crude oil, natural
gas, and NGLs. In particular, Noble’s business is focused on both U.S. unconventional basins and certain global conventional
basins. Noble endeavors to maintain a high-quality, growth-oriented portfolio of assets that are well-positioned on the global
industry cost supply curve. In addition, Noble’s asset portfolio offers operational and investment flexibility.

In U.S. unconventional basins, Noble has demonstrated competence in applying geological capabilities, drilling and completion
expertise and midstream synergies to deliver incremental value. In onshore U.S., Noble typically applies a major project
development concept to a U.S. unconventional basin by utilizing an integrated development plan approach. In the global offshore,
Noble has had notable exploration successes over the past decade, which have led to Noble’s entry into new conventional offshore
basins. Noble has executed several major offshore development projects both on schedule and within budget which have provided
long-lived cash flows to its business.

Approximately 75% of Noble’s capital is allocated to U.S. onshore development, primarily focused on liquids-rich
opportunities in the DJ Basin, Delaware Basin and Eagle Ford Shale. Eastern Mediterranean capital expenditures, including initial
development costs associated with the Leviathan project, represent over 20% of the total. As Noble manages its asset portfolio, it
will consider expanding the portfolio to include additional long-term and/or large-scale exploration opportunities.

In addition, the majority of Noble’s assets are held by production, which provides for further investment and financial
flexibility. Occasional strategic acquisitions of producing or non-producing properties, combined with the periodic divestment of
assets, have allowed Noble to pursue its objective of a well-diversified, growing portfolio delivering attractive financial returns.

Oil and Gas Properties and Activities

Noble searches for crude oil and natural gas properties onshore and offshore, and seeks to acquire exploration rights and
conduct exploration activities in numerous areas of interest. Noble’s activities include geophysical and geological evaluation;
analysis of commercial, regulatory and political risks; and exploratory drilling, where appropriate.

Noble’s current portfolio consists primarily of interests in developed and undeveloped crude oil and natural gas leases and
concessions. These properties contribute all of Noble’s crude oil, natural gas and NGL production, provide continual investment
opportunities in proved areas, and offer further exploration opportunities. Noble’s new venture areas provide frontier exploration
opportunities, which may result in the establishment of new operational areas in the future. Noble also owns midstream assets
primarily used in the processing and transportation of Noble’s onshore U.S. production.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

The map below illustrates the locations of Noble’s significant crude oil and natural gas exploration and production activities:

 

Operating Segments

Noble manages its operations by region. Its segments, each of which is primarily in the business of crude oil, natural gas and
NGL exploration, development, production and acquisition, include:

• United States, including the DJ Basin, Permian Basin, Eagle Ford Shale, Marcellus Shale, and deepwater Gulf of Mexico,
as well as the consolidated accounts of Noble Midstream, which completed its initial public offering of common units in
2016;

• Eastern Mediterranean, including offshore Israel and Cyprus;

• West Africa, including offshore Equatorial Guinea, Cameroon, and Gabon; and

• Other international and corporate, including new ventures such as offshore the Falkland Islands, Suriname, and
Newfoundland.

Development Activities

Noble’s development projects have resulted from both exploration success as well as periodic strategic acquisitions. These
projects provide multiple opportunities for consistent growth at attractive financial returns. Each project progresses, as appropriate,
through the various development phases including appraisal, engineering and design, development drilling, construction and
production. While development projects require significant capital investments, typically over a multi-year period, they offer
sustained cash flows and attractive financial returns, while generally increasing net asset value over the oil and gas business cycle.

Onshore U.S., Noble’s low production-risk development programs, typically centered around IDPs, provide a stable base of
production. These programs, which have delivered significant historical production growth, accommodate a flexible capital
investment program that can be varied in response to changes in the commodity price environment. Noble continues to enhance
project performance in these areas through technology and operational efficiencies.

Offshore, Noble engages in long-cycle development projects, such as the Tamar natural gas development offshore Israel, which
is currently undergoing expansion. Noble is also progressing a final investment decision for the first phase of development at the
Leviathan natural gas field, offshore Israel, the largest natural gas discovery in Noble’s history.

Exploration Activities

Noble primarily focuses on organic growth from exploration and development drilling activities, concentrating on basins or
plays where it has strategic competitive advantages. These advantages are derived from proprietary

seismic data and operational expertise, which Noble believes will generate superior returns over the oil and gas business cycle.
Noble has had substantial historic exploration success in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, the Levant Basin offshore Eastern
Mediterranean and the Douala Basin offshore West Africa, resulting in the successful completion of numerous major development
projects over the past decade.

In 2016, Noble performed limited exploration activities due to the commodity price environment. Also, after review of
additional 3D seismic data, modeling and economic assessment, it determined that certain discoveries offshore West Africa were
impaired in the current forward outlook for crude oil prices and wrote off related capitalized costs of $468 million, which is
included in exploration expense.

For 2017, Noble anticipates engaging in seismic acquisition and processing and potentially drilling an exploratory well
offshore Suriname.

Acquisition and Divestiture Activities

Noble maintains an ongoing portfolio management program. Accordingly, it may engage in acquisitions of additional crude oil
or natural gas properties and related assets through either direct acquisitions of the assets or acquisitions of entities owning the
assets. Noble may also periodically divest non-strategic assets through asset or equity sales, exchanges, dissolutions of joint
ventures or other transactions.

During 2016, Noble generated cash of approximately $1.5 billion through asset sales and the initial public offering of Noble
Midstream common units.

For the year ended December 31, 2016, Noble had total revenues of approximately $3.5 billion and a net loss of approximately
$998.0 million.

Noble’s principal offices are located at 1001 Noble Energy Way, Houston, Texas 77070 and its telephone number is (281) 872-
3100. Noble common shares are listed on the NYSE, trading under the symbol “NBL.”

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Required Vote

Required Vote to Approve the Merger Proposal (Item 1 on the Proxy Card)

Approval of the merger proposal requires the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the outstanding CWEI common
shares entitled to vote on the merger proposal.

Required Vote to Approve the Adjournment Proposal (Item 2 on the Proxy Card)

Approval of the adjournment proposal requires the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the CWEI common shares

Treatment of Abstentions; Failure to Vote

For purposes of the CWEI special meeting, an abstention occurs when a CWEI stockholder attends the CWEI special meeting,
either in person or by proxy, but abstains from voting or fails to vote.

• For the merger proposal, an abstention or a failure to submit a proxy card or to vote in person at the CWEI special meeting
will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” such proposal.

• For the adjournment proposal, an abstention will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” such proposal. A failure to
submit a proxy card or to vote in person at the CWEI special meeting will have no effect on the outcome of the vote for
the adjournment proposal.

• For the advisory compensation proposal, an abstention will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” such proposal. A
failure to submit a proxy card or to vote in person at the CWEI special meeting will have no effect on the outcome of the
vote for the advisory compensation proposal, assuming a quorum is present.

Voting of Proxies; Incomplete Proxies

Giving a proxy means that a CWEI stockholder authorizes the persons named in the enclosed proxy card to vote its shares at
the CWEI special meeting in the manner it directs. A CWEI stockholder may vote by proxy or in person at the CWEI special
meeting. If you hold your CWEI common shares in your name as a stockholder of record, you, as a CWEI stockholder, may submit
a proxy:

• By Telephone: By dialing the toll-free number specified on the proxy card and following the instructions on the proxy
card;

• Via the Internet: By accessing the website specified on the proxy card and following the instructions on the proxy card;
or

• By Mail: By completing and returning the proxy card in the enclosed envelope. The envelope requires no additional
postage if mailed in the United States.

CWEI requests that CWEI stockholders submit their proxies over the phone or internet or by completing and returning the
accompanying proxy as soon as possible in the enclosed postage-paid envelope. When the accompanying proxy is returned properly
executed, the CWEI common shares represented by it will be voted at the CWEI special meeting in accordance with the instructions
contained on the proxy card.

If any proxy is properly signed and dated but returned without indication as to how to vote, the CWEI common shares
represented by the proxy will be voted as recommended by the CWEI board. Unless a CWEI stockholder checks the box on its
proxy card to withhold discretionary authority, the proxyholders may use their discretion to vote on other matters relating to the
CWEI special meeting.

Every CWEI stockholder’s vote is important. Accordingly, each CWEI stockholder should sign, date and return the
enclosed proxy card, or submit a proxy by telephone or via the Internet, whether or not it plans to attend the CWEI special
meeting in person. Proxies must be received by 11:59 p.m., Eastern time, on April 23, 2017.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Shares Held in Street Name; Broker Non-Votes

If you are a CWEI stockholder and your shares are held in an account at a broker or bank or through another nominee, you
must instruct the broker or other nominee on how to vote your shares by following the instructions that the broker, bank or other
nominee provides to you with this prospectus/proxy statement. Most brokers offer the ability for stockholders to submit voting
instructions by mail by completing a voting instruction card, by telephone and via the internet.

If you do not provide voting instructions to your broker or other nominee, your shares will not be voted on any proposal on
which your broker or other nominee does not have discretionary authority to vote. This is referred to in this proxy
statement/prospectus and in general as a broker non-vote. In these cases, the broker or other nominee cannot register your shares as
being present at the CWEI special meeting for purposes of determining a quorum, and will not be able to vote your shares on those
matters for which specific authorization is required. Under current NYSE rules, brokers do not have discretionary authority to vote
on any of the proposals, including the merger proposal. As a result, a broker non-vote of a CWEI common share will have the same
effect as a vote “AGAINST” the merger proposal and will have no effect on the outcome of the vote on the adjournment proposal
or the advisory compensation proposal (assuming in the case of the advisory compensation proposal that a quorum is present).

Revocability of Proxies and Changes to a CWEI Stockholder’s Vote

You may revoke your proxy and/or change your vote at any time before your CWEI common shares are voted by proxy at the
CWEI special meeting by:

• sending a written notice, which is received prior to your vote being cast at the CWEI special meeting, to Clayton Williams
Energy, Inc., 6 Desta Drive, Suite 6500, Midland, Texas 79705, Attention: Secretary, that bears a date later than the date of
the proxy and states that you revoke your proxy;

• submitting a valid, later-dated proxy by mail, telephone or via the internet that is received prior to your vote being cast at
the CWEI special meeting; or

• attending the CWEI special meeting and voting by ballot in person (your attendance at the CWEI special meeting will not,
by itself, revoke any proxy that you have previously given).

If you hold your CWEI common shares through a broker or other nominee, you must follow the directions you receive from
your broker or other nominee in order to revoke your proxy or change your voting instructions.

Solicitation of Proxies

This proxy statement/prospectus is furnished in connection with the solicitation of proxies by the CWEI board. CWEI will bear
all costs and expenses in connection with the solicitation of proxies. CWEI has engaged Morrow Sodali LLC to assist in the
solicitation of proxies for the CWEI special meeting. CWEI estimates it will pay Morrow Sodali LLC a fee of approximately
$10,000, in addition to the reimbursement of expenses, for these services.

In addition to solicitation of proxies by mail, proxies may be solicited by CWEI’s officers, directors and regular employees,
without additional remuneration, by personal interview, telephone or other means of communication. CWEI may also reimburse
brokerage houses, custodians, nominees and fiduciaries for their reasonable expenses incurred in forwarding proxy solicitation
materials to beneficial owners of CWEI common shares.

Voting by CWEI Directors and Executive Officers

On March 22, 2017, the last practicable date before the date of this proxy statement/prospectus, directors and executive officers
of CWEI and their affiliates owned and were entitled to vote 6,595,569 CWEI common shares, or approximately 37% of the total
voting power of the CWEI common shares outstanding on that date. It is currently expected that CWEI’s directors and executive
officers will vote their CWEI common shares in favor of each of the proposals to be considered at the CWEI special meeting,
although none of them have entered into any agreements obligating them to do so. Clayton W. Williams, Jr. did, however, enter into
an agreement pursuant to which he agreed, among other things, not to exercise or assert any appraisal rights under Section 262 of
the DGCL in connection with the merger. See “The Merger—Share Ownership of Certain Stockholders; Support and Non-Dissent
Agreements—Non-Dissent Agreements” beginning on page 48. In addition, certain of CWEI’s directors, P. Scott Martin, Nathan W.
Walton and Ronald D. Scott, are affiliated with Ares Management, certain entity affiliates of which (the Ares stockholders) are
holders of CWEI common shares and have entered into a support agreement pursuant to

which they agreed, among other things, not to exercise or assert any appraisal rights under Section 262 pf the DGCL in connection
with the merger. The Ares stockholders also have agreed, among other things, during the period from January 13, 2017 to and
including the date of termination of the merger agreement, if any, to vote all of the CWEI common shares and, if applicable, the
CWEI preferred shares, they beneficially own as of the record date of the CWEI special meeting in favor of the merger proposal.

beginning on page 47.

Stockholders Should Not Send Certificates with Their Proxies

CWEI stockholders should not send in any stock certificates with the enclosed proxy. At the time of mailing of this proxy
statement/prospectus, each record holder of CWEI common shares is also separately being sent an election form. The election form
contains instructions for surrendering your CWEI common shares to the exchange agent in exchange for the merger consideration.
For information regarding delivery of your stock certificates, if any, see “The Merger Agreement—Exchange and Payment
Procedures” and “The Merger Agreement—Election Procedures” beginning on pages 57 and 58, respectively.

Attending the CWEI Special Meeting

Subject to space availability, all CWEI stockholders as of the record date, or their duly appointed proxies, may attend the
CWEI special meeting. Since seating is limited, admission to the CWEI special meeting will be on a first-come, first-served basis.
Registration and seating will begin at 9:30 a.m., Central time.

If you hold your CWEI common shares in your name as a stockholder of record and you wish to attend the CWEI special
meeting, please bring your proxy and evidence of your stock ownership, such as your most recent account statement, to the CWEI
special meeting. You should also bring valid picture identification.

If your CWEI common shares are held in “street name” in a stock brokerage account or by a bank or nominee and you wish to
attend the CWEI special meeting, you need to bring a copy of a bank or brokerage statement to the CWEI special meeting reflecting
your stock ownership as of the record date. You should also bring valid picture identification.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CWEI PROPOSALS

Item 1. The Merger Proposal

(Item 1 on Proxy Card)

As discussed throughout this proxy statement/prospectus, CWEI is asking CWEI stockholders to approve the merger proposal.
CWEI stockholders should carefully read this proxy statement/prospectus in its entirety, including the annexes, for more detailed
information concerning the merger agreement and the merger. In particular, CWEI stockholders are directed to the merger
agreement, a copy of which is attached as Annex A to this proxy statement/prospectus.

The CWEI board recommends a vote “FOR” the merger proposal.

Item 2. The Adjournment Proposal

(Item 2 on Proxy Card)

The CWEI special meeting may be adjourned to another time or place, if necessary to solicit additional proxies if there are
insufficient votes at the time of the CWEI special meeting to approve the merger proposal.

If, at the CWEI special meeting, the number of CWEI common shares present or represented by proxy and voting in favor of
the merger is insufficient to approve the merger proposal, CWEI intends to move to adjourn the CWEI special meeting in order to
enable the CWEI board to solicit additional proxies for approval of the merger proposal. In that event, CWEI will ask its
stockholders to vote only upon the adjournment proposal, and not upon any other proposal.

In this proposal, CWEI is asking CWEI stockholders to authorize the proxy holders, and each of them individually, to adjourn
the CWEI special meeting to another time and place for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies. If the CWEI stockholders
approve the adjournment proposal, CWEI could adjourn the CWEI special meeting and use the additional time to solicit additional
proxies, including the solicitation of proxies from CWEI stockholders who have previously voted.

The CWEI board recommends a vote “FOR” the adjournment proposal, if necessary.

Item 3. The Advisory Compensation Proposal

(Item 3 on Proxy Card)

In this proposal, CWEI is asking its stockholders to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, specified compensation that
may be payable to CWEI’s named executive officers in connection with the merger and therefore is asking stockholders to adopt the
following resolution:

“RESOLVED, that the compensation that may be paid or become payable to CWEI’s named executive officers in connection
with the merger, as disclosed in the table in the section of the proxy statement/prospectus entitled “Interests of CWEI Directors and
Executive Officers in the Merger—Quantification of Payments and Benefits to CWEI’s Named Executive Officers,” including the
preceding narrative discussion, and the agreements pursuant to which such compensation may be paid or become payable, are
hereby APPROVED.”

The advisory vote on executive compensation payable in connection with the merger is a vote separate and apart from
the vote to adopt the merger agreement, and approval of such executive compensation is not a condition to completion of the
merger. Accordingly, you may vote to approve the merger proposal and vote not to approve the advisory executive
compensation and vice versa. Because the vote is advisory in nature only, it will not be binding on either CWEI or Noble.
Accordingly, to the extent CWEI or Noble is contractually obligated to pay the compensation, the compensation will be
payable to the named executive officers, subject only to the conditions applicable thereto, if the merger proposal is approved
and the merger completed, regardless of the outcome of the advisory vote.

UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL INFORMATION

The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information is derived from the historical consolidated
financial statements of Noble and CWEI, and has been adjusted to reflect the proposed merger of Noble and CWEI. Certain of
CWEI’s historical amounts have been reclassified to conform to Noble’s financial statement presentation. The unaudited pro forma
combined balance sheet as of December 31, 2016 gives effect to the merger as if the merger had been completed on December 31,
2016. The unaudited pro forma combined statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2016 gives effect to the merger
as if the merger had been completed on January 1, 2016.

The unaudited pro forma combined financial statements reflect the following merger-related pro forma adjustments, based on
available information and certain assumptions that Noble believes are reasonable:

• Noble’s merger with CWEI, which will be accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting;

• the exchange of CWEI’s outstanding equity awards, including warrants and stock options for Noble common stock, and
restricted stock awards for similar Noble awards;

• the assumption of liabilities for transaction-related expenses;

• the recognition of estimated tax impacts of the pro forma adjustments; and

• the repayment of CWEI’s term loan with Ares Management at or prior to closing.

Assumptions and estimates underlying the pro forma adjustments are described in the accompanying notes, which should be read in
conjunction with the unaudited pro forma combined financial statements. In Noble’s opinion, all adjustments that are necessary to
present fairly the pro forma information have been made.

The unaudited pro forma combined financial information does not purport to represent what Noble’s financial position or
results of operations would have been had the merger actually been consummated on the assumed dates nor is it indicative of
Noble’s future financial position or results of operations. The unaudited pro forma combined financial information does not reflect
future events that may occur after the merger, including, but not limited to, the anticipated realization of ongoing savings from
operating efficiencies. These unaudited pro forma combined financial statements should be read in conjunction with the historical
consolidated financial statements and related notes of Noble and CWEI for the periods presented.

Noble Energy, Inc.
Notes to Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Financial Statements

Note 1. Basis of Presentation

The unaudited pro forma combined financial information has been derived from the historical consolidated financial statements
of Noble and CWEI. Certain of CWEI’s historical amounts have been reclassified to conform to Noble’s financial statement
presentation. The unaudited pro forma combined balance sheet as of December 31, 2016 gives effect to the merger as if the merger
had been completed on December 31, 2016. The unaudited pro forma combined statement of operations for the year ended
December 31, 2016 gives effect to the merger as if the merger had been completed on January 1, 2016.

The unaudited pro forma combined financial statements reflect pro forma adjustments that are described in the accompanying
notes and are based on available information and certain assumptions that Noble believes are reasonable, however, actual results
may differ from those reflected in these statements. In Noble’s opinion, all adjustments that are necessary to present fairly the pro
forma information have been made. The following unaudited pro forma combined statements do not purport to represent what the
combined company’s financial position or results of operations would have been if the transaction had actually occurred on the dates
indicated above, nor are they indicative of Noble’s future financial position or results of operations. These unaudited pro forma
combined financial statements should be read in conjunction with the historical consolidated financial statements and related notes
of Noble and CWEI for the periods presented.

Note 2. Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Balance Sheet

The merger will be accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. The allocation of the
preliminary estimated purchase price is based upon management’s estimates of and assumptions related to the fair value of assets to
be acquired and liabilities to be assumed as of December 31, 2016 using currently available information. Due to the fact that the
unaudited pro forma combined financial information has been prepared based on these preliminary estimates, the final purchase
price allocation and the resulting effect on financial position and results of operations may differ significantly from the pro forma
amounts included herein. Noble expects to finalize its allocation of the purchase consideration as soon as practicable after
completion of the proposed transaction.

The preliminary purchase price allocation is subject to change due to several factors, including but not limited to:

• changes in the estimated fair value of the Noble common stock consideration transferred to CWEI stockholders, based on
Noble’s share price at the date of closing;

• changes in the estimated fair value of CWEI’s assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of the transaction,
which could result from changes in future oil and gas commodity prices, reserve estimates, interest rates, and other factors;
and

• the tax bases of CWEI’s assets and liabilities as of the closing date of the transaction.

The preliminary consideration to be transferred, fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and resulting goodwill
expected to be recorded is as follows:

(1) Based on 48,070,486 Noble common shares at $33.91 per share (closing price as of March 16, 2017).

(2) Based on 1,428,216 Noble common shares at $33.91 per share (closing price as of March 16, 2017).

(3) Based on 441,268 Noble common shares computed using a 10-day average closing price of Noble common shares at March 16, 2017.

(4) Based on 5,223,751 Noble common shares computed using a 10-day volume-weighted average price of CWEI common shares at March 16, 2017.

Noble has agreed to acquire CWEI for cash consideration of approximately $665 million and per-share consideration
consisting of 2.7874 Noble common shares for each outstanding CWEI common share, including CWEI’s outstanding equity
awards which will result in Noble issuing approximately $1.9 billion of common shares. Based on the closing price of Noble
common shares of $33.91 on March 16, 2017, the proposed transaction has a preliminary value of approximately $4.0 billion,
including the fair value of CWEI’s long-term debt assumed of $500 million.

Goodwill recognized is primarily attributable to the excess of the consideration transferred over the acquisition-date
identifiable assets acquired net of liabilities assumed, measured in accordance with GAAP. Because the merger will be non-taxable,
CWEI’s tax basis in the assets and liabilities will carry over to Noble.

From the date prior to the transaction’s initial public announcement to March 16, 2017, the preliminary value of Noble’s
purchase consideration to be transferred had decreased approximately $192 million, as a result of the decrease in Noble’s share price
from $37.39 to $33.91. The final value of Noble consideration will be determined based on the actual number of Noble common
shares issued and the market price of Noble common shares on the closing date of the merger. A ten percent increase or decrease in
the closing price of Noble common shares, as compared to the March 16, 2017 closing price of $33.91, would increase or decrease
the purchase price by approximately $187 million, assuming all other factors are held constant.

The following adjustments have been made to the accompanying unaudited pro forma combined balance sheet as of December
31, 2016:

(a) Reflects various adjustments made to reflect the following items:

• a $526 million decrease to cash to reflect the repayment of CWEI’s term loan with Ares Management of $377
million, accrued interest of approximately $12 million and the make whole payment of approximately $137 million at
or prior to closing, using cash on hand;

TABLE OF CONTENTS

• a net increase of $318 million to long term debt reflects the draw on Noble’s credit facility of $665 million incurred
to finance the cash portion of the merger consideration less the effects of extinguishing CWEI’s outstanding debt of
$377 million related to the Ares Management notes upon consummation of the merger and elimination of
approximately $30 million of debt issuance costs.

• a $247 million decrease to other non-current liabilities to reflect the Ares Management warrants conversion into
Noble common shares to effect the transaction.

(b) The allocation of the estimated fair value of consideration transferred (based on the closing price of Noble common shares
as of March 16, 2017) to the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed resulted in the following
purchase price allocation adjustments:

• a $22 million decrease in inventory to reflect estimated fair value associated with the transaction;

• an $836 million increase in CWEI’s gross book basis of oil and gas properties and a $202 million decrease in CWEI’s
gross book basis of other property, plant and equipment to reflect them at fair value;

• $1.31 billion in goodwill associated with the transaction; and

• a net $688 million increase in deferred tax liabilities associated with the transaction.

(c) Reflects the elimination of CWEI’s historical accumulated depreciation, depletion and amortization (“DD&A”) balances.

(d) Reflects the netting of CWEI’s $7 million federal current deferred tax asset against $772 million of non-current deferred
tax liability resulting from the step-up in book basis of oil and gas properties.

(e) Reflects the impact of estimated transaction costs of $35 million expected to be incurred by Noble and CWEI in
connection with the merger, including estimated underwriting, banking, legal and accounting fees that are not capitalizable
as part of the transaction as well as severance costs resulting from double trigger arrangements following the merger.
These costs are not reflected in the historical December 31, 2016 balance sheets of Noble and CWEI, but are reflected in
the unaudited pro forma balance sheet as an increase to liabilities and a reduction of equity as they will be expensed by
Noble and CWEI as incurred. These amounts and their corresponding tax effect have not been reflected in the pro forma
statements of operations due to their nonrecurring nature.

(f) Reflects the estimated increase in Noble’s common stock and additional paid-in capital resulting from the issuance of
Noble common shares to CWEI stockholders to effect the transaction as follows (in millions, except share and per share
amounts):

Noble common shares to be issued  48,070,486 
Noble common shares to be issued subject to CWEI equity awards and warrants  7,093,234 
Total shares to be issued  55,163,720

Fair value of common stock and equity based awards to be issued $ 1,678 
Fair value of CWEI options to be converted to Noble common shares $ 15 
Fair value of CWEI warrants to be converted to Noble common shares $ 177

Increase in Noble’s common stock ($0.01 par value per share) as of December 31,

of funds legally available for their payment (subject to the rights of holders of the preferred stock, if any).

Voting Rights

Each holder of Noble common shares is entitled to one vote per share. Subject to the rights, if any, of the holder of any series of
preferred stock pursuant to applicable law or the provisions of the certificate of designations creating that series, all voting rights are
vested in the holders of shares Noble common shares. The holders of Noble’s common shares are not entitled to cumulate their votes
for the election of directors. The Noble board of directors is not classified.

Generally, the vote of the holders of a majority of the total number of votes of Noble capital stock represented at a meeting and
entitled to vote on a matter is required in order to approve such matter. Certain extraordinary transactions and other actions require
supermajority votes, including but not limited to the supermajority voting provisions described in “—Delaware Anti-takeover Law”
beginning on page 101.

Rights Upon Liquidation

In the event of Noble’s voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up, the holders of Noble common shares
will be entitled to share equally in any of Noble’s assets available for distribution after the payment in full of all debts and
distributions and after the holders of all series of outstanding preferred stock, if any, have received their liquidation preferences in
full.

Miscellaneous

Holders of Noble common shares are not entitled to preemptive rights. Noble common shares are not convertible into shares of
any other class of capital stock. There are no redemption, purchase, retirement or sinking fund provisions applicable to the Noble

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Delaware Anti-takeover Law

Noble is subject to Section 203 of the DGCL. Section 203 provides that, subject to certain exceptions specified in the law, a
Delaware corporation shall not engage in certain “business combinations” with any “interested stockholder” for a three-year period
following the time that the stockholder became an interested stockholder unless:

• prior to such time, the Noble board of directors approved either the business combination or the transaction that resulted in
the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder;

• upon consummation of the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder, the interested
stockholder owned at least 85% of the voting stock outstanding at the time the transaction commenced, excluding certain
shares; or

• at or subsequent to that time, the business combination is approved by the Noble board of directors and by the affirmative
vote of holders of at least 66 2/3% of the outstanding voting stock that is not owned by the interested stockholder.

Generally, a “business combination” includes a merger, asset or stock sale or other transaction resulting in a financial benefit to
the interested stockholder. Subject to certain exceptions, an “interested stockholder” is a person who, together with that person’s
affiliates and associates, beneficially owns, or within the previous three years did own, 15% or more of Noble’s voting stock.

Under certain circumstances, Section 203 makes it more difficult for a person who would be an “interested stockholder” to
effect various business combinations with a corporation for a three-year period. The provisions of Section 203 may encourage
companies interested in acquiring Noble to negotiate in advance with the Noble board of directors because the stockholder approval
requirement would be avoided if the Noble board of directors approves either the business combination or the transaction that
results in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder. These provisions also may make it more difficult to accomplish
transactions that stockholders may otherwise deem to be in their best interests.

Description of Noble Preferred Stock

Noble’s certificate of incorporation authorizes the Noble board of directors to cause preferred stock to be issued in one or more
series, without stockholder action.

Noble’s board of directors is authorized to determine the number of shares of each series, and the rights, preference and
limitations of each series. Noble may amend its certificate of incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of preferred
stock in a manner permitted by the certificate of incorporation and the DGCL.

The particular terms of any series of preferred stock will be set by Noble’s board of directors for that series of preferred stock.
Those terms may include:

(1) The number of shares of the series of preferred stock being offered;

(2) Voting rights, if any, of the series of preferred stock;

(3) The title and liquidation preference per share of that series of the preferred stock;

(4) The purchase price of the preferred stock;

(5) The dividend rate (or method for determining dividend rates);

(6) The dates on which dividends will be paid;

(7) Whether dividends on that series of preferred stock will be cumulative or noncumulative and, if cumulative, the dates from
which dividends will begin to accumulate;

(8) Any redemption or sinking fund provisions applicable to that series of preferred stock;

(9) Any conversion provisions applicable to that series of preferred stock; and

(10) Any additional dividend, liquidation, redemption, sinking fund and other rights and restrictions applicable to that series of
preferred stock.

The following summary is not complete. You should refer to the certificate of designations relating to the series of the preferred
stock for the complete terms of that preferred stock.

101



9/1/2019 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/880115/000156761917000509/s001558x6_defm14a.htm

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/880115/000156761917000509/s001558x6_defm14a.htm 124/224

TABLE OF CONTENTS

The preferred stock will, when issued, be fully paid and nonassessable. Unless otherwise specified in the terms of the preferred
stock series, if Noble liquidates, dissolves or winds-up its business, each series of preferred stock will have the same rank as to
dividends and distributions as each other series of the preferred stock Noble may issue in the future. The preferred stock will have
no preemptive rights.

Dividend Rights

Holders of preferred stock of each series will be entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the Noble board of directors,
cash dividends at the rates and on the dates set forth by the board of directors. Dividend rates may be fixed or variable or both.
Different series of preferred stock may be entitled to dividends at different dividend rates or based upon different methods of
determination. Each dividend will be payable to the holders of record as they appear on Noble’s stock books on record dates
determined by Noble’s board of directors.

Dividends on any series of the preferred stock may be cumulative or noncumulative, as specified in the terms of the preferred
stock. If the Noble board of directors fails to declare a dividend on any series of preferred stock for which dividends are
noncumulative, then the right to receive that dividend will be lost, and Noble will have no obligation to pay the dividend for that
dividend period, whether or not dividends are declared for any future dividend period.

Noble may not declare or pay any full dividends on any series of preferred stock, unless Noble has declared and paid, or
contemporaneously declares and pays, full dividends for the dividend period commencing after the immediately preceding dividend
payment date (and cumulative dividends still owing, if any) on all other series of preferred stock that have the same rank as, or rank
senior to, that preferred stock. When Noble does not pay those dividends in full, Noble will declare dividends pro rata, so that the
amount of dividends declared per share on that series of preferred stock and on each other series of preferred stock having the same
rank as, or ranking senior to, that series of preferred stock will in all cases bear to each other the same ratio that accrued dividends
per share on that series of preferred stock and the other preferred stock bear to each other. In addition, Noble generally may not
declare or pay any dividends on Noble common shares or redeem or purchase any Noble common shares, unless it has paid full
dividends, including cumulative dividends still owing, if any, on all outstanding shares of any series of preferred stock. Noble will
not pay any interest, or sum of money in lieu of interest, in connection with any dividend payment or payments that may be in
arrears.

Unless otherwise described in the terms of the preferred stock, Noble will compute the amount of dividends payable for each
dividend period by annualizing the applicable dividend rate and dividing by the number of dividend periods in a year, except that
Noble will compute the amount of dividends payable for the initial dividend period or any period shorter than a full dividend period
on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months and, for any period less than a full month, the actual number of
days elapsed in the period.

Rights Upon Liquidation

If Noble liquidates, dissolves or winds-up its affairs, either voluntarily or involuntarily, the holders of each series of preferred
stock will be entitled to receive liquidating distributions in the amount set forth in the terms relating to that series of preferred stock,
plus an amount equal to accrued and unpaid dividends, if any, before any distribution of assets is made to the holders of Noble
common shares. If the amounts payable with respect to preferred stock of any series and any stock having the same rank as that
series of preferred stock are not paid in full, the holders of preferred stock and of the other stock will share ratably in any
distribution of assets in proportion to the full respective preferential amounts to which they are entitled. After the holders of each
series of preferred stock and any stock having the same rank as the preferred stock are paid in full, they will have no right or claim
to any of Noble’s remaining assets. Neither the sale of all or substantially all our property or business nor a merger or consolidation
by Noble with any other corporation will be considered a dissolution, liquidation or winding up of Noble’s business or affairs.

Redemption

A series of preferred stock may be redeemable, in whole or in part, at Noble’s option. In addition, any series of preferred stock
may be subject to mandatory redemption pursuant to a sinking fund. Any redemption provisions that apply to a series of preferred
stock, including the redemption dates and the redemption prices for that series, will be set forth in the terms relating to that series.

102



9/1/2019 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/880115/000156761917000509/s001558x6_defm14a.htm

TABLE OF CONTENTS

If a series of preferred stock is subject to mandatory redemption, the terms relating to the series will specify the year Noble can
begin to redeem shares of the preferred stock, the number of shares of the preferred stock Noble can redeem each year, and the
redemption price per share. Noble may pay the redemption price in cash, stock or in cash that it has received specifically from the
sale of its capital stock, as specified in the terms of the preferred stock. If the redemption price is to be paid only from the proceeds
of the sale of Noble’s capital stock, the terms of the series of preferred stock may also provide that, if no capital stock is sold or if
the amount of cash received is insufficient to pay in full the redemption price then due, the series of preferred stock will
automatically be converted into shares of the applicable capital stock pursuant to conversion provisions specified in the terms of the
preferred stock.

If fewer than all the outstanding shares of any series of preferred stock are to be redeemed, whether by mandatory or optional
redemption, Noble’s board of directors will determine the method for selecting the shares to be redeemed, which may be by lot or
pro rata or by any other method determined to be equitable. From and after the redemption date, dividends will cease to accrue on
the shares of preferred stock called for redemption and all rights of the holders of those shares (except the right to receive the
redemption price) will cease.

If Noble has not paid full dividends, including accrued but unpaid dividends, if any, on any series of preferred stock, Noble
may not redeem that series in part and Noble may not purchase or acquire any shares of that series of preferred stock, except by any
offer made on the same terms to all holders of that series of preferred stock.

Voting Rights

Except as indicated in the terms of the preferred stock, or except as expressly required by applicable law, the holders of
preferred stock will not be entitled to vote.

but is not a complete statement of all those differences, or a complete description of the specific provisions referred to in this
summary. Stockholders should read carefully the relevant provisions of the DGCL and the respective certificates of incorporation
and bylaws of Noble and CWEI. For more information on how to obtain the documents that are not attached to this proxy
statement/prospectus, see “Where You Can Find More Information” beginning on page 112.

In order for stockholder proposals submitted under Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act to be presented at Noble’s 2018 annual

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CWEI

CWEI held its 2016 annual meeting of stockholders on June 7, 2016. If the merger is completed, CWEI does not expect to hold
an annual meeting of stockholders in 2017. In that case, stockholder proposals for Noble’s 2018 annual meeting of stockholders
must be submitted to Noble’s secretary in accordance with the procedures described above. If the merger is not completed, CWEI
will hold a 2017 annual meeting of stockholders.

The deadline for stockholder proposals submitted under Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act to be presented at CWEI’s 2017
annual meeting of stockholders, if held, and included in its proxy statement and form of proxy relating to the 2017 meeting, if held,
was December 29, 2016. As of the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, CWEI had not received notice of any stockholder
proposals for its 2017 annual meeting. However, if the date of CWEI’s 2017 annual meeting of stockholders, if held, is changed by
more than 30 days from June 7, 2017, then the deadline for submission will be a reasonable time before CWEI begins to print and
mail its proxy materials for the 2017 annual meeting, if held. Stockholder proposals must be received by CWEI’s secretary at
Clayton Williams Energy, Inc., 6 Desta Drive, Suite 6500, Midland, Texas 79705, Attention: Secretary, no later than the applicable
deadline, to be eligible for inclusion in CWEI’s proxy materials.

In accordance with CWEI’s bylaws, a stockholder may nominate one or more persons for election as director at a meeting or
propose business to be brought before a meeting, or both, only if such stockholder has given timely notice to CWEI’s secretary at
Clayton Williams Energy, Inc., 6 Desta Drive, Suite 6500, Midland, Texas 79705, Attention: Secretary, in proper written form of his
or her intent to make such nomination or nominations or to propose such business. To be timely, such stockholder’s notice must be
delivered to or mailed and received at the principal executive offices of CWEI not less than 120 calendar days in advance of the date
of CWEI’s proxy statement released to stockholders in connection with the previous year’s annual meeting of stockholders, except
that if no annual meeting was held in the previous year or the date of the annual meeting has been changed by more than 30 days
from the date contemplated at the time of the previous year’s proxy statement, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be
received a reasonable time before the solicitation is made. As a result, for a stockholder nomination for election to the CWEI board
or a proposal of business to be considered at the 2017 annual meeting of stockholders, if held, it must have been properly submitted
to CWEI’s secretary no later than December 29, 2016. As of the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, CWEI had not
received notice of any stockholder nominations or proposals for its 2017 annual meeting. However, if the date of CWEI’s 2017
annual meeting of stockholders, if held, is changed by more than 30 days from June 7, 2017, then the deadline for submission will
be a reasonable time before the solicitation is made. To be in proper form, a stockholder’s notice must contain the information and
comply with the other requirements set forth in CWEI’s bylaws.

In addition, pursuant to Rule 14a-4(c) of the Exchange Act, the CWEI board may exercise discretionary voting authority under
proxies solicited by it with respect to any matter properly presented by a stockholder at the 2017 annual meeting, if held, that the
stockholder does not seek to have included in CWEI’s proxy statement if (except as described in the following sentence) the proxy
statement discloses the nature of the matter and how the CWEI board intends to exercise its discretion to vote on such matter unless
CWEI was notified of the proposal on or before December 29, 2016 and the stockholder satisfies the other requirements of Rule
14a-4(c)(2). As of the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, CWEI had not received notice of any stockholder proposals for
its 2017 annual meeting. If CWEI first received or receives notice of such matter after December 29, 2016 (or, alternatively, if the
date of CWEI’s 2017 annual meeting of stockholders, if held, is changed by more than 30 days from June 7, 2017, CWEI first
receives notice of such matter after a reasonable time before the solicitation is made), and the matter nonetheless is permitted to be
presented at the 2017 annual meeting of stockholders, if held, the CWEI board may exercise discretionary voting authority with
respect to any such matter without including any discussion of the matter in the proxy statement for the 2017 annual meeting of
stockholders, if held.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

(e) Company Preferred Shares will be treated in accordance with Section 3.7. Company Options and Company Restricted
Shares will be treated in accordance with Section 3.8.

3.2   Rights As Stockholders or Warrant Holders; Share and Warrant Transfers.   All Company Common Shares and all
Company Warrants converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 3.1(b) will cease to be
outstanding and will automatically be canceled and will cease to exist when converted as a result of and pursuant to the Merger. At
the Effective Time, each holder of a certificate representing Company Common Shares (a “Certificate”), each holder of non-
certificated Company Common Shares represented by book-entry (“Book-Entry Shares”), and each holder of a Company Warrant
will cease to have any rights with respect thereto or thereunder, except the right to receive (a) the Merger Consideration, (b) any
cash to be paid in lieu of any fractional New Common Share in accordance with Section 3.3(d), and (c) any distributions in
accordance with Section 3.3(c), in each case to be issued or paid, without interest, in consideration therefor in accordance with
Section 3.3; provided, however, that the rights of (i) any holder of Company Preferred Shares, or Company Options or Company
Restricted Shares will be as set forth in Section 3.7 and Section 3.8, respectively, (ii) any holder of Treasury Shares will be as set
forth in Section 3.1(d) and (iii) any holder of Dissenting Shares will be as set forth in Section 3.9. At the Effective Time, the transfer
books of the Company will be closed immediately and there will be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of
the Company with respect to Company Common Shares, Company Warrants or Company Preferred Shares.

3.3   Exchange of Certificates.

(a) Exchange Agent. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent will appoint a commercial bank or trust company reasonably
acceptable to the Company to act as exchange and payment agent hereunder for the purpose of receiving elections and exchanging
Company Common Shares and Company Warrants for the Merger Consideration as required by this Article III (the “Exchange
Agent”). Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent will deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent for the benefit of
the holders of the applicable Company Common Shares, Company Preferred Shares and Company Warrants, for exchange in
accordance with this Article III, through the Exchange Agent, New Common Shares and cash as required by this Article III. Parent
agrees to make available to the Exchange Agent, from time to time as needed, cash sufficient to pay the cash portion of the Mixed
Consideration, the Cash Consideration, the Preferred Share Consideration, and any distributions pursuant to Section 3.3(c) and to
make payments in lieu of any fractional New Common Shares pursuant to Section 3.3(d), in each case without interest. Any cash as
payment for any fractional New Common Shares in accordance with Section 3.3(d), any distributions with respect to New Common
Shares in accordance with Section 3.3(c), and New Common Shares and cash for payment of the Merger Consideration deposited
with the Exchange Agent are hereinafter referred to as the “Exchange Fund.” The Exchange Agent will, pursuant to irrevocable
instructions from Parent and the Company, deliver the Merger Consideration, and the Preferred Share Consideration contemplated
to be paid for Company Common Shares, Company Warrants and Company Preferred Shares, as applicable, pursuant to this
Agreement out of the Exchange Fund. Except as contemplated by Sections 3.3(c) and 3.3(d), the Exchange Fund will not be used
for any other purpose.

(b) Exchange Procedures. Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent will instruct the Exchange Agent to mail to each record
holder of Company Common Shares as of the Effective Time (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries and Parent and its
Subsidiaries) (i) a letter of transmittal (specifying that in respect of certificated Company Common Shares, delivery will be effected,
and risk of loss and title to the Certificates will pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent, and which
will be in customary form and agreed to by Parent and the Company prior to the Effective Time) and (ii) instructions (in customary
form and agreed to by Parent and the Company prior to the Effective Time) for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration payable in respect of Company Common Shares represented by such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable. Promptly after the Effective Time, upon surrender of Certificates, if any, for
cancellation to the Exchange Agent together with such letters of transmittal, properly completed and duly executed, and such other
documents (including in respect of Book-Entry Shares) as may be reasonably required pursuant to such instructions, each holder
who held Company Common Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries and
Parent and its Subsidiaries) will be entitled to receive upon surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares therefor (x) New
Common Shares representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of New Common Shares that such holder has the right to receive
pursuant to this Article III (after taking into account all Company Common Shares then held by such holder) and/or (y) a check in
an amount equal to the aggregate amount of cash that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to this Article III,

including (A) cash in an amount (subject to any applicable withholding Tax) equal to the product of (x) the number of Company
Common Shares represented by such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares in the name of such
holder multiplied by (y) the Cash Consideration or the cash portion of the Mixed Consideration, if and as applicable, (B) cash
payable in lieu of any fractional New Common Shares pursuant to Section 3.3(d) and (C) distributions pursuant to Section 3.3(c).
No interest will be paid or accrued on any Merger Consideration, Preferred Share Consideration, any cash payment in lieu of
fractional New Common Shares, or any Parent distributions payable pursuant to Section 3.3(c). In the event of a transfer of
ownership of Company Common Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, the Merger Consideration
payable in respect of such Company Common Shares may be paid to a transferee, if the Certificate representing such Company
Common Shares or evidence of ownership of the Book-Entry Shares is presented to the Exchange Agent, and in the case of both
certificated and book-entry Company Common Shares, accompanied by all documents reasonably required to evidence and effect
such transfer and the Person requesting such exchange will pay to the Exchange Agent in advance any transfer or other Taxes
required by reason of the delivery of the Merger Consideration in any name other than that of the record holder of such Company
Common Shares, or will establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Taxes have been paid or are not payable.
Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent will instruct the Exchange Agent to follow similar procedures with respect to the
surrender of certificates representing Company Preferred Shares in exchange for the Preferred Share Consideration payable in
respect thereof and Company Warrants in exchange for the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof. Until all such required
documentation has been delivered and Certificates, if any, Company Warrants or certificates representing Company Preferred
Shares, as applicable, have been surrendered as contemplated by this Section 3.3, each Certificate or Book-Entry Share, Company
Warrant or certificate representing a Company Preferred Share, as applicable, will be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration, or Preferred Share Consideration payable in respect of such Company
Common Shares, Company Warrants or Company Preferred Shares, as applicable, upon such delivery and surrender, and any cash
or distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Sections 3.3(c) and 3.3(d).

(c) Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Company Common Shares. No distributions declared or made with respect to
Parent Common Shares with a record date after the Effective Time will be paid to the holder of any Company Common Shares or
Company Warrants with respect to New Common Shares that such holder would be entitled to receive in accordance herewith and
no cash payment in lieu of fractional New Common Shares will be paid to any such holder until such holder has delivered the
required documentation and surrendered any Certificates, Book-Entry Shares or Company Warrants as contemplated by this Section
3.3. Subject to applicable Law, following compliance with the requirements of Section 3.3(b), there will be paid to such holder of
New Common Shares issuable in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) promptly after the time of such compliance, the amount of
any cash payable in lieu of fractional New Common Shares to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 3.3(d) (which shall
be paid by the Exchange Agent as provided therein) and the amount of distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
theretofore paid with respect to New Common Shares and payable with respect to such New Common Shares, and (ii) promptly
after such compliance, or, if later, at the appropriate payment date, the amount of distributions with a record date after the Effective
Time but prior to such delivery and surrender and a payment date subsequent to such compliance payable with respect to such New
Common Shares (which shall be paid by Parent).

(d) Fractional New Common Shares. No certificates or scrip for New Common Shares representing fractional New Common
Shares or book entry credit of the same will be issued upon the surrender of Company Common Shares or Company Warrants
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time in accordance with Section 3.3(b), and such fractional interests will not entitle
the owner thereof to vote or to have any rights as a holder of any New Common Shares. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, each holder of Company Common Shares or Company Warrants converted in the Merger who would otherwise have
been entitled to receive a fraction of a New Common Share (after taking into account all Company Common Shares and Company
Warrants exchanged by such holder) will receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest rounded up to the nearest whole cent) in an
amount equal to the product of (i) the Average Closing Price as of the Closing Date and (ii) the fraction of a New Common Share
that such holder would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to this Article III. As promptly as practicable after the
determination of the amount of cash, if any, to be paid to holders of fractional interests, Parent will cause the Exchange Agent to
forward payments to such holders of fractional interests subject to and in accordance with the terms hereof.

(e) No Further Rights in Company Common Shares or Company Warrants. The Merger Consideration issued upon conversion
of a Company Common Share or Company Warrant in accordance with the terms hereof (including

TABLE OF CONTENTS

any cash paid pursuant to Section 3.3(d)) will be deemed to have been issued and/or paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining
to such Company Common Share or Company Warrant. From and after the Effective Time, each Company Warrant shall no longer
be exercisable by the former holder thereof, but shall only entitle such holder to the payment of the Merger Consideration in respect
of such Company Warrant.

(f) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of Company
Common Shares, Company Preferred Shares or Company Warrants after 180 days following the Effective Time will be delivered to
Parent upon demand by Parent and, from and after such delivery, any former holders of Company Common Shares, Company
Preferred Shares or Company Warrants who have not theretofore complied with this Article III will thereafter look only to Parent
for the Merger Consideration or other consideration as applicable, payable in respect of such Company Common Shares, Company
Preferred Shares or Company Warrants, any cash in lieu of fractional New Common Shares to which they are entitled pursuant to
Section 3.3(d), or any distributions with respect to New Common Shares to which they are entitled pursuant to Section 3.3(c), in
each case, without any interest thereon. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of Company Common Shares, Company
Preferred Shares or Company Warrants immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become the
property of any Governmental Authority will, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Parent. Without
limitation of the foregoing, after 180 days following the Effective Time, any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of Company
Common Shares, Company Preferred Shares or Company Warrants will become the property of Parent, subject to the legitimate
claims of any Person previously entitled thereto hereunder or under abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, none of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, the Exchange
Agent, or any other Person shall be liable to any former holder of Company Common Shares, Company Preferred Shares or
Company Warrants for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or similar
Law.

(g) Lost Certificates. If any Certificate or Company Warrant is lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that
fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of
an indemnity agreement or a bond, in a customary amount, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect
to such Certificate or Company Warrant, the Exchange Agent will pay in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate and
affidavit the Merger Consideration payable in respect of Company Common Shares represented by such Certificate or Warrant
Notational Common Shares represented by such Company Warrant, as applicable, and any amounts to which the holders thereof are
entitled pursuant to Sections 3.3(c) and 3.3(d).

(h) Withholding. The Company, Parent, Merger Sub, Marshall Texas and the Exchange Agent are entitled to deduct and
withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any Person such amounts or securities as the
Company, Parent, Merger Sub, Marshall Texas or the Exchange Agent reasonably deems to be required to deduct and withhold
under the Code or any provision of state, local, or foreign Tax Law, with respect to the making of such payment or issuance. To the
extent that amounts or securities are so deducted and withheld, such amounts will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid or issued to the Person in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made.

(i) Book Entry Shares. All New Common Shares to be issued in the Merger will be issued in book-entry form, without physical
certificates.

(j) Investment of the Exchange Fund. Parent will cause the Exchange Agent to invest the cash in the Exchange Fund as directed
by Parent on a daily basis, in Parent’s sole discretion; provided, however, that no such investment or loss thereon affects the
amounts payable or the timing of the amounts payable to the holders of Company Common Shares, Company Preferred Shares,
Company Options, Company Restricted Shares and Company Warrants, as applicable, pursuant to the other provisions of this
Section 3.3 and Section 3.7, Section 3.8 and Section 3.9. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments will be paid
promptly to Parent.

(k) Tax Characterization of Merger. The Company and Parent each acknowledges and agrees that for U.S. federal income Tax
purposes the Integrated Mergers are intended to qualify as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.
Each of the Company and Parent agrees to prepare and file all U.S. federal income Tax Returns in accordance with the foregoing
and shall not take any position inconsistent therewith on any such Tax

required by applicable Laws following a final determination by a court of competent jurisdiction or other final administrative
decision by an applicable Taxing Authority.

3.4   Election Procedures.   Each holder of record of a Company Common Share or Company Warrant issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Election Deadline (a “Company Holder”) shall have the right, subject to the limitations set forth in this
Article III, to submit an election on or prior to the Election Deadline in accordance with the following procedures:

(a) Parent shall prepare a form reasonably acceptable to the Company (the “Form of Election”), which shall be mailed by
Parent to record holders of Company Common Shares and Company Warrants so as to permit the Company Holders to exercise
their right to make an Election prior to the Election Deadline. For the avoidance of doubt, a holder of a Company Warrant may only
make one type of Election (i.e., a Share Election, Mixed Election or Cash Election) with respect to such Company Warrant.

(b) Each Company Holder may specify on the Form of Election in accordance with the provisions of this Section 3.4 and the
instructions on such form (an “Election”), (i) the number of Company Common Shares with respect to which such Company Holder
desires to make a Share Election, (ii) the number of Company Common Shares with respect to which such Company Holder desires
to make a Mixed Election, (iii) the number of Company Common Shares with respect to which such Company Holder desires to
make a Cash Election and (iv) with respect to each Company Warrant held by such Company Holder, whether such Company
Holder desires to make a Share Election, a Mixed Election or a Cash Election with respect to such Company Warrant. Any holder of
Company Common Shares who makes an Election shall be required to waive all appraisal rights in connection with the Company
Common Shares subject to such Election.

(c) Parent shall mail or cause to be mailed or delivered, as applicable, the Form of Election to the holders of the Company
Warrants and to record holders of Company Common Shares as of the record date for the Company Meeting not less than 20
Business Days prior to the anticipated Election Deadline. Parent shall make available one or more Forms of Election as may
reasonably be requested from time to time by all persons who become holders of record of Company Common Shares or Company
Warrants during the period following the record date for the Company Meeting and prior to the Election Deadline, and the Company
shall provide to the Exchange Agent all information reasonably necessary for the Exchange Agent to perform as specified herein.

(d) Any Election shall have been made properly only if the Exchange Agent shall have received, prior to the Election Deadline,
a Form of Election properly completed and signed and accompanied by Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the Certificates),
if any, for the Company Common Shares to which such Form of Election relates, or the Company Warrants to which such Form of
Election relates, as the case may be, duly endorsed in blank or otherwise in form acceptable for transfer on the books of the
Company or by an appropriate customary guarantee of delivery of such Certificates or Company Warrants, as applicable, as set forth
in such Form of Election, from a firm that is an eligible guarantor institution (as defined in Rule 17Ad-15 under the Exchange Act);
provided that such Certificates or Company Warrants, as applicable, are in fact delivered to the Exchange Agent by the time
required in such guarantee of delivery, and, in the case of Company Common Shares in book-entry form, any additional documents
specified in the procedures set forth in the Form of Election. Failure to deliver Company Common Shares or Company Warrants, as
applicable, covered by such a guarantee of delivery within the time set forth on such guarantee shall be deemed to invalidate any
otherwise properly made Election, unless otherwise determined by Parent, in its sole and absolute discretion. As used herein, unless
otherwise jointly agreed in advance by the Company and Parent, “Election Deadline” means 5:00 p.m. local time (in the city in
which the principal office of the Exchange Agent is located) on a date mutually agreed by the Company and Parent but which in no
event shall be less than one (1) day prior to the anticipated Closing Date. Parent and the Company shall issue a joint press release
reasonably satisfactory to each of them announcing the anticipated date of the Election Deadline not more than 15 Business Days
before, and at least five Business Days prior to, the anticipated date of the Election Deadline. Without limiting the other provisions
set forth in this Section 3.4, any Company Common Shares or Company Warrants with respect to which the Exchange Agent has not
received an effective, properly completed Form of Election prior to the Election Deadline (other than any Company Common
Shares that constitute Dissenting Shares as of such time) shall also be deemed to be Non-Election Shares.

(e) Any Company Holder may, at any time prior to the Election Deadline, change or revoke such Company Holder’s Election
by written notice received by the Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline accompanied by

Holder’s Certificates or Company Warrants, as applicable, or of the guarantee of delivery of such Certificates or Company Warrants,
or any documents in respect of shares of Company Common Stock in book-entry form, previously deposited with the Exchange
Agent. After an Election is validly made with respect to any Company Common Shares or Company Warrants, any subsequent
transfer of such Company Common Shares or Company Warrants shall automatically revoke such Election. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, all Elections shall be automatically deemed revoked upon receipt by the Exchange
Agent of written notification from the Company that this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with Article IX. The
Exchange Agent shall have reasonable discretion to determine if any Election is not properly made with respect to any Company
Common Shares or Company Warrants (none of the Parties or the Exchange Agent being under any duty to notify any Company
Holder of any such defect). In the event the Exchange Agent makes such a determination, such Election shall be deemed to be not in
effect, and the Company Common Shares or Company Warrant, as applicable, covered by such Election shall, for purposes hereof,
be deemed to be Non-Election Shares or a Non-Election Warrant, as applicable, unless a proper Election is thereafter timely made
with respect to such Company Common Shares or Company Warrant. In the event that any Company Warrant in respect of which an
Election shall have been made is subsequently exercised, such Election shall automatically be deemed to have been withdrawn as to
such Company Warrant.

(f) Parent, in the exercise of its reasonable discretion, shall have the right to make all determinations, not inconsistent with the
terms of this Agreement, governing the manner and extent to which Elections are to be taken into account in making the
determinations prescribed by Section 3.5.

3.5   Proration.

(a) Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this Agreement, the aggregate number of Company Common Shares and
the aggregate number of Warrant Notional Common Shares represented by all of the Company Warrants to be converted into the
right to receive the Cash Consideration pursuant to Section 3.1(b) (the “Cash Conversion Number”) shall be equal to the quotient
obtained by dividing (i) the Cash Component minus the product obtained by multiplying (x) the sum of the number of Mixed
Election Shares and the aggregate number of Warrant Notional Common Shares represented by all of the Mixed Election Warrants
by (y) $34.75, by (ii) the Cash Consideration. The “Cash Component” shall be equal to the amount by which (i) the product
obtained by multiplying (A) the sum of the number of Company Common Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (excluding all Treasury Shares) plus the number of Warrant Notional Common Shares represented by all of the
Company Warrants that are outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time by (B) $34.75, exceeds (ii) the
product obtained by multiplying (1) the number of Dissenting Shares by (2) the Cash Consideration. All other Company Common
Shares and Company Warrants (other than Mixed Election Shares and Mixed Election Warrants, which shall be converted into the
Mixed Consideration, and other than Dissenting Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive the Share Consideration, subject
to Section 3.5(b)(iii).

(b) As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to effect the allocation of
Merger Consideration among the holders of Company Common Shares and Company Warrants as follows:

(i) if the sum of the aggregate number of Cash Election Shares and the aggregate number of Warrant Notional Common
Shares represented by Cash Election Warrants (such sum, the “Total Cash Election Number”) exceeds the Cash Conversion
Number, then (A) all Share Election Shares, all Share Election Warrants, all Non-Election Shares and all Non-Election
Warrants shall be converted into the right to receive the Share Consideration, (B) all Mixed Election Shares and all Mixed
Election Warrants shall be converted into the right to receive the Mixed Consideration, (C) Cash Election Shares of each holder
thereof shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration in respect of that number of Cash Election Shares
equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the number of Cash Election Shares held by such holder by (y) a fraction, the
numerator of which is the Cash Conversion Number and the denominator of which is the Total Cash Election Number (with the
Exchange Agent to determine, consistent with Section 3.5, whether fractions of Cash Election Shares shall be rounded up or
down), with the remaining number of such holder’s Cash Election Shares being converted into the right to receive the Share
Consideration, and (D) each Cash Election Warrant shall be converted into the right to receive (x) the Cash Consideration in
respect of the portion of Warrant Notional Common Shares represented by such Cash Election Warrant equal to the product
obtained by multiplying (1) the number of Warrant Notional Common Shares represented by such Cash Election Warrant by (2)
a fraction, the numerator of which is the Cash Conversion Number and the denominator of which is the Total Cash Election

Mixed Election Shares and all Mixed Election Warrants shall be converted into the right to receive the Mixed Consideration,
and (z) the Share Election Shares, the Share Election Warrants, the Non-Election Shares and the Non-Election Warrants shall

(A) if the Shortfall Number is less than or equal to the sum of the aggregate number of all Non-Election Shares and
the aggregate number of Warrant Notional Common Shares represented by all of the Non-Election Warrants (such sum,
the “Aggregate Non-Election Number”), then all Share Election Shares and all Share Election Warrants shall be
converted into the right to receive the Share Consideration, and (x) the Non-Election Shares of each holder thereof shall
be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration in respect of that number of Non-Election Shares equal to the
product obtained by multiplying (1) the number of Non-Election Shares held by such holder by (2) a fraction, the
numerator of which is the Shortfall Number and the denominator of which is the Aggregate Non-Election Number (with
the Exchange Agent to determine, consistent with Section 3.3, whether fractions of Non-Election Shares shall be rounded
up or down), with the remaining number of such holder’s Non-Election Shares being converted into the right to receive
the Share Consideration, and (y) each Non-Election Warrant shall be converted into the right to receive (I) the Cash
Consideration in respect of that portion of the Warrant Notional Common Shares represented by such Company Warrant
equal to the product obtained by multiplying (1) the total number of Warrant Notional Common Shares represented by
such Non-Election Warrant by (2) a fraction, the numerator of which is the Shortfall Number and the denominator of

whether fractions of Warrant Notional Common Shares shall be rounded up or down), and (II) the Share Consideration
with respect to the remaining portion of Warrant Notional Common Shares represented by such Non-Election Warrant; or

(B) if the Shortfall Number exceeds the Aggregate Non-Election Number, then all Non-Election Shares and all Non-
Election Warrants shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration, and (A) the Share Election Shares of
each holder thereof shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration in respect of that number of Share
Election Shares equal to the product obtained by multiplying (1) the number of Share Election Shares held by such holder

of Warrant Notional Common Shares shall be rounded up or down), and (II) the Share Consideration with respect to the
remaining portion of Warrant Notional Common Shares represented by such Share Election Warrant.

3.6   Anti-Dilution Provisions.   Without limiting the covenants in Sections 4.1 and 4.2, in the event the outstanding Company
Common Shares or Parent Common Shares shall have been changed between the date of this Agreement and the Closing into a
different number of shares or a different class after the date hereof by reason of any subdivisions, reclassifications, splits, share
distributions, combinations or exchanges of Company Common Shares or Parent Common Shares, then the Merger Consideration
will be correspondingly adjusted to provide to the holders of Company Common Shares, Company Options, Company Restricted
Shares and Company Warrants, as applicable, the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event;
provided, however, that nothing in this Section 3.6 shall be deemed to permit or authorize any Party hereto to affect any such change
that it is not otherwise authorized or permitted to undertake pursuant to this Agreement.

3.7   Treatment of Company Preferred Shares.   At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further
action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, or the Company, each Company Preferred Share issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time will be converted into the right to receive cash in an amount (subject to any applicable withholding Tax) equal
to one dollar ($1.00), without interest (the “Preferred Share Consideration”). The Preferred Share Consideration issued upon
conversion of a Company Preferred Share in accordance with the terms hereof will be deemed to have been issued in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Company Preferred Share. All Company Preferred Shares converted into the right to
receive the Preferred Share Consideration pursuant to this Section 3.7 will cease to be outstanding and will automatically be
canceled and will cease to exist when converted as a result of and pursuant to the Merger.

3.8   Treatment of Company Options and Company Restricted Shares.   

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof) shall adopt such resolutions or
take such other actions to cause all outstanding Company Options to vest immediately prior to the Effective Time and provide that
each Company Option that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, as of the Effective Time, be exchanged for
the number of Parent Common Shares, rounded down to the nearest whole share, equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (i) the
product of (A) the number of Company Common Shares subject to the Company Option and (B) the amount, if any, by which the
per share closing trading price of Company Common Shares on the Business Day immediately before the Closing Date exceeds the
exercise price per Company Common Share otherwise purchasable pursuant to the Company Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time by (ii) the Average Closing Price; provided if such calculation results in zero or a negative number, the applicable
Company Option shall be forfeited for no consideration.

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof) shall adopt such resolutions or
take such other actions to adjust the terms of all outstanding Company Restricted Shares to provide that, as of the Effective Time,
the Company Restricted Shares that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into a number of
restricted Parent Common Shares (“Adjusted Restricted Shares”) subject to the same vesting, repurchase or other lapse restrictions
equal to the number of corresponding Company Restricted Shares multiplied by the Share Consideration, rounded up to the nearest
whole share.

(c) For the avoidance of doubt, all Adjusted Restricted Shares shall be subject to the same vesting and other terms and
restrictions that applied to the corresponding Company Restricted Share, as applicable, including all vesting acceleration provisions
as may be set forth in an applicable employment agreement or otherwise.

(d) As of the Effective Time, Parent shall (i) assume all of the obligations of the Company under the Company Stock Plans
with respect to the outstanding Adjusted Restricted Shares, and (ii) file one or more appropriate registration statements (on Form S-
3 or Form S-8, or any successor or other appropriate forms) with respect to all Parent Common Shares underlying Adjusted
Restricted Shares.

(e) At the Effective Time, if Parent determines that it desires to do so, Parent may assume any or all of the Company Stock
Plans. If Parent assumes any Company Stock Plan, then, under such Company Stock Plan Parent will be entitled to grant equity or
equity-based incentive awards with respect to Parent Shares, to the extent permissible under applicable Law, using the share
reserves of such Company Stock Plan (including any Parent Shares returned

to such share reserves as a result of the termination or forfeiture of any equity awards). If Parent notifies the Company that it does
not wish to assume a Company Stock Plan, the Company shall ensure that such Company Stock Plan is terminated as of the
Effective Time and no future rights remain under such Company Stock Plan, except with respect to the Adjusted Restricted Shares.

3.9   Dissenting Shares.   Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, with respect to each Company Common
Share that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time as to which the holder thereof shall have properly complied in all
respects with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL as to appraisal rights (each, a “Dissenting Share”), such Dissenting Share
shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration but instead shall be canceled and shall represent the right to
receive only the payment, solely from the Surviving Company, of the appraisal value of the Dissenting Shares to the extent
permitted by and in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL; provided, however, that if any such Person shall
fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL, then the right of
such Person to receive those rights under Section 262 of the DGCL shall cease and such Company Common Shares shall be deemed
to have been converted as of the Effective Time into, and shall represent only the right to right to receive, the same type of Merger
Consideration, without interest thereon, as was payable in respect of an equivalent number of Non-Election Shares. The Company
shall give Parent prompt notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of Company Common Shares, and Parent
shall have the right to control all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company shall not settle, make
any payments with respect to, or offer to settle, any claim with respect to Dissenting Shares without the written consent of Parent.

in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 (the “Company Reserve Reports”)
was based was complete and accurate at the time such data was provided to Williamson Petroleum Consultants, Inc. and Ryder Scott
Company, LP, except for any incompleteness or inaccuracy that would not, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably expected
to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. To the Knowledge of the Company, there are no material errors in the assumptions and
estimates provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries in connection with the preparation of the Company Reserve Reports. The
Hydrocarbon reserve estimates of the Company and its Subsidiaries set forth in the Company Reserve Reports fairly reflect, in all
material respects, the Hydrocarbon reserves of the Company and its Subsidiaries at the dates indicated therein and are in accordance
with the rules promulgated by the SEC, as applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods reflected therein. Except for changes
(including changes in Hydrocarbon commodity prices) generally affecting the oil and gas industry and normal depletion by
production, there has been no change in respect of the matters addressed in the Company Reserve Reports that would, individually
or in the aggregate, be reasonably expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The estimates of proved Hydrocarbon
reserves provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries to Williamson Petroleum Consultants, Inc. and Ryder Scott Company, LP,
respectively, in connection with the preparation of the Company Reserve Reports complied in all material respects with Rule 4-10 of
Regulation S-X promulgated by the SEC.

5.15   Title to Properties.   

(a) The Company and its Subsidiaries have good and indefeasible title to all real and personal properties that are material to the
business of the Company and its Subsidiaries, including all of the Oil and Gas Properties reflected in the Company Reserve Reports
(excluding any Oil and Gas Properties sold or otherwise disposed of since December 31, 2015 under any Company Material
Agreement disclosed on Section 5.12 of the Company Disclosure Schedule), in each case free and clear of all Liens, encumbrances,
claims and defects and imperfections of title except (i) such as do not materially, individually or in the aggregate, affect the value of
such property and do not, individually or in the aggregate, materially interfere with the use made and proposed to be made of such
property by the Company and its Subsidiaries, (ii) for Permitted Encumbrances and (iii) such as would not, individually or in the
aggregate, be reasonably expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. For purposes of the foregoing sentence, “good and
indefeasible title” means title that is free from reasonable doubt to the end that a prudent person engaged in the business of
purchasing and owning, developing, and operating producing or non-producing Oil and Gas Properties in the geographical areas in
which they are located, with knowledge of all of the facts and their legal bearing, would be willing to accept, acting reasonably.

(b) Except to the extent that enforceability thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer,
reorganization, moratorium and similar laws relating to or affecting creditors’ rights generally and by general principles of equity,
each material Oil and Gas Lease (i) constitutes the valid and binding obligation of the Company or its applicable Subsidiary and, to
the Knowledge of the Company, constitutes the valid and binding obligation of the other parties thereto, (ii) is in full force and
effect, and (iii) immediately after the Effective Time will continue to constitute a valid and binding obligation of the Company or its
applicable Subsidiary and, to the Knowledge of the Company, each of the other parties thereto in accordance with its terms. Each of
the Company and its Subsidiaries (to the extent it is a party thereto or bound thereby) and, to the Knowledge of the Company, each
other party thereto has performed in all material respects all obligations required to be performed by it under each material Oil and
Gas Lease. There is not, to the Knowledge of the Company, under any Oil and Gas Lease, any default or event which, with notice or
lapse of time or both, would constitute a default on the part of any of the parties thereto, or any notice of termination, cancellation or
material modification, in each case, except such events of default, other events, notices or modifications as to which requisite
waivers or consents have been obtained, and, to the Knowledge of the Company, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
has received any notice of any material violation or breach of, material default under or intention to cancel, terminate, modify or not
renew any material Oil and Gas Lease.

(c) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has good and valid title, in all material respects, to each material real property
(and each material real property at which its operations are conducted) owned by it (in each case excluding Oil and Gas Leases and
Company Real Property Leases, the “Company Owned Real Property”) except for Permitted Encumbrances. Each of the Company
and its Subsidiaries has a good and valid leasehold interest in each lease, sublease and other agreement under which it uses or
occupies or has the right to use or occupy any material real property (or material real property at which its operations are conducted)
(but excluding Oil and Gas Leases) (such property subject to a lease, sublease or other agreement, the “Company Leased Real
Property” and such leases, subleases and other agreements are, collectively, the “Company Real Property Leases”), in each case,

force and effect, except as enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium
and similar laws relating to or affecting creditors’ rights generally and by general principles of equity. No uncured default of a
material nature on the part of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or, to the Knowledge of the Company, the landlord thereunder,
exists under any Company Real Property Lease, and no event has occurred or circumstance exists which, with or without the giving
of notice, the passage of time, or both, would constitute a material breach or default under a Company Real Property Lease. Section
5.15(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth an accurate and complete list of the Company Owned Real Property and the
Company Leased Real Property (collectively, the “Company Real Property”).

(d) There are no leases, subleases, licenses, rights or other agreements burdening or affecting any portion of the Company Real
Property that would reasonably be expected to materially adversely affect the existing use of such Company Real Property by the
Company and its Subsidiaries in the operation of their respective businesses thereon. Except for such arrangements solely between
or among the Company and its Subsidiaries, there are no outstanding options or rights of first refusal in favor of any other party to
purchase any Company Owned Real Property or any portion thereof or interest therein that would reasonably be expected to
materially adversely affect the existing use of the Company Owned Real Property by the Company and its Subsidiaries in the
operation of their respective businesses thereon. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is currently leasing, subleasing,
licensing or otherwise granting any person the right to use or occupy all or any portion of any Company Real Property that would
reasonably be expected to materially adversely affect the existing use of such Company Real Property by the Company and its
Subsidiaries in the operation of their respective businesses thereon. The Company Real Property constitutes all of the material real
estate used in and necessary for the operation of the respective businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries.

(e) There is no pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened, appropriation, condemnation or like Proceeding or
order by any Governmental Authority or any other Person materially affecting any material Company Owned Real Property or any

condemnation or other matters materially affecting and impairing the current use, occupancy or value thereof.

reason.

and applicable Law, in all material respects, and all drilling and completion (and plugging and abandonment, including plugging and
abandonment of permanently plugged wells located on the Oil and Gas Leases) of the Hydrocarbon Wells and such other Wells and
all related development, production and other operations have been conducted in compliance with all applicable Law in all material
respects.

(h) All Oil and Gas Properties operated by the Company and or any of its Subsidiaries have been operated in accordance with
reasonable, prudent oil and gas field practices and in material compliance with the applicable Oil and Gas Leases and in material
compliance with applicable Company Material Agreements, material joint operating agreements, and applicable Law.

(i) None of the Oil and Gas Properties of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is subject to any preferential purchase,
consent, transfer fee, termination fee, capital recovery fee, payout or similar right or obligation that would become operative or be
required by the Company or any of its Affiliates as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement except as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

aggregate, material). The financial statements to be filed by Parent with the SEC after the date of this Agreement (i) will comply as
to form in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements and with the published rules and regulations of the SEC
with respect thereto, (ii) will be prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved
(except as may be expressly indicated in the notes thereto), and (iii) will fairly present in all material respects the consolidated
financial position of Parent and its Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the consolidated results of their operations and cash flows
for the periods then ended (subject, in the case of unaudited quarterly statements, to normal year-end adjustments which are not,
individually or in the aggregate, material).

6.8   Internal Controls and Procedures.   Parent has established and maintains internal control over financial reporting and
disclosure controls and procedures (as such terms are defined in Rule 13a-15 and Rule 15d-15 under the Exchange Act) sufficient to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting, including policies and procedures that (a) mandate the
maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the material transactions and dispositions of the assets
of Parent and its Subsidiaries, (b) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of Parent and its Subsidiaries are being made only
in accordance with appropriate authorizations of management and the Parent Board and (c) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the assets of Parent and its Subsidiaries. Such
disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that material information relating to Parent, including its Subsidiaries,
required to be disclosed by Parent in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to
Parent’s principal executive officer and its principal financial officer to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Parent’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by Parent in the reports
that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in
SEC rules and forms. Parent’s principal executive officer and its principal financial officer have disclosed, based on their most
recent evaluation, to Parent’s auditors and the audit committee of the Parent Board (x) all significant deficiencies, if any, in the
design or operation of internal controls which could adversely affect Parent’s ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial data and have identified for Parent’s auditors any material weaknesses in internal controls and (y) any fraud, whether or
not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in Parent’s internal controls. To the
Knowledge of Parent, since January 1, 2014, no complaints from any source regarding accounting, internal accounting controls or
auditing matters have been received by Parent. Since January 1, 2014, Parent has not received any material complaints through
Parent’s whistleblower hotline or

equivalent system for receipt of employee concerns regarding possible violations of applicable Law. Since January 1, 2014, no
attorney representing Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, has reported
evidence of a violation of applicable Law that are securities laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation by Parent or any of its
officers, directors, employees or agents to Parent’s chief legal officer, audit committee of the Parent Board or to the Parent Board
pursuant to the rules adopted pursuant to Section 307 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act or any Parent policy contemplating such reporting.
The principal executive officer and the principal financial officer of Parent have made all certifications required by the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act, the Exchange Act and any related rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC with respect to the Parent SEC
Documents, and the statements contained in such certifications were complete and accurate as of the dates they were made.

6.9   Absence of Undisclosed Liabilities.   Except as disclosed in the audited financial statements (or notes thereto) included
in Parent’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, the unaudited financial statements (or notes
thereto) included in Parent’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2016, and in the financial
statements (or notes thereto) included in subsequent Parent SEC Documents filed by Parent prior to the date hereof, neither Parent
nor any of its consolidated Subsidiaries had at the Balance Sheet Date, or has incurred since that date, any liabilities or obligations
(whether absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise) of any nature, except liabilities, obligations or contingencies that (A) are
accrued or reserved against in the financial statements of Parent included in the Parent SEC Documents filed prior to the date
hereof, or reflected in the notes thereto, (B) were incurred since the Balance Sheet Date and prior to the date hereof in the ordinary
course of business and consistent with past practices and that would not reasonably be expected, either individually or in the

6.10   Absence of Certain Changes or Events.

Subsidiaries have carried on and operated their respective businesses in all material respects in the ordinary course of business.

not in default under or in violation of any, applicable Laws (other than any Laws relating to Taxes), including the FCPA, other than
any noncompliance, default or violation which would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any written communication since January 1, 2014
from a Governmental Authority that alleges that Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is not in compliance with or is in default or
violation of any applicable Law, including the FCPA, except where such non-compliance, default or violation would not,
individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. No investigation or review by any
Governmental Authority with respect to any of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent,
threatened, nor, to the Knowledge of Parent, has any Governmental Authority indicated an intention to conduct the same, except
where such investigation or review would not, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably expected to have a Parent Material
Adverse Effect.

6.12   Litigation.   There are no Proceedings pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened, against Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their assets or property or to which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their assets or property is
otherwise a party or, to the Knowledge of Parent, a threatened party, except for Proceedings that would not, individually or in the
aggregate, be reasonably expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect or to prevent or materially delay consummation of the
Merger.

6.13   Information Supplied.   None of the information supplied (or to be supplied) by or on behalf of Parent specifically for
inclusion in (a) the Registration Statement will, at the time the Registration Statement or any amendment or supplement thereto, is
filed with the SEC or at the time it becomes effective under the Securities Act, or (b) the Proxy Statement (which will be included as
a prospectus in the Registration Statement) will, on the date the Proxy Statement or any amendment or supplement thereto is first
mailed to Company Stockholders, and at the time of the Company Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under

(a) Each Employee Benefit Plan sponsored, maintained or contributed to by Parent or any of its ERISA Affiliates or for which
Parent or any of its ERISA Affiliates has or could have any liability, contingent or otherwise (each, a “Parent Employee Benefit
Plan”) has been operated and administered, in all material respects, in accordance with its terms, and in compliance with all
applicable Laws, in each case except where the failure to be so administered or to so comply, would not, individually or in the
aggregate, be reasonably expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. There are no proceedings, audits or other claims
(except routine claims for benefits payable under the Parent Employee Benefit Plans) pending or, to the Knowledge of the Parent,
threatened against or involving any Parent Employee Benefit Plan that would be reasonably expected to have a Parent Material
Adverse Effect.

(b) Parent and its Affiliates are, and have been, in compliance in all respects with all applicable Law relating to the
employment of labor or the engagement of independent contractors, including all such applicable Law relating to wages and other
compensation, hours, overtime, collective bargaining, discrimination, retaliation, immigration status, layoffs, plant closings,
classification of employees and independent contractors, civil rights, safety and health and workers’ compensation, except where the
failure to comply would not, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.
Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Parent Material Adverse Effect, Parent and its Affiliates have complied
with the WARN Act and neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates have any plans to undertake any action that would give rise to any
notice obligation or other obligation under the WARN Act.

(c) Since January 1, 2014, there has been no actual or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened unfair labor practice charges,
grievances, arbitrations, strikes, lockouts, work stoppages, slowdowns, picketing, hand billing or other labor disputes against or

Adverse Effect.

(d) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect, Parent and its Subsidiaries are not

including Taxes required to be collected or withheld from payments to employees, creditors, shareholders, independent contractors
or other third parties, have been duly and timely paid in full, except in each case of clause (i) and (ii) for amounts being contested in
good faith by appropriate proceedings or for which adequate reserves have been maintained in accordance with GAAP.

(b) There is no Proceeding now pending against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries in respect of any material Tax, paid or unpaid,
or material Tax Return, nor has any written adjustment with respect to a material Tax Return or written claim for additional material
Tax been received by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries that is still pending.

(c) Within the last two years, neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has been a party to any transaction intended to qualify
under Section 355 of the Code.

(d) For U.S. federal income tax purposes, (i) Parent is treated as directly owning all of the equity interests in Merger Sub and
(ii) Marshall Texas is currently, and has been since its formation, classified as an entity whose existence is disregarded as separate
from Parent.

(e) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken or agreed to take any action that would prevent the Integrated Mergers
from qualifying as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is
aware of any agreement, plan or other circumstance that would prevent the Integrated Mergers from qualifying as a “reorganization”
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

ARTICLE VII
COVENANTS

The Company hereby covenants to and agrees with Parent, and Parent and Merger Sub hereby covenant to and agree with the
Company, on their behalf and on behalf of the Surviving Corporation, that:

7.1   Consummation of the Merger.   

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including Section 7.1(d)), Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand,
and the Company, on the other hand, will cooperate with each other and use (and will cause their respective Subsidiaries to use) its
reasonable best efforts (subject to, and in accordance with, applicable Law) to: (i) take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do, or
cause to be done, promptly and to assist and cooperate with the Other Party in doing, all things, necessary, proper or advisable to
cause the conditions to the Closing to be satisfied as promptly as practicable (and in any event no later than the Outside Date) and to
consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the Merger, including preparing and filing promptly
and fully all documentation to effect all necessary filings, notifications, notices, petitions, statements, registrations, submissions of
information, applications and other documents (including any required or recommended filings under applicable Antitrust Laws),
(ii) obtain promptly (and in any event no later than the Outside Date) all approvals, consents, clearances, expirations or terminations
of waiting periods, registrations, permits, authorizations and other confirmations from any Governmental Authority or Third Party
necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the Merger, (iii) defend any lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or
administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the Merger, including seeking to have any stay or temporary
restraining order entered by any court or Governmental Authority vacated, lifted, overturned or reversed, (iv) obtain all necessary
consents, approvals or waivers from Third Parties, and (v) execute and deliver any additional instruments necessary to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided, however, that in no event shall the Company, Parent or Merger Sub (or
any of their respective Subsidiaries) be required to pay any penalty, compensation or other consideration to any Third Party for any
consent or approval required under any license, contract or agreement for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, “Antitrust Laws” means the Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as
amended, the HSR Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, and all other applicable Laws issued by a Governmental
Authority that are designed or intended to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or effect of monopolization or
restraint of trade or lessening of competition.

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each Party hereto agrees to make an appropriate filing of a Notification
and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable and in
any event within ten (10) Business Days after the date of this Agreement and to supply as promptly as practicable any additional
information and documentary material that may be requested by any Governmental Authority pursuant to the HSR Act or any other
Antitrust Law and use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken (including by their respective Subsidiaries), all other
actions consistent with this Section 7.1 necessary to cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under the
HSR Act as soon as practicable (and in any event no later than the Outside Date). Parent will pay any HSR Act filing fee.

(c) Each of the Parties hereto will use its reasonable best efforts to: (i) cooperate in all respects with each other in connection
with any filing or submission with a Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and in
connection with any investigation or other inquiry by or before a Governmental Authority relating to the Merger, including any
proceeding initiated by a private Person; (ii) promptly inform the Other Party of (and supply to the Other Party) any communication
received by such Party from, or given by such party to, the Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of the Department of
Justice, or any other Governmental Authority and any material communication received or given in connection with any proceeding
by a private Person, in each case regarding the Merger; (iii) permit the Other Party to review in advance and incorporate the Other
Party’s reasonable comments in any communication to be given by it to any Governmental Authority with respect to obtaining any
clearances required under any Antitrust Law in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby; and (iv) consult with the
Other Party in advance of any meeting or teleconference with any Governmental Authority or, in connection with any proceeding by
a private Person, with any other Person, and, to the extent not prohibited by the Governmental Authority or other Person, give the
Other Party the opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings and teleconferences. Subject to Section 7.4(a), the Parties will
take reasonable efforts to share information protected from disclosure under the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine,
joint defense privilege or any

other privilege pursuant to this Section 7.1 in a manner so as to preserve the applicable privilege. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, neither Party is required to disclose to the Other Party its documents responsive to Items
4(c) and 4(d) of the HSR Notification and Report Form.

(d) In furtherance of the covenants set forth in this Section 7.1 and subject to the limitations set forth in this Section 7.1(d), if
any objections are asserted with respect to the Merger under any Antitrust Law or if any lawsuit or other proceeding, whether
judicial or administrative, is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) by the Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of
the Department of Justice or any other Governmental Authority challenging the Merger or which would otherwise prohibit or
materially impede or delay the consummation of the Merger, each of Parent and the Company shall (and shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries to) take all actions necessary to resolve any such objections or lawsuits or other proceedings (or threatened lawsuits or
other proceedings) so as to permit consummation of the Merger as soon as reasonably practicable, including becoming subject to,
consenting to or agreeing to, or otherwise taking any action with respect to, any requirement, condition, understanding, agreement
or order to sell, to hold separate or otherwise dispose of, or to conduct, restrict, operate, invest or otherwise change its respective
assets or business (including that of its Affiliates) (each, a “Divestiture Action”); provided that notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, none of Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries shall be required to take any such
action that would reasonably be expected to impair the benefits of the Merger to Parent or to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect or a Parent Material Adverse Effect; provided, further, that the obligations of the parties under this Section 7.1(d) to
consummate any such Divestiture Action shall be conditioned upon the occurrence of the Closing or satisfaction of all of the
conditions to the Closing in a case where the Closing will occur immediately following such Divestiture Action.

(e) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the Parties contained in this Section 7.1 (but subject to the
limitations set forth in Section 7.1(d)), if any administrative or judicial action or proceeding, including any proceeding by a private
Person, is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging the Merger as violative of any Antitrust Law, each of Parent and the
Company will use reasonable best efforts to contest and resist any such action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or
overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that
prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the Merger.

7.2   Registration Statement; Proxy Statement.

(a) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Company and Parent will prepare and the Company will
file with the SEC the Proxy Statement and the Company and Parent will prepare and Parent will file with the SEC the Registration
Statement, in which the Proxy Statement will be included as a prospectus. The Parties shall file, if necessary, any other statement or
schedule relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. Each of the Company and Parent shall use their
respective reasonable best efforts to furnish the information required to be included by the SEC in the Proxy Statement, the
Registration Statement and any such statement or schedule. Each of the Company and Parent will use its reasonable best efforts to
have the Registration Statement declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such filing and keep the
Registration Statement effective for so long as necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. Parent also agrees to
use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any necessary state securities law or “Blue Sky” permits and approvals required to
carry out the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Company will use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy
Statement to be mailed to the Company Stockholders as promptly as practicable after the Registration Statement is declared
effective under the Securities Act. No filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the Registration Statement will be made by Parent,
and no filing of, or amendment or supplement to, or dissemination to the Company Stockholders of, the Proxy Statement or any
other materials used in connection with the Company Meeting that constitute “proxy materials” or “solicitation materials” as those
terms are used in Rules 14a-1 through 14a-17 under the Exchange Act or are otherwise used for the “solicitation” of “proxies” as
those terms are defined in Rule 14a-1 under the Exchange Act (“Other Proxy Materials”) will be made by the Company without
providing the Other Party a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon (and good faith consideration by Parent or the
Company, as applicable, of all such comments). If at any time prior to the Effective Time any information relating to the Company
or Parent, or any of their respective Affiliates, directors or officers, is discovered by the Company or Parent that should be set forth
in an amendment or supplement to either the Registration Statement or the Proxy Statement, so that either such document would not
include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the Party that discovers such information will promptly notify the
Other

Party hereto and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information will be promptly filed with the SEC and, to
the extent required by Law, disseminated to the Company Stockholders. The Parties will notify each other promptly of the receipt of
any comments from the SEC or the staff of the SEC and of any request by the SEC or the staff of the SEC for amendments or
supplements to the Proxy Statement or the Registration Statement or for additional information and each Party will supply the Other
Party with copies of (i) all correspondence between it or any of its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or the staff of the
SEC, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement, the Registration Statement or the transactions contemplated hereby and
(ii) all orders of the SEC relating to the Registration Statement; provided that no responses to any oral or written request by the SEC
with respect to the Registration Statement, the Proxy Statement or the Other Proxy Materials, will be made by Parent or the
Company, as applicable, without providing the Other Party a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon (and good faith
consideration by Parent or the Company, as applicable, of all such comments).

(b) Unless this Agreement has been validly terminated as provided in Section 9.1 prior thereto, the Company will, as soon as
reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement, establish a record date for, and as soon as reasonably practicable
following the Registration Statement being declared effective by the SEC, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold, the Company
Meeting. Without the prior written consent of Parent, the adoption of this Agreement by the Company Stockholders and an advisory
vote on compensation payable to executive officers of the Company in connection with the Merger (together with related procedural
matters) shall be the only proposals to be submitted to, or voted on by, the Company Stockholders at the Company Meeting. Subject
to Section 7.3, the Company will, through the Company Board, recommend to the Company Stockholders that they adopt this
Agreement (the “Company Board Recommendation”). The Proxy Statement shall (subject to Section 7.3) include the Company
Board Recommendation. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company shall not postpone or adjourn
the Company Meeting without the consent of Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), other than (i) to
solicit additional proxies for the purpose of obtaining Company Stockholder Approval, (ii) in the absence of a quorum, (iii) to allow
reasonable additional time for the filing and/or mailing of any supplemental or amended disclosure that the Company Board has
determined, after consultation with outside legal counsel, is necessary under applicable Law and for such supplemental or amended
disclosure to be disseminated and reviewed by the Company Stockholders prior to the Company Meeting, and (iv) if the Company
has delivered any notice contemplated by Section 7.3(e) or Section 7.3(f) and the time periods contemplated by Section 7.3(e) or
Section 7.3(f) have not expired to extend the date of the Company Meeting beyond the end of such period.

7.3   Alternative Proposals; Change in Recommendation.   

(a) The Company will, and will cause its Subsidiaries and its and their respective Representatives to, immediately cease and
cause to be terminated any discussions or negotiations with any Person conducted heretofore with respect to any possible
Alternative Proposal, and request that each Person who has heretofore executed a confidentiality agreement in connection with such
Person’s consideration of any Alternative Proposal return or destroy all confidential information previously provided to such Person
by or on behalf of the Company or its Subsidiaries. Except as permitted by this Section 7.3, the Company will not, and will cause its
Subsidiaries and its and their respective Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage or
knowingly facilitate (including by way of furnishing information) any inquiries or the making or the submission of any proposal that
constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, an Alternative Proposal, (ii) participate or engage in any discussions or
negotiations with, or disclose any non-public information or data relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or afford access
to the properties, books or records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to, any Person that has made an Alternative Proposal or
to any Person in contemplation of an Alternative Proposal (other than, solely in response to an unsolicited inquiry, to refer the

of the Company’s Subsidiaries or by any Representatives of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not such
Representative is so authorized and whether or not such Representative is purporting to act on behalf of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or otherwise, shall be deemed to be a breach of this Agreement by the Company.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 7.3, if at any time following the date of this Agreement
and prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, (i) the Company has received a written Alternative Proposal that the
Company Board believes in good faith is bona fide, (ii) the Company Board, after consultation with its financial advisors and
outside legal counsel, determines in good faith that such Alternative Proposal constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to
or result in a Superior Proposal, and (iii) the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors
and outside legal counsel, that the failure to participate in such negotiations or discussions or to furnish such information or data to
such Third Party would be inconsistent with the Company Board’s fiduciary duties under applicable Law, then the Company may,
subject to clauses (w)-(z) below, (A) furnish information, including confidential information, with respect to the Company and its
Subsidiaries to the Person making such Alternative Proposal and (B) participate in discussions or negotiations regarding such
Alternative Proposal; provided that (w) such Alternative Proposal was received after the date of this Agreement, such Alternative
Proposal was not initiated, solicited, encouraged or facilitated in violation of Section 7.3(a) and such Alternative Proposal has not
been withdrawn, (x) the Company provides to Parent the notice required by Section 7.3(c) with respect to such Alternative Proposal,
(y) the Company will not, and will cause its Subsidiaries and its and their respective directors, officers and employees not to, and
will use reasonable best efforts to cause their respective other Representatives not to, disclose any non-public information to such
Person unless the Company has, or first enters into, a confidentiality agreement with such Person with confidentiality provisions that
are not materially less restrictive to such Person than the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement are to Parent, a copy of which
shall be promptly provided to Parent (it being agreed that such confidentiality agreement between the Company and such person
shall permit such person to make any non-public Alternative Proposal to the Company Board) and (z) prior to or substantially
concurrently with providing or making available to such other Person any non-public information about the Company and its
Subsidiaries that was not previously provided or made available to Parent, the Company will provide such non-public information to
Parent. If Parent or the Company believes that there has been a breach by a Third Party (or its Representatives) of any standstill
provisions to which such Third Party and the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, or Parent or the Company reasonably
anticipates such a breach, then upon written request by Parent, the Company, subject to the fiduciary duties of the Company Board,
shall take all necessary actions to enforce such standstill provision.

(c) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in this Section 7.3, the Company will promptly (and in no event later
than twenty-four (24) hours) after receipt of any Alternative Proposal or any inquiry or request for discussions or negotiations
regarding an Alternative Proposal or non-public information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with
an Alternative Proposal advise Parent orally and in writing of such Alternative Proposal, inquiry or request (including providing the
identity of the person making or submitting such Alternative Proposal, inquiry or request and, (x) if it is in writing, a copy of such
Alternative Proposal, inquiry or request and any related draft agreements and (y) if oral, a reasonably detailed summary thereof)
(and any changes thereto). The Company will keep Parent reasonably informed of material developments with respect to any such
Alternative Proposal (and in no event later than twenty-four (24) hours following any such development).

(d) Except as otherwise provided in this Section 7.3, neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof will directly or
indirectly: (i) withhold, withdraw, modify, qualify or fail to make, or publicly propose to withhold, withdraw, modify, qualify or fail
to make, in any manner adverse to Parent, the Company Board Recommendation, including by failing to include the Company
Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement and Registration Statement, (ii) publicly approve, adopt or recommend, or publicly
propose to approve, adopt or recommend, any Alternative Proposal, (iii) approve, adopt or recommend, or publicly propose to
approve, adopt or recommend, or allow the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to execute or enter into, any letter of intent,
memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint venture
agreement, partnership agreement, or other similar contract or any tender or exchange offer providing for, with respect to, or in
connection with, any Alternative Proposal, (iv) approve any transaction under, or any Third Party becoming, an “interested
stockholder” under, Section 203 of the DGCL (or similar concepts under any other applicable Takeover Law), or (v) resolve,
propose, agree or publicly announce an intention to do any of the foregoing (any action described in this Section 7.3(d) being
referred to as a “Change in Recommendation”). For the avoidance of doubt, a public statement that merely describes the
Company’s receipt of an Alternative Proposal and the operation of this Agreement with respect thereto shall not be deemed a
Change in Recommendation.

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Company receives a written Alternative Proposal that the Company Board believes in
good faith is bona fide and such Alternative Proposal was not initiated, solicited, encouraged or facilitated in violation of Section
7.3(a) and the Company Board (i) after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, concludes that such
Alternative Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and (ii) following consultation with outside legal counsel, determines that the
failure of the Company Board to make a Change in Recommendation would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law, then the Company Board may at any time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(h) and pay Parent a Termination Fee and/or effect a Change in Recommendation (provided,
however, that such termination shall not be effective unless and until the Company shall have paid the Termination Fee in
accordance with Section 9.4(c)); provided, however, that the Company Board may not take such action pursuant to the foregoing
unless:

(i) the Company has provided prior written notice (which notice must state that the Company Board has made the
determinations contemplated by the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) of Section 7.3(d)) to Parent specifying in reasonable detail the
reasons for such action (including a description of the material terms of such Superior Proposal, identifying the Person or group
making such Superior Proposal and delivering to Parent a copy of the proposed definitive agreement providing for the
Alternative Proposal for such Superior Proposal in the form to be entered into and any other relevant proposed transaction
agreements) at least four calendar days in advance of its intention to take such action with respect to a Change in
Recommendation (the period inclusive of all such days, the “Notice Period”) (it being understood and agreed that any material
amendment to the terms of a Superior Proposal shall require a new notice pursuant to this Section 7.3(e) and a new Notice
Period, except that such new Notice Period in connection with any amendment shall be for three calendar days from the time
Parent receives such notice (as opposed to four calendar days));

(ii) during the Notice Period, the Company has negotiated with Parent in good faith (to the extent Parent desires to
negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and

(iii) at the end of the Notice Period, the Company Board again concludes in good faith, after consultation with its financial
advisors and outside legal counsel, and taking into account any adjustment or modification to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement proposed by Parent, that such Alternative Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal and that the failure
of the Company Board to effect a Change in Recommendation or to terminate this Agreement with respect to such Superior
Proposal would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

(iv) For the avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding any Change in Recommendation pursuant to this Section 7.3, the
Company shall not be entitled to enter into any agreement, including any definitive acquisition agreement, with respect to a
Superior Proposal unless and until (i) this Agreement is terminated and (ii) if applicable, the Termination Fee has been paid to
Parent pursuant to Section 9.4.

(f) Other than in connection with an Alternative Proposal (which shall be subject to Section 7.3(e) and shall not be subject to
this Section 7.3(f)), nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit or restrict the Company Board from making a Change in
Recommendation prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval in response to an Intervening Event to the extent that (i) the
Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with the Company’s outside legal counsel, that the failure of the
Company Board to effect a Change in Recommendation would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, and
(ii) (A) the Company provides Parent four calendar days written notice of its intention to take such action, which notice shall specify
the reasons therefor, (B) after providing such notice and prior to making such Change in Recommendation, the Company shall
negotiate in good faith with Parent during such four calendar day period (to the extent that Parent desires to negotiate) to make such
revisions to the terms of this Agreement as would not permit the Company Board to make a Change in Recommendation pursuant to
this Section 7.3(f), and (C) the Company Board shall have considered in good faith any changes to this Agreement offered in writing
by Parent, and following such four calendar day period, shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel and financial advisors, that the Company Board’s fiduciary duties under applicable Law would continue to require a Change
in Recommendation with respect to such Intervening Event.

(g) Nothing contained in this Agreement will prevent the Company or the Company Board from taking and disclosing to the
Company Stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any
similar communication to the Company Stockholders) or from making any legally required

disclosure to Company Stockholders; provided, however, that any such disclosure that addresses or relates to the approval,
recommendation or declaration of advisability by the Company Board with respect to this Agreement or an Alternative Proposal
shall be deemed to be a Change in Recommendation unless the Company Board in connection with such communication publicly
states that its recommendation with respect to this Agreement has not changed or refers to the prior recommendation of the
Company Board. Any “stop-look-and-listen” communication by the Company or the Company Board to the Company Stockholders
pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication to the Company Stockholders) will
not be considered a failure to make, or a withdrawal, modification or change in any manner adverse to Parent of, all or a portion of
the Company Board Recommendation.

(h) For purposes of this Agreement:

(i) “Alternative Proposal” means any proposal or offer (whether or not in writing) from any Person or “group” (as defined
in Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act), other than Parent and its Subsidiaries, relating to any (A) direct or indirect acquisition
(whether in a single transaction or a series of related transactions) of assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries equal to 20%
or more of the consolidated assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries or to which 20% or more of the consolidated revenues
or earnings of the Company and its Subsidiaries are attributable, (B) direct or indirect acquisition (whether in a single
transaction or a series of related transactions) of beneficial ownership (within the meaning of Section 13(d) of the Exchange
Act) of 20% or more of any class of equity securities or capital stock of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries whose business
constitutes 20% or more of the net revenues, net income or assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (C)
tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any Person or “group” (as defined in Section 13(d) of the
Exchange Act) beneficially owning 20% or more of the outstanding Company Common Shares, or (D) merger, consolidation,
share exchange, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving the Company
which is structured to permit such Person or group to acquire beneficial ownership of at least 20% of the consolidated assets of
the Company and its Subsidiaries or at least 20% of any class of equity securities or capital stock of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries whose business constitutes 20% or more of the net revenues, net income or assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; in each case, other than the transactions contemplated hereby.

(ii) “Intervening Event” means a material event, fact, circumstance, development or occurrence that is not known or
reasonably foreseeable (or if known or reasonably foreseeable, the probability or magnitude of consequences of which were not
known or reasonably foreseeable) to or by the Company Board as of the date of this Agreement, which event, fact,
circumstance, development or occurrence becomes known to or by the Company Board prior to obtaining the Company
Stockholder Approval.

(iii) “Superior Proposal” means a written offer, obtained after the date of this Agreement, to acquire, directly or
indirectly, more than 50% of the outstanding Company Common Shares or more than 50% of the consolidated assets of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, made by a Third Party, which is on terms and conditions which the Company Board determines
in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel) to be more favorable to the Company
Stockholders (in their capacities as stockholders) than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, taking into account at
the time of determination all financial, legal and regulatory terms and conditions of the Alternative Proposal and this
Agreement, including any changes to the terms of this Agreement that as of that time had been committed to by Parent in
writing in response to such Superior Proposal, including any conditions to and expected timing of consummation, and any risks
of non-consummation, of such Alternative Proposal.

7.4   Access to Information; Confidentiality.   

(a) Upon reasonable notice, each Party shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to the Other Party and its
Representatives reasonable access during normal business hours to (and, with respect to books and records, the right to copy) all of
its and its Subsidiaries’ properties (including for purposes of environmental assessment, which may include subsurface or other
invasive testing or sampling only upon the Company’s prior written approval), commitments, books, contracts, records and
correspondence (in each case, whether in physical or electronic form), officers, employees, accountants, counsel, financial advisors
and other Representatives. Without limiting the foregoing, from the date hereof until the Effective Time, the Company shall
maintain, or cause to be maintained, and provide Parent and its Representatives continued access to, the Data Site, and shall not
remove any documents or information loaded onto the Data Site prior to, on or after the date hereof. The Company shall not remove
any of the documents or items provided in the Data Site through and including the Closing Date. Each Party shall furnish promptly
to the Other Party (i) a copy of each report, schedule and other document filed or submitted by it pursuant to the requirements of
federal or state securities Laws and a copy of any communication (including “comment letters”) received by such Party from the
SEC concerning compliance with securities Laws and (ii) all other information concerning its and its Subsidiaries’ businesses,
properties and personnel as the Other Party may reasonably request (including information necessary to prepare the Proxy Statement
and the Registration Statement. Except for disclosures permitted by the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, each Party and its
Representatives shall hold information received from the Other Party pursuant to this Section 7.4 in confidence in accordance with
the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

(b) This Section 7.4 shall not require either Party to permit any access, or to disclose any information, that in the reasonable,
good faith judgment (after consultation with counsel, which may be in-house counsel) of such Party (i) would reasonably be
expected to result in any violation of any contract or Law to which such Party or its Subsidiaries is a party or is subject or cause any
privilege (including attorney-client privilege) that such Party or any of its Subsidiaries would be entitled to assert to be undermined
with respect to such information and such undermining of such privilege could in such Party’s good faith judgment (after
consultation with counsel, which may be in-house counsel) adversely affect in any material respect such Party’s position in any
pending or, what such Party believes in good faith (after consultation with counsel, which may be in-house counsel) could be, future
litigation or (ii) is reasonably pertinent to any litigation, if any, in which such Party or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and
the Other Party or any of its Subsidiaries, on the other hand, are adverse parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of clause
(i) above, the Parties hereto shall cooperate in seeking to find a way to allow disclosure of such information (including by entering
into a joint-defense or similar agreement) to the extent doing so (1) would not (in the good faith belief of the Party being requested
to disclose the information (after consultation with counsel, which may be in-house counsel)) reasonably be likely to result in the
violation of any such contract or Law or reasonably be likely to cause such privilege to be undermined with respect to such
information or (2) could reasonably (in the good faith belief of the Party being requested to disclose the information (after
consultation with counsel, which may be in-house counsel)) be managed through the use of customary “clean-room” arrangements
pursuant to which non-employee Representatives of the Other Party shall be provided access to such information. In addition, the
Party being requested to disclose the information shall (x) notify the Other Party that such disclosures are reasonably likely to
violate its or its Subsidiaries’ obligations under any such contract or Law or are reasonably likely to cause such privilege to be
undermined, (y) communicate to the Other Party in reasonable detail the facts giving rise to such notification and the subject matter
of such information (to the extent it is able to do so in accordance with the first proviso in this Section 7.4(b)) and (z) in the case
where such disclosures are reasonably likely to violate its or its Subsidiaries’ obligations under any contract, use reasonable
commercial efforts to seek consent from the applicable Third Party to any such contract with respect to the disclosures prohibited
thereby (to the extent not otherwise expressly prohibited by the terms of such contract).

7.5   Public Statements.   The initial press release with respect to the execution of this Agreement shall be a joint press release
to be reasonably agreed upon by Parent and the Company. Parent and the Company will not, and each will cause its respective
Representatives not to, issue any public announcements or make other public disclosures regarding this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, without the prior written approval of the Other Party, such approval not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) a Party or its Representatives may issue a public
announcement or other public disclosures required by Law or the rules of any stock exchange upon which such Party’s equity
securities are traded, provided that such Party uses reasonable best efforts to afford the Other Party an opportunity to first review the
content of the proposed disclosure and provide reasonable comment regarding same, (b) the Company shall not be required by this

existence of an Alternative Proposal and matters related thereto or a Change in Recommendation, (c) either Parent or Company may
make public statements or presentations in connection with industry conferences, investor meetings, analyst or investor conference
calls, or in response to questions from investors, analysts, press or other media, so long as such statements or presentations are not
materially inconsistent with public statements or presentations previously approved by the other Party.

7.6   Confidentiality.   The obligations of Parent and the Company under the Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in full
force and effect and all information provided to any Party hereto or its Representatives pursuant to or in connection with this
Agreement is deemed to be “Evaluation Material” as defined under the Confidentiality Agreement; provided, however, that nothing
in the Confidentiality Agreement shall be deemed to restrict the performance by the Company or Parent of their respective
obligations under this Agreement and, in the case of any conflict between the terms of this Agreement and the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement, the terms of this Agreement shall control.

7.7   Takeover Laws.   Neither the Company nor Parent will take any action that would cause the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement to be subject to requirements imposed by any Takeover Laws, and each of them will take all reasonable steps within
its control to exempt (or ensure the continued exemption of) the transactions contemplated by this Agreement from the Takeover
Laws of any state that purport to apply to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to comply with the terms and conditions of such permits, consents, approvals and
authorizations and to cause the Merger to be consummated as expeditiously as practicable. Each of Parent and the Company has the

relating to the exchange of information, with respect to, all material written information submitted to any Third Party or any
Governmental Authorities in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In exercising the foregoing right,
each of the Parties agrees to act reasonably and promptly. Each Party agrees that it will consult with the Other Party with respect to

necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and each Party will keep the Other Party
apprised of the status of material matters relating to completion of the transactions contemplated hereby.

(b) Each of Parent and the Company agrees, upon request, to furnish the Other Party with all information concerning itself, its
Subsidiaries, directors, officers and stockholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection
with the Proxy Statement, the Registration Statement or any filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of such Other Party or
any of such Other Party’s Subsidiaries to any Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.

(c) This Section 7.9 shall not apply to (i) approval under Antitrust Laws or (ii) approval of the SEC of the Registration
Statement and Proxy Statement.

heirs, executors, trustees, fiduciaries and administrators (collectively, the “Indemnified Parties”) to the fullest extent authorized or
permitted by applicable Law from and against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs, Indemnification Expenses, judgments,
fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement (including all interest, assessments and other charges paid or payable in connection
with or in respect of any thereof) arising out of or in connection with any Claim or Action; and (ii) promptly pay on behalf of or,
within fifteen (15) days after any request for advancement, advance to each of the Indemnified Parties, any Indemnification
Expenses incurred in defending, serving as a witness with respect to or otherwise participating with respect to any Claim or Action
in advance of the final disposition of such Claim or Action, including payment on behalf of or advancement to the Indemnified
Party of any Indemnification Expenses incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with enforcing any rights with respect to
such indemnification and/or advancement, in each case without the requirement of any bond or other security; provided, however,
that it shall be a condition to the payment or advancement of any Indemnification Expenses that Parent or the Surviving Corporation
receive an undertaking by the Indemnified Party to repay such Indemnification Expenses paid or advanced if it is ultimately
determined that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to be indemnified under applicable Law. The indemnification and
advancement obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation pursuant to this Section 7.10(a) extend to acts or omissions
occurring at or before the Effective Time in the capacity as a director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any
Claim or Action relating thereto (including with respect to any acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this
Agreement and the consummation of the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the consideration
and approval thereof and the process undertaken in connection therewith and any Claim or Action relating thereto), and all rights to
indemnification and advancement of expenses conferred hereunder continue as to any Indemnified Party who has ceased to be a
director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries after the date hereof (with respect to acts or omissions occurring prior
to such cessation) and inure to the benefit of such Indemnified Party’s heirs, executors and personal and legal representatives. As
used in this Section 7.10: (x) the term “Claim” means any threatened, asserted, pending or completed action or proceeding, whether
instituted by any Party, any Governmental Authority or any other person, whether civil, criminal, administrative, investigative or
other, including any arbitration or other alternative dispute resolution mechanism (“Action”) arising out of or pertaining to matters
that relate to such Indemnified Party’s duties or service as a director or officer of the Company or of any of its Subsidiaries or as a
trustee of (or in a similar capacity with) any compensation and benefit plan of any thereof; (y) the term “Indemnification Expenses”
means reasonable attorneys’ fees and all other reasonable costs, expenses and obligations (including reasonable experts’ fees, travel
expenses, court costs, retainers, transcript fees, duplicating, printing and binding costs, as well as reasonable telecommunications,
postage and courier charges) paid or incurred in connection with investigating, defending, being a witness in or participating in
(including on appeal), or preparing to investigate, defend, be a witness in or participate in, any Claim for which indemnification is
sought pursuant to this Section 7.10(a), including any Action relating to a claim for indemnification or advancement brought by an
Indemnified Party; and (z) the phrase “to the fullest extent authorized or permitted by applicable Law” includes, but is not limited to
(1) to the fullest extent authorized or permitted by any provision of the DGCL that authorizes or permits additional indemnification
by agreement or otherwise, or the corresponding provision of any amendment to or replacement of the DGCL: and (2) to the fullest
extent authorized or permitted by any amendments to or replacements of the DGCL adopted after the date of this Agreement that
increase the extent to which an entity may indemnify its directors, officers, trustees, employees, agents, or fiduciaries or persons
serving in any capacity in which any Indemnified Party serves. To the extent permitted by Law, any amendment, alteration or repeal
of the DGCL that adversely affects any right of any Indemnified Party will be prospective only and does not limit or eliminate any
such right with respect to any Claim or Action involving any occurrence or alleged occurrence of any action or omission to act that
took place prior to such amendment or repeal. Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation will settle, compromise or consent to
the entry of any judgment in any actual or threatened Claim or Action in respect of which indemnification has been or would
reasonably be expected to be sought by such Indemnified Party hereunder unless such settlement, compromise or judgment includes
an unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all liability arising out of such Claim or Action without admission or
finding of wrongdoing, or such Indemnified Party otherwise consents thereto, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable for any settlement
effected without either Parent’s or the Surviving Corporation’s prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned) and Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not be obligated to pay the fees and expenses of
more than one counsel (selected by a plurality of the applicable Indemnified Parties) for all Indemnified Parties in any jurisdiction
with respect to any single such claim, action, suit, proceeding

that would make such joint representation inappropriate. In the event of any such Action, each applicable Indemnified Party, Parent
and the Surviving Corporation shall reasonably cooperate in the defense thereof.

(b) Without limiting the foregoing, Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses
and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time now existing in favor of the
Indemnitees as provided in the Company Charter and Company Bylaws (or, as applicable, the charter, bylaws, partnership
agreement, limited liability company agreement, or other organizational documents of any of the Company’s Subsidiaries) and the
Director and Officer Indemnification Agreements of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries will be assumed by the Surviving
Corporation in the Merger, without further action, at the Effective Time and will survive the Merger and continue in full force and
effect in accordance with their terms.

(c) For a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation and the organizational documents of the Company’s Subsidiaries will contain provisions no less favorable with respect
to indemnification, advancement of expenses, exculpation and limitations on liability of directors and officers than are set forth in
the Company Charter and Company Bylaws, which provisions will not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of
six (6) years from the Effective Time in any manner that would affect adversely the rights thereunder of individuals who, at or prior
to the Effective Time, were Indemnified Parties, unless such modification is required by Law and then only to the minimum extent
required by Law; provided, however, that any such modification shall be prospective only and shall not limit or eliminate any such
right with respect to any Claim or Action involving any occurrence or alleged occurrence of any action or omission to act that took
place prior to modification; and provided further that all rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses in respect of any
Action pending or asserted or any Claim made within such period continue until the disposition of such Action or resolution of such
Claim.

(d) For a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, Parent or the Surviving Corporation will maintain in effect the current
directors’ and officers’ liability and fiduciary liability insurance policies covering the Indemnified Parties (but may substitute
therefor other policies of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions that are no less advantageous to
the Indemnified Parties so long as that substitution does not result in gaps or lapses in coverage) with respect to matters occurring on
or before the Effective Time. Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation will be required to pay annual premiums in excess of
300% of the last annual premiums paid therefor prior to the date hereof and will purchase the maximum amount of coverage that
can be obtained for that amount if the coverage described in this Section 7.10(d) would cost in excess of that amount.

(e) If Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Company or any of their respective successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges with or into any other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation, partnership or other
entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person,
then, and in each such case, proper provision will be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Company, as
applicable, assume the obligations set forth in this Section 7.10.

(f) Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation and, from and after the Second Step Merger, the Surviving Company, to
perform all of the obligations of the Surviving Corporation under this Section 7.10.

(g) This Section 7.10 survives the consummation of the Merger and the Second Step Merger and is intended to be for the
benefit of, and to be enforceable by, the Indemnified Parties and the Indemnitees and their respective heirs and personal
representatives, and will be binding on the Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Company and their respective successors and
assigns.

7.11   Notification of Certain Matters.   The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice
to the Company, to the extent in each case it obtains Knowledge thereof, of: (i) any notice or other communication received by such
Party or its Subsidiaries from any Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby or from any
Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, if the
subject matter of such communication or the failure of such Party to obtain such consent is reasonably likely to be material to the
Company, Parent or the Surviving Corporation or to materially impede or delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby; (ii) any actions, suits, claims, investigations or proceedings commenced or threatened against, relating to or involving or
otherwise affecting such Party or any of its Subsidiaries and that relate to the Merger; (iii) any inaccuracy of any representation or
warranty of the Company or Parent, as applicable, contained herein at any time during the term hereof; (iv) the discovery of any fact

occurrence or non-occurrence of which, would result in the failure to be satisfied of any of the conditions to the Closing in Article
VIII; and (v) any material failure of such Party to comply with or satisfy any covenant or agreement to be complied with or satisfied
by it hereby which would result in the failure to be satisfied of any of the conditions to the Closing in Article VIII. In the case of
clauses (iii), (iv) and (v), however, the failure to comply with this Section 7.11 shall not result in the failure to be satisfied of any of
the conditions to the Closing in Article VIII, or give rise to any right to terminate this Agreement under Article IX, if the underlying
fact, circumstance, event or failure would not in and of itself give rise to such failure or right.

7.12   Section 16 Matters.   Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Company will take all such steps as may be required (to
the extent permitted under applicable Law) to cause any dispositions of Company Common Shares (including derivative securities
with respect to Company Common Shares) resulting from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who
is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company, or will become subject to
such reporting requirements with respect to the Surviving Corporation, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the
Exchange Act.

7.13   Employee Benefits.   

(a) From the Effective Time through December 31, 2017, Parent will, or will cause its Affiliates to, provide each of the
Employees who remains in the active employment of Parent or any of its Affiliates following the Effective Time (the “Continuing
Employees”) with (i) a base salary or wages that are no less than such Continuing Employee’s base salary or wages as of the
Effective Time, and (ii) a target bonus opportunity that is no less favorable than the opportunity provided to such Continuing
Employee as of the Effective Time.

(b) Parent will, or will cause its Affiliates to, honor all obligations under each Company Employee Benefit Plan listed on
Section 5.19(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule that remains in effect after the Effective Time, including any rights or benefits
arising as a result of the transactions contemplated under this Agreement (either alone or in combination with any other event,
including termination of employment), and Parent hereby agrees and acknowledges that the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement constitutes a “change of control” or a “change in control” or similar term, as the case may be, for
all purposes under each Company Employee Benefit Plan.

(c) Effective as of the Effective Time, Parent will, or will cause its Affiliates to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause
each material Parent Employee Benefit Plan (including all applicable vacation, severance and defined contribution retirement
benefit plans and programs) in which any Continuing Employee becomes eligible to participate to treat the prior service of such
Continuing Employee with any of the Company and its Affiliates as service rendered to Parent for all purposes (including vesting,
eligibility, level of benefit and benefit accrual purposes, but other than for purposes of benefit accrual under any defined benefit plan
or vesting under any equity compensation plan) to the extent that such service crediting does not violate any applicable Law or
result in duplication of benefits for the same period of service.

(d) Parent will, or will cause its Affiliates to, use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) waive any limitation on health and
welfare coverage of any Continuing Employee and his or her eligible dependents due to pre-existing conditions and/or waiting
periods, active employment requirements, and requirements to show evidence of good health under the applicable health and
welfare plan of Parent or any Affiliate of Parent to the extent such Continuing Employee and his or her eligible dependents are
covered under a health and welfare benefit plan of the Company or any of its Affiliates (as the case may be), and such conditions,
periods or requirements are satisfied or waived under such plan, immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) credit each
Continuing Employee and his or her eligible dependents with all deductible payments, co-payments and co-insurance paid by such
employee and covered dependents under the medical employee benefit plan of the Company or any of its Affiliates (as the case may
be) prior to the Effective Time during the year in which the Effective Time occurs for the purpose of determining the extent to
which any such employee and his or her dependents have satisfied their deductible and whether they have reached the out-of-pocket
maximum under any medical plan of Parent or any Affiliate of Parent for such year.

(e) For purposes of determining the number of vacation days and other paid time off to which each Continuing Employee is
entitled during the calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs, Parent will, or will cause its Affiliates to, assume and honor all
vacation and other paid time off days accrued or earned but not yet taken by such Continuing Employee as of the Effective Time to
the extent reflected on the Company’s books and records.

or its Subsidiaries, as applicable, and install Parent or one of its Subsidiaries, as obligor for each such letter of credit prior to the
termination of the Revolving Credit Facility.

trustee for the Notes) to, cooperate with one another in good faith to permit such Debt Transactions to be effected on such terms,
conditions and timing as reasonably requested by Parent, including if so requested by Parent, causing those Debt Transactions to be
consummated substantially concurrently with the Closing. For the avoidance of doubt, the consummation of any Debt Transaction
shall not be a condition to Closing.

incurred by the Company in connection with any Debt Transactions. In addition, Parent and Merger Sub shall, on a joint and several
basis, indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective officers, employees, partners, members,

right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.1(e) shall not be available to any party whose breach of any

willful material breach, or an intentional and willful material failure to perform, in each case that is the consequence of an act or
omission by a Party with the knowledge that the taking of, or failure to take, such act would, or would be reasonably expected to,
cause a material breach of this Agreement.

10.6   Entire Understanding; No Third-Party Beneficiaries.   This Agreement, together with the Confidentiality Agreement,
constitutes the entire agreement and understanding of the Parties with respect to the matters therein and supersedes all prior
agreements and understandings on such matters. The provisions of this Agreement are binding upon, inure to the benefit of the
Parties hereto and, subject to Section 10.5, their respective successors and assigns. No provision of this Agreement is intended to
confer any rights, benefits, remedies, obligations or liabilities hereunder upon any Person other than the Parties hereto and their
respective successors and assigns and, except as provided in Section 7.10 (which will be to the benefit of the Persons referred to in
such Section).

10.7   Severability.   Any provision of this Agreement which is invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction will, as to
that jurisdiction, be ineffective only to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability, without affecting in any way the
remaining provisions hereof in such jurisdiction or rendering that or any other provision of this Agreement invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any other jurisdiction.

10.8   Jurisdiction.   

(a) The Parties hereto agree that any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby
shall be heard and determined in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, the Superior Court of the State of Delaware (Complex Commercial
Division) or, if subject matter jurisdiction over the matter that is the subject of the action or proceeding is vested exclusively in the
federal courts of the United States of America, the federal court of the United States of America sitting in the district of Delaware),
and any appellate court from any thereof, and each of them irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of such
courts in any such action or proceeding and irrevocably waives the defense of an inconvenient forum and all other defenses to venue
in any such court in any such action or proceeding. The consents to jurisdiction and venue set forth in this Section 10.8 shall not
constitute general consents to service of process in the State of Delaware and shall have no effect for any purpose except as
provided in this paragraph and shall not be deemed to confer rights on any Person other than the Parties. The Parties agree that a
final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the
judgment or in any other manner provided by applicable Law; provided, however, that nothing in the foregoing shall restrict any
Party’s rights to seek any post-judgment relief regarding, or any appeal from, a final trial court judgment. The Parties agree that
process in any such action or proceeding may be served by registered mail or in any other manner permitted by the rules of the court
in which the action or proceeding is brought.

10.9   Waiver of Jury Trial.   To the extent not prohibited by applicable Law that cannot be waived, each Party hereby
irrevocably waives and covenants that it will not assert (whether as plaintiff, defendant or otherwise) any right to trial by jury in any
forum in respect of any issue, claim, demand, action or cause of action arising in whole or in part under, related to, based on, or in
connection with, this Agreement or the subject matter hereof, whether now existing or hereafter arising and whether sounding in tort
or contract or otherwise. Any Party may file an original counterpart or a copy of this Section 10.9 with any court as written evidence
of the consent of each such Party to the waiver of its right to trial by jury.

10.10   No Recourse.   This Agreement may only be enforced against, and any claims or causes of action that may be based
upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement may only be made
against the entities that are expressly identified as parties hereto and no past, present or future Affiliate, director, officer, employee,
incorporator, member, manager, partner, stockholder, agent, attorney or other representative of any Party hereto has any liability for
any obligations or liabilities of the Parties to this Agreement or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, the
transactions contemplated hereby.

10.11   Specific Performance.   The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur and that the Parties would not have any
adequate remedy at law in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, in each case, in
accordance with this Section 10.11 in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or, if such court lacks subject matter
jurisdiction, any other court of the State of Delaware or, to the extent permitted by law, in a federal court sitting in the State of
Delaware, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. Each of the parties agrees that it
will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief as provided herein on the basis that (x)
either party has an adequate remedy at law or (y) an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason

right it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar instrument.

ANNEX B—OPINION OF GOLDMAN SACHS

PERSONAL AND CONFIDENTIAL

January 13, 2017

Board of Directors
Clayton Williams Energy, Inc.
6 Desta Drive, Suite 6500
Midland, TX 79705

Gentlemen:

You have requested our opinion as to the fairness from a financial point of view to the holders (other than Noble Energy, Inc.
(“Noble”) and its affiliates) of the outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.10 per share (the “Shares”), of Clayton
Williams Energy, Inc. (the “Company”) of the Aggregate Consideration (as defined below) to be paid to such holders pursuant to the
Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of January 13, 2017 (the “Agreement”), by and among Noble, Wild West Merger Sub, Inc.,
a wholly owned subsidiary of Noble (“Acquisition Sub”), NBL Permian LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Noble, and the
Company. The Agreement provides that Acquisition Sub will be merged with and into the Company and each outstanding Share
(other than (i) Shares owned by the Company or Noble or any of their respective wholly owned subsidiaries and (ii) Dissenting
Shares (as defined in the Agreement)) will be converted into the right to receive, at the election of the holder thereof, one of the
following forms of consideration: (i) 3.7222 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the “Noble Common Stock”), of
Noble, (ii) 2.7874 shares of Noble Common Stock and $34.75 in cash, or (iii) $138.39 in cash ((i), (ii) and (iii) taken in the
aggregate, the “Aggregate Consideration”), in each case subject to certain procedures and limitations contained in the Agreement, as
to which procedures and limitations we express no opinion.

Goldman, Sachs & Co. and its affiliates are engaged in advisory, underwriting and financing, principal investing, sales and
trading, research, investment management and other financial and non-financial activities and services for various persons and
entities. Goldman, Sachs & Co. and its affiliates and employees, and funds or other entities they manage or in which they invest or
have other economic interests or with which they co-invest, may at any time purchase, sell, hold or vote long or short positions and
investments in securities, derivatives, loans, commodities, currencies, credit default swaps and other financial instruments of the
Company, Noble, any of their respective affiliates and third parties, including Ares Management LLC (“Ares”), a significant
shareholder of the Company, and its affiliates and portfolio companies or any currency or commodity that may be involved in the
transaction contemplated by the Agreement (the “Transaction”). We have acted as financial advisor to the Company in connection
with, and have participated in certain of the negotiations leading to, the Transaction. We expect to receive fees for our services in
connection with the Transaction, all of which are contingent upon consummation of the Transaction, and the Company has agreed to
reimburse certain of our expenses arising, and indemnify us against certain liabilities that may arise, out of our engagement. We
have provided certain financial advisory and/or underwriting services to the Company and/or its affiliates from time to time for
which our Investment Banking Division has received, and may receive, compensation, including having acted as sole arranger with
respect to its term loan (aggregate principal amount $350 million) in March 2016; as financial advisor to the Company in connection
with its private placement of 5,051,100 Shares in July 2016; and as financial advisor to the Company in connection with its sale of
assets in the Giddings area in December 2016.

We also have provided certain financial advisory and/or underwriting services to Noble and/or its affiliates from time to time for
which our Investment Banking Division has received, and may receive, compensation, including having acted as joint book-running
manager with respect to the issuance of 24,150,000 shares of Noble Common Stock in February 2015. We also have provided
certain financial advisory and/or underwriting services to Ares and/or its affiliates and portfolio companies from time to time for
which our Investment Banking Division has received, and may receive, compensation, including having acted as joint lead arranger
with respect to a term loan (aggregate principal amount $720 million) for American Tire Distributors Inc., a portfolio company of
Ares, in March 2015; as joint lead arranger with respect to a term loan (aggregate principal amount $200 million) for CHG
Healthcare Services, a portfolio company of Ares, in May 2015; as co-manager with respect to a public offering by Ares of its
5.25% Senior Notes due 2025 (aggregate principal amount $325 million) in August 2015; as financial advisor to Ares on its sale of
the Allegheny Lock & Dam 8 and Allegheny Lock & Dam 9 hydro plants in September 2015; and as book runner with respect to a
term loan (aggregate principal amount $990 million) for CHG Healthcare Services in May 2016. We may also in the future provide
financial advisory and/or underwriting services to the Company and Noble and their respective affiliates and Ares and its affiliates
and portfolio companies for which our Investment Banking Division may receive compensation. Affiliates of Goldman, Sachs &
Co. also may have co-invested with Ares and its affiliates from time to time and may have invested in limited partnership units of
affiliates of Ares from time to time and may do so in the future.

In connection with this opinion, we have reviewed, among other things, the Agreement; annual reports to stockholders and
Annual Reports on Form 10-K of the Company and Noble for the five fiscal years ended December 31, 2015; certain interim reports
to stockholders and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q of the Company and Noble; certain other communications from the Company
and Noble to their respective stockholders; certain publicly available research analyst reports for the Company and Noble; and
certain internal financial analyses and forecasts for the Company prepared by its management, certain internal financial analyses and
forecasts for Noble stand alone prepared by its management, and certain financial analyses and forecasts for Noble pro forma for the
Transaction prepared by management of the Company, in each case, as approved for our use by the Company (collectively, the
“Forecasts”), including certain operating synergies projected by the management of the Company to result from the Transaction, as
approved for our use by the Company (the “Synergies”). We have also held discussions with members of the senior managements of
the Company and Noble regarding their assessment of the strategic rationale for, and the potential benefits of, the Transaction and
the past and current business operations, financial condition and future prospects of Noble and with members of the senior
management of the Company regarding their assessment of the past and current business operations, financial condition and future
prospects of the Company; reviewed the reported price and trading activity for the Shares and shares of Noble Common Stock;
compared certain financial and stock market information for the Company and Noble with similar information for certain other
companies the securities of which are publicly traded; reviewed the financial terms of certain recent business combinations in the oil
and gas industry; and performed such other studies and analyses, and considered such other factors, as we deemed appropriate.

For purposes of rendering this opinion, we have, with your consent, relied upon and assumed the accuracy and completeness of
all of the financial, legal, regulatory, tax, accounting and other information provided to, discussed with or reviewed by, us, without
assuming any responsibility for independent verification thereof. In that regard, we have assumed with your consent that the
Forecasts, including the Synergies, have been reasonably prepared on a basis reflecting the best currently available estimates and
judgments of the management of the Company. We have not made an independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets and liabilities
(including any contingent, derivative or other off-balance-sheet assets and liabilities) of the Company or Noble or any of their
respective subsidiaries and we have not been furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal. We have assumed that all
governmental, regulatory or other consents and approvals necessary for the consummation of the Transaction will be obtained
without any adverse effect on the Company or Noble or on the expected benefits of the Transaction in any way meaningful to our
analysis. We have assumed that the Transaction will be consummated on the terms set forth in the Agreement, without the waiver or
modification of any term or condition the effect of which would be in any way meaningful to our analysis.

Our opinion does not address the underlying business decision of the Company to engage in the Transaction, or the relative
merits of the Transaction as compared to any strategic alternatives that may be available to the Company; nor does it address any
legal, regulatory, tax or accounting matters. This opinion addresses only the fairness from a financial point of view to the holders
(other than Noble and its affiliates) of Shares, as of the date hereof, of the Aggregate Consideration to be paid to such holders
pursuant to the Agreement. We do not express any view on, and our opinion does not address, any other term or aspect of the
Agreement or Transaction or any term or aspect of any other agreement or instrument contemplated by the Agreement or entered
into or amended in connection with the Transaction, including, the fairness of the Transaction to, or any consideration received in
connection therewith by, the holders of any other class of securities, creditors, or other constituencies of the Company; nor as to the
fairness of the amount or nature of any compensation to be paid or payable to any of the officers, directors or employees of the
Company, or class of such persons, in connection with the Transaction, whether relative to the Aggregate Consideration to be paid
to the holders (other than Noble and its affiliates) of Shares pursuant to the Agreement or otherwise. We are not expressing any
opinion as to the prices at which shares of Noble Common Stock will trade at any time or as to the impact of the Transaction on the
solvency or viability of the Company or Noble or the ability of the Company or Noble to pay their respective obligations when they
come due. Our opinion is necessarily based on economic, monetary, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information
made available to us as of, the date hereof and we assume no responsibility for updating, revising or reaffirming this opinion based
on circumstances, developments or events occurring after the date hereof. Our advisory services and the opinion expressed herein
are provided for the information and assistance of the Board of Directors of the Company in connection with its consideration of the
Transaction and such opinion does not constitute a recommendation as to how any holder of Shares should vote or make any
election with respect to such Transaction or how any holder of Shares should vote with respect to the Transaction or any other
matter. This opinion has been approved by a fairness committee of Goldman, Sachs & Co.

Based upon and subject to the foregoing, it is our opinion that, as of the date hereof, the Aggregate Consideration to be paid to
the holders (other than Noble and its affiliates) of Shares pursuant to the Agreement is fair from a financial point of view to such
holders.

Very truly yours,

(a) Any stockholder of a corporation of this State who holds shares of stock on the date of the making of a demand pursuant to
subsection (d) of this section with respect to such shares, who continuously holds such shares through the effective date of the
merger or consolidation, who has otherwise complied with subsection (d) of this section and who has neither voted in favor of the
merger or consolidation nor consented thereto in writing pursuant to § 228 of this title shall be entitled to an appraisal by the Court
of Chancery of the fair value of the stockholder's shares of stock under the circumstances described in subsections (b) and (c) of this
section. As used in this section, the word “stockholder” means a holder of record of stock in a corporation; the words “stock” and
“share” mean and include what is ordinarily meant by those words; and the words “depository receipt” mean a receipt or other
instrument issued by a depository representing an interest in 1 or more shares, or fractions thereof, solely of stock of a corporation,
which stock is deposited with the depository.

(b) Appraisal rights shall be available for the shares of any class or series of stock of a constituent corporation in a merger or
consolidation to be effected pursuant to § 251 (other than a merger effected pursuant to § 251(g) of this title and, subject to
paragraph (b)(3) of this section, § 251(h) of this title), § 252, § 254, § 255, § 256, § 257, § 258, § 263 or § 264 of this title:

agreement of merger or consolidation, were either: (i) listed on a national securities exchange or (ii) held of record by more
than 2,000 holders; and further provided that no appraisal rights shall be available for any shares of stock of the constituent
corporation surviving a merger if the merger did not require for its approval the vote of the stockholders of the surviving
corporation as provided in § 251(f) of this title.

(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1) of this section, appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the shares of
any class or series of stock of a constituent corporation if the holders thereof are required by the terms of an agreement of
merger or consolidation pursuant to §§ 251, 252, 254, 255, 256, 257, 258, 263 and 264 of this title to accept for such stock
anything except:

a. Shares of stock of the corporation surviving or resulting from such merger or consolidation, or depository receipts
in respect thereof;

b. Shares of stock of any other corporation, or depository receipts in respect thereof, which shares of stock (or

the subsidiary Delaware corporation.

set forth in subsections (d) and (e) of this section, shall apply as nearly as practicable, with the word “amendment” substituted
for the words “merger or consolidation,” and the word “corporation” substituted for the words “constituent corporation” and/or

TABLE OF CONTENTS

incorporation, any merger or consolidation in which the corporation is a constituent corporation or the sale of all or substantially all
of the assets of the corporation. If the certificate of incorporation contains such a provision, the provisions of this section, including
those set forth in subsections (d), (e), and (g) of this section, shall apply as nearly as is practicable.

(d) Appraisal rights shall be perfected as follows:

(1) If a proposed merger or consolidation for which appraisal rights are provided under this section is to be submitted for
approval at a meeting of stockholders, the corporation, not less than 20 days prior to the meeting, shall notify each of its
stockholders who was such on the record date for notice of such meeting (or such members who received notice in accordance
with § 255(c) of this title) with respect to shares for which appraisal rights are available pursuant to subsection (b) or (c) of this
section that appraisal rights are available for any or all of the shares of the constituent corporations, and shall include in such
notice a copy of this section and, if 1 of the constituent corporations is a nonstock corporation, a copy of § 114 of this title.
Each stockholder electing to demand the appraisal of such stockholder's shares shall deliver to the corporation, before the
taking of the vote on the merger or consolidation, a written demand for appraisal of such stockholder's shares. Such demand
will be sufficient if it reasonably informs the corporation of the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends
thereby to demand the appraisal of such stockholder's shares. A proxy or vote against the merger or consolidation shall not
constitute such a demand. A stockholder electing to take such action must do so by a separate written demand as herein
provided. Within 10 days after the effective date of such merger or consolidation, the surviving or resulting corporation shall
notify each stockholder of each constituent corporation who has complied with this subsection and has not voted in favor of or
consented to the merger or consolidation of the date that the merger or consolidation has become effective; or

(2) If the merger or consolidation was approved pursuant to § 228, § 251(h), § 253, or § 267 of this title, then either a
constituent corporation before the effective date of the merger or consolidation or the surviving or resulting corporation within
10 days thereafter shall notify each of the holders of any class or series of stock of such constituent corporation who are
entitled to appraisal rights of the approval of the merger or consolidation and that appraisal rights are available for any or all
shares of such class or series of stock of such constituent corporation, and shall include in such notice a copy of this section
and, if 1 of the constituent corporations is a nonstock corporation, a copy of § 114 of this title. Such notice may, and, if given
on or after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, shall, also notify such stockholders of the effective date of the
merger or consolidation. Any stockholder entitled to appraisal rights may, within 20 days after the date of mailing of such
notice or, in the case of a merger approved pursuant to § 251(h) of this title, within the later of the consummation of the offer
contemplated by § 251(h) of this title and 20 days after the date of mailing of such notice, demand in writing from the
surviving or resulting corporation the appraisal of such holder's shares. Such demand will be sufficient if it reasonably informs
the corporation of the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to demand the appraisal of such
holder's shares. If such notice did not notify stockholders of the effective date of the merger or consolidation, either (i) each
such constituent corporation shall send a second notice before the effective date of the merger or consolidation notifying each
of the holders of any class or series of stock of such constituent corporation that are entitled to appraisal rights of the effective
date of the merger or consolidation or (ii) the surviving or resulting corporation shall send such a second notice to all such
holders on or within 10 days after such effective date; provided, however, that if such second notice is sent more than 20 days
following the sending of the first notice or, in the case of a merger approved pursuant to § 251(h) of this title, later than the
later of the consummation of the offer contemplated by § 251(h) of this title and 20 days following the sending of the first
notice, such second notice need only be sent to each stockholder who is entitled to appraisal rights and who has demanded
appraisal of such holder's shares in accordance with this subsection. An affidavit of the secretary or assistant secretary or of the
transfer agent of the corporation that is required to give either notice that such notice has been given shall, in the absence of
fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein. For purposes of determining the stockholders entitled to receive either
notice, each constituent corporation may fix, in advance, a record date that shall be not more than 10 days prior to the date the
notice is given, provided, that if the notice is given on or after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, the record date
shall be such effective date. If no record date is fixed and the notice is given prior to the effective date, the record date shall be
the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the notice is given.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

(e) Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, the surviving or resulting corporation or any
stockholder who has complied with subsections (a) and (d) of this section hereof and who is otherwise entitled to appraisal rights,
may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Court of Chancery demanding a determination of the value of the
stock of all such stockholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or
consolidation, any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party shall
have the right to withdraw such stockholder's demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the merger or
consolidation. Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, any stockholder who has complied with the
requirements of subsections (a) and (d) of this section hereof, upon written request, shall be entitled to receive from the corporation
surviving the merger or resulting from the consolidation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor
of the merger or consolidation and with respect to which demands for appraisal have been received and the aggregate number of
holders of such shares. Such written statement shall be mailed to the stockholder within 10 days after such stockholder's written
request for such a statement is received by the surviving or resulting corporation or within 10 days after expiration of the period for
delivery of demands for appraisal under subsection (d) of this section hereof, whichever is later. Notwithstanding subsection (a) of
this section, a person who is the beneficial owner of shares of such stock held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of
such person may, in such person's own name, file a petition or request from the corporation the statement described in this
subsection.

(f) Upon the filing of any such petition by a stockholder, service of a copy thereof shall be made upon the surviving or resulting
corporation, which shall within 20 days after such service file in the office of the Register in Chancery in which the petition was
filed a duly verified list containing the names and addresses of all stockholders who have demanded payment for their shares and
with whom agreements as to the value of their shares have not been reached by the surviving or resulting corporation. If the petition
shall be filed by the surviving or resulting corporation, the petition shall be accompanied by such a duly verified list. The Register in
Chancery, if so ordered by the Court, shall give notice of the time and place fixed for the hearing of such petition by registered or
certified mail to the surviving or resulting corporation and to the stockholders shown on the list at the addresses therein stated. Such
notice shall also be given by 1 or more publications at least 1 week before the day of the hearing, in a newspaper of general
circulation published in the City of Wilmington, Delaware or such publication as the Court deems advisable. The forms of the
notices by mail and by publication shall be approved by the Court, and the costs thereof shall be borne by the surviving or resulting
corporation.

(g) At the hearing on such petition, the Court shall determine the stockholders who have complied with this section and who
have become entitled to appraisal rights. The Court may require the stockholders who have demanded an appraisal for their shares
and who hold stock represented by certificates to submit their certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon
of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings; and if any stockholder fails to comply with such direction, the Court may dismiss the
proceedings as to such stockholder. If immediately before the merger or consolidation the shares of the class or series of stock of the
constituent corporation as to which appraisal rights are available were listed on a national securities exchange, the Court shall
dismiss the proceedings as to all holders of such shares who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless (1) the total number of
shares entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of the class or series eligible for appraisal, (2) the value of the
consideration provided in the merger or consolidation for such total number of shares exceeds $1 million, or (3) the merger was
approved pursuant to § 253 or § 267 of this title.

(h) After the Court determines the stockholders entitled to an appraisal, the appraisal proceeding shall be conducted in
accordance with the rules of the Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings. Through such
proceeding the Court shall determine the fair value of the shares exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment
or expectation of the merger or consolidation, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair
value. In determining such fair value, the Court shall take into account all relevant factors. Unless the Court in its discretion
determines otherwise for good cause shown, and except as provided in this subsection, interest from the effective date of the merger
through the date of payment of the judgment shall be compounded quarterly and shall accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve
discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the effective date of the merger
and the date of payment of the judgment. At any time before the entry of judgment in the proceedings, the surviving corporation
may pay to each stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which case interest shall accrue thereafter as provided herein
only upon the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair value of the shares as determined by the
Court, and (2) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time. Upon application by the surviving or resulting corporation or by
any stockholder entitled to participate in the appraisal

proceeding, the Court may, in its discretion, proceed to trial upon the appraisal prior to the final determination of the stockholders
entitled to an appraisal. Any stockholder whose name appears on the list filed by the surviving or resulting corporation pursuant to
subsection (f) of this section and who has submitted such stockholder's certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery, if such is
required, may participate fully in all proceedings until it is finally determined that such stockholder is not entitled to appraisal rights
under this section.

(i) The Court shall direct the payment of the fair value of the shares, together with interest, if any, by the surviving or resulting
corporation to the stockholders entitled thereto. Payment shall be so made to each such stockholder, in the case of holders of
uncertificated stock forthwith, and the case of holders of shares represented by certificates upon the surrender to the corporation of
the certificates representing such stock. The Court's decree may be enforced as other decrees in the Court of Chancery may be
enforced, whether such surviving or resulting corporation be a corporation of this State or of any state.

(j) The costs of the proceeding may be determined by the Court and taxed upon the parties as the Court deems equitable in the
circumstances. Upon application of a stockholder, the Court may order all or a portion of the expenses incurred by any stockholder
in connection with the appraisal proceeding, including, without limitation, reasonable attorney's fees and the fees and expenses of
experts, to be charged pro rata against the value of all the shares entitled to an appraisal.

(k) From and after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, no stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights as
provided in subsection (d) of this section shall be entitled to vote such stock for any purpose or to receive payment of dividends or
other distributions on the stock (except dividends or other distributions payable to stockholders of record at a date which is prior to
the effective date of the merger or consolidation); provided, however, that if no petition for an appraisal shall be filed within the
time provided in subsection (e) of this section, or if such stockholder shall deliver to the surviving or resulting corporation a written
withdrawal of such stockholder's demand for an appraisal and an acceptance of the merger or consolidation, either within 60 days
after the effective date of the merger or consolidation as provided in subsection (e) of this section or thereafter with the written
approval of the corporation, then the right of such stockholder to an appraisal shall cease. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no
appraisal proceeding in the Court of Chancery shall be dismissed as to any stockholder without the approval of the Court, and such
approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Court deems just; provided, however that this provision shall not affect the
right of any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw
such stockholder's demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the merger or consolidation within 60 days after the
effective date of the merger or consolidation, as set forth in subsection (e) of this section.

(l) The shares of the surviving or resulting corporation to which the shares of such objecting stockholders would have been
converted had they assented to the merger or consolidation shall have the status of authorized and unissued shares of the surviving
or resulting corporation.
