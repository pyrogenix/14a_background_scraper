This Schedule 14D-9 relates to the Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on
January 16, 2018 (together with any amendments and supplements thereto, the “Schedule TO”) by (i) Mallinckrodt plc, an Irish public limited company
(“Mallinckrodt”), and (ii) Sun Acquisition Co., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Mallinckrodt (“Sun Acquisition”). The
Schedule TO relates to the tender offer to acquire all of the outstanding Shares for $18.00 per Share, to be paid to the seller in cash, without interest and
subject to any applicable withholding taxes (the “Offer Price”), upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Offer to Purchase, dated
January 16, 2018 (as it may be amended or supplemented from time to time, the “Offer to Purchase”), and the related Letter of Transmittal (as it may be
amended or supplemented from time to time, the “Letter of Transmittal” and together with the Offer to Purchase, the “Offer”).

The Offer to Purchase and the Letter of Transmittal are being mailed to our stockholders together with this Schedule 14D-9 and filed as Exhibits

Section 251(h) of the DGCL and effected without a vote of Sucampo stockholders. In the Merger, each Share outstanding immediately prior to the
effective time of the Merger (the “Effective Time”) (other than Shares held (i) by Sucampo (including any held in Sucampo’s treasury) or by
Mallinckrodt or Sun Acquisition, which Shares will be canceled and will cease to exist, (ii) by any wholly owned subsidiary of Sucampo or any wholly
owned subsidiary of Mallinckrodt (other than Sun Acquisition), which Shares will be converted into such number of shares of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation so as to maintain relative ownership percentages or (iii) by any stockholders who validly exercise appraisal rights under
Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to such Shares) will be automatically converted into the right to receive the Offer Price (or any greater price per
Share paid in the Offer), without interest thereon (the “Merger Consideration”) and less any applicable withholding taxes. Upon the Effective Time,
Sucampo will cease to be a publicly traded company and will become wholly owned by Mallinckrodt. The Offer, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement are collectively referred to as the “Transactions.” The Merger Agreement is filed as Exhibit (e)(1) hereto and is
incorporated herein by reference.

The Merger Agreement also provides that, at the Effective Time, each Stock Option that is then outstanding as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time will become fully vested and exercisable effective immediately prior to, and contingent upon, the Effective Time. As of the Effective
Time, by virtue of the Merger, each Stock Option that is then outstanding and unexercised as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, will be
cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, less applicable withholding taxes, equal to the product of (i) the total number of
Shares subject to such Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (ii) the excess, if any, of (A) the Merger Consideration over
(B) the exercise price payable per Share under such Stock Option. If the exercise price of any Stock Option is equal to or greater than the Merger
Consideration, such Stock Option will be cancelled for no consideration at the Effective Time.

In addition, the Merger Agreement provides that, at the Effective Time, each RSU that is then outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time, whether vested or unvested, will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive cash in an amount, less any applicable withholding taxes,
equal to (i) the total number of Shares underlying such RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time (in the case of performance stock awards,
determined based on “target” performance levels) multiplied by (ii) the Merger Consideration.

The initial expiration date of the Offer is at 8:00 a.m., Eastern Time on February 13, 2018, subject to extension in certain circumstances as
permitted by the Merger Agreement and applicable law. A copy of the Merger Agreement is filed as Exhibit (e)(1) to this Schedule 14D-9 and is

(a) Arrangements between Sucampo and its Executive Officers, Directors and Affiliates.

In considering the recommendation of our board of directors to tender Shares in the Offer, stockholders should be aware that our executive
officers, members of our Board of Directors and affiliates may be deemed to have interests in the execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement and
all of the Transactions, including the Offer and the Merger, that may be different from or in addition to those of our stockholders, generally. Our board of
directors was aware of these interests and considered them, among other matters, in reaching its decision to approve the Merger Agreement and the
Transactions. As described in more detail below, these interests include:
 

 •  the accelerated vesting and cash settlement of outstanding Stock Options and RSUs in connection with the Merger;
 

 
•  the acceleration of vesting and settlement of RSUs held by certain executive officers in December, 2017, and the payment of 2017 annual

bonuses during December, 2017;
 

 
•  the receipt of payments and benefits by certain executive officers under individual employment agreements upon qualifying terminations of

employment;
 

 •  the receipt of transaction bonuses by the executive officers contingent upon the consummation of the Transactions; and
 

 •  the entitlement to indemnification benefits in favor of directors and officers of Sucampo.

For further information with respect to the arrangements between Sucampo and its executive officers, directors and affiliates described in this Item
3, as well as other arrangements between Sucampo and its executive officers, directors, and affiliates, please see the Proxy Statement, including the
information under the headings “Stock Ownership Information,” “Related Party Transactions” and “Executive Compensation.”

Outstanding Shares Held by Directors and Executive Officers

If the executive officers and directors of Sucampo who own Shares tender their Shares for purchase pursuant to the Offer, they will receive the
same cash consideration on the same terms and conditions as the other stockholders of Sucampo. As of December 31, 2017, the executive officers and
directors of Sucampo beneficially owned, in the aggregate, 1,669,091 Shares (which, for clarity, excludes shares of capital stock of Sucampo issuable
upon the exercise of outstanding Stock Options or settlement of outstanding RSUs, unless such Stock Options are exercisable or RSUs settle within 60

Treatment of Stock Options and RSUs

Under the Merger Agreement, at the Effective Time, each Stock Option that is then outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will
become fully vested and exercisable effective immediately prior to, and contingent upon, the Effective Time. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger, each Stock Option that is then outstanding and unexercised as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will be cancelled and converted into
the right to receive an amount in cash, less applicable withholding taxes, equal to the product of (i) the total number of Shares subject to such Stock
Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (ii) the excess, if any, of (A) the Merger Consideration over (B) the exercise price payable
per Share under such Stock Option. If the exercise price of any Stock Option is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration, such Stock Option
will be cancelled for no consideration at the Effective Time.

Under the Merger Agreement, at the Effective Time, each RSU that is then outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether
vested or unvested, will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive cash in an amount, less any applicable withholding taxes, equal to (i) the
total number of Shares underlying such RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time (in the case of performance stock awards, determined based on
“target” performance levels) multiplied by (ii) the Merger Consideration.

On December 22, 2017, in connection with the Merger Agreement and in order to assist with tax planning to avoid subjecting certain payments
otherwise payable in connection with the Transactions to excise taxes under the Internal Revenue Code, our board of directors approved the immediate
accelerated vesting of all outstanding RSUs held by each of Max Donley, Alex Driggs and Peter Kiener. The Shares underlying each such accelerated
RSU were settled on December 28, 2017 and delivered to the executive officers on December 29, 2017.

The table below sets forth, for each of our executive officers and directors holding Stock Options with exercise prices below the Offer Price
(“In-the-Money Options”) and/or RSUs as of December 31, 2017, (i) the aggregate number of Shares subject to such In-the-Money Options and RSUs;
(ii) the value of cash amounts payable in respect of such In-the-Money Options and RSUs on a pre-tax basis at the Effective Time (or in the case of the
RSUs accelerated on December 22, 2017, December 28, 2017), calculated by (a) in the case of Stock Options, multiplying (A) the excess of the Merger
Consideration over the respective per share exercise prices of the applicable Stock Options by (B) the number of Shares subject to such Stock Options
and (b) in the case of RSUs, multiplying the Merger Consideration (or, in the case of RSUs accelerated on December 22, 2017, $17.98, the closing per
Share price on December 28, 2017) by the number of Shares subject to such RSUs (in the case of performance stock awards, determined based on
“target” performance levels).

up to 15% of their compensation for the purchase of our Shares at a price per Share equal to the lower of (i) 85% of the fair market value of our Shares
on the first date of an offering and (ii) 85% of the fair market value of our Shares on the last date of the offering period.

The ESPP’s final 12-month offering period commenced on January 1, 2017 and ended on December 31, 2017. Under the terms of the Merger
Agreement, (i) no offering period or purchase period will be authorized or commence on or after the date of the Merger Agreement, (ii) no additional
purchase rights shall be granted under the ESPP on and following the date of the Merger Agreement, and (iii) the ESPP will terminate in its entirety as
of the Effective Time.

Employment Arrangements

Each of our executive officers is entitled to certain severance and change in control benefits pursuant to the terms of his employment agreement,
as described below. The Transactions will constitute a change in control under these agreements. However, under the Merger Agreement, the vesting of
all of the Company’s outstanding unvested equity awards (including any performance-based awards) will be accelerated in connection with the Offer
and the Merger, and any provisions in the agreements below related to the acceleration of the vesting of equity awards in connection with a change in
control will be superseded by the provisions of the Merger Agreement.

Peter Greenleaf.

Mr. Greenleaf’s employment agreement provides that he may be terminated by us for any reason upon written notice. However, the employment
agreement provides for payments to him in the event of the termination of his employment in specified situations.

Termination within 12 months following a change in control. If, in advance of the closing or within 12 months following a change in control of our
company, we terminate Mr. Greenleaf’s employment without cause or Mr. Greenleaf terminates his employment due to a material diminution of his role,
material diminution of status or diminution of reporting structure, he will be entitled to receive a lump sum severance payment equal to (i) 24 months of
his then-current base salary, plus (ii) an amount equal to 200% of his target bonus for the year in which his employment is terminated. He also will
receive reimbursement of his COBRA premiums until the earliest of (a) 24 months from separation and (b) the date he becomes eligible for insurance
coverage from another source. In addition to the cash severance payments described above, 100% of his then-outstanding stock options and other equity
awards that have a time-based vesting condition will become vested and exercisable, as applicable and any then-outstanding stock options and other
equity awards with a performance vesting condition will immediately vest and may be exercised only to the extent the performance targets have been
achieved or would be achieved by such change in control.

These severance payments and benefits are subject to Mr. Greenleaf executing, delivering and not revoking a release of claims in favor of our
company.

The estimated amounts that would be payable to our executive officers who are not named executive officers under their respective employment
agreements if the Effective Time were to occur and they were to experience a qualifying termination on December 31, 2017 is as follows:

For purposes of Mr. Greenleaf’s employment agreement and the employment agreements with each of the other executives:
 

 

•  “cause” generally means the executive’s (i) gross neglect, willful failure, or refusal to perform his duties and/or responsibilities (other than
as a result of death or disability); (ii) perpetration of an intentional and knowing fraud against or affecting Sucampo or any customer,
supplier, client, agent or employee thereof; (iii) willful or intentional act that could reasonably be expected to injure the reputation, financial
condition, business or business relationships of Sucampo or the executive officer’s reputation or business relationships; (iv) conviction
(including conviction on a nolo contendere plea) of a felony or any crime involving fraud, dishonesty or moral turpitude; (v) material breach
of the employment agreement; (vi) failure or refusal to perform the executive officer’s job duties and/or responsibilities at an acceptable
level; and (vii) refusal to execute a modified employment agreement offered by Sucampo which does not include any unilateral changes to
the provisions related to base salary, termination, change of control, separation benefits, unilateral changes or arbitration rights; and

 

 

•  “change in control” generally means (i) the acquisition by any person of beneficial ownership of 50% or more of the outstanding shares of
Sucampo voting securities; (ii) Sucampo is the non-surviving party in a merger; (iii) Sucampo sells all or substantially all of its assets,
provided that no “change in control” will be deemed to have occurred merely as the result of a refinancing by Sucampo or as a result of
Sucampo’s insolvency or the appointment of a conservator; or (iv) our board of directors, in its sole and absolute discretion, determines that
there has been a sufficient change in the share ownership or ownership of the voting power of Sucampo’s voting securities to constitute a
change of effective ownership or control.

Annual Incentive Plan

Under the terms of the employment agreements, each of our executive officers has the opportunity to earn an annual performance bonus calculated
based on the achievement of specific corporate and individual performance goals, with each executive officer being assigned a target bonus opportunity,
calculated as a percentage of that individual’s 2017 base salary, based on the individual’s role and title in the company. For each of our executive officers
other than our Chief Executive Officer, the achievement of corporate performance goals represents 70% of the total bonus potential and the achievement
of individual performance goals represents the remaining 30%. The annual bonus for our Chief Executive Officer is based solely on the achievement of
corporate performance goals.

On December 22, 2017, our board of directors approved the payment of cash bonuses to each of our executive officers, pursuant to the terms of
the 2017 annual incentive plan, in the amounts set forth below (the “AIP Payments”). In approving the AIP Payments, our compensation committee and
our board of directors carefully reviewed company and individual executive officer performance against the pre-established goals for 2017 and
determined that, it was appropriate to pay the bonuses based on 140% achievement of the corporate goals and 100% achievement of the individual
goals, as applicable. The AIP Payments were paid on December 29, 2017. Our board approved the payment of the bonuses before year end for tax
planning purposes

Golden Parachute Compensation

This section sets forth the information required by Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K regarding the compensation for each of our named executive
officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the Offer and the Merger. This compensation is referred to as “golden parachute” compensation by the
applicable SEC disclosure rules. The amounts set forth in the table are estimates based on multiple assumptions that may or may not actually occur,
including assumptions described in this Schedule 14D-9 and in the footnotes to the table. As a result, the actual amounts, if any, which a named
executive officer receives may materially differ from the amounts set forth in the table.

The table below assumes that (1) the Effective Time will occur on December 31, 2017; (2) the employment of each named executive officer will
be terminated at the Effective Time in a manner entitling the named executive officer to receive severance payments and benefits under their respective
employment agreements; (3) no named executive officer receives any additional equity grants or exercises any Stock Options on or prior to the Effective
Time; and (4) no named executive officer enters into new agreements or is otherwise legally entitled to, prior to the Effective Time, additional
compensation or benefits. For a narrative description of the terms and conditions applicable to the payments quantified in the table below, see the
preceding subsections of this “Item 3. Past Contacts, Transactions, Negotiations and Agreements—Arrangements between Sucampo and its Executive
Officers, Directors and Affiliates” above. The amounts shown in the table do not include the payments or benefits that would have been earned on or
prior to the Effective Time, or any amounts associated with equity awards that vested, pursuant to their terms, on or prior to the Effective Time; or the
value of payments or benefits that are not based on or otherwise related to the Transactions. The amounts in

(1) Under relevant SEC rules, we are required to provide information in this table with respect to our “named executive officers,” who are
generally the individuals whose compensation was required to be reported in the summary compensation table of our most recent proxy statement.
While disclosure was required in that proxy statement with respect to Andrew P. Smith, our former Chief Financial Officer, and Matthias Alder, our
former Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary, Messrs. Smith and Alder resigned from employment with Sucampo
effective as of March 20, 2017 and June 30, 2017, respectively, and neither will receive any compensation that is based on or otherwise relates to the
Transactions.

(2) The amount listed in this column represents the pre-tax value of the severance payments (salary payment and a bonus payment) that
would be paid pursuant to a qualifying termination of employment under each named executive officer’s employment agreement as described in more
detail above under “—Employment Arrangements.” These benefits are “double trigger benefits.” For Mr. Greenleaf, amount equals two times his current
base salary and AIP target bonus. In the case of the other executive officers, amount equals 18 months of their current base salary plus 150% of their
AIP target bonus.

(3) The amount listed in this column represents the aggregate pre-tax amount payable pursuant to the Merger Agreement, as a result of the
Transactions, on a “single-trigger” basis, to each named executive officer in respect of unvested Stock Options and RSUs held as of December 31, 2017,
the latest practicable date before the filing of this Schedule 14D-9, as set forth in more detail in the tables above under “Outstanding Company Options
and RSUs Held by Directors and Executive Officers.” With respect to unvested Stock Options, this amount represents the value of the cash payable in
respect to such Stock Options, calculated on a pre-tax basis as of the Effective Time by multiplying (a) the excess of the Merger Consideration over the
respective per Share exercise prices of the Stock Options by (b) the number of unvested Shares subject to such Stock Options. With respect to the
unvested RSUs held by Mr. Greenleaf, this amount represents the value of the cash payable in respect of such RSUs, calculated on a pre-tax basis by
multiplying the Merger Consideration by the number of unvested Shares subject to such RSUs as of December 31, 2017. With respect to Messrs. Donley
and Kiener, this amount represents the pre-tax value of the Shares received by such named executive officer upon the settlement of his unvested Shares
subject to the RSUs that were accelerated on December 22, 2017 and settled on December 28, 2017 as described above under the section titled “—
Treatment of Stock Options and RSUs.”

(4) The amounts listed in this column represents the pre-tax value of the reimbursement of health care premiums which would be due
pursuant to a qualifying termination of employment under the respective employment agreements as described in more detail above under “Employment
Arrangements.” These benefits are “double trigger benefits” in that they require both the occurrence of the Transactions and a termination of
employment in order to be payable.

(5) For each of Messrs. Greenleaf, Donley and Kiener, respectively, the amounts listed in this column include the $1,006,200, $475,960 and
$470,283 “single trigger” Transaction Bonuses described above under the section titled “Transaction Bonuses” and the $693,599, $271,117 and
$281,572 “single trigger” accelerated AIP Payments described above under the section titled “—Annual Incentive Plan.”

Employee Benefits

Under the Merger Agreement, Parent has agreed that for a period of one year following the Effective Time, Parent will provide, or cause to be
provided, to each employee of Sucampo, including the executive officers, who is employed by Sucampo as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
and who continues to be employed by the Surviving Corporation (or any Affiliate thereof) during such one-year period (each, a “Continuing Employee”)
a base salary (or base wages, as the case may be) and short-term cash incentive compensation opportunities, each of which is no less favorable than the
base salary (or base wages, as the case may be) and short-term cash incentive compensation opportunities provided to such Continuing Employee
immediately prior to Effective Time, and commission opportunities and benefits (including severance benefits and other employee benefits) that are
substantially comparable in the aggregate to the commission opportunities and benefits (including severance benefits and other employee benefits)
provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to Effective Time.

Potential for Future Arrangements

To our knowledge, except for certain agreements described in this Schedule 14D-9 (or in the documents incorporated by reference herein) between
Sucampo and its executive officers and directors, no employment, equity contribution or other agreement, arrangement or understanding between any
executive officer or director of Sucampo, on the one hand, and Parent, Sun Acquisition, any of their affiliates or Sucampo, on the other hand, existed as
of the date of this Schedule 14D-9, and neither the Offer nor the Merger is conditioned upon any executive officer or director of Sucampo entering into
any such agreement, arrangement or understanding.

Although such arrangements have not, to our knowledge, been discussed as of the date of this Schedule 14D-9, it is possible that members of our
current management team will enter into new employment or consulting arrangements with the Surviving Corporation. Such arrangements may include
the right to purchase or participate in the equity of Mallinckrodt or its affiliates. Any such arrangements with the existing management team are
currently expected to be entered into after the completion of the Offer and will not become effective until after the Merger is completed, if at all. There
can be no assurance that the applicable parties will reach an agreement on any terms, or at all.

Director Compensation

Non-employee members of our board of directors receive cash and equity compensation under the terms of our non-employee director
compensation policy, which is applicable to all of our non-employee directors. This compensation policy provides that each director who is not an
employee or officer will receive the following compensation for service on our board of directors:
 

 •  a $55,000 annual retainer for service as a member of our board of directors;
 

 •  an additional annual retainer of $30,000 for the lead independent director;
 

 •  a $12,500 supplemental annual retainer for service as a member of our audit committee;
 

 •  a $15,000 supplemental annual retainer for service as chair of our audit committee;
 

 •  a $10,000 supplemental annual retainer for service on our compensation committee;
 

 •  a $8,500 supplemental annual retainer for service as the chair of our compensation committee;
 

 •  a $6,000 supplemental annual retainer for service on our nominating and corporate governance committee;
 

 •  a $8,500 supplemental annual retainer for service as the chair of our nominating and corporate governance committee;
 

 •  a $12,500 supplemental annual retainer for service as a member of our transaction committee;

 •  a $15,000 supplemental annual retainer for service as chair of our transaction committee;
 

 
•  an initial grant of 30,000 options to purchase Shares, which vests in 12 equal quarterly installments at the end of each successive three-

month period following the grant date through the third anniversary of the grant date; and
 

 
•  an annual grant of 20,000 options to purchase Shares, which vests in 12 equal installments at the end of each successive one-month period

following the grant date through the first anniversary of the grant date.

Outstanding equity awards held by our non-employee directors will vest and settle in connection with the Merger, as described above in “—
Treatment of Stock Options and RSUs.”

Indemnification of Directors and Officers; Insurance

Sucampo has entered into indemnification agreements (collectively, the “Indemnification Agreements”) with certain of our directors and executive
officers. The Indemnification Agreements provide for indemnification and the advancement of expenses related to any action, suit, arbitration, alternate
dispute resolution mechanism, investigation, administrative hearing or any other actual, threatened or completed proceeding whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative (other than on initiated by the indemnified director or officer), brought against such individual by reason of the fact that
they are, or were a director, officer, agent or fiduciary of Sucampo or of any other corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or
other enterprise which such director or officer is or was serving at our express written request. The Indemnification Agreements provide for
indemnification and expense advancement to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.

The foregoing description of the Indemnification Agreements does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by the full text of the
Form of Indemnification Agreement, which is included as Exhibit 10.1 to the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed by Sucampo on November 9, 2016
and incorporated herein by reference.

The Merger Agreement provides that all rights to indemnification existing as of the date of the Merger Agreement in favor of the present directors
and officers of Sucampo for their acts and omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time, as provided in Sucampo’s organizational documents and as
provided in specified indemnification agreements between Sucampo and such persons, shall survive the Merger for a period of six years from the
Effective Time, and any claim made requesting indemnification pursuant to such indemnification rights within such six-year period shall continue to be
subject to the Merger Agreement and the indemnification rights provided under the Merger Agreement until disposition of such claim.

The Merger Agreement also provides that, from the Effective Time until the sixth (6th) anniversary of the date on which the Effective Time
occurs, Mallinckrodt and the Surviving Corporation shall, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, indemnify and hold harmless each of Sucampo’s present
officers and directors in his or her capacity as an officer or director of Sucampo against all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, fees, expenses, judgments
or fines incurred by such indemnified person as an officer or director of Sucampo in connection with any pending or threatened legal proceeding based
on or arising out of, in whole or in part, the fact that such indemnified person is or was a director or officer of Sucampo at or prior to the Effective Time
and pertaining to any and all matters pending, existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time, including any such matter arising under any claim with respect to the Transactions.

The Merger Agreement also provides that, from the Effective Time until the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
must maintain (and Mallinckrodt must cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain) in effect the existing policy of directors’ and officers’ liability
insurance maintained by Sucampo as of the date of the Merger Agreement for the benefit of the indemnitees who were covered by such

policy as of the date of the Merger Agreement with respect to their acts and omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time in their capacities as
directors and officers of Sucampo (as applicable), on terms with respect to coverage, deductibles and amounts no less favorable in the aggregate than the
existing policy. However, in lieu maintaining such existing policy, Mallinckrodt may (and we will, upon Mallinckrodt’s request) purchase a six-year
“tail” policy for the Sucampo policy in effect as of the date of the Merger Agreement, subject to specified limitations.

Section 16 Matters

The Merger Agreement provides that our board of directors will take appropriate action, prior to or as of the Offer Acceptance Time, to approve,
for purposes of Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act, the disposition and cancellation or deemed disposition and cancellation of Shares and equity awards
in the Transactions by applicable individuals and to cause such dispositions and/or cancellations to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the
Exchange Act.

Rule 14d-10 Matters

The Merger Agreement provides that prior to the Offer Acceptance Time and to the extent permitted by applicable laws, the compensation
committee of our board of directors will approve, as an “employment compensation, severance or other employee benefit arrangement” within the
meaning of Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act, each agreement, arrangement or understanding between Sucampo or any of its affiliates and any
of the officers, directors or employees of Sucampo that are effective as of the date of the Merger Agreement or are entered into after the date of the
Merger Agreement and prior to the Effective Time pursuant to which compensation is paid to such officer, director or employee and will take all other
action reasonably necessary to satisfy the requirements of the non-exclusive safe harbor set forth in Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act.

(b) Arrangements with Sun Acquisition and Mallinckrodt and their Affiliates.

Merger Agreement

On December 23, 2017, Sucampo, Mallinckrodt and Sun Acquisition entered into the Merger Agreement. The summary of the material provisions
of the Merger Agreement contained in Section 11—“The Merger Agreement; Other Agreements” and Section 12—“Purpose of the Offer; Plans for
Sucampo” of the Offer to Purchase and the description of the conditions to the Offer contained in Section 15—“Conditions of the Offer” of the Offer to
Purchase are incorporated herein by reference. Such summary and description are qualified in their entirety by reference to the Merger Agreement,
which is filed as Exhibit (e)(1) hereto and is incorporated herein by reference.

The Merger Agreement has been filed as an exhibit to the Schedule 14D-9 to provide stockholders with information regarding its terms and is not
intended to modify or supplement any factual disclosure about Sucampo in Sucampo’s public reports filed with the SEC. The Merger Agreement and the
summary of its terms contained in the Offer to Purchase filed by Sun Acquisition with the SEC on January 16, 2018 are incorporated herein by
reference, and are not intended to provide any other factual information about Sucampo, Mallinckrodt, Sun Acquisition or their respective subsidiaries
and affiliates. The Merger Agreement contains representations and warranties that the parties to the Merger Agreement made to and solely for the
benefit of each other. The assertions embodied in the representations and warranties contained in the Merger Agreement are qualified by information in
confidential disclosure schedules delivered by Sucampo to Mallinckrodt in connection with the signing of the Merger Agreement. Moreover, certain
representations and warranties in the Merger Agreement were made as of a specified date, may be subject to a contractual standard of materiality
different from what might be viewed as material to stockholders, or may have been used for the purpose of allocating risk between the parties to the
Merger Agreement. Accordingly, the representations and warranties in the Merger Agreement should not be relied on by any persons as
characterizations of the actual state of facts and circumstances of

Sucampo at the time they were made and the information in the Merger Agreement should be considered in conjunction with the entirety of the factual
disclosure about Sucampo in Sucampo’s public reports filed with the SEC. Information concerning the subject matter of the representations and
warranties may change after the date of the Merger Agreement, which subsequent information may or may not be fully reflected in Sucampo’s public
disclosures. The Merger Agreement should not be read alone, but should instead be read in conjunction with the other information regarding the Offer,
the Merger, Sucampo, Mallinckrodt, Sun Acquisition, their respective affiliates and their respective businesses that are contained in, or incorporated by
reference into, the tender offer statement on Schedule TO and related exhibits, including the Offer to Purchase, and this solicitation/recommendation
statement on Schedule 14D-9, as well as in Sucampo’s other public filings.

Tender and Support Agreement

Concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, certain of our stockholders (RJ Fund, LLC, Ryuji Ueno Foundation, Inc., SK Impact
Fund, LLC and Sachiko Kuno Foundation, Inc.) entered into a Tender and Support Agreement dated as of December 23, 2017 (the “Tender and Support
Agreement”) with Mallinckrodt and Sun Acquisition, pursuant to which, among other things, each such stockholder agreed, among other things, to
tender Shares (totaling, in the aggregate, approximately 32% of the outstanding Shares as of January 9, 2018) to Sun Acquisition in the Offer, and,
subject to certain exceptions, not to transfer their Shares that are subject to the Tender and Support Agreement. This summary and description of the
Tender and Support Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Tender and Support Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit (e)(2) hereto and
incorporated herein by reference.

Confidentiality Agreement

On November 3, 2017, Mallinckrodt LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Mallinckrodt, and Sucampo entered into a Confidentiality Agreement
(the “Confidentiality Agreement”) pursuant to which each party agreed on behalf of itself and its affiliates, and subject to certain exceptions, to keep
confidential nonpublic information about the other party and its affiliates in connection with the consideration of a possible strategic transaction
involving Mallinckrodt and Sucampo. The Confidentiality Agreement includes a standstill provision for the benefit of Sucampo that expires 12 months
following the date of the Confidentiality Agreement but terminates automatically in specified circumstances (and terminated with respect to
Mallinckrodt upon the execution of the Merger Agreement).

On December 22, 2017, our board of directors unanimously (a) determined that the Merger Agreement and transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement, including the Offer and the Merger, are advisable and fair to, and in the best interest of, Sucampo and its stockholders, (b) approved
the execution, delivery and performance by Sucampo of the Merger Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement, including the Offer and the Merger, (c) agreed that the Merger Agreement shall be subject to Section 251(h) of the DGCL, (d) resolved to
recommend that the stockholders of Sucampo accept the Offer and tender their shares to Mallinckrodt pursuant to the Offer and, with Mr. Greenleaf
abstaining as to his compensation and (e) approved each of the compensation related actions proposed by the compensation committee of our board of
directors.

Accordingly, and for other reasons described in more detail below, our board of directors unanimously recommends that holders of Shares accept
the Offer and tender their Shares pursuant to the Offer.

(i) Background of Offer and Merger

We are a global biopharmaceutical company focused on developing, identifying, acquiring and bringing to market innovative medicines that meet
unmet medical needs. Our board of directors regularly assesses our strategy and considers opportunities to acquire other products under development
and our strategic alternatives.

In October 2014, we received an unsolicited proposal to be acquired by Party A, a publicly traded pharmaceutical company, for cash and
contingent value rights. We engaged in preliminary price discussions and in a due diligence process with Party A. As part of that process, our financial
advisor at that time assisted us in conducting a market check to determine whether there were other potential parties, including Mallinckrodt, with
interest in acquiring us. No third party submitted any proposal to acquire us. While discussions with Party A were pending, we announced several
transactions and our stock price increased to a price that exceeded Party A’s offer price and we terminated those discussions in December 2014.

In April 2016, we received an unsolicited proposal to be acquired by Party B, a privately held pharmaceutical company, for cash and a partial
rollover of equity by entities affiliated with our founders, Sachiko Kuno and Ryuji Ueno, who then collectively owned approximately 49% of our
outstanding equity. Our board of directors had previously established a transaction committee of independent directors (the “Transaction Committee”)
comprised of John Johnson, Maureen O’Connell and Timothy Walbert to assist our board in connection with the consideration of strategic alternatives,
including potential acquisitions. Our board designated the Transaction Committee as a special committee of independent directors to review, evaluate
and negotiate the potential transaction with Party B and any other strategic alternatives. Party B ultimately was unable to raise sufficient equity capital to
fund the acquisition and proposed that we acquire Party B in a stock for stock transaction. Our founders were not supportive of us acquiring Party B and
the discussions terminated in November 2016. While discussions with Party B were pending, we contacted the parties who hold the marketing rights for
our marketed drugs to determine whether they had any interest in acquiring us and they expressed no interest in an acquisition. During this period, we
also received an unsolicited proposal from Party C, a private equity fund in China, and engaged in discussions and due diligence under a confidentiality
agreement. Party C terminated discussions with us in July 2016, indicating that there was too much financial risk relating to the expected entrance of
generics for AMITIZA, our lead marketed product.

On September 12, 2017, at a regularly scheduled board meeting, our board approved the appointment of members to our board committees,
including the appointment of Mr. Johnson (Committee Chair), Ms. O’Connell, Mr. Walbert and Robert Spiegel to the Transaction Committee. Following
the termination of the 2016 strategic transaction discussions discussed above, the board determined to keep the Transaction Committee in place to
enable a more efficient review of potential acquisition opportunities and strategic alternatives.

On September 25, 2017, Josh Schafer, Vice President, Business Development and Licensing of Mallinckrodt, contacted Woody Bryan, our Senior
Vice President, Business Development and Licensing by e-mail to schedule a phone call to discuss strategic matters. On September 28, 2017,
Mr. Schafer informed Mr. Bryan that Mallinckrodt was interested in considering an acquisition of Sucampo. Following this call, Peter Greenleaf, our
Chief Executive Officer, informed Mr. Johnson, our Lead Independent Director and Chair of the Transaction Committee, of the call and agreed upon a
response to Mallinckrodt. Mr. Bryan requested that Mark Trudeau, the Chief Executive Officer of Mallinckrodt, call Mr. Greenleaf.

On October 9, 2017, Mr. Greenleaf had a call with Mr. Trudeau to discuss Mallinckrodt’s interest in considering an acquisition of Sucampo.
Consistent with the discussion with Mr. Johnson, Mr. Greenleaf informed Mr. Trudeau that Sucampo was not for sale, but that Mallinckrodt was free to
submit a proposal and that any such proposal would receive appropriate consideration from our board. Mr. Trudeau proposed that the parties meet for a
more detailed discussion. With further input from Mr. Johnson, Mr. Greenleaf agreed to hold the proposed meeting.

On October 12, 2017, Messrs. Greenleaf and Bryan met with Messrs. Trudeau and Schafer and Gary Philips, M.D., Executive Vice President and
Chief Strategy Officer of Mallinckrodt, in Mallinckrodt’s New Jersey offices and discussed Sucampo’s strategy. Our stock was trading in the range of
approximately $10.00 to $10.40 per Share at that time.

On October 20, 2017, Mr. Trudeau called Mr. Greenleaf to convey Mallinckrodt’s preliminary non-binding offer to acquire Sucampo for $17.00 to
$19.00 per Share in cash, subject to the completion of due diligence, and followed up by sending a letter confirming the proposal.

On October 21, 2017, our Transaction Committee held a telephonic meeting to discuss the Mallinckrodt proposal. A representative of Cooley LLP,
our outside counsel, attended the meeting and reviewed fiduciary duty considerations in connection with the review of the proposal. The Transaction
Committee authorized management to share with Mallinckrodt limited due diligence materials to inform its valuation of Sucampo so that Mallinckrodt
could provide a single indicative offer price rather than a price range. The Transaction Committee also authorized engaging Jefferies LLC (“Jefferies”)
as our financial advisor in connection with our review of the Mallinckrodt proposal and related matters. We subsequently engaged Jefferies given,
among other things, its reputation and substantial knowledge and experience in healthcare mergers and acquisitions and its familiarity with Sucampo and
its business through prior engagements by Sucampo.

On October 22, 2017, Mr. Greenleaf provided feedback from the Transaction Committee meeting to Mr. Trudeau. Thereafter, representatives of
Sucampo provided a draft confidentiality agreement to Mallinckrodt.

On October 31, 2017, Mr. Greenleaf called Mr. Trudeau to discuss the proposed confidentiality agreement between the parties. During the call,
Mr. Trudeau proposed a new price range and later the same day Mallinckrodt submitted a revised preliminary non-binding offer to acquire Sucampo for
$18.00 to $18.50 per Share, subject to the completion of due diligence. On November 1, 2017, following its further review of due diligence materials,
Mallinckrodt submitted a further revised non-binding proposal for $17.50 to $18.50 per Share, subject to the completion of due diligence.

On November 3, 2017, we entered into a confidentiality agreement with Mallinckrodt that contained a standstill that would terminate
automatically in certain circumstances.

On November 8, 2017, representatives of Mallinckrodt and Sucampo had discussions regarding the diligence process. Sucampo’s and
Mallinckrodt’s management teams held a series of calls between November 12 and 27, 2017 on commercial, clinical and regulatory matters.

On November 12, 2017, we provided Mallinckrodt and its advisors access to an electronic data room with limited due diligence information, and
beginning on November 28, 2017, we provided access to full due diligence information through the data room. Throughout the due diligence process
leading up to the execution of the Merger Agreement we provided due diligence materials to Mallinckrodt in response to its requests.

On November 25, 2017, Mr. Trudeau called Mr. Greenleaf to convey a new preliminary non-binding offer of $17.50 per Share and to discuss
assumptions included in Mallinckrodt’s financial model for the transaction that required further due diligence investigation. Later that day, Mallinckrodt
submitted the revised proposal in writing.

On November 26, 2017, the Transaction Committee held a telephonic meeting that included Paul Edick, a member of our board, with our senior
management and representatives of Cooley and Jefferies also in attendance. Jefferies reviewed the premium implied by the revised proposal and, on a
preliminary basis, certain financial aspects of the revised proposal. The Transaction Committee discussed potential responses to the proposal and noted
that Sucampo could face a significant decline in its revenue and EBITDA primarily as a result of generic competition for AMITIZA in future years. The
Transaction Committee also noted that our founders were likely to be supportive of the proposed transaction given that, per public filings, they had
recently been selling Shares in the market at prices below the offer prices per Share under discussion. The Transaction Committee authorized a
counterproposal of $19.00 per Share.

Later that day, Mr. Greenleaf presented the $19.00 per Share counterproposal to Mr. Trudeau. Mr. Trudeau informed Mr. Greenleaf that he did not
have board authority to offer $19.00 per Share and that Mallinckrodt’s

valuation work did not support an offer above $18.00 per Share. Mr. Trudeau stated that Mallinckrodt revised the offer to $18.00 per Share and indicated
that he would not be willing to recommend to Mallinckrodt’s board a higher price.

On November 27, 2017, the Transaction Committee held a telephonic meeting including Mr. Edick, our senior management and representatives of
Cooley and Jefferies also in attendance. Mr. Greenleaf updated the committee on the discussion with Mr. Trudeau and the $18.00 per Share
counterproposal. Jefferies discussed, based on publicly available information, Mallinckrodt’s ability to finance a transaction and, on a preliminary basis,
certain financial aspects of the revised proposal. The $18.00 per Share proposal represented a 70.6% premium to our last closing price of $10.55 per
Share on November 24, 2017 and a 75.9% premium to the 30-day volume weighted average price at that time. The Transaction Committee also
discussed and concluded that a market check to potential strategic or financial parties was unlikely to generate additional interest in acquiring Sucampo
and could result in a leak that could undermine the proposal from Mallinckrodt. The committee based this decision on senior management’s feedback on
lack of interest expressed in general business development discussions, the results of prior market checks, including the lack of interest from the most
logical acquirers, and the committee’s own knowledge of our current portfolio and the lack of market interest in royalty assets of short duration like
AMITIZA. The Transaction Committee approved proceeding with discussions with Mallinckrodt at $18.00 per Share, subject to full board approval of
the transaction.

Following the meeting, Mr. Greenleaf called Mr. Trudeau to convey the board’s willingness to proceed based on an $18.00 per Share price, subject
to completion of due diligence and the execution of a merger agreement before the Christmas holiday. Later on November 28, 2017, Mallinckrodt
delivered to Sucampo a revised non-binding indication of interest confirming the contemplated offer price of $18.00 per Share. Our stock price closed at
$11.45 per Share that day.

On November 29, 2017, we sent to Mallinckrodt a draft merger agreement. The draft merger agreement, contemplated, among other things, a
tender offer followed by a second-step merger pursuant to Section 251(h) of the DGCL, and a Sucampo termination fee equal to 2.5% of the outstanding
equity value.

On November 30, 2017, the Transaction Committee held a telephonic meeting, with Mr. Edick, our senior management and representatives of
Cooley and Jefferies also in attendance. Mr. Greenleaf updated the committee on developments since the last meeting, including the site visits requested
by Mallinckrodt and the committee and management discussed the stock price and trading volume increases. Management presented financial
projections that were based on the financial projections approved by the board in March 2017 in connection with the consideration of the Vtesse, Inc.
acquisition, updated for expected AMITIZA pricing reductions in Japan in 2018 and the possible licensing of the over the counter sale of generic
AMITIZA. Jefferies reviewed on a preliminary basis certain financial aspects of the proposed $18 per Share purchase price utilizing such projections, as
authorized by the Transaction Committee for purposes of such review. After representatives of Jefferies were excused from the meeting, the Transaction
Committee discussed Jefferies’ material relationships disclosure with respect to Mallinckrodt that had been provided in advance of this meeting and
concluded that such relationships would not adversely affect Jefferies’ ability to serve as our financial advisor.

On December 1, 2017, Mr. Greenleaf and Mr. Trudeau had a telephone call to discuss the status of the due diligence process and a targeted signing
date for the transaction.

On December 7, 2017, Bloomberg published a story that we were considering a sale of the company for an unspecified amount, and our stock
price closed at $16.00 per Share that day. We did not receive any inbound inquiries from any other potential acquirers either before or after publication
of this story.

On December 8, 2017, Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz (“Wachtell”), Mallinckrodt’s outside counsel, sent Cooley a revised draft of the merger
agreement. The revised draft contemplated, among other changes, a Sucampo termination fee equal to 4.0% of Sucampo’s equity value, including the
equity underlying its outstanding convertible notes, and the entry by the founders into a tender and support agreement.

On December 12, 2017, our board of directors held a regular board meeting, with representatives of senior management and a representative of
Cooley in attendance and representatives of Jefferies attending a portion of the meeting. At this meeting, Jefferies provided an update to our board on
the proposed transaction, including the history of negotiations and certain financial aspects of the proposed transaction. Our senior management
provided an update to our board on the status of the due diligence process. Cooley discussed with the board its fiduciary duties. Our board also discussed
whether it should conduct a market check, including the recommendation of the Transaction Committee that no market check be conducted and the fact
that the company had not received any inquiries since the publication of the December 7 Bloomberg article about the company’s consideration of
strategic options. The board also formally appointed Mr. Edick to the Transaction Committee. Following the board meeting, Mr. Greenleaf had a call
with Mr. Trudeau to share feedback from the board meeting and to discuss the remaining due diligence process and timing.

On December 13, 2017, Cooley sent a revised draft of the merger agreement to Wachtell. The revised draft contemplated, among other changes, a
Sucampo termination fee equal to 3.0% of equity value, including the equity underlying Sucampo’s convertible notes, and no tender and support
agreement with the founders.

On December 14, 2017, Wachtell and Cooley had calls to discuss the merger agreement. The following day, Wachtell sent Cooley a revised draft
of the merger agreement and a proposed tender and support agreement that Mallinckrodt was seeking from our founders.

On December 15, 2017, Mr. Trudeau called Mr. Greenleaf to discuss potential valuation issues and to ask whether our board would consider a
structured transaction with contingent value rights rather than an all cash transaction. Mr. Greenleaf informed Mr. Trudeau that the board would not be
receptive to a deal that was not at least $18.00 per Share in cash.

On December 17, 2018, Mr. Trudeau called Mr. Greenleaf to inform him that Mallinckrodt was willing to move forward with the $18.00 per Share
cash transaction. Mr. Trudeau also indicated that Mallinckrodt expected our founders and their affiliated entities to sign tender and support agreements in
connection with the execution of the merger agreement.

On December 18, 2017, Mr. Greenleaf updated our board on the call from Mr. Trudeau.

On December 18, 2017, Mr. Greenleaf, Alex Driggs, the General Counsel of Sucampo, and Cooley participated in a conference call with
Mr. Trudeau and Gary Phillips, Executive Vice President and Chief Strategy Officer, Dr. Frank Scholz, Executive Vice President of Global Operations
and President, Specialty Generics, and Jared Freedberg, Vice President, Business Development and Licensing of Mallinckrodt, as well as Wachtell, to
discuss Mallinckrodt’s request for tender and support agreements from our founders and Sucampo’s concern that such a request could delay the potential
transaction.

Later that day, Mr. Greenleaf contacted our founders to request that they enter into a confidentiality agreement to discuss an urgent matter. After
agreeing to confidentiality, Mr. Greenleaf had a discussion with a lawyer representative of the founders to disclose the proposed transaction and to
request the execution of tender and support agreements. Cooley had subsequent calls with the founders’ outside counsel, McGuireWoods LLP, to discuss
the proposed transaction and provided to McGuireWoods the draft of the requested tender and support agreement. On December 20, 2017,
McGuireWoods provided comments on the tender and support agreement that were accepted by Mallinckrodt and the founders subsequently agreed to
enter into the Support Agreement in connection with the execution of the merger agreement with Mallinckrodt.

Late at night on December 18, 2017, Cooley sent Wachtell a revised draft of the merger agreement.

Throughout the week of December 18, 2017, Cooley and Wachtell held calls to resolve remaining open issues in the merger agreement and related
schedules, including the amount of the termination fee, and exchanged drafts of the merger agreement.

On December 19, 2017, Wachtell provided to Cooley a draft of Mallinckrodt’s debt commitment letter, and a redacted debt fee letter, related to
new term loan financing that Mallinckrodt expected to enter into in order to fund, in part, the transaction.

On December 22, 2017, Cooley sent Wachtell a revised draft of the merger agreement providing for a $44 million termination fee, reflecting
approximately 3.5% of the equity value, including the equity underlying Sucampo’s outstanding convertible notes. On the same day, Wachtell sent
Cooley a revised draft of the debt commitment letter and Wachtell and Cooley had a call to discuss the terms thereof.

In the evening of December 22, 2017, our board held a special telephonic meeting, with our senior management and representatives of Cooley and
Jefferies also attending. Mr. Greenleaf updated the board on recent developments, including the founders’ willingness to execute the Support Agreement
and the expected timing of execution of the merger agreement and public announcement of the proposed transaction. At this meeting, Jefferies reviewed
its financial analysis of the $18.00 per Share cash consideration with the board and rendered an oral opinion, confirmed by delivery of a written opinion
dated December 22, 2017, to the board to the effect that, as of that date and based on and subject to various assumptions made, procedures followed,
matters considered and limitations and qualifications on the review undertaken as described in the opinion, the $18.00 per Share cash consideration to be
received in the Offer and the Merger, taken together as an integrated transaction, by holders of Shares (other than Mallinckrodt, Sun Acquisition and
their respective affiliates) pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. Representatives of Cooley
reviewed with our board its fiduciary duties in the context of considering the proposed transaction with Mallinckrodt. Cooley also reviewed in detail the
proposed terms of the Merger Agreement by referring to an executive summary of the Merger Agreement distributed in advance of the meeting. As part
of this review, Cooley reviewed in detail the tender offer conditions, as well as the deal protection-related provisions, including the non-solicitation
provisions, the exceptions to the non-solicitation provisions, the provisions relating to the board’s recommendation in favor of the transaction and the
process for changing the board’s recommendation, the right to terminate the Merger Agreement to accept a superior offer and the termination fee. The
board asked questions and discussed the proposed transaction.

During an executive session (without Mr. Greenleaf on the call), Mr. Walbert as chair of the Compensation Committee then presented actions that
the Compensation Committee recommended that the board approve in connection with the transaction with Mallinckrodt:
 

 

•  the award of performance-based cash bonus payments to management, including the named executive officers, based on the assessment of
their achievement of the previously established corporate and personal goals for 2017. The Compensation Committee recommended awards
based on achievement of 100% of personal objectives and achievement of 140% of the corporate goals for 2017 and recommended payment
of such bonuses prior to December 31, 2017 for tax planning purposes to avoid subjecting change of control payments to excise taxes under
the Internal Revenue Code;

 

 
•  the award of cash payments to certain executive officers, including named executive officers, in connection with the consummation of the

Offer and Merger with such payments contingent and effective upon the Effective Time; and
 

 
•  the acceleration of vesting of RSUs held by certain executives, including two named executive officers, to be fully vested on December 22,

2017 and to be settled on or prior to December 31, 2017 for tax planning purposes to avoid subjecting change of control payments to excise
taxes under the Internal Revenue Code.

Following consideration of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including consideration of the
factors described in “Reasons for the Transaction”, and consideration of the respective recommendations of the Transaction Committee and the
Compensation Committee, our board

unanimously (a) determined that the Merger Agreement and transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Offer and the Merger,
are advisable and fair to, and in the best interest of, Sucampo and its stockholders, (b) approved the execution, delivery and performance by Sucampo of
the Merger Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Offer and the Merger, (c) agreed
that the Merger Agreement shall be subject to Section 251(h) of the DGCL, (d) resolved to recommend that the stockholders of Sucampo accept the
Offer and tender their Shares to Sun Acquisition pursuant to the Offer and, with Mr. Greenleaf abstaining as to his compensation, and (e) approved each
of the compensation related actions proposed by the Compensation Committee and described in the prior paragraph.

On the morning of December 23, 2017, the transaction committee and the audit committee of the board of directors of Mallinckrodt unanimously
approved the execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement.

Also on the morning of December 23, 2017, Wachtell sent Cooley a further revised draft of the debt commitment letter and the redacted debt fee
letter, together with executed copies thereof.

Later that morning, representatives of Sucampo, Mallinckrodt and Sun Acquisition executed the definitive Merger Agreement. Concurrent with
the execution of the Merger Agreement, RJ Fund, LLC, Ryuji Ueno Foundation, Inc., SK Impact Fund, LLC and Sachiko Kuno Foundation, Inc.,
holders of approximately 32% of the outstanding Shares in the aggregate, entered into the Support Agreement pursuant to which they agreed to tender
such Shares in the Offer to be made pursuant to the Merger Agreement.

Execution of the Merger Agreement was publicly announced early on the morning of December 26, 2017.

(ii) Reasons for Recommendation

On December 22, 2017, our board of directors unanimously (i) determined that the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement, including the Offer and the Merger, are advisable and fair to, and in the best interest of, Sucampo and its stockholders, (ii) agreed
that the Merger shall be effected under Section 251(h) of the DGCL, (iii) approved the execution, delivery and performance by Sucampo of the Merger
Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions, including the Offer and the Merger, and (iv) resolved to recommend that the stockholders of
Sucampo tender their Shares to Sun Acquisition pursuant to the Offer, subject to the right of the Sucampo Board to withdraw or modify its
recommendation in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement.

Our board of directors consulted with our management and legal and financial advisors in evaluating the Merger Agreement and the Offer and the
Merger. Our board of directors also considered the following factors (which are not listed in any relative order of importance) in reaching its conclusion
to approve the Merger Agreement and the Transactions:
 

 •  The Offer consists solely of cash, providing certainty, immediate value and liquidity to our stockholders.
 

 

•  The fact that the $18.00 price to be paid for each Share in connection with the Offer and the Merger represents (a) a 70.6% premium to the
closing price of $10.55 per Share on November 24, 2017, the last trading day before the Transaction Committee authorized proceeding with
due diligence and negotiations based on the price of $18.00 per Share, (b) a 20% premium to the closing price of $14.95 per Share on
December 6, 2017, the last trading day prior to news reports publishing speculation regarding a potential transaction involving Sucampo,
and a 44% and 51% premium, respectively, over the average closing trading prices for the 30-day period and 90-day period ended on
December 6, 2017, and (c) a 6% premium to the closing price of $17.00 per share on December 22, 2017, the last trading day before the
Offer and the Merger were approved by our board of directors and publicly announced.

Table of Contents

 

•  Our board’s belief, after consideration of potential strategic alternatives and discussions with our management, the results of prior market
checks and discussions with other industry participants and the board’s own knowledge of our current portfolio, that the sale of the Shares
for the Offer Price is more favorable to the stockholders of Sucampo than the potential value that might have resulted from other strategic
options available to Sucampo, including remaining a standalone public company.

 

 

•  Our board’s assessment of our prospects for substantially increasing stockholder value as a standalone company in excess of the Offer Price,
given the risks and uncertainties in our business, including, among other things: (a) the expected generic competition for branded AMITIZA
beginning in 2021 and the potential significant drop in revenue and EBITDA as branded AMITIZA sales decline significantly thereafter;
(b) risks relating to the development of VTS-270 and CPP-1X/sulindac, and assuming successful clinical trials, risks relating to obtaining
marketing approval for these products, building a commercial infrastructure and successfully commercializing these products; and (c) risks
relating to identifying and licensing or acquiring additional marketed products or pipeline assets.

 

 
•  Our board’s belief that we negotiated the highest price per Share that Mallinckrodt was willing to pay to acquire the Shares and that the

terms of the Merger Agreement include the most favorable terms to us, in the aggregate, to which Mallinckrodt was willing to agree.
 

 
•  The fact that our founders, who hold an aggregate of approximately 32% of our outstanding Shares, had recently been selling Shares in the

market at prices below the Offer Price prior to becoming aware of the contemplated transaction, and were willing to enter into the Tender
and Support Agreement pursuant to which they agreed to tender their Shares in the Offer.

 

 

•  The opinion, dated December 22, 2017, of Jefferies to Sucampo’s board as to the fairness, from a financial point of view and as of such date,
of the $18.00 per Share cash consideration to be received in the Offer and the Merger, taken together as an integrated transaction, by holders
of Shares (other than Mallinckrodt, Sun Acquisition and their respective affiliates) pursuant to the Merger Agreement, which opinion was
based on and subject to the various assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and limitations and qualifications on the
review undertaken as further described under the caption “Opinion of Financial Advisor.”

 

 

•  The Offer is structured as a tender offer, which can be completed, and the Offer Price, subject to any applicable withholding taxes, can
thereafter be delivered promptly to our stockholders who tender their Shares for purchase pursuant to the Offer, reducing the period of
uncertainty for stockholders and employees during the pendency of the Transactions, with a second step merger, in accordance with
Section 251(h) of the DGCL, to be completed promptly after the Offer Acceptance Time, as a result of which each Share (other than Shares
(i) held immediately prior to the Effective Time by Sucampo (including any held in Sucampo’s treasury), (ii) held immediately prior to the
Effective Time by Mallinckrodt or any of its wholly owned subsidiaries (including Sun Acquisition), or (iii) held by a holder who is entitled
to demand and properly exercised and perfected its demand for appraisal of such Shares in the time and manner provided in Section 262 of
the DGCL and, as of the Effective Time, has neither effectively withdrawn nor lost its rights to such appraisal and payment under the
DGCL) will be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration.

 

 
•  The fact that, under certain circumstances, the Sun Acquisition must, at our election, extend the Offer for one or more periods if any Offer

condition set forth in the Merger Agreement has not been satisfied or, to the extent permitted by the Merger Agreement, waived.
 

 
•  Our board’s belief that the Offer would likely be consummated after taking into account the nature of the conditions to the Offer, including

the absence of any financing condition, and our founders’ execution of the Tender and Support Agreement covering approximately 32% of
the outstanding Shares and our board’s belief that the transaction is unlikely to be delayed by any regulatory review.

 •  The other terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, including the following related factors:
 

 
•  the conclusion of our board that the termination fee of $44 million, and the circumstances when such termination fee may be payable

by Sucampo, are reasonable in light of the benefit of the Offer and the other Transactions;
 

 

•  the fact that prior to the execution of the Merger Agreement, Mallinckrodt delivered to Sucampo a copy of a debt commitment letter
entered into among a subsidiary of Mallinckrodt, Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch (“DBNY”) and Deutsche Bank Securities
Inc., where DBNY has committed to provide, subject to the terms and conditions therein, up to $500 million for the purposes of
financing the Transactions, and the representations and covenants of Mallinckrodt in the Merger Agreement as to its financing;

 

 

•  the ability of our board under the Merger Agreement to withdraw or modify its recommendation that our stockholders accept the
Offer and tender their Shares in certain circumstances, including in connection with a superior offer, and our right to terminate the
Merger Agreement in order to accept a superior offer and enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such superior offer,
subject to compliance with certain requirements (including the payment of the termination fee), and the related ability for any other
party to approach Sucampo if such party is potentially interested in such a transaction, subject in each case to the terms and
conditions of the Merger Agreement; and

 

 
•  the availability of statutory appraisal rights to our stockholders who do not tender their Shares in the Offer and who otherwise

comply with all required procedures under the DGCL.

Our board of directors also considered a variety of risks, uncertainties, restrictions and other potentially negative factors in determining whether to
approve the Merger Agreement and the Transactions, including the following:
 

 
•  The fact that we would no longer exist as an independent, publicly traded company, and our stockholders would no longer participate in any

future earnings or growth of Sucampo or benefit from the successful execution of our current strategy as a public company.
 

 
•  The potential effects of the announcement and pendency of the Merger Agreement and the Offer on our operations, Share price, employees,

customers and suppliers, our ability to retain and attract key personnel while the Transactions are pending, and the possibility of any suit,
action or proceeding in respect of the Merger Agreement or the Transactions.

 

 
•  The financial interests of our executive officers and directors and the fact that our executive officers and members of our board may be

deemed to have interests in the execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement and the Transactions, including the Offer and the Merger,
that may be different from or in addition to those of our stockholders, generally.

 

 •  The fact that if the Offer and the other Transactions are not consummated in a timely manner or at all:
 

 •  the trading price of Shares may be adversely affected;
 

 •  we will have incurred significant transaction and opportunity costs attempting to consummate the Transactions;
 

 •  we may have lost employees or commercial partners after announcement of the Offer;
 

 •  our business may be subject to significant disruption; and
 

 •  our directors, officers and other employees will have expended considerable time and effort to consummate the Transactions.
 

 
•  The $44 million termination fee payable to Mallinckrodt upon the occurrence of certain events, including the potential effect of such

termination fee to deter other potential acquirers from making a competing offer for Sucampo that might be more advantageous to our
stockholders, and the impact of

the termination fee on our ability to engage in certain other transactions for 12 months from the date of the Merger Agreement is terminated
in certain circumstances.

 

 
•  The fact that any gain realized by our stockholders as a result of the Offer and the Merger generally will be taxable to the stockholders for

U.S. federal income tax purposes.
 

 
•  The restrictions in the Merger Agreement on the conduct of our business prior to the consummation of the Merger, which may delay or

prevent us from undertaking business or other opportunities that may arise prior to the consummation of the Offer or the Merger.

Our board of directors concluded that the risks, uncertainties, restrictions and potentially negative factors associated with the Offer and Merger
were outweighed by the potential benefits of the Offer and Merger.

The foregoing discussion of our board of directors’ reasons for its recommendation to accept the Offer is not meant to be exhaustive, but addresses
the material information and factors considered by our board of directors in connection with its recommendation. In view of the wide variety of factors
considered by our board of directors in connection with the evaluation of the Merger Agreement, the Offer and the Merger and the complexity of these
matters, our board of directors did not find it practicable to, and did not, quantify or otherwise assign relative weights to the specific factors considered
in reaching its determination and recommendation. Rather, our directors made their determinations and recommendations based on the totality of the
information presented to them, and the judgments of individual members of our board of directors may have been influenced to a greater or lesser
degree by different factors. In arriving at their respective recommendations, the members of our board of directors considered the interests of our
executive officers and directors as described under “Past Contacts, Transactions, Negotiations and Agreements” in Item 3 above.”

(iii) Certain Financial Projections

We do not, as a matter of course, publicly disclose long-term forecasts or internal projections as to our future performance or results of operations
due to the inherent unpredictability of the underlying assumptions and projections. In November 2017, in connection with our board’s review of a
potential strategic transaction with Mallinckrodt, our management updated and provided to our Transaction Committee financial projections reflecting
Sucampo as a standalone company (the “Management Projections”). The Management Projections were based on the financial projections approved by
our board of directors in March 2017 in connection with its consideration of the acquisition of Vtesse, Inc. by Sucampo and were updated for more
recent developments, including the expected AMITIZA pricing in Japan in 2018 and the expected licensing of the over the counter sale of generic
AMITIZA. We also provided the Management Projections to Jefferies as reflective of management’s best currently available estimates and good faith
judgments as to the future financial performance of Sucampo and the other matters covered thereby and directed Jefferies to use and rely upon the
Management Projections in connection with its financial analyses and opinion to the Sucampo board of directors as described below under the heading
“—Opinion of Financial Advisor” in this Item 4 of this Schedule 14D-9. In addition, in response to Mallinckrodt’s request that we provide projections,
in December 2017, we prepared and provided to Mallinckrodt certain limited long-term financial projections as further described below (the “December
Projections”, and together with the Management Projections, the “Projections”).

The Projections set forth below are included solely to give our stockholders access to certain financial projections that were made available to our
board of directors and advisors and Mallinckrodt and is not included in this Schedule 14D-9 in order to influence any stockholder’s decision to tender
Shares in the Offer or for any other purpose.

The Management Projections were prepared by management for internal use and the December Projections were prepared by management for
Mallinckrodt’s internal use. The Projections were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure, or with a view toward compliance with published
guidelines of the SEC, the guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation and presentation of

financial forecasts, or United States generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). Neither our independent registered public accounting firm, nor
any other independent accountants, have compiled, examined or performed any procedures with respect to the Projections, or expressed any opinion or
any other form of assurance on such information or its achievability.

The Projections reflect numerous estimates and assumptions made by our management with respect to general business, economic, competitive,
regulatory, tax, reimbursement and other market and financial conditions and other future events, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which
are beyond our control. The Projections reflect subjective judgment in many respects and, therefore, are susceptible to multiple interpretations and
periodic revisions based on actual experience and business developments. The inclusion of the Projections should not be regarded as an indication that
we or anyone who received the Projections then considered, or now considers, the projections to be necessarily predictive of actual future events, and
this information should not be relied upon as such. Our management views the Projections as subject to inherent risks and uncertainties associated with
long-range projections.

The Projections should be evaluated, if at all, in conjunction with the historical financial statements and other information regarding Sucampo in
our public filings with the SEC. The Projections do not take into account any circumstances or events occurring after the date they were prepared,
including any potential effects of the U.S. tax reform enacted on December 22, 2017 and any potential changes resulting from the Offer or the Merger.
Further, the Projections do not take into account the effect of any failure of the Offer or the Merger to be consummated and should not be viewed as
predictive or continuing in that context. Stockholders are cautioned not to place undue, if any, reliance on the Projections included in this
Schedule 14D-9.

The Management Projections estimate (i) total revenue, (ii) EBIT (calculated as total revenue less cost of goods and operating expenses (including
selling and marketing expense, research and development costs, general and administrative expenses, royalty payments, intangible assets amortization
and CPP-1X/sulindac profit sharing with Cancer Prevention Pharmaceuticals)), (iii) taxes and (iv) unlevered free cash flow (calculated as EBIT plus
depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation, less capital expenditures and changes in net working capital). EBIT and unlevered free
cash flow are not GAAP financial measures. The Management Projections are based on the certain assumptions, including assumptions relating to
volume growth and pricing increases for branded AMITIZA sales in the United States in 2018-2022 and decreasing U.S. market share after generic
entry in 2021, entry of pediatric AMITIZA in the first half of 2018, volume growth and pricing decreases for branded AMITIZA sales in Japan and
market and pricing assumptions relating to revenue from the AMITIZA generic market. The Management Projections also include the assumption that
VTS-270 receives marketing approval and is commercially launched in the United States and the European Union in February 2019 and launched in the
rest of the world in February 2020 and makes assumptions about pricing, volume and peak market share for VTS-270, which were consistent with the
assumptions used in the financial projections in March 2017 in connection with our board’s consideration of the acquisition of Vtesse, Inc. by Sucampo.
The revenue and related research and development and sales and marketing expenses for VTS-270 are adjusted for a 70% probability of success. The
Management Projections further assume that CPP-1X/sulindac (FAP) receives marketing approval and we exercise our option to acquire certain U.S.
profit sharing rights in this product and that the product is launched for treatment of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) in 2020. Revenue and related
research and development and milestone expenses for CPP-1X/sulindac are adjusted for a 45% probability of success in 2019 and 37% probability of
success thereafter. We also make assumptions relating to projected research and development, selling and marketing and general and administrative
expenses and include projected royalty payments to the former stockholders of Vtesse, Inc. relating to VTS-270. For the purposes of Jefferies’ financial
analyses, our management also provided Jefferies with the following financial and other information for its use and reliance: (i) projected cash and cash
equivalents of approximately $104 million as of December 31, 2017; and (ii) that the fully diluted Shares of Sucampo capital stock include
approximately (a) 47.169 million Shares outstanding , (b) 5.332 million options to purchase Shares at weighted average exercise price of $11.14 per
share using treasury stock method, (c) 0.447 million restricted stock unit awards and (d) $300 million Convertible Notes at a conversion price of $16.59
per net Share using the settlement method as of December 22, 2017.

At the request of Mallinckrodt that we provide projections, in December 2017, Sucampo provided the December Projections to Mallinckrodt. The
December Projections were created by Sucampo management in response to Mallinckrodt’s request and for no other purpose. The December Projections
were prepared by us after the Management Projections were reviewed by the Transaction Committee on November 30, 2017, were not shared with the
Transaction Committee or our board and Jefferies was not directed to use or rely upon the December Projections in connection with its financial
analyses and opinion to our board of directors described below under the heading “—Opinion of Financial Advisor” in this Item 4 of this
Schedule 14D-9. The December Projections do not project free cash flow, and were not utilized in any discounted cash flow analysis or other financial
analysis. Sucampo management prepared the December Projections from a seller advocacy perspective and, as a result, used assumptions that were
more aggressive and optimistic than the assumptions used in the Management Projections (with the Management Projections having reflected
management’s best estimates of the results that Sucampo would achieve as a standalone company). For example, the December Projections: (1) are not
probability adjusted for success (i.e., assume 100% successful outcome) with respect to our two pipeline products (VTS-270 and CPP-1X/sulindac) and
future product label expansion or over the counter sales for AMITIZA (based on our management’s view that Mallinckrodt could and would form its
own views of such probabilities as informed by its industry and regulatory knowledge and experience), (2) use more optimistic assumptions relating to
the launch price for VTS-270 in the United States and in the rest of the world, (3) use more optimistic assumptions about market penetration for
VTS-270, (4) assume higher sales volumes for branded AMITIZA in the United States, (5) use less aggressive price reductions for sales of branded
AMITIZA in Japan and (6) assume more optimistic projections of market share retained by generic AMITIZA. Further, the December Projections
assume higher research and development expenses and higher selling and administrative and general and administrative expenses (as a consequence of
both the higher assumed sales and absence of discounting for probabilities of success) as compared to the Management Projections. Management
believed that Mallinckrodt would develop its own financial model and would form its own view about the assumptions in the December Projections.

(iv) Opinion of Financial Advisor

Sucampo has retained Jefferies as its financial advisor in connection with the Offer and the Merger. In connection with this engagement, Sucampo
requested that Jefferies evaluate the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the $18.00 per Share cash consideration to be received in the Offer and
the Merger, taken together as an integrated transaction, by holders of Shares (other than Mallinckrodt, Sun Acquisition and their respective affiliates)
pursuant to the Merger Agreement. On December 22, 2017, at a meeting of Sucampo’s board held to evaluate the Offer and the Merger, Jefferies
rendered an oral opinion, confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated December 22, 2017, to Sucampo’s board to the effect that, as of that date and
based on and subject to the various assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and limitations and qualifications on the review
undertaken as described in its opinion, the $18.00 per Share cash consideration to be received in the Offer and the Merger, taken together as an
integrated transaction, by holders of Shares (other than Mallinckrodt, Sun Acquisition and their respective affiliates) pursuant to the Merger Agreement
was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.

The full text of Jefferies’ opinion, which describes the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and limitations and
qualifications on the review undertaken by Jefferies, is attached as Annex I to this Schedule 14D-9 and is incorporated herein by reference. Jefferies’
opinion was provided for the use and benefit of Sucampo’s board (in its capacity as such) in its evaluation of the per Share cash consideration
from a financial point of view and did not address any other aspect of the Offer, the Merger or any other matter. The opinion did not address
the relative merits of the Offer or the Merger contemplated by the Merger Agreement as compared to any alternative transaction or
opportunity that might be available to Sucampo, nor did it address the underlying business decision by Sucampo to engage in the Offer or the
Merger. Jefferies’ opinion does not constitute a recommendation as to whether any stockholder should tender Shares in the Offer or how any
stockholder should act with respect to the Offer, the Merger or any other matter. The following summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to
the full text of Jefferies’ opinion.

In arriving at its opinion, Jefferies, among other things:
 

•  reviewed a draft, dated December 22, 2017, of the Merger Agreement;
 

•  reviewed certain publicly available financial and other information regarding Sucampo;
 

•  reviewed certain information furnished to Jefferies by the management of Sucampo relating to the businesses, operations and prospects of
Sucampo, including probability-weighted and tax-affected financial forecasts and estimates provided by the management of Sucampo;

 

•  held discussions with members of the senior management of Sucampo concerning the matters described in the second and third bullets
immediately above;

Table of Contents

•  reviewed the stock trading price history and implied trading multiples for Sucampo and compared them with those of certain publicly traded
companies that Jefferies deemed relevant in evaluating Sucampo;

 

•  compared the financial terms of the Offer and the Merger with publicly available financial terms of certain other transactions that Jefferies deemed
relevant in evaluating the Offer and the Merger; and

 

•  conducted such other financial studies, analyses and investigations as Jefferies deemed appropriate.

In its review and analysis and in rendering its opinion, Jefferies assumed and relied upon, but did not assume any responsibility to independently
investigate or verify, the accuracy and completeness of all financial and other information that was supplied or otherwise made available by Sucampo or
that was publicly available to Jefferies (including, without limitation, the information described above) or otherwise reviewed by Jefferies. Jefferies
relied on assurances of the management and other representatives of Sucampo that they were not aware of any facts or circumstances that would make
such information incomplete, inaccurate or misleading. In its review, Jefferies did not obtain any independent evaluation or appraisal of any of the assets
or liabilities (contingent, derivative, off-balance sheet or otherwise), nor did Jefferies conduct a physical inspection of any of the properties or facilities,
of Sucampo or any other entity and Jefferies was not furnished with, and assumed no responsibility to obtain, any such evaluations, appraisals or
physical inspections.

With respect to the financial forecasts and estimates (including as to certain tax attributes of Sucampo on a standalone basis) provided to and
reviewed by Jefferies, Jefferies noted that projecting future results of any company is inherently subject to uncertainty. However, Jefferies was advised,
and Jefferies assumed, that the financial forecasts and estimates relating to Sucampo that Jefferies was directed to utilize in its analyses were reasonably
prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and good faith judgments of the management of Sucampo as to the future financial
performance of Sucampo and the other matters covered thereby. Jefferies expressed no opinion as to any such financial forecasts or estimates or the
assumptions on which they were based. Jefferies relied upon the assessments of the management of Sucampo as to, among other things, (i) the potential
impact on Sucampo of market, competitive and other trends and developments in and prospects for, and governmental, regulatory and legislative matters
relating to or otherwise affecting, the pharmaceutical industry, including with respect to the pricing of and/or reimbursement for pharmaceutical
products, (ii) the products and/or product candidates, technology and intellectual property of Sucampo and associated regulatory approval processes and
risks (including, without limitation, with respect to the development, clinical testing, manufacturing and commercialization of such products and product
candidates, use and indications for such products and product candidates, the validity and duration of patents and the potential for generic competition),
and (iii) existing and future relationships, agreements and arrangements with, and the ability to attract, retain and/or replace, key employees, suppliers,
manufacturers and other commercial and collaboration relationships of Sucampo. Jefferies assumed that there would not be any developments with
respect to any such matters that would be meaningful in any respect to Jefferies’ analyses or opinion.

Jefferies’ opinion was based on economic, monetary, regulatory, market and other conditions existing and which could be evaluated as of the date
of Jefferies’ opinion. Jefferies expressly disclaimed any undertaking or obligation to advise any person of any change in any fact or matter affecting its
opinion of which Jefferies becomes aware after the date of its opinion.

Jefferies made no independent investigation of any legal, regulatory, accounting or tax matters affecting Sucampo, the Offer or the Merger, and
Jefferies assumed the correctness in all respects meaningful to its analyses and opinion of all legal, regulatory, accounting and tax advice given to
Sucampo and/or Sucampo’s board, including, without limitation, advice as to legal, regulatory, accounting and tax consequences to Sucampo and its
stockholders of the terms of, and transactions contemplated by, the Merger Agreement and related documents. In addition, Jefferies did not take into
account for purposes of its opinion and expressed no view as to the impact of any potential or proposed tax reform on Sucampo or any tax or other
consequences of the Offer or the Merger to, or individual circumstances of, any holder of Shares. Jefferies assumed that the Offer and the Merger would
be consummated in accordance with their respective terms without waiver, modification or

amendment of any material term, condition or agreement and in compliance with all applicable laws, documents and other requirements and that, in the
course of obtaining the necessary governmental, regulatory or third party approvals, consents, waivers and releases for the Offer and the Merger,
including with respect to any divestiture or other requirements, no delay, limitation, restriction or condition would be imposed or occur that would have
an adverse effect on Sucampo, the Offer or the Merger or that otherwise would be meaningful in any respect to Jefferies’ analyses or opinion. Jefferies
also assumed that the final Merger Agreement, when signed by the parties thereto, would be substantially similar to the draft reviewed by Jefferies.

Jefferies’ opinion was provided for the use and benefit of Sucampo’s board (in its capacity as such) in its evaluation of the per Share cash
consideration from a financial point of view. Jefferies’ opinion did not address the relative merits of the Offer or the Merger contemplated by the Merger
Agreement as compared to any alternative transaction or opportunity that might be available to Sucampo, nor did it address the underlying business
decision by Sucampo to engage in the Offer or the Merger or the terms of the Merger Agreement or the documents referred to therein, including the
form or structure of the Offer, the Merger or any term, aspect or implication of any support or other agreements, arrangements or understandings entered
into in connection with, or contemplated by or resulting from, the Offer, the Merger or otherwise. Jefferies’ opinion does not constitute a
recommendation as to whether any stockholder should tender Shares in the Offer or how any stockholder should act with respect to the Offer, the
Merger or any other matter. In addition, Jefferies expressed no opinion or view with respect to, and Jefferies’ opinion did not address, the individual
circumstances of, or allocation or relative fairness among, holders of Shares or any other securities of Sucampo, or any rights, preferences, restrictions
or limitations (whether by virtue of control, voting, liquidity or otherwise) that might be attributable to any such securities or that might distinguish any
holders thereof. Jefferies expressed no opinion as to the prices at which Shares or any other securities of Sucampo might trade or otherwise be
transferable at any time. Furthermore, Jefferies did not express any view or opinion as to the fairness, financial or otherwise, of the amount or nature of
any compensation or other consideration payable to or to be received by any officers, directors or employees, or any class of such persons, in connection
with the Offer or the Merger relative to the per Share cash consideration or otherwise. The issuance of Jefferies’ opinion was authorized by Jefferies’
fairness committee.

In connection with rendering its opinion to Sucampo’s board, Jefferies performed a variety of financial and comparative analyses, which are
summarized below. The following summary is not a complete description of all analyses performed and factors considered by Jefferies in connection
with its opinion. The preparation of a financial opinion is a complex process involving subjective judgments and is not necessarily susceptible to partial
analysis or summary description. With respect to the selected public companies and selected precedent transactions analyses summarized below, no
company or transaction used as a comparison was identical or directly comparable to Sucampo, the Offer or the Merger. These analyses necessarily
involved complex considerations and judgments concerning financial and operating characteristics and other factors that could affect the public trading,
acquisition or other values of the companies or transactions concerned.

Jefferies believes that its analyses and the summary below must be considered as a whole and that selecting portions of its analyses and factors or
focusing on information presented in tabular format, without considering all analyses and factors or the narrative description of the analyses, could
create a misleading or incomplete view of the processes underlying Jefferies’ analyses and opinion. Jefferies did not draw, in isolation, conclusions from
or with regard to any one factor or method of analysis for purposes of its opinion, but rather arrived at its ultimate opinion based on the results of all
analyses undertaken by it and assessed as a whole.

The estimates of the future performance of Sucampo in or underlying Jefferies’ analyses are not necessarily indicative of future results or values,
which may be significantly more or less favorable than those estimates. In performing its analyses, Jefferies considered industry performance, general
business and economic conditions and other matters, many of which were beyond the control of Sucampo. Estimates of the financial value of companies
do not purport to be appraisals or necessarily reflect the prices at which companies or securities actually may be sold or acquired. Accordingly, the
estimates used in, and the range of the valuations resulting from, any particular analysis described below are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty
and should not be taken as Jefferies’ view of the actual value of Sucampo or its securities.

Table of Contents

The per Share cash consideration payable in the Offer and the Merger was determined through negotiations between Sucampo and Mallinckrodt,
and the decision by Sucampo to enter into the Merger Agreement was solely that of Sucampo’s board. Jefferies’ opinion and financial analyses were
only one of many factors considered by Sucampo’s board in its evaluation of the per Share cash consideration and should not be viewed as determinative
of the views of Sucampo’s board or management of Sucampo with respect to the Offer, the Merger or the per Share cash consideration.

Financial Analyses

The following is a summary of the material financial analyses reviewed with Sucampo’s board and performed by Jefferies in connection with its
opinion. The financial analyses summarized below include information presented in tabular format. In order to fully understand Jefferies’
financial analyses, the tables must be read together with the text of each summary. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of
the financial analyses. Considering the data below without considering the full narrative description of the financial analyses, including the
methodologies and assumptions underlying the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of Jefferies’ financial analyses. For
purposes of the financial analyses described below, the term “adjusted EBITDA” means earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization as
adjusted for non-cash and certain one-time non-recurring items, as applicable.

Selected Public Companies Analysis. Jefferies reviewed publicly available financial, stock market and operating information of Sucampo and the
following ten selected publicly traded companies in the specialty pharmaceutical industry that, given business and financial characteristics, Jefferies
considered generally relevant for purposes of analysis, collectively referred to in this section of this Schedule 14D-9 as the selected companies:
 

 •  Acorda Therapeutics, Inc.
 

 •  AMAG Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
 

 •  Depomed, Inc.
 

 •  Horizon Pharma plc
 

 •  Indivior PLC
 

 •  Jazz Pharmaceuticals plc
 

 •  PDL BioPharma, Inc.
 

 •  Retrophin, Inc.
 

 •  United Therapeutics Corporation
 

 •  Vanda Pharmaceuticals Inc.

Jefferies reviewed, among other information, enterprise values of the selected companies, calculated as fully diluted equity values based on
closing stock prices on December 22, 2017 plus total debt, preferred equity and non- controlling interests (as applicable) less cash and cash equivalents,
as a multiple, to the extent meaningful, of calendar year 2018 and calendar year 2019 estimated adjusted EBITDA. Financial data of the selected
companies were based on publicly available research analysts’ estimates, public filings and other publicly available information.

The overall low to high calendar year 2018 and calendar year 2019 estimated adjusted EBITDA multiples observed for the selected companies
were 3.6x to 9.7x (with a median of 8.3x) and 4.2x to 10.1x (with a median of 8.0x), respectively. Jefferies then applied selected ranges derived from the
selected companies of calendar year 2018 and calendar year 2019 estimated adjusted EBITDA multiples of 8.0x to 9.0x and 7.5x to 8.5x, respectively, to
corresponding data of Sucampo based on internal estimates of Sucampo’s management. This analysis

Selected Precedent Transactions Analysis. Jefferies reviewed, to the extent publicly available, financial information for the following eight
selected transactions involving target companies in the specialty pharmaceutical industry that, given business and financial characteristics of such target
companies, Jefferies considered generally relevant for purposes of analysis, collectively referred to in this section of this Schedule 14D-9 as the selected
transactions:
 

Date Announced  Acquiror  Target
05/11/17  •   Norgine B.V.  •   Merus Labs International Inc.
01/09/17

 
•   Sanpower Group Co., Ltd.

 
•   Dendreon Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (a subsidiary of Valeant

09/03/12  •   Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc.  •   Medicis Pharmaceutical Corporation
08/17/12  •   Cinven Group Limited  •   Mercury Pharma Group Limited

Jefferies reviewed transaction values of the selected transactions, calculated, to the extent publicly available, as the purchase prices paid for the
target companies involved in such transactions plus total debt, preferred equity and non-controlling interests (as applicable) less cash and cash
equivalents, as a multiple of latest 12 months adjusted EBITDA as of the applicable announcement dates of such transactions. Financial data of the
selected transactions were based on publicly available research analysts’ estimates, public filings and other publicly available information.

The overall low to high latest 12 months adjusted EBITDA multiples observed for the selected transactions were 6.6x to 10.5x (with a median of
9.4x). Jefferies then applied a selected range of latest 12 months adjusted EBITDA multiples of 8.5x to 10.5x derived from the selected transactions to
Sucampo’s latest 12 months (as of December 31, 2017) estimated adjusted EBITDA based on internal estimates of Sucampo’s management. This
analysis indicated the following approximate implied per Share equity value reference range for Sucampo, as compared to the per Share cash
consideration:

Reference Range

Discounted Cash Flow Analysis. Jefferies performed a discounted cash flow analysis of Sucampo by calculating the estimated present value of the
standalone unlevered, after-tax free cash flows that Sucampo was forecasted to generate during the fiscal years ending December 31, 2018 through
December 31, 2027 based on probability-weighted and tax-affected financial forecasts and estimates of Sucampo’s management (inclusive of Sucampo’s
net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes). The implied terminal value of Sucampo was derived by applying to Sucampo’s fiscal
year 2027 unlevered free cash flows a selected range of perpetuity growth rates of (5.0%) to (15.0%). The present values (as of January 1, 2018) of the
cash flows and terminal values were then calculated using a selected discount rate range of 11.0% to 12.0%. This analysis

Certain Additional Information

Jefferies observed certain additional factors that were not considered part of Jefferies’ financial analysis with respect to its opinion but were noted
for informational purposes, including the following:
 

•  the implied premiums paid or proposed to be paid in selected mergers and acquisition transactions in the biopharmaceutical industry announced
from January 1, 2013 and prior to December 22, 2017 with transaction values ranging from $500 million to $2.0 billion and cash consideration of
at least 80% of the total consideration; applying a selected range of implied premiums of approximately 18.5% to 65.7% (reflecting the overall
25th and 75th percentile implied premiums derived from such transactions based on the closing stock prices of the target companies involved in
such transactions one trading day prior to public announcement of such transactions or prior to market speculation of a potential acquisition of the
target, as applicable) to the price per Share as of December 6, 2017 (the last trading day prior to market speculation of a potential acquisition of
Sucampo) indicated an approximate implied per Share equity value reference range for Sucampo of $17.72 to $24.77; and

 

•  illustrative sensitivities reflecting the potential impact of the new U.S. tax reform on the discounted cash flow analysis described above under “—
Discounted Cash Flow Analysis” using effective overall corporate tax rates per Sucampo’s management for the fiscal years ending December 31,
2019 through December 31, 2027 ranging from 26.0% to 31.0%, selected discount rates ranging from 11.0% to 12.1% and a selected range of
perpetuity growth rates of (5.0%) to (15%), which indicated an approximate implied per Share equity value reference range for Sucampo of
$16.60 to $20.20.

Miscellaneous

Sucampo has agreed to pay Jefferies for its financial advisory services in connection with the Offer and the Merger an aggregate fee of
approximately $18.5 million, of which a portion was payable upon delivery of Jefferies’ opinion to Sucampo’s board and approximately $17.0 million is
payable contingent upon consummation of the Offer. In addition, Sucampo agreed to reimburse Jefferies for expenses, including fees and expenses of
counsel, incurred in connection with Jefferies’ engagement, and to indemnify Jefferies and related parties against liabilities, including liabilities under
federal securities laws, arising out of or in connection with the services rendered and to be rendered by Jefferies under its engagement.

As Sucampo’s board was aware, Jefferies and its affiliates in the past provided, currently are providing and in the future may provide financial
advisory and/or financing services unrelated to the Offer and the Merger to Sucampo, Mallinckrodt and certain of their respective affiliates for which
services Jefferies and its affiliates have received and would expect to receive compensation. During the two-year period prior to the date of Jefferies’
opinion, Jefferies and/or certain of its affiliates acted or concurrently were acting as (i) with respect to Sucampo, (a) financial advisor to Sucampo in
connection with the acquisition of Vtesse, Inc. and a potential (but not consummated) acquisition transaction, and (b) administrative agent and collateral
agent for, and as a lender under, a credit facility of Sucampo, and (ii) with respect to Mallinckrodt, as a lender under a credit facility of Mallinckrodt.
During the two-year period prior to the date of Jefferies’ opinion, Jefferies and its affiliates received an aggregate fee of approximately $6 million from
Sucampo for the services described in clauses (i)(a) and (b) above and did not receive financial advisory or financing fees as a syndicate member in
Mallinckrodt’s credit facility referenced in clause (ii) above (other than a customary original issue discount to syndicate members). In addition, Jefferies
maintains a market in the securities of Sucampo and, in the ordinary course of

business, Jefferies and its affiliates may trade or hold securities of Sucampo, Mallinckrodt and certain of their respective affiliates for Jefferies’ own
account and for the accounts of Jefferies’ customers and, accordingly, may at any time hold long or short positions in those securities.

Jefferies was selected as Sucampo’s financial advisor in connection with the Offer and the Merger because Jefferies is an internationally
recognized investment banking firm with substantial experience in merger and acquisition transactions and its familiarity with Sucampo and its business.
Jefferies is regularly engaged in the valuation of businesses and their securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions, leveraged buyouts,
negotiated underwritings, competitive bids, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities and private placements.

(v) Intent to Tender

As of December 31, 2017, our directors and executive officers, as a group, beneficially owned 1,669,091 Shares (excluding shares of capital stock
of Sucampo issuable upon the exercise of Stock Options or the settlement of RSUs, unless such Stock Options or RSUs are exercisable or issuable
within 60 days of December 31, 2017), representing approximately 3.5% of the then outstanding Shares. To our knowledge, after making reasonable
inquiry, all of our executive officers and directors currently intend to tender, or cause to be tendered pursuant to the Offer, all Shares held of record by
such persons immediately prior to the expiration of the Offer. The foregoing does not include any Shares over which, or with respect to which, any such
executive officer or director acts in a fiduciary or representative capacity or is subject to the instructions of a third party with respect to such tender.

 
Item 5. Person/Assets Retained, Employed, Compensated or Used.

Neither Sucampo nor any person acting on its behalf has or currently intends to employ, retain or compensate any person to make solicitations or
recommendations to the stockholders of Sucampo on its behalf with respect to the Offer, the Merger or related matters.

 
Item 6. Interest in Securities of the Subject Company.

Except for (i) the exercise, pursuant to a pre-existing trading plan, by Dr. Kiener of a Stock Option to purchase 50,000 Shares at an exercise price
of $8.33 per Share on December 7, 2017 and (ii) 129,118 Shares underlying RSUs the vesting of which was accelerated effective December 22, 2017,
no transactions with respect to our Shares have been effected by us or, to our knowledge after making reasonable inquiry, by any of our executive
officers, directors or affiliates during the 60 days prior to the date of this Schedule 14D-9.

 
Item 7. Purposes of the Transaction and Plans or Proposals.

(a) Except as set forth in this Schedule 14D-9 (including in the exhibits and annexes hereto) or as incorporated in this Schedule 14D-9 by
reference, no negotiations are being undertaken or are underway by us in response to the Offer which relate to a tender offer or other acquisition of our
securities by Sucampo, any subsidiary of Sucampo or any other person.

(b) Except as set forth in this Schedule 14D-9 (including in the exhibits and annexes hereto) or as incorporated in this Schedule 14D-9 by
reference, no negotiations are being undertaken or are underway by us in response to the Offer which relate to, or would result in (i) any extraordinary
transaction, such as a merger, reorganization or liquidation, involving Sucampo or any subsidiary of Sucampo, (ii) any purchase, sale or transfer of a
material amount of assets of Sucampo or any subsidiary of Sucampo, or (iii) any material change in the present dividend rate or policy, or indebtedness

(c) We have agreed that from the date of the Merger Agreement to the Effective Time or the date, if any, on which the Merger Agreement is
terminated, we will not, among other matters, solicit alternative acquisition offers. In addition, we have agreed to certain procedures that we must follow
in the event Sucampo receives an unsolicited acquisition proposal. The information set forth in Section 11—“The Merger Agreement; Other
Agreements” of the Offer to Purchase under the heading “No Solicitation” is incorporated herein by reference.

(d) Except as set forth in this Schedule 14D-9 (including in the exhibits and annexes hereto) or as incorporated in this Schedule 14D-9 by
reference, there are no transactions, resolutions of our board of directors, agreements in principle or signed contracts in response to the Offer that relate

Item 8. Additional Information.

Golden Parachute Compensation

See “Item 3. Past Contacts, Transactions, Negotiations and Agreements—Arrangements between Sucampo and its Executive Officers, Directors
and Affiliates—Golden Parachute Compensation.”

Conditions to the Offer

The information set forth in Section 15—“Conditions of the Offer”—of the Offer to Purchase is incorporated herein by reference.

Stockholder Approval Not Required

On December 22, 2017, our board of directors unanimously (a) determined that the Merger Agreement and transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement, including the Offer and the Merger, are advisable and fair to, and in the best interest of, Sucampo and its stockholders, (b) approved
the execution, delivery and performance by Sucampo of the Merger Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement, including the Offer and the Merger, (c) agreed that the Merger Agreement shall be subject to Section 251(h) of the DGCL, (d) resolved to
recommend that the stockholders of Sucampo accept the Offer and tender their shares to Mallinckrodt pursuant to the Offer and, with Mr. Greenleaf
abstaining as to his compensation and (e) approved each of the compensation related actions proposed by the compensation committee of our board of
directors.

If Sun Acquisition acquires, pursuant to the Offer, a number of Shares that, when considered together with all other Shares (if any) otherwise
beneficially owned by Mallinckrodt or any of its wholly owned subsidiaries (including Sun Acquisition), represent at least one more than 50% of the
total number of Shares outstanding at the time of the expiration of the Offer, Sun Acquisition will be able to effect the Merger after consummation of the
Offer pursuant to Section 251(h) of the DGCL, without a vote by our stockholders.

State Takeover Laws

A number of states (including Delaware, where we are incorporated) have adopted takeover laws and regulations which purport, to varying
degrees, to be applicable to attempts to acquire securities of corporations which are incorporated in such states or which have substantial assets,
stockholders, principal executive offices or principal places of business therein.

In general, Section 203 of the DGCL prevents a Delaware corporation from engaging in a “business combination” (defined to include mergers and
certain other actions) with an “interested stockholder” (including a person who owns or has the right to acquire 15% or more of a corporation’s
outstanding voting stock) for a period of three years following the time such person became an “interested stockholder” unless, among other things, the
“business combination” is approved by the board of directors of such corporation before such person became an “interested stockholder.”

Table of Contents

In accordance with the provisions of Section 203 of the DGCL, our board of directors has approved the Merger Agreement and the Transactions,
as described in Item 4 above, for purposes of Section 203 of the DGCL.

Notice of Appraisal Rights

No appraisal rights are available in connection with the Offer. However, if the Offer is successful and the Merger is consummated, stockholders of
Sucampo who have not properly tendered their Shares in the Offer and have neither voted in favor of the Merger nor consented thereto in writing, and
who otherwise comply with the applicable procedures under Section 262 of the DGCL, will be entitled to receive appraisal rights for the “fair value” of
their Shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL. Stockholders should be aware that the fair value of their Shares could be more than, the same
as or less than the consideration to be received pursuant to the Merger and that an investment banking opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point
of view, of the consideration payable in a sale transaction, such as the Offer and the Merger, is not an opinion as to, and does not otherwise address, fair
value under Section 262 of the DGCL. Any stockholder contemplating the exercise of such appraisal rights should review carefully the provisions of
Section 262 of the DGCL, particularly the procedural steps required to perfect such rights.

The following is a summary of the procedures to be followed by stockholders that wish to exercise their appraisal rights under Section 262 of the
DGCL, the full text of which is attached to this Schedule 14D-9 as Annex II. This summary does not purport to be a complete statement of, and is
qualified in its entirety by reference to, Section 262 of the DGCL and to any amendments to such section adopted or otherwise made effective after the
date of this Schedule 14D-9. Failure to follow any of the procedures of Section 262 of the DGCL may result in termination or waiver of appraisal rights
under Section 262 of the DGCL. Stockholders should assume that Sucampo will take no action to perfect any appraisal rights of any stockholder.

Any stockholder who desires to exercise his, her or its appraisal rights should review carefully Section 262 of the DGCL and is urged to
consult his, her or its legal advisor before electing or attempting to exercise such rights.

Under Section 262 of the DGCL, where a merger is approved under Section 251(h), either a constituent corporation before the effective date of the
merger, or the surviving corporation within ten days thereafter, shall notify each of the holders of any class or series of stock of such constituent
corporation who are entitled to appraisal rights of the approval of the merger or consolidation and that appraisal rights are available for any or all shares
of such class or series of stock of such constituent corporation, and shall include in such notice a copy of Section 262. This Schedule 14D-9 constitutes
the formal notice of appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL. Any holder of Shares who wishes to exercise such appraisal rights or who
wishes to preserve his, her or its right to do so should review the following discussion and Annex II carefully because failure to timely and properly
comply with the procedures specified will result in the loss of appraisal rights under the DGCL.

If a stockholder elects to exercise appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL, such stockholder must do all of the following:
 

 
•  prior to the later of the consummation of the Offer and 20 days after the mailing of this Schedule 14D-9, deliver to Sucampo at the address

indicated below a written demand for appraisal of Shares held, which demand must reasonably inform Sucampo of the identity of the
stockholder and that the stockholder is demanding appraisal;

 

 •  not tender such stockholder’s Shares in the Offer; and
 

 •  continuously hold of record the Shares from the date on which the written demand for appraisal is made through the Effective Time.

Table of Contents

Written Demand by the Record Holder

All written demands for appraisal should be addressed to Sucampo Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 805 King Farm Boulevard, Suite 550, Rockville,
Maryland, 20850. Attention: Alex Driggs, General Counsel. The demand for appraisal must be executed by or for the stockholder of record, fully and
correctly, as such stockholder’s name appears on the stockholder’s certificates (whether in book entry or on physical certificates) evidencing such
stockholder’s Shares. If the Shares are owned of record in a fiduciary capacity, such as by a trustee, guardian or custodian, the demand should be made
in that capacity, and if the Shares are owned of record by more than one person, as in a joint tenancy or tenancy in common, the demand must be made
by or for all owners of record. An authorized agent, including one or more joint owners, may execute the demand for appraisal for a stockholder of
record; however, such agent must identify the record owner or owners and expressly disclose in such demand that the agent is acting as agent for the
record owner or owners of such Shares.

A record stockholder, such as a broker who holds Shares as a nominee for beneficial owners, some or all of whom desire to demand appraisal,
must exercise rights on behalf of such beneficial owners with respect to the Shares held for such beneficial owners. In such case, the written demand for
appraisal must set forth the number of shares covered by such demand. Unless a demand for appraisal specifies a number of Shares, such demand will
be presumed to cover all Shares held in the name of such record owner.

Filing a Petition for Appraisal

Within 120 days after the Effective Time, but not thereafter, the Surviving Corporation, or any holder of Shares who has complied with
Section 262 of the DGCL and is entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262 may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition (a “Petition”)
in the Delaware Court of Chancery (the “Delaware Court”) demanding a determination of the fair value of the Shares held by all holders who did not
tender in the Offer and demanded appraisal. If no such petition is filed within that 120-day period, appraisal rights will be lost for all holders of Shares
who had previously demanded appraisal of their Shares. Sucampo is under no obligation to and has no present intention to file a petition and holders
should not assume that Sucampo will file a petition or that it will initiate any negotiations with respect to the fair value of the Shares. Accordingly, it is
the obligation of the holders of Shares to initiate all necessary action to perfect their appraisal rights in respect of the Shares within the period prescribed
in Section 262 of the DGCL.

Within 120 days after the Effective Time, any holder of Shares who has complied with the requirements for exercise of appraisal rights will be
entitled, upon written request, to receive from the Surviving Corporation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of Shares not tendered into the
Offer and with respect to which demands for appraisal have been received and the aggregate number of holders of such Shares. Such statement must be
mailed within 10 days after a written request therefor has been received by the Surviving Corporation or within 10 days after the expiration of the period
for delivery of demands for appraisal, whichever is later. Notwithstanding the foregoing requirement that a demand for appraisal must be made by or on
behalf of the record owner of the Shares, a person who is the beneficial owner of Shares held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such
person, and as to which demand has been properly made and not effectively withdrawn, may, in such person’s own name, file a petition for appraisal or
request from the Surviving Corporation the statement described in this paragraph.

Upon the filing of such petition by any such holder of Shares (a “Dissenting Stockholder”), service of a copy thereof must be made upon the
Surviving Corporation, which will then be obligated within 20 days to file with the Delaware Register in Chancery a duly verified list containing the
names and addresses of all stockholders who have demanded payment for their Shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their Shares has not
been reached. Upon the filing of a Petition by a Dissenting Stockholder, the Delaware Court may order a hearing and that notice of the time and place
fixed for the hearing on the Petition be mailed to the Surviving Corporation and all the Dissenting Stockholders. Notice will also be published at least
one week before the day of the hearing in a newspaper of general circulation published in the City of Wilmington, Delaware, or in

another publication deemed advisable by the Delaware Court. The costs relating to these notices will be borne by the Surviving Corporation.

If a hearing on the Petition is held, the Delaware Court is empowered to determine which Dissenting Stockholders have complied with the
provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL and are entitled to an appraisal of their Shares. The Delaware Court may require that Dissenting Stockholders
submit their Share certificates for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings. The Delaware Court is empowered to dismiss the
proceedings as to any Dissenting Stockholder who does not comply with such requirement. Accordingly, Dissenting Stockholders are cautioned to retain
their Share certificates pending resolution of the appraisal proceedings. If immediately before the Effective Time, the Shares were listed on a national
securities exchange, the Delaware Court shall dismiss the proceedings as to all holders of such shares who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights
unless (1) the total number of shares entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of the class or series eligible for appraisal, (2) the value
of the consideration provided in the merger or consolidation for such total number of shares exceeds $1 million, or (3) the merger was approved
pursuant to Section 253 or Section 267 of the DGCL.

The Shares will be appraised by the Delaware Court at the fair value thereof exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or
expectation of the Merger, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. Unless the Delaware Court in its
discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest from the Effective Time through the date of payment of the judgment will be
compounded quarterly and will accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during
the period between the Effective Time and the date of payment of the judgment. In determining the value, the court is to take into account all relevant
factors. At any time before the entry of judgment in the proceedings, the Surviving Corporation may pay to each stockholder entitled to appraisal an
amount in cash, in which case interest shall accrue thereafter as provided herein only upon the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the amount so
paid and the fair value of the shares as determined by the Delaware Court, and (2) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time.

The Delaware Court may also (i) assess costs of the proceeding among the parties as the Delaware Court deems equitable and (ii) order all or a
portion of the expenses incurred by any Dissenting Stockholder in connection with the appraisal proceeding, including, without limitation, reasonable
attorneys’ fees and fees and expenses of experts, to be charged pro rata against the value of all shares entitled to appraisal. Determinations by the
Delaware Court are subject to appellate review by the Delaware Supreme Court.

Dissenting Stockholders are generally permitted to participate in the appraisal proceedings. No appraisal proceedings in the Delaware Court shall
be dismissed as to any Dissenting Stockholder without the approval of the Delaware Court, and this approval may be conditioned upon terms which the
Delaware Court deems just.

Stockholders considering whether to seek appraisal should bear in mind that the fair value of their Shares determined under Section 262 of the
DGCL could be more than, the same as, or less than the value of consideration to be issued and paid in the Merger as set forth in the Merger Agreement.
Also, the Surviving Corporation may assert in any appraisal proceeding that, for purposes thereof, the “fair value” of the Shares is less than the value of
the consideration to be issued and paid in the Merger as set forth in the Merger Agreement.

The process of dissenting and exercising appraisal rights requires strict compliance with technical prerequisites. Stockholders wishing to dissent
should consult with their own legal counsel in connection with compliance with Section 262 of the DGCL.

Any stockholder who has duly demanded and perfected appraisal rights in compliance with Section 262 of the DGCL will not, after the Effective
Time, be entitled to vote his or her Shares for any purpose or be entitled to the payment of dividends or other distributions thereon, except dividends or
other distributions payable to holders of record of Shares as of a date prior to the Effective Time.

If any stockholder who demands appraisal of Shares under Section 262 of the DGCL fails to perfect, successfully withdraws or loses such holder’s
right to appraisal, such stockholder’s Shares will be deemed to have been converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration. A stockholder will fail to perfect, or effectively lose, the stockholder’s right to appraisal if no petition for appraisal is filed within 120
days after the Effective Time. In addition, as indicated above, a stockholder may withdraw his, her or its demand for appraisal in accordance with
Section 262 of the DGCL and accept the Merger Consideration.

This summary of appraisal rights under the DGCL is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to Section 262 of the DGCL and the
Offer.

STOCKHOLDERS WHO SELL SHARES IN THE OFFER WILL NOT BE ENTITLED TO EXERCISE APPRAISAL RIGHTS WITH
RESPECT THERETO BUT, RATHER, WILL RECEIVE THE OFFER PRICE.

Legal Proceedings

There are currently no legal proceedings relating to the Offer or the Merger.

U.S. Antitrust Compliance

Under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the “HSR Act”), and the related rules and regulations that have
been issued by the Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”), certain transactions may not be consummated until required information and documentary
material has been furnished to the FTC and the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the “Antitrust Division”) and the applicable waiting
period requirements have been satisfied. These requirements apply to Sun Acquisition’s acquisition of the Shares in the Offer and the Merger.

Under the HSR Act, the purchase of Shares in the Offer may not be completed until the expiration of a 15 calendar day waiting period which
begins when Mallinckrodt files a Premerger Notification and Report Form under the HSR Act with the FTC and the Antitrust Division, unless such
waiting period is earlier terminated by the FTC and the Antitrust Division. Sucampo also must file a Premerger Notification and Report Form no later
than 5:00 p.m., Eastern time on the 15th business day following the date of the Merger Agreement. If the end of the 15-calendar-day waiting period is set
to fall on a federal holiday or weekend day, the waiting period is automatically extended until 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on the next business day.
A Premerger Notification and Report Form under the HSR Act was filed by each of Mallinckrodt and Sucampo with the FTC and the Antitrust Division
in connection with the purchase of Shares in the Offer on Friday, January 12, 2018. Accordingly, the required waiting period with respect to the Offer
will expire at 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on Monday, January 29, 2018, unless earlier terminated by the FTC and the Antitrust Division, or
Mallinckrodt receives a request for additional information or documentary material prior to that time. With the written consent of Sucampo,
Mallinckrodt may elect to withdraw and re-file the Premerger Notification and Report Form, which would result in the initiation of a new
15-calendar-day waiting period. If prior to the expiration or termination of the waiting period either the FTC or the Antitrust Division issues a request
for additional information or documentary material from Mallinckrodt, the waiting period with respect to the Offer would be extended until the 10th
calendar day following the date of Mallinckrodt’s substantial compliance with that request. The FTC or the Antitrust Division may terminate the
applicable waiting period at any time before its expiration.

Mallinckrodt and Sucampo and certain of their subsidiaries conduct business in several countries outside of the United States. Mallinckrodt
determined that no foreign antitrust filings would be required in connection with the Merger.

ANNEX I

OPINION OF JEFFERIES LLC

December 22, 2017

The Board of Directors
Sucampo Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
805 King Farm Boulevard, Suite 550
Rockville, Maryland 20850

The Board of Directors:

We understand that Sucampo Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Sucampo”), Mallinckrodt plc, an Irish public limited company
(“Mallinckrodt”), and Sun Acquisition Co., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Mallinckrodt (“Purchaser”), propose to enter into
an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) pursuant to which (i) Purchaser will commence a tender offer (the “Tender Offer”) to
purchase all outstanding shares of Class A common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Sucampo (“Sucampo Class A Common Stock”) at a purchase
price of $18.00 per share in cash (the “Consideration”) and (ii) subsequent to consummation of the Tender Offer, Purchaser will be merged with and into
Sucampo (the “Merger” and, together with the Tender Offer as an integrated transaction, the “Transaction”) and each outstanding share of Sucampo
Class A Common Stock not previously tendered will be converted into the right to receive the Consideration. The terms and conditions of the
Transaction are more fully set forth in the Merger Agreement.

You have asked for our opinion as to whether the Consideration to be received in the Transaction by holders of Sucampo Class A Common Stock
(other than Mallinckrodt, Purchaser and their respective affiliates) pursuant to the Merger Agreement is fair, from a financial point of view, to such
holders.

In arriving at our opinion, we have, among other things:
 

(i) reviewed a draft, dated December 22, 2017, of the Merger Agreement;
 

(ii) reviewed certain publicly available financial and other information regarding Sucampo;
 

(iii) reviewed certain information furnished to us by the management of Sucampo relating to the businesses, operations and prospects of Sucampo,
including probability-weighted and tax-affected financial forecasts and estimates provided by the management of Sucampo;

 

(iv) held discussions with members of the senior management of Sucampo concerning the matters described in clauses (ii) and (iii) above;
 

(v) reviewed the stock trading price history and implied trading multiples for Sucampo and compared them with those of certain publicly traded
companies that we deemed relevant in evaluating Sucampo;

 

(vi) compared the financial terms of the Transaction with publicly available financial terms of certain other transactions that we deemed relevant in
evaluating the Transaction; and

 

(vii) conducted such other financial studies, analyses and investigations as we deemed appropriate.

In our review and analysis and in rendering this opinion, we have assumed and relied upon, but have not assumed any responsibility to
independently investigate or verify, the accuracy and completeness of all financial and other information that was supplied or otherwise made available
by Sucampo or that was publicly available to us (including, without limitation, the information described above) or otherwise reviewed by us. We have
relied on assurances of the management and other representatives of Sucampo that they are not aware of any facts or circumstances that would make
such information incomplete, inaccurate or misleading. In our review, we did not obtain any independent evaluation or appraisal of any of the assets or
liabilities (contingent, derivative, off-balance sheet or otherwise), nor did we conduct a physical inspection of any of the properties or facilities, of
Sucampo or any other entity and we have not been furnished with, and assume no responsibility to obtain, any such evaluations, appraisals or physical
inspections.

The Board of Directors
Sucampo Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
December 22, 2017
 

With respect to the financial forecasts and estimates (including as to certain tax attributes of Sucampo on a standalone basis) provided to and
reviewed by us, we note that projecting future results of any company is inherently subject to uncertainty. However, we have been advised, and we have
assumed, that the financial forecasts and estimates relating to Sucampo that we have been directed to utilize in our analyses have been reasonably
prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and good faith judgments of the management of Sucampo as to the future financial
performance of Sucampo and the other matters covered thereby. We express no opinion as to any such financial forecasts or estimates or the
assumptions on which they are based. We have relied upon the assessments of the management of Sucampo as to, among other things, (i) the potential
impact on Sucampo of market, competitive and other trends and developments in and prospects for, and governmental, regulatory and legislative matters
relating to or otherwise affecting, the pharmaceutical industry, including with respect to the pricing of and/or reimbursement for pharmaceutical
products, (ii) the products and/or product candidates, technology and intellectual property of Sucampo and associated regulatory approval processes and
risks (including, without limitation, with respect to the development, clinical testing, manufacturing and commercialization of such products and product
candidates, use and indications for such products and product candidates, the validity and duration of patents and the potential for generic competition),
and (iii) existing and future relationships, agreements and arrangements with, and the ability to attract, retain and/or replace, key employees, suppliers,
manufacturers and other commercial and collaboration relationships of Sucampo. We have assumed that there will not be any developments with respect
to any such matters that would be meaningful in any respect to our analyses or opinion.

Our opinion is based on economic, monetary, regulatory, market and other conditions existing and which can be evaluated as of the date hereof.
We expressly disclaim any undertaking or obligation to advise any person of any change in any fact or matter affecting our opinion of which we become
aware after the date hereof.

We have made no independent investigation of any legal, regulatory, accounting or tax matters affecting Sucampo or the Transaction and we have
assumed the correctness in all respects meaningful to our analyses and opinion of all legal, regulatory, accounting and tax advice given to Sucampo
and/or the Board of Directors of Sucampo (the “Board”), including, without limitation, advice as to legal, regulatory, accounting and tax consequences
to Sucampo and its stockholders of the terms of, and transactions contemplated by, the Merger Agreement and related documents. In addition, we have
not taken into account for purposes of our opinion and express no view as to the impact of any potential or proposed tax reform on Sucampo or any tax
or other consequences of the Transaction to, or individual circumstances of, any holder of Sucampo Class A Common Stock. We have assumed that the
Transaction will be consummated in accordance with its terms without waiver, modification or amendment of any material term, condition or agreement
and in compliance with all applicable laws, documents and other requirements and that, in the course of obtaining the necessary governmental,
regulatory or third party approvals, consents, waivers and releases for the Transaction, including with respect to any divestiture or other requirements, no
delay, limitation, restriction or condition will be imposed or occur that would have an adverse effect on Sucampo or the Transaction or that otherwise
would be meaningful in any respect to our analyses or opinion. We also have assumed that the final Merger Agreement, when signed by the parties
thereto, will be substantially similar to the draft reviewed by us.

It is understood that our opinion is for the use and benefit of the Board (in its capacity as such) in its evaluation of the Consideration from a
financial point of view. Our opinion does not address the relative merits of the Transaction contemplated by the Merger Agreement as compared to any
alternative transaction or opportunity that might be available to Sucampo, nor does it address the underlying business decision by Sucampo to engage in
the Transaction or the terms of the Merger Agreement or the documents referred to therein, including the form or structure of the Transaction or any
term, aspect or implication of any support or other agreements, arrangements or understandings entered into in connection with, or contemplated by or
resulting

from, the Transaction or otherwise. Our opinion does not constitute a recommendation as to whether any stockholder should tender shares of Sucampo
Class A Common Stock in the Tender Offer or how any stockholder should act with respect to the Transaction or any other matter. In addition, no
opinion or view is expressed with respect to, and this opinion does not address, the individual circumstances of, or allocation or relative fairness among,
holders of Sucampo Class A Common Stock or any other securities of Sucampo, or any rights, preferences, restrictions or limitations (whether by virtue
of control, voting, liquidity or otherwise) that may be attributable to any such securities or that may distinguish any holders thereof. We express no
opinion as to the prices at which shares of Sucampo Class A Common Stock or any other securities of Sucampo may trade or otherwise be transferable
at any time. Furthermore, we do not express any view or opinion as to the fairness, financial or otherwise, of the amount or nature of any compensation
or other consideration payable to or to be received by any officers, directors or employees, or any class of such persons, in connection with the
Transaction relative to the Consideration or otherwise. The issuance of our opinion has been authorized by the Fairness Committee of Jefferies LLC.

We have been engaged by Sucampo to act as its financial advisor in connection with the Transaction and will receive a fee for our services, of
which a portion is payable upon delivery of this opinion and the principal portion is contingent upon consummation of the Tender Offer. In addition,
Sucampo has agreed to reimburse us for expenses incurred in connection with our engagement and to indemnify us against liabilities arising out of or in
connection with the services rendered and to be rendered by us under such engagement.

As you are aware, we and our affiliates in the past have provided, currently are providing and in the future may provide financial advisory and/or
financing services unrelated to the Transaction to Sucampo, Mallinckrodt and their respective affiliates for which services we and our affiliates have
received and would expect to receive compensation, including, during the past two years, having acted or acting as (i) with respect to Sucampo,
(a) financial advisor to Sucampo in connection with an acquisition transaction and a potential (but not consummated) acquisition transaction, and
(b) administrative agent and collateral agent for, and as a lender under, a credit facility of Sucampo, and (ii) with respect to Mallinckrodt, as a lender
under a credit facility of Mallinckrodt. In addition, we maintain a market in the securities of Sucampo and, in the ordinary course of business, we and
our affiliates may trade or hold securities of Sucampo, Mallinckrodt and certain of their respective affiliates for our own account and for the accounts of
our customers and, accordingly, may at any time hold long or short positions in those securities.

Based upon and subject to the foregoing, we are of the opinion that, as of the date hereof, the Consideration to be received in the Transaction by
holders of Sucampo Class A Common Stock (other than Mallinckrodt, Purchaser and their respective affiliates) pursuant to the Merger Agreement is
fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.

Very truly yours,

JEFFERIES LLC

ANNEX II

SECTION 262 OF THE DELAWARE GENERAL CORPORATION LAW, APPRAISAL RIGHTS

§ 262. Appraisal rights

(a) Any stockholder of a corporation of this State who holds shares of stock on the date of the making of a demand pursuant to subsection (d) of
this section with respect to such shares, who continuously holds such shares through the effective date of the merger or consolidation, who has otherwise
complied with subsection (d) of this section and who has neither voted in favor of the merger or consolidation nor consented thereto in writing pursuant
to § 228 of this title shall be entitled to an appraisal by the Court of Chancery of the fair value of the stockholder’s shares of stock under the
circumstances described in subsections (b) and (c) of this section. As used in this section, the word “stockholder” means a holder of record of stock in a
corporation; the words “stock” and “share” mean and include what is ordinarily meant by those words; and the words “depository receipt” mean a
receipt or other instrument issued by a depository representing an interest in one or more shares, or fractions thereof, solely of stock of a corporation,
which stock is deposited with the depository.

(b) Appraisal rights shall be available for the shares of any class or series of stock of a constituent corporation in a merger or consolidation to be
effected pursuant to § 251 (other than a merger effected pursuant to § 251(g) of this title and, subject to paragraph (b)(3) of this section, § 251(h) of this
title), § 252, § 254, § 255, § 256, § 257, § 258, § 263 or § 264 of this title:

(1) Provided, however, that, except as expressly provided in § 363(b) of this title, no appraisal rights under this section shall be available for
the shares of any class or series of stock, which stock, or depository receipts in respect thereof, at the record date fixed to determine the
stockholders entitled to receive notice of the meeting of stockholders to act upon the agreement of merger or consolidation, were either: (i) listed
on a national securities exchange or (ii) held of record by more than 2,000 holders; and further provided that no appraisal rights shall be available
for any shares of stock of the constituent corporation surviving a merger if the merger did not require for its approval the vote of the stockholders
of the surviving corporation as provided in § 251(f) of this title.

(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1) of this section, appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the shares of any class or series
of stock of a constituent corporation if the holders thereof are required by the terms of an agreement of merger or consolidation pursuant to §§
251, 252, 254, 255, 256, 257, 258, 263 and 264 of this title to accept for such stock anything except:

a. Shares of stock of the corporation surviving or resulting from such merger or consolidation, or depository receipts in respect thereof;

b. Shares of stock of any other corporation, or depository receipts in respect thereof, which shares of stock (or depository receipts in
respect thereof) or depository receipts at the effective date of the merger or consolidation will be either listed on a national securities
exchange or held of record by more than 2,000 holders;

c. Cash in lieu of fractional shares or fractional depository receipts described in the foregoing paragraphs (b)(2)a. and b. of this
section; or

nearly as practicable, with the word “amendment” substituted for the words “merger or consolidation”, and the word “corporation” substituted for
the words “constituent corporation” and/or “surviving or resulting corporation”.

(c) Any corporation may provide in its certificate of incorporation that appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the shares of any
class or series of its stock as a result of an amendment to its certificate of incorporation, any merger or consolidation in which the corporation is a
constituent corporation or the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the corporation. If the certificate of incorporation contains such a provision,
the provisions of this section, including those set forth in subsections (d), (e) and (g) of this section, shall apply as nearly as is practicable.

(d) Appraisal rights shall be perfected as follows:

(1) If a proposed merger or consolidation for which appraisal rights are provided under this section is to be submitted for approval at a
meeting of stockholders, the corporation, not less than 20 days prior to the meeting, shall notify each of its stockholders who was such on the
record date for notice of such meeting (or such members who received notice in accordance with § 255(c) of this title) with respect to shares for
which appraisal rights are available pursuant to subsection (b) or (c) of this section that appraisal rights are available for any or all of the shares of
the constituent corporations, and shall include in such notice a copy of this section and, if one of the constituent corporations is a nonstock
corporation, a copy of § 114 of this title. Each stockholder electing to demand the appraisal of such stockholder’s shares shall deliver to the
corporation, before the taking of the vote on the merger or consolidation, a written demand for appraisal of such stockholder’s shares. Such
demand will be sufficient if it reasonably informs the corporation of the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to
demand the appraisal of such stockholder’s shares. A proxy or vote against the merger or consolidation shall not constitute such a demand. A
stockholder electing to take such action must do so by a separate written demand as herein provided. Within 10 days after the effective date of
such merger or consolidation, the surviving or resulting corporation shall notify each stockholder of each constituent corporation who has
complied with this subsection and has not voted in favor of or consented to the merger or consolidation of the date that the merger or consolidation
has become effective; or

(2) If the merger or consolidation was approved pursuant to § 228, § 251(h), § 253 or § 267 of this title, then either a constituent corporation
before the effective date of the merger or consolidation or the surviving or resulting corporation within 10 days thereafter shall notify each of the
holders of any class or series of stock of such constituent corporation who are entitled to appraisal rights of the approval of the merger or
consolidation and that appraisal rights are available for any or all shares of such class or series of stock of such constituent corporation, and shall
include in such notice a copy of this section and, if one of the constituent corporations is a nonstock corporation, a copy of § 114 of this title. Such
notice may, and, if given on or after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, shall, also notify such stockholders of the effective date of
the merger or consolidation. Any stockholder entitled to appraisal rights may, within 20 days after the date of mailing of such notice or, in the case
of a merger approved pursuant to § 251(h) of this title, within the later of the consummation of the offer contemplated by § 251(h) of this title and
20 days after the date of mailing of such notice, demand in writing from the surviving or resulting corporation the appraisal of such holder’s
shares. Such demand will be sufficient if it reasonably informs the corporation of the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends
thereby to demand the appraisal of such holder’s shares. If such notice did not notify stockholders of the effective date of the merger or
consolidation, either (i) each such constituent corporation shall send a second notice before the effective date of the merger or consolidation
notifying each of the holders of any class or series of stock of such constituent corporation that are entitled to appraisal rights of the effective date
of the merger or consolidation or (ii) the surviving or resulting corporation shall send such a second notice to all such holders on or within 10 days
after such effective date; provided, however, that if such second notice is sent more than 20 days following the sending of the first notice or, in the
case of a merger approved pursuant to § 251(h) of this title, later than the later of the consummation of the offer contemplated by § 251(h) of this

title and 20 days following the sending of the first notice, such second notice need only be sent to each stockholder who is entitled to appraisal
rights and who has demanded appraisal of such holder’s shares in accordance with this subsection. An affidavit of the secretary or assistant
secretary or of the transfer agent of the corporation that is required to give either notice that such notice has been given shall, in the absence of
fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein. For purposes of determining the stockholders entitled to receive either notice, each
constituent corporation may fix, in advance, a record date that shall be not more than 10 days prior to the date the notice is given, provided, that if
the notice is given on or after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, the record date shall be such effective date. If no record date is
fixed and the notice is given prior to the effective date, the record date shall be the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which
the notice is given.

(e) Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, the surviving or resulting corporation or any stockholder who has
complied with subsections (a) and (d) of this section hereof and who is otherwise entitled to appraisal rights, may commence an appraisal proceeding by
filing a petition in the Court of Chancery demanding a determination of the value of the stock of all such stockholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at
any time within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or
joined that proceeding as a named party shall have the right to withdraw such stockholder’s demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon
the merger or consolidation. Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, any stockholder who has complied with the
requirements of subsections (a) and (d) of this section hereof, upon written request, shall be entitled to receive from the corporation surviving the merger
or resulting from the consolidation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the merger or consolidation and with
respect to which demands for appraisal have been received and the aggregate number of holders of such shares. Such written statement shall be mailed
to the stockholder within 10 days after such stockholder’s written request for such a statement is received by the surviving or resulting corporation or
within 10 days after expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal under subsection (d) of this section hereof, whichever is later.
Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, a person who is the beneficial owner of shares of such stock held either in a voting trust or by a nominee
on behalf of such person may, in such person’s own name, file a petition or request from the corporation the statement described in this subsection.

(f) Upon the filing of any such petition by a stockholder, service of a copy thereof shall be made upon the surviving or resulting corporation,
which shall within 20 days after such service file in the office of the Register in Chancery in which the petition was filed a duly verified list containing
the names and addresses of all stockholders who have demanded payment for their shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares have
not been reached by the surviving or resulting corporation. If the petition shall be filed by the surviving or resulting corporation, the petition shall be
accompanied by such a duly verified list. The Register in Chancery, if so ordered by the Court, shall give notice of the time and place fixed for the
hearing of such petition by registered or certified mail to the surviving or resulting corporation and to the stockholders shown on the list at the addresses
therein stated. Such notice shall also be given by one or more publications at least one week before the day of the hearing, in a newspaper of general
circulation published in the City of Wilmington, Delaware or such publication as the Court deems advisable. The forms of the notices by mail and by
publication shall be approved by the Court, and the costs thereof shall be borne by the surviving or resulting corporation.

(g) At the hearing on such petition, the Court shall determine the stockholders who have complied with this section and who have become entitled
to appraisal rights. The Court may require the stockholders who have demanded an appraisal for their shares and who hold stock represented by
certificates to submit their certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings; and if any
stockholder fails to comply with such direction, the Court may dismiss the proceedings as to such stockholder. If immediately before the merger or
consolidation the shares of the class or series of stock of the constituent corporation as to which appraisal rights are available were listed on a national
securities exchange, the Court shall dismiss the proceedings as to all holders of such shares who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless (1) the
total number of shares entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of the class or series

eligible for appraisal, (2) the value of the consideration provided in the merger or consolidation for such total number of shares exceeds $1 million, or
(3) the merger was approved pursuant to § 253 or § 267 of this title.

(h) After the Court determines the stockholders entitled to an appraisal, the appraisal proceeding shall be conducted in accordance with the rules
of the Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings. Through such proceeding the Court shall determine the fair
value of the shares exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger or consolidation, together with
interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. In determining such fair value, the Court shall take into account all relevant
factors. Unless the Court in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, and except as provided in this subsection, interest from the
effective date of the merger through the date of payment of the judgment shall be compounded quarterly and shall accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve
discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the effective date of the merger and the date of
payment of the judgment. At any time before the entry of judgment in the proceedings, the surviving corporation may pay to each stockholder entitled to
appraisal an amount in cash, in which case interest shall accrue thereafter as provided herein only upon the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the
amount so paid and the fair value of the shares as determined by the Court and (2) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time. Upon application
by the surviving or resulting corporation or by any stockholder entitled to participate in the appraisal proceeding, the Court may, in its discretion,
proceed to trial upon the appraisal prior to the final determination of the stockholders entitled to an appraisal. Any stockholder whose name appears on
the list filed by the surviving or resulting corporation pursuant to subsection (f) of this section and who has submitted such stockholder’s certificates of
stock to the Register in Chancery, if such is required, may participate fully in all proceedings until it is finally determined that such stockholder is not
entitled to appraisal rights under this section.

(i) The Court shall direct the payment of the fair value of the shares, together with interest, if any, by the surviving or resulting corporation to the
stockholders entitled thereto. Payment shall be so made to each such stockholder, in the case of holders of uncertificated stock forthwith, and the case of
holders of shares represented by certificates upon the surrender to the corporation of the certificates representing such stock. The Court’s decree may be
enforced as other decrees in the Court of Chancery may be enforced, whether such surviving or resulting corporation be a corporation of this State or of
any state.

(j) The costs of the proceeding may be determined by the Court and taxed upon the parties as the Court deems equitable in the circumstances.
Upon application of a stockholder, the Court may order all or a portion of the expenses incurred by any stockholder in connection with the appraisal
proceeding, including, without limitation, reasonable attorney’s fees and the fees and expenses of experts, to be charged pro rata against the value of all
the shares entitled to an appraisal.

(k) From and after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, no stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights as provided in subsection
(d) of this section shall be entitled to vote such stock for any purpose or to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on the stock (except
dividends or other distributions payable to stockholders of record at a date which is prior to the effective date of the merger or consolidation); provided,
however, that if no petition for an appraisal shall be filed within the time provided in subsection (e) of this section, or if such stockholder shall deliver to
the surviving or resulting corporation a written withdrawal of such stockholder’s demand for an appraisal and an acceptance of the merger or
consolidation, either within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation as provided in subsection (e) of this section or thereafter with
the written approval of the corporation, then the right of such stockholder to an appraisal shall cease. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no appraisal
proceeding in the Court of Chancery shall be dismissed as to any stockholder without the approval of the Court, and such approval may be conditioned
upon such terms as the Court deems just; provided, however that this provision shall not affect the right of any stockholder who has not commenced an
appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such stockholder’s demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered
upon the merger or consolidation within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, as set forth in subsection (e) of this section.
