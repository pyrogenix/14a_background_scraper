exhibits attached hereto, this “Schedule 14D-9”) relates is the Company’s common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Common
Stock”). As of January 5, 2018, there were 67,656,026 shares of Common Stock outstanding.

Item 2. Identity and Background of Filing Person.

Name and Address.

The name, address and telephone number of the Company, which is the person filing this Schedule 14D-9 and the subject company, are
set forth in Item 1 above under the heading “Name and Address.”

Tender Offer.

This Schedule 14D-9 relates to the cash tender offer by Abingdon Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation (“Purchaser”) and a
wholly owned subsidiary of Roche Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Parent” or “Roche”), to purchase all of the issued and
outstanding shares of Common Stock (the “Shares”), at a purchase price equal to $27.00 per Share (the “Offer Price”), net to the seller
in cash, without interest and subject to deduction for any required withholding taxes, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in the Offer to Purchase, dated January 10, 2018 (as amended or supplemented from time to time, the “Offer to Purchase”), and in
the related Letter of Transmittal (which, together with the Offer to Purchase, as each may be amended or supplemented from time to
time, constitute the “Offer”). The Offer is described in a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO (as amended or supplemented from
time to time, the “Schedule TO”) filed by Parent and Purchaser with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on
January 10, 2018. The Offer to Purchase and Letter of Transmittal are filed as Exhibits (a)(1) and (a)(2), respectively, hereto and are
incorporated herein by reference.

The Offer is being made pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of December 21, 2017, by and among Parent,
Purchaser and the Company (the “Merger Agreement”). The Merger Agreement provides that, among other things, subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions, following completion of the Offer, and upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in the Merger Agreement and in accordance with the relevant provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware, as amended (the “DGCL”), Purchaser will be merged with and into the Company (the “Merger”). Following the Merger, the
separate corporate existence of Purchaser shall cease, and the Company will continue as the surviving corporation in the Merger (the
“Surviving Corporation”) under the name “Ignyta, Inc.” as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. The Merger will be governed by
Section 251(h) of the DGCL, which provides that following consummation of a successful tender offer for a public corporation, and
subject to certain statutory provisions, if the acquirer holds at least the amount of shares of each class of stock of the acquired
corporation that would otherwise be required to approve a merger for the acquired corporation, and the other stockholders receive the
same consideration for their stock in the merger as was payable in the tender offer, the acquirer can effect a merger without the action
of the other stockholders of the acquired corporation. Accordingly, if Purchaser consummates the Offer, the Merger Agreement
contemplates that the parties will effect the closing of the Merger without a vote of the stockholders of the Company in accordance
with Section 251(h) of the DGCL.

The Merger Agreement includes a remedy of specific performance and is not subject to a financing condition. The obligation of
Purchaser to purchase the Shares validly tendered pursuant to the Offer and not validly withdrawn prior to the expiration of the Offer is
subject to the satisfaction or waiver of a number of conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, including (i) that there shall have
been validly tendered and not withdrawn Shares (excluding

any Shares tendered pursuant to guaranteed delivery procedures that have not yet been delivered in settlement or satisfaction of such
guarantee) that, considered together with all other Shares (if any) beneficially owned by Parent and its affiliates, represent a majority of
the total number of Shares outstanding at the time of the expiration of the Offer; (ii) the accuracy of the representations and warranties
of the Company contained in the Merger Agreement, subject to customary exceptions; (iii) the Company’s compliance in all material
respects with its covenants and obligations contained in the Merger Agreement; (iv) the expiration or termination of any waiting period
(and extensions thereof) relating to the Offer under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the “HSR
Act”), and any applicable foreign antitrust laws, and any approvals or clearances required thereunder shall have been obtained;
(v) there not having been a material adverse effect with respect to the Company; (vi) the absence of any temporary restraining order,
preliminary or permanent injunction or other order or decree issued by any court of competent jurisdiction or other legal restraint or
prohibition in effect that would prohibit or make illegal the acquisition of or payment for the Shares pursuant to the Offer, or the
consummation of the merger; and (vii) other customary conditions.

At the effective time of the Merger (the “Effective Time”), by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders of
any Shares, each outstanding Share, other than any Shares owned by Parent, Purchaser or any wholly owned subsidiary of Parent or
held in the treasury of the Company, or any stockholders who are entitled to and who properly exercise appraisal rights under Delaware
law, will be canceled and converted into the right to receive the Offer Price, in cash, without interest, and subject to any deduction for
any withholding taxes (the “Merger Consideration”). In addition, (i) effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, each
outstanding Company stock option (each, a “Company Stock Option”) will be accelerated and vest in full and automatically be
canceled and terminated as of the Effective Time and the holder thereof will be entitled to receive an amount in cash, without interest
and subject to deduction for any required withholding taxes, equal to the product of (A) the number of Shares underlying such
Company Stock Option multiplied by (B) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share of such
Company Stock Option, (ii) effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, each outstanding Company restricted stock unit
(each, a “Company RSU”) will automatically be fully accelerated and vest in full and the restrictions thereon will lapse, and each such
Company RSU will be canceled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the Merger Consideration, and
(iii) effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, each outstanding Company warrant, whether vested or unvested and
exercisable or unexercisable, in exchange for the surrender and cancellation therefor, shall represent the right to receive an amount in
cash, without interest and subject to deduction for any required withholding taxes, equal to the product of (A) the number of Shares
subject to the warrant multiplied by (B) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share of such
warrant.

The Company, until the earlier of consummation of the Offer or the termination of the Merger Agreement, has agreed that the
Company may not, and will direct and use reasonable best efforts to cause its representatives not to, (i) continue any solicitation,
knowing encouragement, or negotiations with any persons that may be ongoing with respect to an acquisition proposal, (ii) solicit,
initiate or knowingly facilitate or knowingly encourage any inquiries regarding, or the making of any proposal or offer that constitutes,
or could reasonably be expected to lead to, an acquisition proposal, (iii) engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions
or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any other person any material nonpublic information for the purpose of soliciting, knowingly
encouraging or knowingly facilitating, an acquisition proposal or any proposal or offer that could reasonably be expected to lead to an
acquisition proposal, or (iv) enter into any letter of intent, acquisition agreement, agreement in principle or similar agreement with
respect to an acquisition proposal or any proposal or offer that could reasonably be expected to lead to an acquisition proposal.
Notwithstanding this limitation, prior to the consummation of the Offer, if the Company or any of its representatives receives a bona
fide written acquisition proposal from a person that did not result from a breach of the aforementioned non-solicitation restrictions, the
Company may contact such person to clarify the terms and conditions with respect to such acquisition proposal, and if the board of
directors of the Company (the “Company Board”) determines in good faith that such acquisition proposal constitutes or could
reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal (as defined in the Merger Agreement), then the Company and its representatives
may furnish information, subject to an acceptable confidentiality agreement, to such person and engage in or otherwise participate in
discussions or negotiations with the person making the acquisition proposal. The Company Board may also terminate the Merger
Agreement in order to accept a Superior Proposal and may change its recommendation in the event the Company Board determines, in
good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that failure to do so would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Company Board under applicable law, subject to certain restrictions.

Table of Contents

The Merger Agreement is summarized in the Offer to Purchase in Section 13 under the heading “The Merger Agreement.” The
summary of the Merger Agreement set forth in the Offer to Purchase and any summary of provisions of the Merger Agreement set
forth herein do not purport to be complete and each is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Merger Agreement, a copy of which is
filed as Exhibit (e)(1) hereto and is incorporated herein by reference. The expiration date of the Offer is 12:00 midnight, Eastern Time,
at the end of the day on Wednesday, February 7, 2018, subject to extension in certain circumstances set forth in the Merger Agreement
and described in the Offer to Purchase.

Parent has formed Purchaser for the purpose of effecting the Offer and the Merger. The Offer to Purchase states that each of Parent’s
and Purchaser’s principal executive office is located at Tax Department, 1 DNA Way, Bldg. 82—MS24, South San Francisco,
California 9408, and each of their telephone number is (650) 225 7893.

The Company has made information relating to the Offer available online at www.ignyta.com/investors and the Company has filed this
Schedule 14D-9 and Parent and Purchaser have filed the Schedule TO with the SEC, and these documents are available free of charge
at the website maintained by the SEC at www.sec.gov.

Item 3. Past Contacts, Transactions, Negotiations and Agreements.

Except as set forth in this Schedule 14D-9 or as otherwise incorporated herein by reference, as of the date of this Schedule 14D-9, to
the knowledge of the Company, there are no material agreements, arrangements or understandings and no actual or potential conflicts
of interest between the Company or its affiliates, on the one hand, and (i) its executive officers, directors or affiliates, or (ii) Parent or
Purchaser or their respective executive officers, directors or affiliates, on the other hand.

Arrangements with Purchaser and Parent.

Merger Agreement

The summary of the Merger Agreement and the description of the conditions to the Offer contained in the Offer to Purchase are
incorporated herein by reference. Such summary and description are qualified in their entirety by reference to the Merger Agreement.

The Merger Agreement has been included to provide investors and stockholders with information regarding the terms of the agreement.
It is not intended to provide any other factual information about Parent, Purchaser or the Company. The representations, warranties and
covenants contained in the Merger Agreement were made only as of specified dates for the purposes of such agreement, were solely for
the benefit of the parties to such agreement and may be subject to qualifications and limitations agreed upon by such parties. In
particular, in reviewing the representations, warranties and covenants contained in the Merger Agreement and discussed in the
foregoing description, it is important to bear in mind that such representations, warranties and covenants were negotiated with the
principal purpose of allocating risk between the parties, rather than establishing matters as facts. Such representations, warranties and
covenants may also be subject to a contractual standard of materiality different from those generally applicable to stockholders and
reports and documents filed with the SEC, and in some cases were qualified by disclosures set forth in a confidential disclosure letter
that was provided by the Company to Parent and Purchaser but is not filed with the SEC as part of the Merger Agreement. Investors
and stockholders are not third-party beneficiaries under the Merger Agreement. Accordingly, investors and stockholders should not rely
on such representations, warranties and covenants as characterizations of the actual state of facts or circumstances described therein
without consideration of the entirety of the factual disclosures about the Company, Parent or Purchaser made in this Schedule 14D-9,
the Schedule TO or reports filed with the SEC. Information concerning the subject matter of such representations, warranties and
covenants, which do not purport to be accurate as of the date of this Schedule 14D-9, may have changed since the date of the Merger
Agreement, which subsequent information may or may not be fully reflected in the parties’ public disclosures.

Table of Contents

Confidentiality Agreement

On December 1, 2017, the Company and Parent entered into a confidentiality agreement (effective as of November 28, 2017) (the
“Confidentiality Agreement”), pursuant to which, among other things, Parent, Hoffmann-La Roche Inc. and its affiliates agreed, subject
to certain exceptions, to keep confidential certain non-public information about the Company in connection with the consideration of a
possible negotiated transaction with the Company. The summary of the Confidentiality Agreement contained in the Offer to Purchase
in Section 13 under the heading “The Confidentiality Agreement” is incorporated herein by reference.

Tender and Support Agreement

Concurrent with the execution of the Merger Agreement, on December 21, 2017, all of the Company’s executive officers and directors
and certain of the Company’s stockholders entered into a tender and support agreement (the “Tender and Support Agreement”) with
Parent and Purchaser, pursuant to which each such person or entity agreed, among other things, to tender his, her or its Shares pursuant
to the Offer. As of the date of the Merger Agreement, these stockholders owned a number of Shares equal to approximately 6.4% of the
outstanding shares of common stock of the Company. The Tender and Support Agreement terminates in the event the Merger
Agreement is terminated. The summary of the Tender and Support Agreement contained in the Offer to Purchase in Section 13 under
the heading “Tender and Support Agreements” is incorporated herein by reference. Such summary does not purport to be complete and
is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Tender and Support Agreement, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit (e)(2) hereto and is
incorporated herein by reference.

Arrangements with Current Executive Officers and Directors of the Company.

The Company’s executive officers and the members of the Company Board may be deemed to have certain interests in the Offer and
the Merger and related transactions that may be different from or in addition to those of the Company’s stockholders generally. Those
interests may create potential or actual conflicts of interests. The Company Board was aware of those interests and considered them,
among other matters, in reaching its decision to approve the Merger Agreement and related transactions.

Consideration for Shares Tendered Pursuant to the Offer

If the directors and executive officers of the Company who own Shares tender their Shares for purchase pursuant to the Offer, they will
receive the same Offer Price on the same terms and conditions as the other stockholders of the Company.

As of January 5, 2018, the directors and executive officers of the Company and their affiliates beneficially owned in the aggregate
4,379,749 Shares, which for purposes of this subsection excludes any Shares issuable upon exercise or settlement of Company Stock
Options and Company RSUs held by such individuals. If the directors and executive officers and their affiliates were to tender all of
such Shares pursuant to the Offer and those Shares were accepted for purchase and purchased by Purchaser, the directors and executive
officers and their affiliates would receive an aggregate of $118,253,223 in cash, without interest, less any required withholding taxes.
For a description of the treatment of Company Stock Options and Company RSUs held by the directors and executive officers of the
Company, see below under the heading “Effect of the Merger on Stock Awards.”

The following table sets forth, as of January 5, 2018, the cash consideration that each executive officer and director and his or her
affiliates would be entitled to receive in respect of outstanding Shares beneficially owned by him, her or it (excluding shares
underlying Company Stock Options and Company RSUs), assuming such individual or his or her affiliate were to tender all of his, her
or its outstanding Shares pursuant to the Offer and those Shares were accepted for purchase and purchased by Purchaser.

benefits pursuant to any equity compensation plan or defined benefit pension plan); however, Parent will be under no obligation to
retain any employee or group of employees or any compensation or benefit plans of the Company.

The Merger Agreement further provides that Parent will provide, or cause its subsidiaries to provide, each Continuing Employee with
full credit for purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting and accrual of severance benefits under any employee benefit plans of
Parent or its subsidiaries for such Continuing Employee’s service with the Company and any predecessor employer (but not for
purposes of any sabbatical benefit provided by Parent or its subsidiaries or to the extent such service credit would result in a
duplication of benefits for the same period of service).

The Merger Agreement further provides that Parent will use commercially reasonable efforts (1) to waive for Continuing Employees
any waiting period provision, pre-existing condition limitation, actively at work requirement, evidence of insurability requirements or
any other restriction that would prevent immediate or full participation under the health and welfare plans of Parent or any subsidiary
of Parent (to the extent such limitations or requirements would not have been applicable under the Company’s welfare plans as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time), and (2) give full credit under the welfare plans of Parent or its subsidiaries to each
Continuing Employee for all co-payments and deductibles satisfied prior to the Effective Time in the same year as the Closing Date,
and for any lifetime maximums, as if there had been a single, continuous employer.

Severance and Change in Control Severance Plan

The Company maintains the Ignyta, Inc. Severance and Change in Control Severance Plan, or the Severance Plan. Each of the
Company’s executive officers is a participant in the Severance Plan. The Severance Plan provides for specified severance benefits to
participants whose employment terminates under the circumstances described in the Severance Plan, including, but not limited to, an
involuntary termination other than for cause (as defined in the Severance Plan) or a resignation for good reason (as defined in the
Severance Plan) within a specified period of time preceding or following a change in control of the Company (as defined in the
Severance Plan).

Pursuant to the Severance Plan, if, at any time more than 60 days prior to a change in control and more than 12 months following a
change in control, the Company terminates an executive officer’s employment other than for cause (and other than due to death or
disability), then the executive officer will be entitled to receive the following severance benefits, subject to his or her execution of a
release of claims and compliance with certain restrictive covenants, including with respect to non-solicitation and non-disparagement:
 

 
• Continued payment of the executive’s base salary for 12 months (in the case of Dr. Lim) or nine months (in the case of the

other executive officers) following termination; and
 

 
• Company-paid COBRA coverage for 12 months (in the case of Dr. Lim) or nine months (in the case of the other executive

officers) following termination.

Pursuant to the Severance Plan, if, at any time during the period commencing 60 days prior to a change in control and ending 12
months following such change in control, the Company terminates an executive officer’s employment other than for cause (and other
than due to death or disability) or the executive officer resigns for good reason, then the executive officer will be entitled to receive the
following severance benefits, subject to his or her execution of a release of claims and compliance with certain restrictive covenants,
including with respect to non-solicitation and non-disparagement:
 

 • The following aggregate cash amount paid in installments over the following time periods:
 

 
• In the case of Dr. Lim, twice the sum of his base salary and target annual cash bonus, paid in equal installments over

the 24-month period following termination; or
 

 
• In the case of the other executive officers, the sum of the executive officer’s base salary plus the executive officer’s

target annual bonus, paid in equal installments over the 12-month period following termination.
 

 
• Company-paid COBRA coverage for 24 months (in the case of Dr. Lim) or 12 months (in the case of the other executive

officers) following termination.
 

 
• 100% accelerated vesting of the executive officer’s Company equity awards that were outstanding on the date of the change

in control.

With respect to the executive officers other than Dr. Lim, the severance benefits prescribed by the Severance Plan are subject to a
Section 280G better-off cutback provision, which provides that, in the event that the benefits provided to the executive officer pursuant
to the Severance Plan or otherwise constitute parachute payments with the meaning of Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the “Code”), the executive officer’s severance benefits under the Severance Plan will either be delivered in full or
reduced to the extent necessary to avoid an excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code, whichever would result in the executive officer
receiving the largest amount of severance benefits on an after-tax basis.

The Severance Plan will automatically terminate on December 16, 2019 unless otherwise extended by its terms.

If the Offer is completed in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, the consummation of the Offer will constitute a
“change in control” under the terms of the Severance Plan. The table below describes the estimated potential payments to each of the
Company’s executive officers in the event of the executive officer’s termination of employment other than for cause (and other than
due to death or disability) or the executive officer’s resignation for good reason occurs within the period beginning on the date that is
60 days prior to the Closing Date and ending 12 months following the Closing Date, except for the value of accelerated vesting of each
such executive officer’s Company Stock Options and Company RSUs, as those amounts are disclosed in the tables above. The amounts
shown reflect only the additional payments or benefits that the individual would have received under the Severance Plan upon the
occurrence of a termination of employment other than for cause (and other than due to death or disability) or a resignation for good
reason; they do not include the value of payments or benefits that would have been earned absent such a qualifying termination.

For purposes of calculating the potential payments set forth in the table below, we have assumed that the initial expiration date of the
Offer and the date of termination of employment other than for cause (and other than due to death or disability) or the resignation for
good reason were January 5, 2018. The amounts shown in the table are estimates only and are based on assumptions regarding events
that may or may not actually occur, including assumptions described in this Schedule 14D-9 and in the notes to the table below. Some
of these assumptions are based on information currently available and, as a result, the actual amounts, if any, that may become payable
to an executive officer may materially differ from the amounts set forth below.

(1) The amount set forth represents a cash severance payment payable as follows: (i) in the case of Dr. Lim, twice the sum of his base

salary and target annual cash bonus; and (ii) in the case of each other executive officer, the executive officer’s base salary plus the
executive officer’s target annual bonus. Any amounts payable in connection with the termination of an executive’s employment
are subject to applicable withholdings and are payable in installments over 24 months (in the case of Dr. Lim) and 12 months (in
the case of the other named executive officers). Payment of severance is also subject to the executive officer’s execution of a
release of claims and compliance with certain restrictive covenants, including with respect to non-solicitation and
non-disparagement

(2) Consists of COBRA coverage for a period of 24 months (in the case of Dr. Lim) or 12 months (for the other executive officers)
following the date of termination. The value is based upon the type of insurance coverage the Company carried for each executive
officer as of January 5, 2018 and is valued at the premiums in effect on such date.

Tax Reimbursement Agreement with Jonathan E. Lim, M.D.

In connection with the signing of the Merger Agreement, the Company entered into an agreement with Dr. Lim (the “Tax
Reimbursement Agreement”), which provides that, if the Merger is consummated and an excise tax is imposed on Dr. Lim under
Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”) as a result of any compensation or benefits provided to him in connection
with the Merger, he will be entitled to a tax gross-up payment in an amount equal to such excise tax (and any related taxes or penalties
or interest on such excise taxes or any such tax-gross up payment).

The foregoing description of the Tax Reimbursement Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by
reference to the Tax Reimbursement Agreement, filed as Exhibit (e)(17) to this Schedule 14D-9, which is incorporated herein by
reference.

Grant of Company RSUs to Executive Officers; Acceleration of Vesting of Company RSUs; Payment of 2017 Executive Bonuses.

On December 22, 2017, Company RSUs were granted to the executive officers of the Company as part of the annual process of
the Compensation Committee of the Company Board for determining 2017 annual stock award grants, 2017 annual bonus
determinations and 2018 base salary adjustments for employees of the Company. On December 26, 2017, the Compensation
Committee of the Company Board approved the accelerated vesting of certain Company RSUs held by Dr. Lim, Mr. Hornby,
Dr. Kuhlen, Mr. McCarthy and Dr. Smart (including, in the case of Dr. Kuhlen and Mr. McCarthy, a portion of the Company RSUs
granted on December 22, 2017) in anticipation of the Merger and to facilitate tax planning strategies for the Company and these
individuals. As part of the same tax planning strategies, the Compensation Committee of the Company Board also approved the payout
of each executive officer’s annual cash incentive award for 2017 prior to year-end. The annual incentive award payments were paid out
at 100% of target based on the Compensation Committee’s determination of the Company’s performance relative to the applicable
performance metrics and each individual executive’s individual performance. See Item 6 below where the grant of the Company RSUs
and the accelerated vesting of these Company RSUs is described.

Director Compensation

The Company compensates its non-employee directors for their service on the Company Board, but does not pay director fees to
directors who are employees of the Company. Non-employee members of the Company Board receive a combination of cash
compensation, in the form of annual retainers, and equity incentive compensation, in the form of stock option awards, for their service
on the Company Board.

Cash Compensation

Non-employee directors are eligible to receive the following cash compensation:
 

 • each director receives an annual retainer of $40,000;
 

 • the lead independent director of the Company Board, if any, receives an additional annual retainer of $20,000;
 

 
• an additional annual retainer is paid to the non-employee director serving as (1) the chairman of the audit committee in an

amount equal to $15,000, (2) the chairman of the compensation committee in an amount equal to $10,000, and (3) the
chairman of the nominating and corporate governance committee in an amount equal to $7,500; and

 

 
• audit, compensation and nominating and corporate governance committee members (other than the committee chairmen)

receive an additional annual retainer equal to $7,500 for audit committee members, $5,000 for compensation committee
members and $3,500 for nominating and corporate governance committee members.

Fees are paid to the non-employee directors in four equal quarterly installments. In addition, the Company provides reimbursement to
the non-employee directors for their reasonable expenses incurred in attending meetings of the Company Board and committees of the
Company Board.

For 2018, each non-employee director is entitled to receive the same amounts of cash compensation as described above.

Equity Compensation

Any non-employee director when first elected or appointed to the Company Board is granted a non-qualified option to purchase 40,000
shares of the Company’s common stock on the date of his or her initial election or appointment. In addition, on the date of each annual

meeting of the Company’s stockholders, each non-employee director is eligible to receive a non-qualified option to purchase an
additional 20,000 shares of the Company’s common stock. Such options have an exercise price per share equal to the fair market value
of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant.

The initial options granted to non-employee directors described above will vest over three years, with one-third of the options vesting
on the first anniversary of the date of grant and the remainder vesting in equal monthly installments over the two years thereafter,
subject to the director’s continuing service on the Company Board on

those dates. The annual options granted to non-employee directors described above will vest on the first to occur of (1) the first
anniversary of the date of grant or (2) the next occurring annual meeting of its stockholders, subject to the director’s continuing service
on the Company Board on such date. In addition, all of the options granted to the non-employee directors will vest in full immediately
prior to the occurrence of a change in control. The term of each option granted to non-employee directors is ten years.

Please see the section above entitled “Effect of the Merger on Stock Awards” for more information on the treatment of equity held by
directors in the Merger.

Executive Officer and Director Arrangements Following the Merger

While, as of the date of this Schedule 14D-9, none of the Company’s current directors or executive officers have entered into any
employment, incentive, equity or other agreement, arrangement or understanding with Parent or its affiliates regarding continued
service with Parent or its affiliates after the Effective Time, it is possible that Parent or its affiliates may enter into service, employment
or other arrangements with the Company’s directors or executive officers in the future.

Director and Officer Indemnification and Insurance

Section 102(b)(7) of the DGCL allows a corporation, by a provision of its certificate of incorporation, to eliminate or limit the personal
liability of directors of a corporation to the corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for a breach of fiduciary duty as a
director, provided that such provision shall not eliminate or limit the liability of a director (i) for any breach of the director’s duty of
loyalty to the corporation or its stockholders, (ii) for acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a
knowing violation of law, (iii) under Section 174 of the DGCL, or (iv) for any transaction from which the director derived an improper
personal benefit.

The Company has included in its second amended and restated certificate of incorporation (as amended, the “Charter”) and its amended
and restated bylaws (the “Bylaws”) provisions to limit or eliminate the personal liability of its directors to the fullest extent permitted
under Delaware law, as it now exists or may in the future be amended.

Subsection (a) of Section 145 of the DGCL, empowers a corporation to indemnify any person who was or is a party or who is
threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the corporation) by reason of the fact that the person is or was
a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer,
employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys’
fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by the person in connection with such action,
suit or proceeding if the person acted in good faith and in a manner the person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best
interests of the corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe the person’s
conduct was unlawful.

Subsection (b) of Section 145 of the DGCL empowers a corporation to indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to
be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the corporation to procure a judgment in its
favor by reason of the fact that the person acted in any of the capacities set forth above, against expenses (including attorneys’ fees)
actually and reasonably incurred by the person in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if the person acted in
good faith and in a manner the person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, except that no
indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to
the corporation unless and only to the extent that the Court of Chancery or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall
determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is
fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which the Court of Chancery or such other court shall deem proper.

Section 145 of the DGCL further provides that to the extent a director or officer of a corporation has been successful on the merits or
otherwise in the defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in subsections (a) and (b) of Section 145, or in defense of any
claim, issue or matter therein, such person shall be indemnified against expenses

(including attorneys’ fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection therewith; that indemnification provided for
by Section 145 shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which the indemnified party may be entitled; and that the
indemnification provided for by Section 145 shall, unless otherwise provided when authorized or ratified, continue as to a person who
has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of such person’s heirs, executors and
administrators. Section 145 also empowers the corporation to purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a
director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer,
employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any liability asserted against such
person and incurred by such person in any such capacity, or arising out of his status as such, whether or not the corporation would have
the power to indemnify such person against such liabilities under Section 145.

The Company has included in its Charter and its Bylaws provisions that permit the Company to provide the foregoing indemnification
to the fullest extent permitted under Delaware law. The Bylaws of the Company also permit it to secure insurance on behalf of any
officer, director, employee or other agent for any liability arising out of his or her actions in this capacity, regardless of whether the
Bylaws would permit indemnification. In addition, the Company may advance expenses incurred in connection with any such
proceeding upon a receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such person to repay all amounts advanced if it shall be ultimately
determined that the person is not entitled to be indemnified by the Company. The Company has also obtained directors’ and officers’
liability insurance.

Pursuant to authorization by the Company Board, the Company has entered into separate indemnification agreements
(“Indemnification Agreements”) with its directors and executive officers, in addition to the indemnification provided for in the Charter
and Bylaws. These Indemnification Agreements, among other things, provide for indemnification by the Company of its directors and
executive officers for expenses, judgments, fines and settlement amounts incurred by such person in any action or proceeding arising
out of such person’s services as a director or executive officer or at the Company’s request. These indemnification agreements also may
require the Company to advance any expenses incurred by the directors or officers as a result of any proceeding against them as to
which they could be indemnified. This summary of the Indemnification Agreements does not purport to be complete and is qualified in
its entirety by reference to the Indemnification Agreements, the form of which is filed as Exhibit (e)(13) hereto, and is incorporated
herein by reference.

The Merger Agreement provides for certain indemnification, exculpation and insurance rights in favor of the Company’s current and
former directors, officers and employees, who are referred to as “indemnitees.” Specifically, Parent and Purchaser have agreed that all
rights to indemnification, exculpation and advancement of expenses in favor of indemnitees as provided in the Charter or Bylaws or
under any agreement filed as an exhibit to specified SEC filings of the Company or listed on the confidential disclosure letter provided
by the Company to Parent and Purchaser with respect to all acts or omissions occurring prior to or at the Effective Time will survive
the closing of the Offer and the Merger and will continue in full force and effect in accordance with their respective terms for a period
not less than six years.

From and after the Effective Time, Parent has agreed to cause to be maintained in effect for a period of six years after the Effective
Time, in respect of acts or omissions occurring prior to or at the Effective Time, the Company’s current directors’ and officers’ liability
insurance covering each person currently covered by the Company’s directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policy for acts or
omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time; provided that Parent may (i) substitute therefor policies of an insurance company the
material terms of which, including coverage and amount, are no less favorable in any material respect to such directors and officers
than the Company’s existing policies as of the date of the Merger Agreement or (ii) request that the Company obtain such extended
reporting period coverage under its existing insurance programs (to be effective as of the Effective Time); and provided further that in
no event shall Parent or the Company be required to pay annual premiums for such insurance policies in excess of 300% of the amount
of the annual premiums paid by the Company in fiscal year 2017 for such purpose, it being understood that Parent shall nevertheless be
obligated to provide as much coverage as may be obtained for such 300% amount.

In lieu of the foregoing, Parent or the Surviving Corporation may purchase a six-year “tail” prepaid policy on the directors’ and
officers’ liability insurance policies on terms and conditions no less advantageous than the directors’ and officers’ liability insurance
policies in effect on the date of the Merger Agreement.

Item 4. The Solicitation or Recommendation.

Recommendation of the Company Board.

At a meeting of the Company Board held on December 21, 2017, the Company Board unanimously: (i) determined that the Offer, the
Merger Agreement, the Merger and the transactions contemplated thereby are advisable and fair to and in the best interests of the
Company and its stockholders, (ii) approved the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby and declared that the
Merger Agreement, the Offer, the Merger and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement are advisable and fair to and in
the best interests of the Company and its stockholders (iii) resolved to recommend that the Company’s stockholders accept the Offer
and tender all of their Shares pursuant to the Offer.

Accordingly, and for the other reasons described in more detail below, the Company Board hereby recommends that the
Company’s stockholders accept the Offer and tender all of their Shares pursuant to the Offer.

A copy of the letter to the Company’s stockholders communicating the Company Board’s recommendation is filed as Exhibit (a)(13) to
this Schedule 14D-9 and is incorporated herein by reference. A copy of the press release issued by the Company and Parent, dated
December 21, 2017, announcing the Merger Agreement, the Offer and the Merger, is filed as Exhibit (a)(8) to this Schedule 14D-9 and
is incorporated herein by reference.

Background and Reasons for the Company Board’s Recommendation.

Background of the Offer

Parent is an indirect subsidiary of Roche Holding Ltd, a Swiss joint-stock company. For the purposes of this “Background of the Offer”
only, references to “Roche” shall mean Roche Holding Ltd, a Swiss joint-stock company.

The Company Board and management continually evaluate the Company’s business and financial plans. As part of this evaluation, the
Company Board and management also periodically consider strategic alternatives to maximize value to the Company’s stockholders. In
particular, the Company Board and management have considered a number of potential licensing relationships and other strategic
transactions as the Company’s lead product candidate, entrectinib, has advanced through clinical trials. Entrectinib, formerly called
RXDX-101, is an investigational, central nervous system-active, potent, and selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor being developed for
tumors that harbor NTRK fusions or ROS1 fusions, which is in a Phase 2 clinical study in molecularly defined patient populations for
the treatment of solid tumors. If successful, this clinical trial will support dual NDA submissions in TRK tissue agnostic and ROS1
non-small cell lung cancer indications in 2018, with anticipated commercial launch in 2019.

From January 2016 through December 2017, at the direction of the Company Board, the Company initiated discussions with, and
sought proposals from, twenty-five pharmaceutical companies (including Roche, Party A, and Party B discussed below) regarding
possible licensing opportunities with the Company related to the global development and commercialization of entrectinib. The
purpose of this process was to cultivate relationships with potential licensees and convey information regarding the Company’s
principal value-driving asset so that the Company could move quickly in pursuing licensing relationships or other strategic transactions
necessary to fund the development and commercialization of entrectinib. The Company entered into formal confidentiality agreements
with seventeen of these companies to facilitate detailed discussions concerning entrectinib and potential transaction terms. Twelve of
these companies entered into a formal due diligence process, including receiving access to a virtual data room established by the
Company for potential licensees to evaluate entrectinib. Additionally, six companies submitted non-binding term sheets for regional or
global licensing arrangements for entrectinib. As part of these discussions, several included the possibility of an acquisition of the
Company. However, except as described below, none of these discussions advanced beyond a preliminary stage.

Between March 2016 and December 2017, the Company Board held over a dozen meetings, with members of management and
representatives of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC (“J.P. Morgan”) and/or Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated (“BofA
Merrill Lynch”), financial advisors to the Company (each engaged by the Company as described below), and Latham & Watkins LLP
(“Latham & Watkins”), regular corporate counsel to the Company, participating, to discuss potential strategic alternatives for the
Company and the capital needs required to pursue the Company’s business and financial plans as a standalone company. The Company
Board regularly discussed the potential risks and benefits of continuing to pursue its business and financial plans as a standalone
company.

On May 17, 2016, the Company and Parent entered into a confidentiality agreement to facilitate discussions related to the licensing of
entrectinib and Roche was given access to the Company’s virtual data room related to entrectinib for due diligence purposes. The
parties amended the confidentiality agreement on February 15, 2017 to expand the definition of information considered Parent’s
confidential information. Between June 2016 and September 2016, Roche conducted extensive due diligence on entrectinib with
respect to a potential licensing transaction. During this period, several in-person meetings between Company management and the
management of Roche occurred. In September 2016, Roche informed the Company that it would no longer seek to license rights to
entrectinib from the Company. However, between September 2016 and December 2017, Company management had periodic meetings
with counterparts at Roche to maintain a potential dialogue for future collaboration opportunities.

On May 9, 2017, in light of the status of its licensing process and its continuing capital needs, the Company completed a public
offering of 14.375 million shares of the Company’s common stock at an offering price of $6.15 per share, raising approximately
$88.4 million. J.P. Morgan was a joint book-running manager for the transaction.

On June 3, 2017, Mr. Hornby met with the management of a biopharmaceutical company (“Party A”) to discuss the possibility of a
licensing arrangement with the Company related to entrectinib. Later that month, the Company and Party A entered into a
confidentiality agreement, and Party A was given access to the Company’s virtual data room related to entrectinib. On June 15, 2017,
Company management met with the management of Party A to further discuss the possibility of a licensing arrangement.

On October 6, 2017, the management of Party A contacted Mr. Hornby to communicate that Party A was interested in pursuing a
licensing transaction with the Company related to entrectinib.

On October 17, 2017, the Company announced interim clinical data from the Company’s STARTRK-2 trial of entrectinib. The same
day, the Company also announced that the European Medicines Agency had granted Priority Medicines designation (“PRIME”) to
entrectinib in the treatment of NTRK fusion-positive, locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors in adult and pediatric patients who
have either progressed following prior therapies or who have no acceptable standard therapy. The PRIME initiative gave the Company
the possibility of accelerating assessment of the Marketing Authorisation Application for entrectinib, and engaging in early discussion
with the European Medicines Agency and health technology assessments regarding reimbursement pathways.

On October 24, 2017, in light of the status of its licensing process and its continuing capital needs, the Company completed an
additional public offering of 10,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock at an offering price of $16.00 per share, raising
approximately $160.0 million. Again, J.P. Morgan served as a joint book-running manager on the transaction.

On October 27, 2017, the management of Party A met at the Company’s facilities to continue its due diligence. On October 28, 2017,
Dr. Lim had a call with a corporate development executive at Party A and an outright acquisition of the company was discussed as a
possible option.

On November 8, 2017, a corporate development executive at Party A contacted Dr. Lim and informed him that Party A remained
interested in pursuing a partnership or possible acquisition of the Company and would be submitting a non-binding term sheet prior to
the Company’s regularly scheduled in-person Board meeting to be held on December 7, 2017.

Based on the collective interest expressed in exploring strategic options for the Company, Dr. Lim gave notice to the Company Board
to convene a special meeting on November 13, 2017. Representatives of Latham & Watkins participated, as did members of the
Company’s management. At the meeting, Dr. Lim and Mr. Hornby updated the Company Board on the status of the strategic and
licensing discussions. Dr. Lim, Mr. Hornby and Dr. Chacko discussed with the Company Board strategic opportunities and future
financing options available to the Company, including a review of the potential constraints on future acquisition opportunities for the
Company if the Company were to out-license rights for entrectinib. Specifically, the Company Board and management discussed that
entering into a licensing arrangement whereby the Company grants an exclusive license to entrectinib (even if geographically or
otherwise restricted) could discourage companies from seeking to acquire the Company because they would not have sole control of
entrectinib after that acquisition. The Company Board and management also discussed that the Company had not received interest in
licensing entrectinib on terms that the Company Board and management found to be acceptable. The Company Board also discussed
the significant capital required to bring a drug candidate through trials to market and that continuing to raise capital as a standalone
company would be dilutive to existing investors. After the discussion, the Company Board determined it would be in the best interests
of stockholders to fully explore all strategic options, including the possibility of an outright acquisition of the Company. The Company
Board decided to engage BofA Merrill Lynch as a financial advisor to the Company, in light of its familiarity with the pharmaceutical
industry, its qualifications and reputation in the investment community, the Company’s prior positive experience with BofA Merrill
Lynch as an advisor to the Company, BofA Merrill Lynch’s experience with transactions similar to those being considered by the
Company and BofA Merrill Lynch’s familiarity with the Company’s business, to advise the Company Board concerning strategic

Company Board’s decision-making with respect to licensing opportunities and understand the possibility of a sale of the Company. The

engaged Latham & Watkins to act as its legal advisor in connection with the Company’s consideration of any proposals to acquire the
Company and other potential strategic transactions. The Company Board and management believed Latham & Watkins would be a
valuable advisor to the Company’s consideration of strategic alternatives based on Latham & Watkins’ history with the Company,
expertise advising companies in the life sciences industry and its expertise in mergers and acquisitions. After discussion among the
Company Board, management and the Company’s advisors, the Company Board directed BofA Merrill Lynch to contact a select group
of companies who had familiarity with entrectinib through the Company’s earlier licensing discussions, as well as other companies
who were not engaged in licensing discussions with the Company but who had the strategic interest and/or capabilities to fully develop
and commercialize entrectinib globally, to see if they would have an interest in acquiring the Company.

Between November 14, 2017, and November 27, 2017, at the direction of the Company Board, BofA Merrill Lynch initiated contact
with eleven parties (including Party A and Party B, the details of which are described below) to gauge their interest in participating in a
strategic process to acquire the Company. At the direction of the Company Board BofA Merrill Lynch did not suggest a definitive
timeline for the anticipated strategic process to these parties at this time, but guided parties to express an indication of interest, without
requiring statements of value, prior to the Company Board’s next scheduled meeting on December 7, 2017, and that initial indications
of value were likely to be requested by early January 2018.

On November 15, 2017, BofA Merrill Lynch contacted Party A regarding its interest in participating in the Company’s strategic
process, including the preliminary anticipated timing of the acquisition process in early January.

On November 15, 2017, the management of a pharmaceutical company (“Party B”) contacted Mr. Hornby to communicate that Party B
was interested in a licensing arrangement with the Company. Mr. Hornby informed Party B that the Company had received indications
that other parties may be interested in participating in a process to acquire the Company.

On November 16, 2017, at Party A’s request, Dr. Lim spoke with a corporate development executive at Party A to discuss the strategic
process. Dr. Lim reiterated the strategic process considerations that BofA Merrill Lynch had conveyed to Party A on November 15,
2017.

On November 17, 2017, Party B submitted a non-binding term sheet related to a license to develop and commercialize entrectinib in all
markets outside the United States.

On November 20, 2017, Mr. Hornby and Party B discussed the Company’s strategic process and Party B agreed to discuss the strategic
process with BofA Merrill Lynch. Later that day, BofA Merrill Lynch discussed with Party B the strategic process being conducted by
the Company.

Also on November 20, 2017, Roche contacted Mr. Hornby on an unsolicited basis and indicated it had an interest in entrectinib and that
Roche would like to meet at the upcoming J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference in January 2018. Mr. Hornby informed Roche that the
Company was moving forward with a strategic process with BofA Merrill Lynch as its financial advisor. Mr. Hornby put Roche in
touch with BofA Merrill Lynch to further discuss the Company’s strategic process.

On November 21, 2017, Party A requested access to an enterprise-wide virtual data room containing additional information about the
Company for purposes of evaluating a strategic process. Party A entered into a new confidentiality agreement governing access to the
enterprise-wide virtual data room established for the strategic process. This confidentially agreement included a standstill provision
with a customary “fall away” provision providing that the standstill obligations would terminate in certain circumstances, including
upon the Company entering into a binding agreement related to a change in control of the Company.

On November 22, 2017, BofA Merrill Lynch contacted Roche to discuss the Company’s strategic process.

On November 27, 2017, BofA Merrill Lynch met with the Head of Mergers and Acquisitions at Roche (at a meeting the parties had
scheduled prior to Roche expressing interest in the Company’s strategic process) and discussed the Company and its strategic process.

On November 30, 2017 and again on December 1, 2017, Roche contacted the Company to convey that the leadership in its oncology
department supported participating in the Company’s strategic process and that Roche intended to move forward with its consideration
of acquiring the Company.

On December 1, 2017, Parent entered into a confidentiality agreement with the Company (effective as of November 28, 2017). This
confidentiality agreement included a standstill provision with a customary “fall away” provision providing that the standstill

obligations would terminate in certain circumstances, including upon the Company entering into a binding agreement related to a
change in control of the Company. The Company granted Roche access to the enterprise-wide virtual data room.

On December 5, 2017, Dr. Lim and Mr. Hornby met with the Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and a corporate development executive
at Party A to discuss the possibility of Party A acquiring the Company. The parties discussed the Company’s strategic process and
timing. The management of Party A indicated that Party A intended to submit an offer to acquire the Company.

On December 6, 2017, Party A submitted a non-binding indication of interest (the “Initial Party A Proposal”) to acquire all of the
Company’s outstanding capital stock for $23.00 per share, which represented a premium of 47% to the Company’s closing share price
from the prior trading day of $15.65 per share. Party A indicated that the Initial Party A Proposal would be subject to satisfactory
completion of due diligence and the successful negotiation of a definitive agreement. The Initial Party A Proposal included a
December 21, 2017 deadline to sign a definitive acquisition agreement and Party A requested an initial response to the Initial Party A
Proposal by no later than December 11, 2017.

On December 7, 2017, the Company Board held a regularly scheduled in-person meeting. Representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch and
Latham & Watkins participated, as did members of the Company’s management. Management updated the Company Board on the
status of strategic discussions, including: (i) two global licensing proposals from pharmaceutical companies; (ii) one licensing proposal
for the European Union market from a pharmaceutical company; (iii) one licensing proposal for all markets outside the United States
from Party B; and (iv) the Initial Party A Proposal. The Company Board discussed the Initial Party A Proposal and its other strategic
alternatives, including that Roche was conducting due diligence and confirmed interest in the Company’s strategic process.
Representatives of Latham & Watkins reviewed with the Company Board its fiduciary duties when considering strategic transactions.
The Company Board determined to engage J.P. Morgan as an additional financial advisor to the Company in light of its familiarity with
the pharmaceutical industry, its qualifications and reputation, the Company’s prior positive experience with J.P. Morgan as an
underwriter in the Company’s public stock offerings, J.P. Morgan’s experience with transactions similar to those being considered by
the Company and J.P. Morgan’s familiarity with the Company’s business. Following discussion, the Company Board determined that
the Initial Party A Proposal provided a sufficient basis for further negotiation and due diligence, but instructed management to attempt
to negotiate with Party A for a higher price per share and explore other terms of the proposal. The Company Board further instructed
management to respond to the Initial Party A Proposal and contemporaneously engage with other potential acquirers. The Company
Board noted that the other potential acquirers were generally already well-acquainted with the Company, and with entrectinib in
particular, as a result of the earlier broad licensing process conducted by the Company, and that an accelerated timeframe should be
sufficient to gauge acquisition interest given the level of exposure that these potential acquirers already had with entrectinib and the
Company. The Company Board directed management and its advisors to engage with Party A to improve its offer, as well as engage
with other potential acquirers to encourage additional competitive offers for the Company.

On December 8, 2017, BofA Merrill Lynch informed Party A that the Company was reluctant to accelerate its strategic process unless
Party A submitted a revised proposal to the Company that more fully valued the Company. Additionally, legal counsel to Party A
submitted diligence requests to Latham & Watkins to assist with Party A’s evaluation of the Company and over the following days,
additional materials were made available in the virtual data room.

Between December 8, 2017 and December 9, 2017, the Company informed five pharmaceutical companies, including companies that
had previously submitted licensing proposals for entrectinib, that the Company’s process had been revised to focus on the sale of the
Company and that timing would likely accelerate; however, these companies declined to participate in the Company’s sale process.

On December 9, 2017, BofA Merrill Lynch contacted Roche and informed Roche that the Company’s process had been revised to
focus on the sale of the Company.

On December 10, 2017, the Company Board held a telephonic meeting to discuss the status of the strategic process. Representatives of
BofA Merrill Lynch, J.P. Morgan and Latham & Watkins participated, as did members of the Company’s management. Representatives
of the Company’s financial advisors discussed the status of the strategic process, including the ongoing discussions with the various
active parties in the process, including Party A and that Roche was continuing with its due diligence. Latham & Watkins discussed
their interactions with Party A’s legal counsel. After discussion about the Initial Party A Proposal, the potential to negotiate for an
enhanced proposal and further due diligence to be completed by Party A, the Company Board directed management and its financial
advisors to continue dialogue with Party A while concurrently seeking to cultivate interest from competing acquirers.

Additionally, on December 11, 2017, Party A entered into a new confidentiality agreement with the Company and, as a result, the
Company granted Party A access to the enterprise-wide virtual data room to aid in its review of the possibility of an acquisition of the
Company. This confidentiality agreement included a standstill provision with a customary “fall away” provision providing that the
standstill obligations would terminate in certain circumstances, including upon the Company entering into a binding agreement related
to a change in control of the Company.

In the morning on December 12, 2017, the Company Board held a telephonic meeting to discuss the Company’s strategic process.
Representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch, J.P. Morgan and Latham & Watkins participated, as did members of the Company’s
management. The Company’s financial advisors reviewed the overall process, including the status of all sixteen companies that had
been contacted. The Company Board directed its financial advisors to continue to pursue the Company’s strategic process. Dr. Chacko

also presented the Company preliminary financial projections, including projected entrectinib sales forecasts, projected operating
expenses and other assumptions. Representatives from BofA Merrill Lynch and J.P. Morgan also discussed the management

projections with respect to RXDX-106, and Dr. Lim informed the Company Board that management would continue working to refine
the projections and would provide an updated presentation at the Company Board’s next meeting. For a detailed discussion of the
projections discussed, please see below under the heading “—Certain Projections.”

In the afternoon on December 12, 2017, Party A submitted a revised written indication of interest (the “Revised Party A Proposal”) to
acquire all outstanding capital stock of the Company for $23.75 per share in cash. Party A indicated that the Revised Party A Proposal
would be subject to satisfactory completion of due diligence and the successful negotiation of a definitive agreement, and outlined key
provisions Party A wanted to include in the agreement. Among the specified terms were a two-step tender offer structure, deal
protection measures including a termination fee equal to 4% and an expense reimbursement equal to 1%, respectively, of the aggregate
equity value of the transaction, specific restrictions on the Company Board’s ability to accept a superior proposal from another party,
financing assistance covenants and entry into tender support agreements from all directors and officers of the Company. The Revised
Party A Proposal represented a premium of approximately 50% to the Company’s closing share price from the prior trading day of
$15.80 per share.

Additionally, on December 12, 2017, the financial advisor to Party B contacted BofA Merrill Lynch on behalf of Party B to inquire
about the sale process. BofA Merrill Lynch, J. P. Morgan and the financial advisor to Party B discussed the Company’s sale process,
including due diligence requirements, the terms of a confidentiality agreement and the anticipated timing of the transaction. The next
day, Party B entered into a revised confidentiality agreement with the Company and was granted access to the enterprise-wide virtual
data room. This confidentiality agreement included a standstill provision with a customary “fall away” provision providing that the
standstill obligations would terminate in certain circumstances, including upon the Company entering into a binding agreement related
to a change in control of the Company.

In the morning on December 13, 2017, Roche communicated to BofA Merrill Lynch that Roche continued to review the strategic
opportunity to acquire the Company and that, should Roche decide to submit an offer, it would need until the week of January 15, 2018
to submit its bid.

In the afternoon on December 13, 2017, the Company Board held a telephonic meeting to discuss the Company’s strategic process.
Representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch, J.P. Morgan and Latham & Watkins participated, as did members of the Company’s
management. The Company’s financial advisors provided a process update. Representatives of Latham & Watkins reviewed with the
Company Board its fiduciary duties when considering strategic transactions. Representatives of the Company’s financial advisors
discussed with the Company Board preliminary financial analyses, including key assumptions underlying the analyses. The Company
Board discussed with its financial advisors the advisability of accelerating its process in response to the Revised Party A Proposal. The
Company Board determined that the price per share represented in the Revised Party A Proposal was not sufficient to accelerate the
Company’s sale process to attempt to sign a merger agreement by December 21, 2017. The Company Board determined, however, that
the Revised Party A Proposal provided a sufficient basis for further negotiation and due diligence, and instructed management to
attempt to negotiate with Party A for a higher price per share and more favorable terms. The Company Board also directed
management and its financial advisors to continue the dialogue with other companies that had expressed an interest and inform them
that the timing of the process may accelerate.

After the Company Board’s meeting on December 13, 2017, Dr. Lim called the CEO of Party A to respond to Party A’s Revised Party
A Proposal. Dr. Lim stated that the Company Board had determined that the price per share represented in the Revised Party A
Proposal was not sufficient for the Company to accelerate its sale process to accommodate Party A’s desired timeframe. During this
call, Dr. Lim and the CEO of Party A discussed the factors that the Company Board would consider in evaluating the Revised Party A
Proposal, including the price per share offered, the premium above trading price, whether the Company would consider accelerating its
sale process, and that the Company had received interest from other parties on track to meet the Company’s original timeline.

Later in the afternoon on December 13, 2017, the CEO of Party A called Dr. Lim and verbally communicated a revised indication of
interest (the “Final Party A Proposal”) to acquire all outstanding capital stock of the Company for $25.00 per share in cash, which
represented a premium of 61% to the Company’s closing share price from the prior trading day of $15.55 per share. The Final Party A
Proposal reiterated a deadline to sign a definitive agreement by Thursday, December 21, 2017.

In the evening on December 13, 2017, the Company Board held a telephonic meeting to discuss the Final Party A Proposal.
Representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch, J.P. Morgan and Latham & Watkins participated, as did members of the Company’s
management. Dr. Lim updated the Company Board regarding his discussion with the CEO of Party A, as well as the Final Party A
Proposal. Representatives from the Company’s financial advisors discussed the Final Party A Proposal and discussed preliminary
financial analyses. The Company Board discussed the Final Party A Proposal, including the merits of proceeding to meet Party A’s
accelerated timeline. Representatives from Latham & Watkins discussed the Company Board’s fiduciary duties when considering

strategic transactions, including the Company’s ability to move forward with negotiations of a definitive acquisition agreement at the
value and on the timeline in the Final Party A Proposal while informing other potential acquirers of the required timetable for
participating in the Company’s sale process. Representatives from BofA Merrill Lynch and J.P. Morgan then reviewed with the

Company Board the status of discussions with other potential acquirers. The Company Board instructed management and Latham &
Watkins to begin negotiating transaction documents with Party A, including a termination fee and other transactional protections that
would not discourage other interested potential acquirers from making superior proposals and would preserve the ability of the
Company to evaluate and accept superior proposals. The Company Board also directed the financial advisors to reach out to select
other potential acquirers, including Roche and Party B to alert them of the need to move on an accelerated timeline if they were going
to participate in the Company’s sale process.

After the Company Board telephonic meeting, Dr. Lim communicated to the CEO of Party A that the Company was willing to work
toward meeting Party A’s December 21, 2017 timeline to sign a definitive acquisition agreement at the value indicated in the Final
Party A Proposal, provided that the parties could reach mutually agreeable terms.

Also in the evening on December 13, 2017, Latham & Watkins provided to legal counsel to Party A a draft of a merger agreement that
had been prepared for the Company’s strategic process which provided for a single step merger transaction, transactional protections
and other terms as directed by the Company Board, referred to herein as the Company’s auction draft of the merger agreement.

In the evening on December 13, 2017, BofA Merrill Lynch contacted Roche and informed Roche of the accelerated timeframe for the
Company’s sale process due to an alternative proposal from another bidder.

In the morning on December 14, 2017, the Head of Partnering at Roche contacted Dr. Lim and they discussed the accelerated
timeframe for the Company’s sale process. The Head of Partnering at Roche informed Dr. Lim of Roche’s strong interest in acquiring
the Company and communicated that the Head of Partnering at Roche would be meeting with the CEO of Roche on December 18,
2017 and submitting a bid by December 19, 2017 or December 20, 2017 to acquire the Company. In the meantime, the Company
continued to actively respond to Roche’s diligence requests.

On December 14, 2017, Roche received the Company’s auction draft of the merger agreement that had been prepared for the
Company’s sale process.

On December 14, 2017, Party B and its financial advisor began conducting diligence on the Company’s operations.

In the morning on December 15, 2017, the Company Board held a telephonic meeting to discuss the Company’s strategic process.
Representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch, J.P. Morgan and Latham & Watkins participated, as did members of the Company’s
management. The Company Board discussed the status of discussions with the interested parties. Latham & Watkins and the financial
advisors updated the Company Board on the status of discussions with Party A and their advisors, including issues raised in
preliminary discussions regarding the terms of the draft merger agreement. The financial advisors discussed Roche’s profile, including
the company’s financial resources, strategic focus and ability to complete a transaction. The financial advisors noted that Roche had
expressed serious interest in participating in the Company’s sale process, but that Roche had concerns about its ability to meet an
accelerated timeline. The financial advisors then discussed their interactions with Party B, and Mr. Hornby discussed the due diligence
that was currently underway by each of Roche, Party A and Party B. The Company Board discussed the potential advantages and
disadvantages of conducting a broader market check. The Company Board noted that the Company’s broad licensing process had
exposed the Company to multiple parties that had conducted due diligence and its belief that if any party had an interest in acquiring
the Company, the party would have already contacted the Company or its representatives. The Company Board decided against
reaching out to any additional potential acquirers beyond those that had affirmatively expressed interest in a sale of the Company,
concluding that, in light of the work that had been done to date to assess interest in the Company, as well as the risks of press leaks and
potential loss of momentum in the process, the downside of expanding to a broader market check far outweighed the potential
advantages. The Company Board directed management, the financial advisors and Latham & Watkins to continue to pursue
negotiations with each of the potential acquirers discussed at the meeting and to re-affirm with all parties the accelerated timeline for a
potential transaction.

On December 16, 2017, legal counsel to Party A provided its own draft of a form of merger agreement with terms differing
considerably from the auction draft previously circulated by Latham & Watkins, including changing the transaction structure to a
tender offer to accelerate the time to close the transaction, and more robust deal protection measures favoring Party A, including a
termination fee equal to 4% of the aggregate equity value of the transaction. The draft also contained financing terms, which increased
the uncertainty regarding completing the transaction.

On December 16, 2017, Roche’s Head of Partnering contacted Dr. Lim to discuss the Company’s sale process. During the call, Roche’s
Head of Partnering indicated that Roche was interested in acquiring all of the outstanding stock of the Company for $1.7 billion which
she believed represented a share price offer between $25.00 and $27.00 per share. Dr. Lim indicated that the Company had received a

compelling offer that the Company Board would review and make a decision on by December 21, 2017 and indicated that Roche
would need to accelerate its timing to be competitive and that a bid at the higher end of Roche’s valuation range would be necessary.

On the morning of December 17, 2017, Roche’s Head of Partnering indicated that Roche’s senior management had approved a verbal
indication of interest (the “Roche Proposal”) to acquire all outstanding capital stock of the Company for $27.00 per share in cash, with
a targeted deal announcement on or before December 30, 2017. The Roche Proposal represented a premium of 77% to the Company’s
closing share price from the prior trading day of $15.25 per share. Roche’s Head of Partnering indicated an intention for the
organization to work as quickly as possible to a deal announcement, but said a signing date of December 21, 2017 was unlikely.

Later in the morning on December 17, 2017, the Company Board held a telephonic meeting to discuss the Company’s sale process.
Representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch, J.P. Morgan and Latham & Watkins participated, as did members of the Company’s
management. Latham & Watkins provided an update on the status of discussions with Party A, including a review of the issues raised
by Party A’s draft merger agreement, including significant issues relating to timing, deal certainty and the ability of the Board to
consider alternative proposals. The Company Board provided input and directed management, the financial advisors and Latham &
Watkins to continue to pursue negotiations with Party A. Dr. Lim provided an update on interactions with Roche and the Roche
Proposal, including Roche’s inability to meet a signing deadline of December 21, 2017. The Company Board, management and the
Company’s advisors then discussed how to accelerate the timeline for Roche to enter into a definitive acquisition agreement to meet the
timing set in the Final Party A Proposal. They also discussed the risk to the offer presented by Party A if the December 21, 2017
signing deadline requested by Party A was not met. The Company Board directed Dr. Lim to reengage with Roche and indicate that the
price proposed in the Roche Proposal was likely acceptable at $27.00 per share, provided that Roche could move to the execution of a
binding definitive agreement by Friday, December 22, 2017 on mutually agreeable terms.

On December 17, 2017, after the meeting of the Company’s Board, Dr. Lim called Roche and relayed the positive feedback on the offer
price and the strong encouragement that in order to succeed in the process, Roche would need to sign a definitive agreement regarding
the transaction no later than December 22, 2017. Roche continued to indicate that signing a definitive agreement by December 22,
2017 was unlikely but that it would endeavor to provide as much certainty as it could and plan to sign an agreement shortly after
December 25, 2017. The Head of Partnering at Roche indicated that Roche would send a draft of an acquisition agreement on
December 20, 2017.

On December 18, 2017, the CEO of Roche contacted Dr. Lim telephonically, and indicated that good progress was being made with
due diligence, but that it was unlikely that Roche would be prepared to sign a definitive acquisition agreement and announce the
transaction by December 22, 2017. Dr. Lim indicated that the Company expected another party to have a fully documented offer in
front of the Company Board by December 21, 2017, and that Roche would need to meet that timing if they were going to be successful
in the process. The parties agreed to discuss timing of the transaction again over the following days.

Also in the morning on December 18, 2017, Latham & Watkins participated in a telephonic meeting with Party A’s legal counsel
regarding the draft merger agreement. The parties discussed (i) deal protection terms, including the appropriateness of a go-shop
provision, the no-shop terms and the size of the proposed break fee, (ii) revisions to representations and warranties, the timing and
scheduling burden, and the lack of deal certainty created by the “bring down” standards, (iii) the extent of changes and the challenges
of resolving all open issues while still meeting Party A’s timeline, and (iv) the accelerated timeline of the transaction and the need for
concessions on items included in the merger agreement.

Also in the morning on December 18, 2017, Latham & Watkins delivered to Roche a draft of the disclosure letter to the merger
agreement.

Later in the morning on December 18, 2017, the Company Board held a telephonic meeting to discuss the progress of the Company’s
strategic process. Latham & Watkins provided an update on the status of discussions with Party A, including a review of the
outstanding issues under the draft merger agreement provided by their counsel, including significant issues relating to timing, deal
certainty and the ability of the Company Board to consider alternative proposals. Dr. Lim updated the Company Board on his
conversations with Roche regarding certainty and timing of the transaction. The Company Board provided input and instructed
management and the advisors to continue to engage with Roche, Party A, and Party B, including making sure all parties were aware of
the accelerated timeline for the transaction.

Later on December 18, 2017, Roche’s Head of Partnering and Dr. Lim discussed ways in which Roche’s process could potentially be
accelerated, including streamlining the legal review, creating daily updates for Dr. Lim to speak with Roche’s CEO, and allowing a
broader working group of Roche and Company representatives and advisors to communicate directly regarding the merger agreement,
the status of due diligence, and the approval process for both companies.

Early on December 19, 2017, Latham & Watkins sent Roche and Sidley Austin LLP (“Sidley Austin”), legal counsel to Roche, a draft

On December 19, 2017, the CEO of Roche informed Dr. Lim that Roche was still unlikely to meet the Company’s desired
December 22, 2017 timeline. Dr. Lim warned Roche that if they could not meet the December 22, 2017 deadline, the Company Board
may accept an alternative proposal.

Later in the afternoon on December 19, 2017, the Company Board held a telephonic meeting to discuss the Company’s strategic
process. Representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch, J.P. Morgan and Latham & Watkins participated, as did members of the Company’s
management. The Company’s financial advisors provided an overview of the status of discussions with the parties in the process and
management reviewed diligence activity by Roche, Party A, and Party B. Dr. Lim also provided an overview of recent discussions with
Roche regarding its ability to meet the accelerated timing of the process. Dr. Lim also reviewed the progress made by Latham &
Watkins with respect to definitive documentation for a potential transaction with either Roche or Party A. The Company’s management
then updated the Company Board with the progress to date by Party B. The Company’s advisors indicated that requests for and review
of due diligence materials by Party B had been moving at a slower pace than the due diligence being conducted by Roche and Party A.
Latham & Watkins described interactions with Party A’s legal counsel. Latham & Watkins also discussed the key open issues in the
negotiation of the draft merger agreement for Party A, including a termination fee equal to 4% of the aggregate equity value of the
transaction, deal protection terms that could hinder the ability of the Company to consider superior proposals, and provisions requiring
the Company to cooperate with Party A on expanding a financing facility in order to complete the transaction. The Company Board
discussed the status of the negotiation of value with Party A and its belief that the Final Party A Proposal reflected the highest price
Party A could pay. Dr. Lim then provided an update to the Company Board with respect to interactions with Roche. Among other
things, Dr. Lim noted the active engagement of their senior executives and that significant resources had been dedicated to completing
diligence. Roche had indicated that it was expecting to provide a proposed draft acquisition agreement based upon the merger
agreement form provided by Latham & Watkins, by Wednesday, December 20, 2017. A discussion then ensued among the Company
Board, Company management, and the Company’s financial and legal advisors regarding how to obtain the best potential transaction
for the Company’s stockholders given the level of interest being shown by both Roche and Party A. The Company Board instructed
management and its advisors to continue to progress the negotiations with Party A and Roche and to encourage Roche to submit a fully
documented bid by December 22, 2017.

Later on December 19, 2017, Party A contacted Dr. Lim to discuss a number of matters related to the draft merger agreement and
communicated that it would send across a revised merger agreement reflecting the final terms Party A was willing to accept to
complete an acquisition of the Company.

Also on December 19, 2017, the Company entered into separate engagement letters with each of BofA Merrill Lynch and J.P. Morgan.

On December 20, 2017, the CEO of Roche contacted Dr. Lim to tell him that Roche’s due diligence would be completed that evening,
Roche’s lawyers would be sending the Company a markup of the merger agreement, and that Roche had the ability to sign a merger
agreement by the evening of Thursday, December 21, 2017, matching the timeline set forth in the Final Party A Proposal.

In the morning on December 20, 2017, Latham & Watkins delivered to legal counsel for Party A and Sidley Austin updates to the
disclosure letters to the merger agreements, which included a description of the routine year-end compensation matters for the
Company’s employees, including the executive officers, which included annual equity awards, 2017 annual bonuses and 2018 base
salary increases, and a description of the proposed tax reimbursement arrangements to be provided for the executive officers of the
Company.

On December 20, 2017, Sidley Austin and Latham & Watkins exchanged drafts of a merger agreement. The Sidley Austin draft
reflected a two-step tender offer structure as had been agreed between the lawyers, and accepted most of the key terms contained in the
auction draft. That same day and through December 21, 2017, Latham & Watkins, with input from the Company, negotiated
satisfactory resolution of all of the open issues in the merger agreement with Sidley Austin, including employee compensation matters.
As part of this resolution, the parties agreed (i) that the Company Termination Fee would be equal to $58 million, or approximately 3%
of the aggregate equity value of the transaction, (ii) that the Company would have an appropriate “fiduciary out” and (iii) to an
appropriate level of time and effort that would be required of Roche to obtain antitrust approval. Latham & Watkins and Sidley Austin
also exchanged and discussed drafts of tender and support agreements to be executed concurrently with the signing of a merger
agreement.

Also on December 20, 2017, the CEO and a corporate development executive at Party A contacted Dr. Lim to discuss the draft merger
agreement and communicated that they would send across a revised merger agreement reflecting Party A’s final terms it was willing to
accept to complete an acquisition of the Company. Legal counsel for Party A sent a revised draft of a merger agreement to Latham &
Watkins, and legal counsel for both parties engaged in negotiations of the terms of the agreement.

In the afternoon on December 20, 2017, the Company Board held a special meeting. Representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch, J.P.
Morgan and Latham & Watkins participated, as did members of the Company’s management. Dr. Lim discussed the status of
discussions with Party A and Roche and the on-going due diligence review. Latham & Watkins reviewed with the Company Board its
fiduciary duties with respect to the proposed sale of the Company and reviewed the strategic process to date. Latham & Watkins
reviewed key terms of the draft merger agreements and tender and support agreements, including various deal protection measures, and
summarized the remaining open issues under each draft merger agreement. Latham & Watkins noted that compared with the draft
merger agreement negotiated with Roche, the draft merger agreement negotiated with Party A required more comprehensive
representations and warranties, would not exclude adverse regulatory and clinical developments in determining whether there had been
a material adverse effect, and contained significantly more restrictive deal protection terms. Party A also continued to require debt
financing to complete the transaction. Representatives of Latham & Watkins also provided the Company Board with a review of
antitrust considerations related to the proposed transaction. Representatives of the Company’s financial advisers discussed with the
Company Board their confidence that other potential buyers would have time to make a competing offer under the twenty business day
timing of a tender offer (even without a delay in the timing of the launch of a tender offer) and would not be deterred by a 3% break-up
fee. The Company Board then discussed whether the Company’s financial advisors should affirmatively pursue other potential buyers
in light of the current offers. The representatives of the Company’s financial advisors noted that no other party had expressed interest in
participating in the Company’s sale process, other than Party B which had not made significant progress in completing due diligence,
despite earlier discussions. The Company Board then discussed strategic alternatives, including the state of the Company and its
current business plans, as well as the pros and cons of each of the proposed transactions relative to other strategic alternatives. The
Company Board instructed management and Latham & Watkins to seek to finalize transaction documents on satisfactory terms with
Party A and Roche.

Later on December 20, 2017, the CEO of Roche communicated to Dr. Lim the full support from Roche’s Board. Later that evening,
Roche submitted a written proposal to acquire the Company at $27.00 per share.

On December 21, 2017, Dr. Lim had a call with the CEO of Party A regarding the key remaining issues of the merger agreement,
including the representations and warranties and material adverse effect definition. The CEO of Party A conveyed that Party A was not
prepared to make any further compromises. Later that morning, Latham & Watkins sent a draft of a revised merger agreement to legal
counsel for Party A reflecting the Company’s position on the remaining open issues.

Later in the morning on December 21, 2017, the CEO of Roche and Dr. Lim discussed and resolved several final due diligence issues
and open issues under the merger agreement.

On December 21, 2017, the Company Board held two special meetings to discuss the proposed sale of the Company. Representatives
of BofA Merrill Lynch, J.P. Morgan and Latham & Watkins participated at each meeting, as did members of the Company’s
management.

At the first meeting, Latham & Watkins reviewed with the Company Board its fiduciary duties with respect to the proposed sale of the
Company and reviewed the strategic process to date. Latham & Watkins reviewed key terms of the draft merger agreements and tender
and support agreements, including various deal protection measures, and summarized the remaining open issues under each draft
merger agreement. The Company Board instructed management and Latham & Watkins to seek to finalize transaction documents on
satisfactory terms with Party A and Roche.

At the second meeting,
 

 
•  representatives of Latham & Watkins again reviewed with the Company Board its fiduciary duties when considering the

proposed transaction;
 

 
•  Latham & Watkins reviewed with the Company Board the outcome of the negotiations with Roche and the revised terms and

conditions of the proposed Merger Agreement;
 

 

•  management and representatives of the financial advisors reviewed with the Company Board the financial projections case
for the Company prepared by Company management reflecting management’s view of the impact of the then pending Tax
Cuts & Jobs Act that had recently been passed by both the U.S. Senate and the U.S. House of Representatives (although had
not yet been signed into law) (the “Pending Tax Law Case”) and discussed with the Company Board that the financial
advisors performed their financial analyses using both the Pending Tax Law Case and Company’s management financial
projection case reflecting U.S. tax law as then in effect; and

•  representatives of each of BofA Merrill Lynch and J.P. Morgan reviewed with the Company Board their financial analysis of

the $27.00 per share cash consideration that would be received by holders of Common Stock under the proposed transaction
offered by Roche and each financial advisor delivered to the Company Board an oral opinion, subsequently

confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated as of December 21, 2017, to the effect that, as of that date and subject to
the various assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered, and qualifications and limitations on the review
undertaken by it as set forth in its written opinion, the $27.00 per Share cash consideration to be received by holders of
Common Stock (other than as specified in such opinion) in the Offer and the Merger, taken together, was fair, from a
financial point of view, to such holders. For a detailed discussion of the opinions of BofA Merrill Lynch and J.P. Morgan,
please see below under the heading “—Opinions of the Company Financial Advisors.”

Dr. Lim also informed the Company Board that, based upon, among other things, the Company’s management’s views of the
Company’s prospects on a standalone basis, its consideration of all the alternatives available to the Company and the information and
advice provided by BofA Merrill Lynch, J.P. Morgan and Latham & Watkins, it was the Company’s management’s recommendation
that the Company Board approve the transaction as proposed by Roche. The Company Board considered various reasons to approve
the merger, and certain countervailing factors. For a detailed description of the various reasons considered by the Company Board,
please see below under the heading “—Reasons for the Recommendation of the Company Board.”

After discussions with its financial and legal advisors and members of the Company’s management, and in light of the reasons
considered, the Company Board unanimously: (i) determined that the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby,
including the Offer and the Merger, are advisable and fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company and its stockholders,
(ii) approved the execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the Merger Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated thereby, including the Offer and the Merger and (iii) resolved to recommend that the stockholders of the
Company tender their Shares to Purchaser pursuant to the Offer.

At the recommendation of the compensation committee of the Company Board, the Company Board also approved certain
compensatory matters, including the routine year-end compensation matters for the Company’s employees, including the executive
officers, which included annual equity awards, 2017 annual bonuses and 2018 base salary increases, and an agreement with Dr. Lim to
provide for the payment or reimbursement of excise taxes (and any related taxes or penalties or interest on such excise taxes or any
such tax-gross up payment) imposed on any compensation or benefits provided to him in connection with the Merger.

On December 21, 2017, Parent, Purchaser and the Company executed and delivered the Merger Agreement and Roche, Purchaser and
certain directors and stockholders and an officer of the Company executed and delivered the Tender and Support Agreement. Prior to
the open of markets on December 22, 2017, the Company and Roche issued a joint press release announcing the execution of the
Merger Agreement.

On January 10, 2018, Purchaser commenced the Offer.

Reasons for the Recommendation of the Company Board

In evaluating the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Offer and the Merger, and recommending
that the Company’s stockholders accept the Offer and tender all of their Shares pursuant to the Offer, the Company Board consulted
with the Company’s senior management and the Company’s financial advisors, BofA Merrill Lynch and J.P. Morgan, and considered
and analyzed a wide and complex range of factors discussed below. The Company Board also consulted with Latham & Watkins
regarding the Company Board’s fiduciary duties, legal due diligence matters and the terms of the Merger Agreement and related
agreements. Based on these consultations, considerations and analyses, and the factors discussed below, the Company Board concluded
that entering into the Merger Agreement with Parent and Purchaser would yield the highest value reasonably available for the
Company’s stockholders and is fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company’s stockholders.

The Company Board believed the following material factors and benefits supported its unanimous determination and recommendation:
 

 

•  The Company’s Operating and Financial Condition; Prospects of the Company. The Company Board considered the current
and historical financial condition, results of operations and business of the Company as well as the Company’s prospects and
risks if the Company were to remain an independent company, including the significant capital required to bring a drug
candidate through trials to market and that continuing to raise capital as a standalone company would be dilutive to existing
investors, and the potential impact on the trading price of the Common Stock (which is not feasible to quantify numerically).
The Company Board evaluated the Company’s current product development pipeline, and general business and financial
plans, including the risks and uncertainties associated with continued clinical development of the Company’s entrectinib
product candidate as well as other product candidates under development. The Company Board also evaluated the potential
to continue to carry out the Company’s development and regulatory strategy alone, or together with a strategic partner. The
Company Board also

considered the general risk of market conditions that could reduce the Company’s stock price. Among the potential risks
identified by the Company Board were the competitive nature of the pharmaceutical industry, and specifically, competition
with respect to oncology indications, the Company’s financial resources relative to its competitors, the Company’s ability to
successfully complete clinical development, obtain regulatory approval, manufacture, distribute, commercialize and make
profitable entrectinib or any other product candidate, the Company’s ability to maintain patent coverage for its product
candidates, the potential impact on its business of government healthcare reform, and general risks and market conditions
that could reduce the market price of the Shares.

 

 

•  Premium to Market Price. The Company Board considered the relationship of the Offer Price to the current and historical
market prices of the Shares. The Offer Price to be paid in cash for each Share would provide stockholders with the
opportunity to receive a significant premium over the current and historical market price of the Shares. The Company Board
reviewed historical market prices, volatility and trading information with respect to the Shares, including the fact that the
Offer Price represented a premium of approximately 74% over the closing price per share of the Shares on the Nasdaq
Global Market on December 21, 2017, the last trading day prior to the announcement of the Merger Agreement, and a
premium of approximately 71% and 89% to the trailing 30-trading-day and 90-trading-day volume weighted average prices
per Share, respectively, prior to the execution date of the Merger Agreement. The Offer Price also represents a premium of
60% over the 52-week high closing price per Share, and a premium of 46% over the all-time high closing price per Share.

 

 

•  Certainty of Value. The Company Board considered that the consideration to be received by the Company’s stockholders in
the Offer and the Merger will consist entirely of cash, which provides liquidity and certainty of value to stockholders. The
Company Board believed this certainty of value was compelling compared to the long-term value creation potential of the
Company’s business taking into account the risks of remaining independent and pursuing the Company’s current business
and financial plans.

 

 

•  Potential Strategic Alternatives. The Company Board considered possible alternatives to the acquisition by Parent (including
the possibility of continuing to operate the Company as an independent entity and the desirability and perceived risks of
each of those alternatives), potential benefits and risks to the Company’s stockholders of these alternatives and the timing
and likelihood of effecting such alternatives, as well as the Company Board’s assessment that none of these alternatives was
reasonably likely to present superior opportunities for the Company to create greater value for the Company’s stockholders,
taking into account risks of execution as well as business, competitive, industry and market risks. The Company Board also
considered the outcome of the Company’s licensing process, the initial interest expressed from potential licensing partners,
the view that a licensing arrangement with respect to entrectinib could discourage companies from seeking to acquire the
Company and the fact that the Company had not received interest in licensing entrectinib on terms that the Company Board
and management found to be acceptable. The Company Board also considered Parent’s superior proposal of $27.00 per
Share relative to a proposal made by Party A to acquire the Company as a price of $25.00 per Share which was submitted by
Party A on December 13, 2017 (which was increased by Party A from $23.00 per Share and $23.75 per Share relative to
proposals made by Party A on December 6, 2017 and December 12, 2017, respectively).

 

 

•  Full and Fair Value. The Company Board believed that the Offer Price of $27.00 per Share represents full and fair value for
the Shares, taking into account the Company Board’s familiarity with the business strategy, assets, prospects, and projected
results for the 2018 to 2032 fiscal years, and the relative certainty of the consideration in cash for the Offer as compared to
forecasted financial results.

 

 

•  Highest Value Reasonably Obtainable. The Company Board believed that the Offer Price of $27.00 per Share represented
the highest value reasonably obtainable for the Shares, based on the progress and outcome of its negotiations with Parent, a
number of changes in the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement from the version initially proposed by Parent that
were favorable to the Company the fact that a number of other strategic parties that had been contacted with respect to the
acquisition of the Company had not expressed the desire or ability to propose a higher valuation. Further, the Company
Board determined that the proposal from Parent was superior to the proposal from Party A both in terms of purchase price
per Share and on key contractual terms such as deal protection (including the break-up fee and the Company’s ability to
terminate the Merger Agreement to consider a superior proposal), the absence of any financing assistance provisions and
representations and warranties (including the exclusion of adverse regulatory and clinical developments in determining
whether there had been a material adverse effect on the Company). The Company Board believed, based on these
negotiations, that the Offer Price was the highest price per Share that Parent was willing to pay and that the Merger
Agreement contained the most favorable terms to the Company to which Parent was willing to agree.

 

 
•  Speed and Likelihood of Completion. The Company Board considered the anticipated timing of the consummation of the

transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the structure of the transaction as a cash tender offer for all
outstanding Shares, with the anticipated result of allowing

stockholders to receive the Offer Price in a relatively short time frame, followed by the Merger in which stockholders who
do not validly exercise appraisal rights will receive the same consideration received by those stockholders who tender their
Shares in the Offer. The Company Board noted that Parent would require no additional financing and, instead, would fund
the purchase price from existing cash resources. The Company Board also believed the transaction was unlikely to be
delayed by antitrust review. The Company Board considered that the potential for closing in a relatively short time frame
could also reduce the amount of time in which the Company’s business would be subject to the potential uncertainty of
closing and related disruption.

 

 

•  Business Reputation of Parent. The Company Board considered the business reputation, management and financial
resources of Parent with respect to the transaction, as well as likely continuation of Parent as an independent entity which
ensured higher certainty of closing. The Company Board believed that these factors supported the conclusion that a
transaction with Parent and Purchaser could be completed relatively quickly and in an orderly manner.

 

 

•  Opinions of the Company’s Financial Advisors. The Company Board considered the respective opinions of BofA Merrill
Lynch and J.P. Morgan, rendered verbally to the Company Board on December 21, 2017, each of which was subsequently
confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated such date, to the effect that, as of such date and subject to the various
assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered, and qualifications and limitations on the review undertaken
by each of BofA Merrill Lynch and J.P. Morgan as set forth in its written opinion, the $27.00 per Share cash consideration to
be received by holders of Common Stock (other than as specified in such opinion) in the Offer and the Merger, taken
together, was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders, as more fully described under the caption “Opinions of the
Company’s Financial Advisors.”

 

 
•  The Merger Agreement. For the reasons noted below, the Company Board believed that the provisions of the Merger

Agreement were advisable and fair to and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. In particular:
 

 
•  No Financing Condition. The Company Board considered the representation of Parent and Purchaser that Parent

and Purchaser would have sufficient cash resources to pay the amounts required to be paid under the Merger
Agreement and that the Offer and the Merger are not subject to a financing condition.

 

 

•  Change in Recommendation/Termination Right to Accept Superior Proposals. In the event the Company
receives a superior acquisition proposal from a third party, the Company Board may withdraw or change its
recommendation or declaration of advisability of the Merger Agreement, the Offer, or the Merger, and terminate
the Merger Agreement, if the Company is not in breach of its non-solicitation obligations under the Merger
Agreement and the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that
the failure to do so would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties under applicable
law of the Company Board to the Company’s stockholders. In order for the Company Board to withdraw its
recommendation in connection with such a superior proposal, the Company Board must first provide Parent and
Purchaser with a right to make, and to negotiate in good faith with Parent one or more, counter-proposals to such
superior proposal. In order for the Company Board to terminate the Merger Agreement to enter into an
agreement with respect to such a superior proposal, it must concurrently pay Parent a termination fee of
$58 million (approximately 3% of the equity value of the transaction). The Company Board concluded that such
provisions were adequate to allow it to consider an alternative offer in a manner consistent with its fiduciary
obligations to the Company and its stockholders.

 

 

•  Change in Recommendation/Termination Right Following Intervening Events. The Company Board considered
its ability to change its recommendation or declaration of advisability of the Merger Agreement, the Offer, or the
Merger in response to certain unknown intervening events, if the Company is not in breach of its
non-solicitation obligations under the Merger Agreement and the Company Board determines in good faith,
after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to do so would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Company Board to the Company’s stockholders under applicable
law. In order for the Company Board to withdraw its recommendation in response to an intervening event, the
Company Board must first provide Parent and Purchaser with notice and a right to meet with the Company to
negotiate changes to the Merger Agreement so that such change in recommendation is no longer necessary.

Table of Contents

 
•  Termination Fee. The Company Board was of the view that the $58 million termination fee payable by the

Company to Parent if the Merger Agreement is terminated for certain reasons provided in the Merger Agreement
was reasonable, and would not likely deter competing bids.

 

 

•  Extension of Offer Period. The Company Board considered that, under certain circumstances set forth in the
Merger Agreement, Purchaser is required to extend the Offer beyond the initial expiration date of the Offer or, if
applicable, subsequent expiration dates, if the conditions to the consummation of the Offer are not satisfied or
waived as of such date.

 

 

•  Outside Date. The Company Board considered the fact that the outside closing date under the Merger
Agreement on which either party, subject to certain exceptions, can terminate the Merger Agreement, allows for
sufficient time to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, but also prevents the
Offer from being extended for an unreasonable amount of time.

 

 

•  Conditions to the Consummation of the Offer and the Merger; Likelihood of Closing. The Company Board
considered the reasonable likelihood of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement in light of the conditions to Purchaser’s obligations to accept for payment and pay for Shares validly
tendered pursuant to the Offer and to complete the Merger under the Merger Agreement, including the fact that
the parties elected to have the Merger Agreement be governed by Section 251(h) of the DGCL to enable
consummation of the Merger promptly following the consummation of the Offer.

 

 

•  Enforcement. The Company Board considered the Company’s ability to obtain specific enforcement of Parent’s
and Purchaser’s obligations under the Merger Agreement, thereby ensuring that the Company has an appropriate
remedy in the event Parent and Purchaser were to decline to comply with their obligations under the Merger
Agreement.

 

 

•  Material Adverse Effect. The Company Board considered the provision in the Merger Agreement that various
changes, conditions, events, circumstances, effects, occurrences or developments related to the Company or its
business are specifically excluded from the determination of whether a material adverse effect has occurred
(including, in particular, the exclusion of adverse regulatory and clinical developments) that otherwise would
permit Parent and Purchaser to elect not to consummate the Offer.

 

 
•  Appraisal Rights. The Company Board considered the fact that the stockholders that do not tender their Shares

in the Offer and who properly exercise their appraisal rights under Delaware law will be entitled to such
appraisal rights in connection with the Merger.

The Company Board also considered a variety of uncertainties and risks and other potentially negative factors in its deliberations
concerning the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including, but not limited to, the
following:
 

 
•  No Stockholder Participation in Future Growth or Earnings. The nature of the Offer and the Merger as a cash transaction

means that the stockholders will not participate in future earnings or growth of the Company and will not benefit from any
appreciation in value of the combined company.

 

 

•  Risk Associated with Failure to Complete the Offer and Consummate the Merger. The possibility that the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Offer and the Merger, might not be consummated, and the fact that if
the Offer and the Merger are not consummated, (i) the Company’s directors, senior management and other employees will
have expended extensive time and effort and will have experienced significant distractions from their work during the
pendency of the transaction, (ii) the Company will have incurred significant transaction costs, (iii) the Company’s
continuing business relationships with consultants, licensors, business partners and employees may be adversely affected,
(iv) the trading price of the Shares could be adversely affected and (v) the market’s perceptions of the Company’s prospects
could be adversely affected.

 

 

•  Interim Restrictions on Business Pending the Completion of the Offer and the Merger. Restrictions on the conduct of the
Company’s business prior to the Effective Time due to pre-closing covenants in the Merger Agreement whereby the
Company agreed that it will carry on its business in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice and, subject
to specified exceptions, will not take a number of actions related to the conduct of its business without the prior written
consent of Parent, which may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s ability to respond to changing market and
business conditions in a timely manner or at all.

Table of Contents

 
•  No Solicitation and Termination Fee. Subject to certain exceptions, the Merger Agreement precludes the Company from

soliciting alternative acquisition proposals, and requires the Company to pay to Parent a termination fee in certain
circumstances as described above.

 

 

•  Effects of Transaction Announcement. The effect of the public announcement of the Merger Agreement, including effects on
the Company’s stock price, and the Company’s ability to attract and retain key management and scientific and research
personnel, during the pendency of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, as well as the likelihood of
litigation in connection with the Merger.

 

 

•  Timing Risks. The amount of time it could take to complete the Offer and the Merger, including the risk that Parent and
Purchaser may not receive the necessary regulatory approvals or clearances to complete the Offer or the Merger, or that
governmental authorities could attempt to condition their approvals or clearances of the Offer or the Merger on one or more
of the parties’ compliance with certain burdensome terms or conditions which may cause one or more of the Offer
conditions not to be satisfied.

 

 
•  Taxable Consideration. The gains from the consideration to be received by the stockholders in the Offer and the Merger will

generally be taxable to the stockholders for federal income tax purposes.
 

 
•  Potential Conflicts of Interest. The possibility that the Company’s officers and directors may have interests in the

transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement that are different from, or in addition to, those of the Company’s other
stockholders.

The foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by the Company Board is intended to be illustrative and not
exhaustive, but includes the material reasons and factors considered by the Company Board in reaching its conclusions and
recommendation in relation to the Offer, the Merger, the Merger Agreement and the transactions proposed thereby. In view of the wide
variety of reasons and factors considered and the complexity of these matters, the Company Board did not find it practical to, and did
not, quantify or otherwise assign relative weights to the specified factors considered in reaching its determinations or the reasons for
such determinations. Individual directors may have given differing weights to different factors or may have had different reasons for
their ultimate determination. In addition, the Company Board did not reach any specific conclusion with respect to any of the factors or
reasons considered. Instead, the Company Board conducted an overall analysis of the factors and reasons described above and
determined in its business judgment that, in the aggregate, the potential benefits of the Offer and the Merger to the stockholders of the
Company outweighed the risks or potential negative consequences.

Opinions of the Company’s Financial Advisors

Opinion of BofA Merrill Lynch

The Company retained BofA Merrill Lynch to act as the Company’s financial advisor in connection with the Offer and the Merger
(collectively, the “Transaction”). BofA Merrill Lynch is an internationally recognized investment banking firm which is regularly
engaged in the valuation of businesses and securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions, negotiated underwritings, secondary
distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements and valuations for corporate and other purposes. The Company
selected BofA Merrill Lynch to act as the Company’s financial advisor in connection with the Transaction on the basis of BofA Merrill
Lynch’s experience in transactions similar to the Transaction, its reputation in the investment community and its familiarity with the
Company and its business.

On December 21, 2017, at a meeting of the Company Board held to evaluate the Transaction, BofA Merrill Lynch delivered to the
Company Board an oral opinion, which was confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated December 21, 2017, to the effect that, as
of that date and based on and subject to various assumptions and limitations described in the opinion, the Offer Price to be received by
holders of Shares (other than, to the extent applicable, Parent and its affiliates) in the Transaction was fair, from a financial point of
view, to such holders.

The full text of BofA Merrill Lynch’s written opinion, dated December 21, 2017, to the Company Board, which describes,
among other things, the assumptions made, procedures followed, factors considered and limitations on the review undertaken,
is attached as Annex I to this Schedule 14D-9 and is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. The following summary of
BofA Merrill Lynch’s opinion is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the opinion. BofA Merrill Lynch

Board for the benefit and use of the Company Board (in its capacity as such) in connection with and for purposes of its
evaluation of the Transaction, from a financial point of view. BofA Merrill Lynch’s opinion does not address any other aspect
or implications of the Transaction, and no opinion or view was expressed as to the relative merits of the Transaction in
comparison to other strategies or transactions that might be available to the Company or in which the Company might engage
or as to the underlying business decision of the Company to proceed with or effect the Transaction. BofA Merrill Lynch also
expressed no opinion or recommendation as to whether any stockholder should tender their shares of Common Stock in the
Offer or as to how any stockholder should vote or act in connection with the Transaction or any other matter.

In connection with rendering its opinion, BofA Merrill Lynch, among other things:
 

 •  reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information relating to the Company;
 

 

•  reviewed certain internal financial and operating information with respect to the business, operations and prospects of the
Company furnished to or discussed with BofA Merrill Lynch by the management of the Company, including certain
financial forecasts relating to the Company, including with respect to rates of growth of the Company’s unlevered free cash
flow after the forecast period, prepared by the management of the Company and containing two different cases, one which
reflected U.S. tax law as in effect as of the date of BofA Merrill Lynch’s opinion (the “Current Tax Law Case”) and one
which reflected U.S. tax law assuming the then pending Tax Cuts & Jobs Act, as passed by both the U.S. Senate and the U.S.
House of Representatives as of the date of BofA Merrill Lynch’s opinion, would be signed into law (the “Pending Tax Law
Case”, and together with the Current Tax Law Case, collectively, the “Company Forecasts” and referred to as the “Company
Projections” in the section of this Schedule 14D-9 entitled “—Certain Projections”);

 

 
•  reviewed and discussed with members of the management of the Company their estimates of the amount and utilization of

certain net operating losses (collectively, “NOLs”);
 

 
•  discussed with members of the management of the Company their assessments as to the product candidates of the Company,

including the likelihood of technical, clinical and regulatory success of such product candidates;
 

 
•  discussed the past and current business, operations, financial condition and prospects of the Company with members of

management of the Company;
 

 
•  reviewed the trading history of Common Stock and a comparison of that trading history with the trading histories of other

companies BofA Merrill Lynch deemed relevant;
 

 
•  compared certain financial and stock market information of the Company with similar information of other companies BofA

Merrill Lynch deemed relevant;
 

 
•  compared certain financial terms of the Transaction to financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of other transactions

BofA Merrill Lynch deemed relevant;
 

 
•  considered the results of BofA Merrill Lynch efforts on behalf of the Company to solicit, at the direction of the Company,

indications of interest and definitive proposals from third parties with respect to a possible acquisition of the Company;
 

 •  reviewed a draft, dated December 21, 2017, of the Merger Agreement (the “Draft Agreement”); and
 

 
•  performed such other analyses and studies and considered such other information and factors as BofA Merrill Lynch deemed

appropriate.

In arriving at its opinion, BofA Merrill Lynch assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the accuracy and
completeness of the financial and other information and data publicly available or provided to or otherwise reviewed by or discussed
with BofA Merrill Lynch and relied upon the assurances of the management of the Company that it was not aware of any facts or
circumstances that would make such information or data inaccurate or misleading in any material respect. With respect to the Company
Forecasts and the NOLs, BofA Merrill Lynch was advised by the Company, and assumed, at the direction of the Company Board, that
they were reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and good faith judgments of the management
of the Company as to the future financial performance of the Company under the two tax scenarios

reflected in the Company Forecasts and as to the other matters covered thereby. BofA Merrill Lynch relied, at the direction of the
Company, on the assessments of the management of the Company as to the ability of the Company to utilize the NOLs and was advised
by the Company, and assumed, at the direction of the Company, that such NOLs would be utilized in the amounts and at the times
projected. BofA Merrill Lynch also relied, at the direction of the Company, on the assessments as to the product candidates of the
Company, including the likelihood of technical, clinical and regulatory success of such product candidates. BofA Merrill Lynch did not
make and was not provided with any independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of the
Company or any other entity, nor did BofA Merrill Lynch make any physical inspection of the properties or assets of the Company or
any other entity. BofA Merrill Lynch did not evaluate the solvency or fair value of the Company or any other entity under any state,
federal or other laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. BofA Merrill Lynch assumed, at the direction of the
Company, that the Transaction would be consummated in accordance with its terms and in compliance with all applicable laws,
relevant documents and other requirements, without waiver, modification or amendment of any material term, condition or agreement
and that, in the course of obtaining the necessary governmental, regulatory and other approvals, consents, releases and waivers for the
Transaction, no delay, limitation, restriction or condition, including any divestiture requirements or amendments or modifications,
would be imposed that would have an adverse effect on the Company or the contemplated benefits of the Transaction. BofA Merrill
Lynch also assumed, at the direction of the Company, that the final executed Merger Agreement would not differ in any material
respect from the Draft Agreement reviewed by BofA Merrill Lynch.

BofA Merrill Lynch expressed no view or opinion as to any terms or other aspects or implications of the Transaction (other than the
Offer Price to the extent expressly specified in its opinion), including, without limitation, the form or structure of the Transaction or
any arrangements, agreements or understandings entered into in connection with or related to the Transaction or otherwise. BofA
Merrill Lynch’s opinion was limited to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the Offer Price to be received by holders of
Common Stock (other than, to the extent applicable, Parent and its affiliates) and no opinion or view was expressed with respect to any
consideration received in connection with the Transaction by the holders of any class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of
any party. In addition, no opinion or view was expressed with respect to the fairness (financial or otherwise) of the amount, nature or
any other aspect of any compensation to any of the officers, directors or employees of any party to the Transaction, or class of such
persons, relative to the Offer Price or otherwise. Furthermore, no opinion or view was expressed as to the relative merits of the
Transaction in comparison to other strategies or transactions that might be available to the Company or in which the Company might
engage or as to the underlying business decision of the Company to proceed with or effect the Transaction. In addition, BofA Merrill
Lynch did not express any view or opinion with respect to, and relied with the consent of the Company upon the assessments of the
Company and its representatives regarding, legal, regulatory, accounting, tax and similar matters relating to the Company and the
Transaction as to which BofA Merrill Lynch understood that the Company obtained such advice as it deemed necessary from qualified
professionals. In addition, BofA Merrill Lynch expressed no opinion or recommendation as to whether any stockholder should tender
their shares of Common Stock in the Offer or as to how any stockholder should vote or act in connection with the Transaction or any
other matter.

BofA Merrill Lynch’s opinion was necessarily based on financial, economic, monetary, market, tax (other than as noted in this section
above) and other conditions and circumstances as in effect on, and the information made available to BofA Merrill Lynch as of, the
date of its opinion. It should be understood that subsequent developments may affect BofA Merrill Lynch’s opinion, and BofA Merrill
Lynch does not have any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm its opinion. The issuance of BofA Merrill Lynch’s opinion was
approved by a fairness opinion review committee of BofA Merrill Lynch. Except as described in this summary, the Company imposed
no other instructions or limitations on the investigations made or procedures followed by BofA Merrill Lynch in rendering its opinion.

The discussion set forth below in the section entitled “Company Financial Analyses” represents a brief summary of the material
financial analyses presented by BofA Merrill Lynch to the Company Board in connection with BofA Merrill Lynch’s opinion, dated
December 21, 2017. The financial analyses summarized below include information presented in tabular format. In order to fully
understand the financial analyses performed by BofA Merrill Lynch, the tables must be read together with the text of each
summary. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the financial analyses performed by BofA Merrill Lynch.
Considering the data set forth in the tables below without considering the full narrative description of the financial analyses,
including the methodologies and assumptions underlying the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the
financial analyses performed by BofA Merrill Lynch.

Company Financial Analyses

Selected Publicly Traded Companies Analyses.

BofA Merrill Lynch reviewed, based on publicly available financial and stock market information, the enterprise values of the
following selected publicly traded oncology companies with a lead product in late stage clinical development and nearing commercial
stage, or at early commercial stage, that, in the professional judgment of BofA Merrill Lynch, have businesses that for the purposes of
this analysis may be considered similar to those of the Company, as a multiple of Wall Street analyst consensus estimates of calendar
years 2021 and 2022 probability-of-success adjusted, or “PoS Adjusted,” net revenues for the applicable company:
 

 •  Juno Therapeutics, Inc.
 

 •  TESARO, Inc.
 

 •  Puma Biotechnology, Inc.
 

 •  Clovis Oncology, Inc.
 

 •  Loxo Oncology, Inc.
 

 •  Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
 

 •  Immunomedics, Inc.
 

 •  Array BioPharma Inc.
 

 •  Epizyme, Inc.
 

 •  Karyopharm Therapeutics Inc.

BofA Merrill Lynch reviewed the enterprise values for each of the selected companies, calculated by multiplying the closing share
price of each applicable company as of December 20, 2017, by the number of fully-diluted shares outstanding of the applicable
company (determined on a treasury stock method basis based on information in its public filings), and adding to (or subtracting from,
as applicable) the result the amount of the applicable company’s net debt (or net cash) (defined as debt, preferred stock and minority
interest less cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities) based on information in its public filings, as a multiple of Wall Street
analyst consensus estimates of calendar years 2021 and 2022 PoS Adjusted net revenues for the applicable company (except with
respect to Immunomedics, Inc., where PoS Adjusted net revenue for calendar year 2021 was calculated as the average of estimated PoS
Adjusted net revenues for fiscal years ending June 30, 2021 and June 30, 2022, and PoS Adjusted net revenue for calendar year 2022
was calculated as the average of estimated PoS Adjusted net revenues for fiscal years ending June 30, 2022 and June 30, 2023). Those
estimates for the selected companies were obtained by BofA Merrill Lynch from FactSet (a data source containing historical and
estimated financial data).

The results of this analysis were as follows:
 

  Enterprise Values/PoS Adjusted Net Revenue  
  2021E   2022E  
Selected Companies (75th percentile)   3.75x   2.55x 
Selected Companies (mean)   3.15x   2.22x 
Selected Companies (median)   2.86x   2.49x 
Selected Companies (25th percentile)   2.36x   1.71x 

Based on its review of the enterprise values/PoS Adjusted net revenue multiples for the selected companies and on its professional
judgment and experience, BofA Merrill Lynch applied an enterprise value/PoS Adjusted net revenue multiple reference range of 2.50x
– 4.00x to the Company management’s estimates of calendar year 2021 PoS Adjusted net revenue as reflected in the Company
Forecasts and an enterprise value/PoS Adjusted net revenue multiple reference range of 1.50x – 2.75x to the Company management’s
estimates of calendar year 2022 PoS

Adjusted net revenue as reflected in the Company Forecasts. Based on these reference ranges of enterprise value/ PoS Adjusted net
revenue multiples, BofA Merrill Lynch calculated ranges of implied enterprise values for the Company. BofA Merrill Lynch then
calculated implied equity value per share reference ranges (rounded to the nearest $0.10) for the Company by adding to these ranges of
implied enterprise values an amount equal to $243 million, which represents the Company management’s estimate of the net cash of
the Company as of December 31, 2017, and dividing the result by the number of fully-diluted shares outstanding of Common Stock
(calculated on a treasury stock method basis taking into account outstanding in-the-money options, warrants and restricted stock units,
based on information provided by the Company management) and compared these implied equity value per share reference ranges to
the Offer Price and the closing price per share of Common Stock as of December 20, 2017, as follows:
 

Implied Equity Value Per Share
Reference Range for the Company    Offer Price   

The Company December 20, 2017
Closing Price  

2021E    2022E      
$14.00 – 20.10

  $
14.70 –

 23.70    $27.00    $15.35 

No selected company used in this analysis is identical or directly comparable to the Company. Accordingly, an evaluation of the results
of this analysis is not entirely mathematical. Rather, this analysis involves complex considerations and judgments concerning
differences in financial and operating characteristics and other factors that could affect the public trading or other values of the
companies to which the Company was compared.

Selected Transactions Analysis.

BofA Merrill Lynch reviewed, to the extent publicly available, financial information relating to the following ten selected transactions
that, in the professional judgment of BofA Merrill Lynch, were considered relevant as transactions involving target companies in the
biotechnology industry, announced since January 1, 2012, with transaction values ranging from approximately $1 billion to $5 billion:
 
Date     Target   Acquiror
07/20/16    Relypsa, Inc.   Galenica AG

05/31/16    Celator Pharmaceuticals, Inc.   Jazz Pharmaceuticals PLC

11/06/15    ZS Pharma, Inc.   AstraZeneca PLC

06/17/15    Kythera Biopharmaceuticals, Inc.   Allergan PLC

03/30/15    Auspex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.   Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.

12/02/14    Avanir Pharmaceuticals, Inc.   Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.

12/19/13    Gentium S.p.A.   Jazz Pharmaceuticals PLC

12/19/13    Algeta ASA   Bayer AG

04/23/12    Ardea Biosciences, Inc.   AstraZeneca PLC

01/07/12    Inhibitex, Inc.   Bristol-Myers Squibb Company

BofA Merrill Lynch calculated the transaction value of each of the selected transactions based on the consideration payable for the
target company in the applicable transaction and the net debt or net cash of the applicable target company as publicly disclosed prior to
the announcement of the applicable transaction, as multiples of estimates of the target company’s PoS Adjusted net revenue for the
fourth calendar year following the year in which the applicable transaction was announced, for transactions announced before June 30,
and for the fifth calendar year following the year in which the applicable transaction was announced, for transactions announced after
June 30 (in each case, referred to in this section as “CY + 5”), as disclosed by the applicable target company in connection with the
applicable transaction.

The results of this analysis were as follows:
 

   
Transaction Value/PoS

Adjusted Net Revenue CY + 5 
Selected Transactions (75th percentile)    4.75x 
Selected Transactions (mean)    4.63x 
Selected Transactions (median)    4.27x 
Selected Transactions (25th percentile)    3.92x 

Based on its review of the transaction values/PoS Adjusted net revenue multiples for the selected transactions and on its professional
judgment and experience, BofA Merrill Lynch applied a transaction value/PoS Adjusted net revenue multiple reference range of 2.00x
– 4.75x to the Company management’s estimates of calendar year 2022 PoS Adjusted net revenue as reflected in the Company
Forecasts. Based on this reference range of transaction value/PoS Adjusted net revenue multiples, BofA Merrill Lynch calculated a
range of implied enterprise values for the Company. BofA Merrill Lynch calculated an implied equity value per share reference range
(rounded to the nearest $0.10) for the Company by adding to this range of implied enterprise values an amount equal to $243 million,
which represents the Company management’s estimate of the net cash of the Company as of December 31, 2017, and dividing the
result by the number of fully-diluted shares outstanding of Common Stock (calculated on a treasury stock method basis taking into
account outstanding in-the-money options, warrants and restricted stock units, based on information provided by the Company
management), and compared the implied equity value per share reference range to the Offer Price and the closing price per share of
Common Stock as of December 20, 2017, as follows:
 

Implied Equity Value Per Share 
Reference Range for the Company   Offer Price  

The Company December 20, 2017
Closing Price

$18.30 – $38.10   $27.00   $15.35

No selected transaction used in this analysis or the applicable target company is identical or directly comparable to the Company or the
Transaction. Accordingly, an evaluation of the results of this analysis is not entirely mathematical. Rather, this analysis involves
complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and operating characteristics, market conditions and other
factors that could affect the acquisition or other values of the companies or transactions to which the Company and the Transaction
were compared.

Discounted Cash Flow Analysis.

BofA Merrill Lynch performed a discounted cash flow analysis to calculate a range of implied present values per share of Common
Stock as of December 31, 2017, utilizing estimates of the standalone, unlevered, after-tax free cash flows the Company was expected to
generate over the period from calendar year 2018 through calendar year 2032 based on the Company Forecasts under each of the
Current Tax Law Case and the Pending Tax Law Case. Unlevered, after-tax free cash flows was calculated as PoS Adjusted operating
income, less taxes, plus depreciation and amortization, less capital expenditures, plus / (less) changes in net working capital (based on
guidance provided by the Company management), all as reflected in the Company Forecasts.

Based on guidance provided by the Company management, BofA Merrill Lynch calculated a range of terminal values for the Company
using an assumed perpetuity growth rate range of negative 50% – negative 30% after calendar year 2032. The estimated free cash flows
for the Company over the period from calendar year 2018 through calendar year 2032 and the range of terminal values were discounted
to December 31, 2017, utilizing mid-year discounting convention, and using discount rates ranging from 12.25 % to 16.25%, reflecting
BofA Merrill Lynch’s

estimate of the Company’s weighted average cost of capital, to derive a range of implied enterprise values for the Company calculated
under each of the Current Tax Law Case and the Pending Tax Law Case. BofA Merrill Lynch added to these ranges of implied
enterprise values (i) an amount equal to $243 million, which represents the Company management’s estimate of the net cash of the
Company as of December 31, 2017 and (ii) the present value of the benefits from the Company’s net operating loss carryforwards as of
December 31, 2017 and from the Company’s future losses over the period from calendar year 2018 through calendar year 2020
discounted to December 31, 2017, utilizing mid-year discounting convention, and using a discount rate of 12.25% to 16.25%,
reflecting BofA Merrill Lynch’s estimate of the Company’s weighted average cost of capital, and divided the result by the number of
fully-diluted shares outstanding of Common Stock (calculated on a treasury stock method basis taking into account outstanding
in-the-money options, warrants and restricted stock units, based on information provided by the Company management), to derive the
following range of implied equity values per share (rounded to the nearest $0.10) for the Company, which BofA Merrill Lynch
compared to the Offer Price and the closing price per share of Common Stock as of December 20, 2017:
 

Forecast Case   
Implied Equity Value Per Share

Reference Ranges for the Company
Current Tax Law Case   $16.10 – 23.20
Pending Tax Law Case   $18.90 – 27.40

BofA Merrill Lynch noted that, given the limited comparability of the Company with the selected companies described above under
“—Selected Publicly Traded Companies Analyses,” it had placed relatively more emphasis on the discounted cash flow analysis for
purposes of its financial analysis.

Other Factors

BofA Merrill Lynch also noted certain additional factors that were not considered part of BofA Merrill Lynch’s financial analyses with
respect to its opinion but were referenced for informational purposes, including, among other things: (i) the low and high closing prices
of shares of Common Stock over the 52-week period ending December 20, 2017, (ii) Wall Street analysts 12-month price targets for
shares of Common Stock, discounted to one year, using a 14.25% assumed mid-point cost of equity, and (iii) an implied premium
analysis, in each case described below.

52-Week Trading Range. BofA Merrill Lynch observed that, over the 52-week period ending December 20, 2017, the low and high
closing prices for shares of Common Stock ranged from $4.85 to $16.85.

Wall Street Analysts Price Targets. BofA Merrill Lynch observed that Wall Street analyst 12-month price targets for shares of Common
Stock ranged from $20.00 to $31.00 per share of Common Stock. BofA Merrill Lynch discounted this range of price targets back one
year applying a discount rate of 14.25%, reflecting an estimate of the Company’s mid-point cost of equity, to derive discounted price
targets (rounded to the nearest $0.10) for shares of Common Stock ranging from $17.50 to $27.10.

Premium Analysis. BofA Merrill Lynch reviewed, among other things, premia paid in public company biopharmaceutical mergers and
acquisitions with transaction values between approximately $1 billion and $5 billion announced since January 1, 2012 measured in
relation to each target company’s (i) closing share price on the day prior to the announcement of the applicable transaction (or on the
unaffected date prior to the announcement of the transaction, when applicable), and (ii) highest closing share price over the 52-week
period prior to announcement or unaffected date of the Transaction. Based on this review and its professional judgment and experience,
BofA Merrill Lynch applied (i) a one-day premia reference range of 33% – 66% to the closing price per share of Common Stock on
December 20, 2017 of $15.35 to derive implied equity values per share of Common Stock (rounded to the nearest $0.10) ranging from
$20.40 to $25.50, and (ii) a 52-week high premia reference range of 10% – 44% to the highest closing price for share of Common
Stock over the 52-week period ending December 20, 2017 of $16.85, to derive implied equity values per share of Common Stock
(rounded to the nearest $0.10) ranging from $18.50 to $24.30.

Miscellaneous

As noted above, the discussion set forth above in the section entitled “Company Financial Analyses” is a summary of the financial
analyses presented by BofA Merrill Lynch to the Company Board in connection with its opinion and is not a comprehensive
description of all analyses undertaken or factors considered by BofA Merrill Lynch in connection with its opinion. The preparation of a
financial opinion is a complex analytical process involving various determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant methods of
financial analysis and the application of those methods to the particular circumstances and, therefore, a financial opinion is not readily
susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. BofA Merrill Lynch believes that the analyses summarized above must be
considered as a whole. BofA Merrill Lynch further believes that selecting portions of its analyses and the factors considered or
focusing on information presented in tabular format, without considering all analyses and factors or the narrative description of the
analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the processes underlying BofA Merrill Lynch’s analyses and opinion. The
fact that any specific analysis has been referred to in the summary above is not meant to indicate that such analysis was given greater
weight than any other analysis referred to in the summary.

In performing its analyses, BofA Merrill Lynch considered industry performance, general business and economic conditions and other
matters, many of which are beyond the control of the Company. The estimates of the future performance of the Company in or
underlying BofA Merrill Lynch’s analyses are not necessarily indicative of actual values or actual future results, which may be
significantly more or less favorable than those estimates or those suggested by BofA Merrill Lynch’s analyses. These analyses were
prepared solely as part of BofA Merrill Lynch’s analysis of the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the Offer Price to be received
by holders of Common Stock (other than, to the extent applicable, Parent and its affiliates) and were provided to the Company Board in
connection with the delivery of BofA Merrill Lynch’s opinion. The analyses do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at
which a company might actually be sold or acquired or the prices at which any securities have traded or may trade at any time in the
future. Accordingly, the estimates used in, and the ranges of valuations resulting from, any particular analysis described above are
inherently subject to substantial uncertainty and should not be taken to be BofA Merrill Lynch’s view of the actual values of the
Company.

The type and amount of consideration payable in the Transaction was determined through negotiations between the Company and
Parent, rather than by any financial advisor, and was approved by the Company Board. The decision to enter into the Merger
Agreement was solely that of the Company Board. As described above, BofA Merrill Lynch’s opinion and analyses were only one of
many factors considered by the Company Board in its evaluation of the Transaction and should not be viewed as determinative of the
views of the Company Board, management or any other party with respect to the Transaction or the consideration payable in the
Transaction.

Opinion of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC

Pursuant to an engagement letter dated December 19, 2017, the Company retained J.P. Morgan as its financial advisor in connection
with the proposed Offer and the Merger.

At the meeting of the Company Board on December 21, 2017, J.P. Morgan rendered its oral opinion to the Company Board that, as of
such date and based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth in its opinion, the Offer Price to be paid to the holders of
Shares in the proposed Transaction was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. J.P. Morgan has confirmed its
December 21, 2017 oral opinion by delivering its written opinion to the Company Board, dated December 21, 2017, that, as of such
date, the Offer Price to be paid to the holders of Shares in the proposed Transaction was fair, from a financial point of view, to such
holders.     

The full text of the written opinion of J.P. Morgan dated December 21, 2017, which sets forth the assumptions made, matters
considered and limits on the review undertaken, is attached as Annex II to this Schedule 14D-9 and is incorporated herein by reference.
The summary of the opinion of J.P. Morgan set forth in this Schedule 14D-9 is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of
such opinion. The Company’s stockholders are urged to read the opinion in its entirety. J.P. Morgan’s written opinion was addressed to
the Company Board (in its capacity as such) in connection with and for the purposes of its evaluation of the proposed Transaction and
was directed only to the Offer Price to be paid in the Transaction and did not address any other aspect of the Transaction. J.P. Morgan
expressed no opinion as to the fairness of the Offer Price to the holders of any class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of
the Company or as to the underlying decision by the Company to engage in the proposed Transaction. The issuance of J.P. Morgan’s
opinion was approved by a fairness committee of J.P. Morgan. The summary of the opinion of J.P. Morgan set forth in this Schedule
14D-9 is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such opinion. The opinion does not constitute a recommendation to any
stockholder of the Company as to whether such stockholder should tender its Shares into the Offer or how such stockholder should
vote with respect to the proposed Transaction or any other matter.

In arriving at its opinions, J.P. Morgan, among other things:
 

 •  reviewed a draft, dated December 21, 2017, of the Merger Agreement;
 

 
•  reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information concerning the Company and the industries in which it

operates;
 

 
•  compared the proposed financial terms of the Transaction with the publicly available financial terms of certain transactions

involving companies J.P. Morgan deemed relevant and the consideration paid for such companies;
 

 
•  compared the financial and operating performance of the Company with publicly available information concerning certain other

companies J.P. Morgan deemed relevant and reviewed the current and historical market prices of the Shares and certain publicly
traded securities of such other companies;

 

 
•  reviewed certain internal financial analyses and forecasts prepared by the management of the Company relating to its business

which are set forth in the section of this Schedule 14D-9 entitled “—Certain Projections” (referred to in this section as the
“Company Forecasts”); and

 

 
•  performed such other financial studies and analyses and considered such other information as J.P. Morgan deemed appropriate for

the purposes of its opinion.

In addition, J.P. Morgan held discussions with certain members of the management of the Company with respect to certain aspects of
the Transaction, and the past and current business operations of the Company, the financial condition and future prospects and
operations of the Company, and certain other matters J.P. Morgan believed necessary or appropriate to its inquiry.

In giving its opinion, J.P. Morgan relied upon and assumed the accuracy and completeness of all information that was publicly
available or was furnished to or discussed with J.P. Morgan by the Company or otherwise reviewed by or for J.P. Morgan. J.P. Morgan
did not independently verify any such information or its accuracy or completeness

and, pursuant to its engagement letter with the Company, J.P. Morgan did not assume any obligation to undertake any such independent
verification. J.P. Morgan did not conduct and was not provided with any valuation or appraisal of any assets or liabilities, nor did J.P.
Morgan evaluate the solvency of the Company or Parent under any state or federal laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar
matters. In relying on financial analyses and forecasts provided to J.P. Morgan or derived therefrom, J.P. Morgan assumed that they
were reasonably prepared based on assumptions (including assumptions relating to tax) reflecting the best currently available estimates
and judgments by management as to the expected future results of operations and financial condition of the Company to which such
analyses or forecasts relate. J.P. Morgan expressed no view as to such analyses or forecasts or the assumptions on which they were
based. J.P. Morgan also assumed that the Transaction and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement would be
consummated as described in the Merger Agreement and that the definitive Merger Agreement would not differ in any material respect
from the draft thereof furnished to J.P. Morgan. J.P. Morgan also assumed that the representations and warranties made by the
Company and Parent in the Merger Agreement and the related agreements were and would be true and correct in all respects material
to its analysis. J.P Morgan is not a legal, regulatory or tax expert and relied on the assessments made by advisors to the Company with
respect to such issues. J.P. Morgan further assumed that all material governmental, regulatory or other consents and approvals
necessary for the consummation of the Transaction would be obtained without any adverse effect on the Company or on the
contemplated benefits of the Transaction.

J.P. Morgan’s opinion was necessarily based on economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made
available to J.P. Morgan as of, the date of such opinion. J.P. Morgan’s opinion noted that subsequent developments may affect J.P.
Morgan’s opinion and that J.P. Morgan does not have any obligation to update, revise, or reaffirm its opinion. J.P. Morgan’s opinion is
limited to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the Offer Price to be paid to the holders of Shares in the proposed Transaction,
and J.P. Morgan has expressed no opinion as to the fairness of any consideration paid in connection with the Transaction to the holders
of any other class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of the Company or as to the underlying decision by the Company to
engage in the Transaction. Furthermore, J.P. Morgan expressed no opinion with respect to the amount or nature of any compensation to
any officers, directors, or employees of any party to the Transaction, or any class of such persons relative to the Consideration to be
paid to the holders of Shares in the Transaction or with respect to the fairness of any such compensation.

The terms of the Merger Agreement, including the Offer Price, were determined through arm’s length negotiations between the
Company and Parent, and the decision to enter into the Merger Agreement was solely that of the Company Board. J.P. Morgan’s
opinion and financial analyses were only one of the many factors considered by the Company Board in its evaluation of the proposed
Transaction and should not be viewed as determinative of the views of the Company Board or management with respect to the
proposed Transaction or the Offer Price.

In accordance with customary investment banking practice, J.P. Morgan employed generally accepted valuation methodology in
rendering its opinion to the Company Board on December 21, 2017 and contained in the presentation delivered to the Company Board
on such date in connection with the rendering of such opinion and does not purport to be a complete description of the analyses or data
presented by J.P. Morgan. Some of the summaries of the financial analyses include information presented in tabular format. The tables
are not intended to stand alone, and in order to more fully understand the financial analyses used by J.P. Morgan, the tables must be
read together with the full text of each summary. Considering the data set forth below without considering the full narrative description
of the financial analyses, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying the analyses, could create a misleading or
incomplete view of J.P. Morgan’s analyses.

Public Trading Multiples Analysis.

Using publicly available information, J.P. Morgan compared selected financial data of the Company with similar data for selected
publicly traded companies engaged in businesses which J.P. Morgan judged to be analogous to the Company or aspects thereof based
on J.P. Morgan’s experience and its familiarity with the industries in which the Company operates. The companies selected by J.P.
Morgan were as follows:
 

 •  Puma Biotechnology, Inc.
 

 •  Blueprint Medicines Corporation
 

 •  Clovis Oncology, Inc.

 •  Loxo Oncology, Inc.
 

 •  Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
 

 •  Array BioPharma Inc.
 

 •  Epizyme, Inc.
 

 •  Karyopharm Therapeutics Inc.

With respect to the selected companies, the information J.P. Morgan presented included the multiple of firm value (calculated as equity
value plus, or minus, as applicable, net debt or net cash), referred to in this section as “FV”, to estimates of calendar year 2022
probability of success adjusted net revenues for the applicable company, referred to in this section as “FV/2022E Net Revenue
Multiple”. Financial data for the selected companies was based on the selected companies’ filings with the SEC and publicly available
analyst consensus estimates for calendar year 2022 that J.P. Morgan obtained from FactSet Research Systems. Results of this analysis
were presented for the selected companies, as indicated in the following table:
 

Selected Company   

FV/2022E Net
Revenue
Multiple  

Puma Biotechnology, Inc.    1.5x 
Blueprint Medicines Corporation    7.6x 
Clovis Oncology, Inc.    2.3x 
Loxo Oncology, Inc.    2.5x 
Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc.    2.5x 
Array BioPharma Inc.    2.6x 
Epizyme, Inc.    0.6x 
Karyopharm Therapeutics Inc.    0.3x 
Median    2.5x 

Based on the above analysis and other factors that J.P. Morgan considered appropriate, J.P. Morgan selected a FV/2022E Net Revenue
Multiple reference range for the Company of 0.6x to 2.6x. J.P. Morgan then applied that range to: (i) the Company’s projected
probability of success adjusted net revenue for calendar year 2022 included in the Company Forecasts, and (ii) for reference purposes
only, publicly available analyst consensus estimates of the Company’s net revenue for calendar year 2022. The analysis indicated the
following implied equity value per share of Shares (rounded to the nearest $0.25), which J.P. Morgan compared to the Offer Price and
to the closing price per share of Common Stock as of December 20, 2017, as follows:

Selected Transaction Analysis.

Using publicly available information, J.P. Morgan examined selected transactions with respect to businesses which J.P. Morgan judged
to be analogous to the Company’s business or aspects thereof based on J.P. Morgan’s experience and familiarity with the industries in
which the Company operates. The transactions indicated in the following table were selected by J.P. Morgan as relevant in evaluating
the proposed Transaction. Using publicly available information, J.P. Morgan calculated, for each selected transaction, the multiple of
the target company’s FV implied in the relevant transaction to the target company’s estimated probability of success adjusted net
revenue for the fourth calendar year following the year in which the applicable transaction was announced for transactions announced
before June 30, and for the fifth calendar year following the year in which the applicable transaction was announced for transactions
announced after June 30 (such calendar year referred to in this section as “CY+5” and such multiple referred to in this section as
“FV/CY+5 Net Revenue Multiple”). Financial data for the target companies, including estimated net revenue, was based on the target
company’s filings with the SEC, including filings made in connection with the applicable selected transaction. Results of this analysis
were presented for the selected transactions, as indicated in the following table:
 
Announcement
Date   Acquiror   Target   

FV / CY+5
Net Revenue

Multiple
7/21/2016   Galenica AG   Relypsa, Inc.   1.9x

05/31/2016   Jazz Pharmaceuticals plc   Celator Pharmaceuticals, Inc.   4.0x

11/06/2015   Astrazeneca PLC   ZS Pharma, Inc.   3.1x

06/17/2015   Allergan plc   KYTHERA Biopharmaceuticals, Inc.   3.9x

03/30/2015   Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.   Auspex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.   4.7x

12/02/2014   Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.   Avanir Pharmaceuticals, Inc.   6.9x

12/19/2013   Jazz Pharmaceuticals plc   Gentium S.p.A.   4.4x

12/19/2013   Bayer AG   Algeta ASA   N/A

04/23/2012   AstraZeneca PLC   Ardea Biosciences, Inc.   4.3x

01/07/2012   Bristol-Myers Squibb Company   Inhibitex, Inc.   8.5x

Mean       4.6x

Median       4.3x

Based on the above analysis and other factors that J.P. Morgan considered appropriate, J.P. Morgan then selected a FV/CY+5 Net
Revenue Multiple reference range for the Company of 1.9x to 4.7x. Applying that range to the Company’s projected probability of
success adjusted net revenue for calendar year 2022 included in the Company Forecasts, this analysis indicated an implied equity value
per share of Common Stock (rounded to the nearest $0.25), which J.P. Morgan compared to the value of the Offer Price and to the
closing price per share of Common Stock as of December 20, 2017, as follows:
 

Implied Equity Value per 
Share Reference Range   Offer Price

Discounted Cash Flow Analysis.

J.P. Morgan conducted a discounted cash flow analysis for the purpose of determining the fully diluted equity value per share of
Common Stock. J.P. Morgan calculated the unlevered free cash flow that the Company is expected to generate during calendar years
2018 through 2032 (as set forth in the section of this Schedule 14D-9 entitled “—Certain Projections”), which were discussed with,
and approved by, the Company’s management for J.P. Morgan’s use in connection with its financial analyses under two different cases
included in the Company Forecasts, one which reflected U.S. tax law as was in effect as of the date of J.P. Morgan’s opinion (referred
in this section as the “Current Tax Law Case”) and one which reflected U.S. tax law assuming the then pending Tax Cuts & Jobs Act,
as passed by both the U.S. Senate and the U.S. House of Representatives as of the date of J.P. Morgan’s opinion, would be signed into
law (referred in this section as the “Pending Tax Law Case”). J.P. Morgan also calculated a range of terminal values for the Company at
the end of this period by applying terminal value growth rates ranging from negative 30% to negative 50%, based on guidance
provided by the Company’s management, to estimates of unlevered free cash flow of the Company during calendar year 2032 as
provided in the Company Forecasts. The unlevered free cash flow estimates and the range of terminal values were then discounted by
J.P. Morgan to present value as of December 31, 2017 using discount rates ranging from 11.00% to 15.00%, which range was chosen
by J.P. Morgan based upon an analysis of the weighted average cost of capital of the Company. The present value of the unlevered free
cash flow estimates and the range of terminal values were then adjusted by adding projected net cash as of December 31, 2017. This
analysis indicated a range of implied equity values for the Company, which J.P. Morgan divided by the number of outstanding shares of
Common Stock, calculated on a fully-diluted basis, to derive a range of implied equity values per share of Common Stock (rounded to
the nearest $0.25) under the Current Tax Law Case and under the Pending Tax Law Case, which J.P. Morgan compared to the value of
the Offer Price and to the closing price per share of Common Stock as of December 20, 2017, as follows:
 

Implied Equity Value per 
Share Reference Range   Offer Price  

Company Common
Stock 12/20/2017

Closing Price
Current Tax Law Case   Pending Tax Law Case      

$17.75 – $25.75   $20.75 – $30.50   $27.00   $15.35

Other Information

Historical Trading Range for the Company. For reference purposes only and not as a component of its fairness analysis, J.P. Morgan
reviewed the historical closing prices of the shares of Common Stock during the 52-week period prior to December 20, 2017, the last
trading day before delivery of J.P. Morgan’s oral opinion on December 21, 2017, noting that the low and high closing prices during
such period ranged from $4.85 per share to $16.85 per share, as compared to the Offer Price of $27.00 per share of Common Stock and
to the closing price per share of Common Stock, as of December 20, 2017, of $15.35 per share of Common Stock.

Analyst Price Targets for the Company. For reference purposes only and not as a component of its fairness analysis, J.P. Morgan
reviewed certain publicly available equity research analyst share price targets for the shares of Common Stock, noting that the low and
high share price targets ranged from $20.00 per share to $31.00 per Share, as compared to the Offer Price of $27.00 per share of
Common Stock and to the closing price per share of Common Stock, as of December 20, 2017, of $15.35 per share of Common Stock.

Miscellaneous.

The foregoing summary of certain material financial analyses does not purport to be a complete description of the analyses or data
presented by J.P. Morgan. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to partial
analysis or summary description. J.P. Morgan believes that the foregoing summary and its analyses must be considered as a whole and
that selecting portions of the foregoing summary and these analyses, without considering all of its analyses as a whole, could create an
incomplete view of the processes underlying the analyses and its opinion. As a result, the ranges of valuations resulting from any
particular analysis or combination of analyses described above were merely utilized to create points of reference for analytical purposes
and should not be taken to be the view of J.P. Morgan with respect to the actual value of the Company. The order of analyses described
does not represent the relative importance or weight given to those analyses by J.P. Morgan. In arriving at its opinion, J.P. Morgan did
not attribute any particular weight to any analyses or factors considered by it and did not form an opinion as to whether any individual
analysis or factor (positive or negative), considered in isolation, supported or failed to support its opinion. Rather, J.P. Morgan
considered the totality of the factors and analyses performed in determining its opinion.

Analyses based upon forecasts of future results are inherently uncertain, as they are subject to numerous factors or events beyond the
control of the parties and their advisors. Accordingly, forecasts and analyses used or made by J.P. Morgan are not necessarily indicative
of actual future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by those analyses. Moreover, J.P. Morgan’s
analyses are not and do not purport to be appraisals or otherwise reflective of the prices at which businesses actually could be acquired
or sold. None of the selected companies reviewed as described in the above summary is identical to the Company, and none of the
selected transactions reviewed was identical to the Transaction. However, the companies selected were chosen because they are
publicly traded companies with operations and businesses that, for purposes of J.P. Morgan’s analysis, may be considered similar to
those of the Company. The transactions selected were similarly chosen because their participants, size and other factors, for purposes of
J.P. Morgan’s analysis, may be considered similar to the Transaction. The analyses necessarily involve complex considerations and
judgments concerning differences in financial and operational characteristics of the companies involved and other factors that could
affect the companies compared to the Company and the transactions compared to the Transaction.

As a part of its investment banking business, J.P. Morgan and its affiliates are continually engaged in the valuation of businesses and
their securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions, investments for passive and control purposes, negotiated underwritings,
secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements, and valuations for corporate and other purposes. J.P.
Morgan was selected to advise the Company with respect to the Transaction on the basis of, among other things, such experience and
its qualifications and reputation in connection with such matters and its familiarity with the Company and the industries in which it
operates.

For financial advisory services rendered in connection with the Transaction (including the delivery of its opinion), the Company has
agreed to pay J.P. Morgan a fee of approximately $16 million, $1 million of which was payable upon delivery by J.P. Morgan of its
opinion, and the remainder of which will become due upon the closing of the proposed Transaction. In addition, the Company has
agreed to reimburse J.P. Morgan for certain of its reasonable costs and expenses incurred in connection with its services, including
certain of the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel, and will indemnify J.P. Morgan against certain liabilities arising out of J.P.
Morgan’s engagement. During the two years preceding the date of J.P. Morgan’s opinion, J.P. Morgan and its affiliates have had
commercial or investment banking relationships with the Company for which J.P. Morgan and such affiliates have received customary
compensation. Such services during such period have included acting as joint lead bookrunner on the Company’s offerings of equity
securities in April 2016, May 2017 and October 2017. During the two years preceding the date of J.P. Morgan’s opinion, J.P. Morgan
and its affiliates have had commercial or investment banking relationships with Parent or its affiliates for which J.P. Morgan and such
affiliates have received customary compensation. In addition, J.P. Morgan and its affiliates hold, on a proprietary basis, less than 1% of
the outstanding common stock of each of the Company and Parent. During the two year period preceding delivery of its opinion ending
on November 30, 2017, the aggregate fees received by J.P. Morgan from the Company were approximately $9 million. During the two
year period preceding delivery of its opinion ending on November 30, 2017, the aggregate fees received by J.P. Morgan from Parent or
its affiliates were approximately $9.1 million. In the ordinary course of their businesses, J.P. Morgan and its affiliates may actively
trade the debt and equity securities of the Company or Parent for their own accounts or for the accounts of customers and, accordingly,
they may at any time hold long or short positions in such securities.

Certain Projections.

The Company does not, as a matter of course, publicly disclose forecasts or projections as to future performance, earnings or other
results due to the inherent unpredictability of the underlying assumptions, estimates and projections. However, the Company’s
management regularly prepares internal financial forecasts regarding its future operations for subsequent fiscal years. In connection
with the Company’s strategic planning process, the Company’s management prepared and provided to the Company Board, BofA
Merrill Lynch and J.P. Morgan forward-looking financial information for the years 2018 through 2032 based upon internal projections
developed by the Company.

The Company’s management prepared two sets of internal financial projections in connection with its strategic review process: (i) an
adjusted consolidated enterprise profit and loss statements summarized below under the heading “Consolidated P&L (PoS Adjusted)”
(the “PoS Adjusted Long-Term Forecast”) and (ii) unadjusted consolidated profit and loss statements summarized below under the
heading “Consolidated P&L (Unadjusted)” (the “Unadjusted Long-Term Forecast” and, together with the PoS Adjusted Long-Term
Forecast, the “Company Projections”). The primary difference between the projections results from the application to the Unadjusted
Long-Term Forecast of Company management’s assumptions regarding the probability of success of the products currently under
development by the Company, to derive PoS Adjusted Long-Term Forecast. In addition to revenue projections and associated cost of
goods sold, Company Projections also reflected Company management’s estimates of potential development costs, marketing
expenses, sales expenses, unallocated corporate expense, and royalty and milestone expenses.

Table of Contents

The Company management prepared the Company Projections based on the tax law as in effect at the time of the initial preparation of
the Company Projections. The Company management subsequently prepared a second PoS Adjusted Long-Term Forecast case
reflecting Company management’s view of the impact of the then pending Tax Cuts & Jobs Act, which is summarized below under the
heading “Consolidated P&L (PoS Adjusted)—(Pending Tax Law Case”). The Company Projections were prepared using standard
industry methods and growth rates for expenses and revenue and included certain prospective costs related to the development of
products and product candidates. The Company did not provide any financial forecasts (including the Company Projections) to Parent
or any other prospective bidder in connection with a potential acquisition of the Company, other than certain revenue forecasts
associated with entrectinib.

The Company Projections were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure, nor were they prepared with a view toward
compliance with published guidelines of the SEC, the guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
for preparation and presentation of financial forecasts, or U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. In addition, the Company
Projections were not prepared with the assistance of or reviewed, compiled or examined by independent accountants. The Company
Projections should be read together with the historical financial statements of the Company, which have been filed with the SEC, and
the other information regarding the Company contained elsewhere and incorporated by reference in this Schedule 14D-9. The
Company’s stockholders are urged to review the Company’s most recent SEC filings for a description of the Company’s reported
results of operations and financial condition and capital resources during 2017, including “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in the Company’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the third quarter ended
September 30, 2017.

The summary of the Company Projections is not being included in this Schedule 14D-9 to influence any stockholder’s decision
whether to tender his, her or its Shares in the Offer. The Company is including the Company Projections in this Schedule 14D-9 solely
because it was made available to BofA Merrill Lynch and J.P. Morgan in connection with their respective financial analyses
summarized above under “—Opinions of the Company’s Financial Advisors” and to the Company Board in connection with its
evaluation of the Offer and the Merger. The Company Projections may differ from published analyst estimates and forecasts and do not
take into account any events or circumstances after the date they were prepared, including the announcement of the Offer and Merger.

Although presented with numerical specificity, the Company Projections are not fact, and are forward-looking statements and reflect
numerous assumptions and variables as to future events and the probability of such events made by the Company’s senior management,
in each case that are inherently uncertain and may be beyond the control of the Company’s senior management. Certain assumptions
underlying the Company projections include assumptions with respect to the Company’s ability to commercialize its products,
assumptions with respect to the factors described above, as well as assumptions with respect to product pricing, costs and expenses,
timing of debt repayment, working capital and stock option exercises, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are
beyond the Company’s control. Important factors that may affect actual results and result in such forecasts not being achieved include,
but are not limited to: failure to consummate the Merger; the effects of disruption caused by the transaction making it more difficult to
maintain relationships with employees, collaborators, vendors and other business partners; the risk that stockholder litigation in
connection with the Offer or the Merger may result in significant costs of defense, indemnification and liability; and risks and
uncertainties pertaining to the Company’s business, including the risks and uncertainties detailed in the Company’s public periodic
filings with the SEC. In addition, the internal financial forecasts may be affected by the Company’s ability to achieve strategic goals,
objectives and targets over the applicable period. These assumptions upon which the financial forecasts were based necessarily involve
judgments with respect to, among other things, future economic, competitive and regulatory conditions and financial market
conditions, all of which are difficult or impossible to predict accurately and many of which are beyond the Company’s control.
Moreover, the Company Projections also reflect assumptions as to certain future business decisions that are subject to change. There
can be no assurance that any Company Projections will be realized, or that the assumptions and estimates used to prepare the Company
Projections will prove to be accurate, and actual results will differ, and may differ materially, from those contained in the Company
Projections. Important factors that may affect actual results and result in projections contained in the Company Projections not being
achieved include, but are not limited to, the factors set forth from time to time in the Company’s SEC filings.

The inclusion of the Company Projections in this Schedule 14D-9 should not be regarded as an indication that the Company, BofA
Merrill Lynch and J.P. Morgan or their respective affiliates, officers, directors, advisors or other representatives considered or consider
the Company Projections necessarily predictive of actual future events, and the Company Projections should not be relied upon as
such. None of the Company, BofA Merrill Lynch, J.P. Morgan, or their respective affiliates, officers, directors, advisors or other
representatives can give any assurance that actual results will not differ from these Company Projections, and the Company undertakes
no obligation to update or otherwise revise or reconcile the Company Projections to reflect circumstances existing after the date such
Company Projections were generated or to reflect the occurrence of future events even in the event that any or all of the assumptions
underlying the projections are shown to be in error. The Company does not, and, to the knowledge of Company, BofA Merrill Lynch or
J.P. Morgan do not, intend to make publicly available any update or other revisions to these Company Projections. None of the
Company or its respective affiliates, officers, directors, advisors or other representatives has made or makes any representation to any
stockholder or other person regarding the ultimate performance of the Company compared to the information contained in the
Company Projections or that forecasted results will be achieved. The Company has made no representation to Parent or Purchaser, in
the Merger Agreement or otherwise, concerning these internal financial forecasts.

In light of the foregoing factors and the uncertainties inherent in these projections, stockholders are cautioned not to place
undue, if any, reliance on these projections.

The foregoing does not include any Shares over which, or with respect to which, any such executive officer, director or affiliate acts in
a fiduciary or representative capacity or is subject to the instructions of a third party with respect to such tender. In addition, all of the

is contingent upon the closing of the transaction. In addition, the Company has agreed to reimburse BofA Merrill Lynch for its
expenses, including fees and expenses of BofA Merrill Lynch’s legal counsel, incurred in connection with BofA Merrill Lynch’s
engagement and to indemnify BofA Merrill Lynch and related persons against liabilities, including liabilities under the federal
securities laws, arising out of BofA Merrill Lynch’s engagement.

In connection with J.P. Morgan’s services as financial advisor to the Company (including the delivery of its opinion), the Company has
agreed to pay J.P. Morgan a fee of approximately $16 million, $1 million of which was payable upon delivery by J.P. Morgan of its
opinion, and the remainder of which will become due upon the closing of the transaction. In addition, the Company has agreed to
reimburse J.P. Morgan for certain of its reasonable costs and expenses incurred in connection with its services, including certain of the
reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel, and will indemnify J.P. Morgan against certain liabilities arising out of J.P. Morgan’s

Shares issued pursuant to a pro rata distribution from a stockholder of the
Company of which Dr. Bristol is a limited partner. Shares were issued to
the Bristol Living Trust of which Mr. Bristol is the trustee.

 
(1) The Company RSUs granted on December 22, 2017, were granted to the executive officers as part of the annual process of the

Compensation Committee of the Company Board for determining 2017 annual stock award grants, 2017 annual bonus
determinations and 2018 base salary adjustments for employees of the Company. The independent compensation consultant to the
Compensation Committee of the Company Board recommended the allocation of stock awards in its materials circulated to the
Compensation Committee on December 13, 2017. No action was expected to be taken to formally grant the Company RSUs until
the Compensation Committee’s regularly scheduled meeting on January 12, 2018. Following discussions with Parent, and in
connection with the approval of the Merger Agreement, the Company Board approved the grants of the Company RSUs to the
employees of the Company, including the executive officers, on December 21, 2017 in connection with its approval of the Merger
Agreement, with such grants effective December 22, 2017. The Company RSUs approved by the Company Board on
December 21, 2017 represented 50% of the allocations previously recommended by the independent compensation consultant to
the Compensation Committee of the Company Board. On December 26, 2017, the Compensation Committee approved the
foregoing acceleration of vesting of certain Company RSUs held by certain executive officers of the Company and the
corresponding net settlement of such Company RSUs for purposes of the payment of related tax withholding arising from such
vesting in anticipation of the Merger and to facilitate tax planning strategies for the Company and these individuals. See Item 3
above under “Arrangements with Current Executive Officers and Directors of the Company—Merger Agreement—Effect of the
Merger on Stock Awards—Restricted Stock Units” where the treatment of the Company RSUs in the Merger is described.

Item 7. Purposes of the Transaction and Plans or Proposals.

Except as indicated in this Schedule 14D-9, (a) the Company is not undertaking or engaged in any negotiations in response to the Offer
that relate to, or would result in: (i) a tender offer for or other acquisition of the Company’s securities by the Company or any other
person; (ii) any extraordinary transaction such as a merger, reorganization or liquidation, involving the Company; (iii) any purchase,
sale or transfer of a material amount of assets of the Company; or (iv) any material change in the present dividend rates or policy, or
indebtedness or capitalization of the Company, and (b) there are no transactions, board resolutions or agreements in principle or signed
contracts in response to the Offer that relate to, or would result in, one or more of the events referred to in clause (a) of this paragraph.

Item 8. Additional Information.

Named Executive Officer Golden Parachute Compensation.

This section sets forth the information required by Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K regarding the compensation of each of the
Company’s named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the Offer and the Merger.

If the Offer is completed in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, the consummation of the Offer will constitute a
“change in control” of the Company under the terms of the Severance Plan. The table below describes the estimated potential payments
to each of the Company’s named executive officers under the terms of the Severance Plan, their Company Stock Options and Company
RSUs and, in the case of Dr. Lim, his Tax Reimbursement Agreement. The severance benefits shown reflect only the additional
payments or benefits that the

individual would have received upon the occurrence of a termination of employment other than for cause (and other than due to death
or disability) or a resignation for good reason, each within the period beginning on the date that is 60 days prior to a change in control
and ending 12 months following such change in control. The amounts shown do not include the value of payments or benefits that
would have been earned absent such a qualifying termination.

Please note the amounts shown in the table are estimates only and are based on assumptions regarding events that may or may not
actually occur, including assumptions described in this Schedule 14D-9 and in the notes to the table below, which may or may not
actually occur. Some of these assumptions are based on information currently available and, as a result, the actual amounts, if any, that
may become payable to a named executive officer may materially differ from the amounts set forth below. Furthermore, for purposes
of calculating these amounts, the Company has assumed:
 

 •  the Effective Time will occur on January 5, 2018;
 

 •  a price per share of $27.00, which is the Offer Price;
 

 

•  the employment of each current named executive officer will be terminated on such date in a manner that entitles the named
executive officer to receive the severance payments and benefits under the terms of the Severance Plan (as described in Item
3 above under the heading “Arrangements with Current Executive Officers and Directors of the Company—Severance and

(1) Under the Severance Plan, cash severance would be payable following termination of the named executive officer’s employment

by the Company other than for cause (and other than due to death or disability) or the named executive officer’s resignation for
good reason, in either case, during the period beginning on the date that is 60 days prior to a change in control and ending
12 months following such change in control, subject to the named executive officer’s execution of a release of claims and
compliance with certain restrictive covenants, including with respect to non-solicitation and non-disparagement. In either such
event, pursuant to the Severance Plan, the named executive officer will receive severance payments equal to: (1) in the case of
Dr. Lim, twice the sum of his base salary and target annual cash bonus; and (2) in the case of each other named executive officer,
the named executive officer’s base salary plus the named executive officer’s target annual bonus. Any amounts payable in
connection with the termination of an executive’s employment are subject to applicable withholdings and are payable in
installments over 24 months (in the case of Dr. Lim) and 12 months (in the case of the other named executive officers). These
cash payments are double-trigger benefits in that they will be paid only if the named executive officer experiences a qualifying
termination of employment during the period described above, in accordance with the Severance Plan.

The following table quantifies the base salary severance and bonus component of the severance reported in the “Cash” column
above.

(2) Under the Severance Plan, each named executive officer would be entitled to accelerated vesting of his unvested equity awards

pursuant to a double trigger arrangement (i.e., the occurrence of a change of control and such executive’s qualifying termination
as described in footnote (1) above).

Additionally, under the Merger Agreement, effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, (i) each Company Stock
Option will fully vest and automatically be canceled and terminated as of the Effective Time and the holder thereof will be
entitled to receive an amount in cash, without interest and less the amount of any tax withholding, equal to the Option Payment
Amount, and (ii) each Company RSU will fully vest and automatically be canceled and terminated as of the Effective Time and
the holder thereof will be entitled to receive an amount in cash, without interest and less the amount of any tax withholding, equal
to the RSU Payment Amount.

The amount listed in this column represents the aggregate pre-tax amount payable in consideration of the cancellation of unvested
Company Stock Options and Company RSUs held by the named executive officers as to which vesting will accelerate
immediately prior to the Effective Time, with such awards being cashed out in connection with the transactions contemplated by
the Merger Agreement. The cash payment is a single-trigger (closing of the Offer and the Merger) benefit that will be received
solely because of the Merger and regardless of whether a named executive officer’s employment is terminated.

(a) The value of the unvested and accelerated Company Stock Options is the difference between the Offer Price of $27.00 per share

and the exercise price of the option, multiplied by the number of Shares underlying the Company Stock Options as of January 5,
2018, consistent with the methodology applied under SEC Regulation M-A Item 1011(b) and Regulation S-K Item 402(t)(2).

(b) The value of the unvested and accelerated Company RSUs is the Offer Price of $27.00 per share multiplied by the number of
Shares underlying such Company RSUs as of January 5, 2018, consistent with the methodology applied under SEC Regulation
M-A Item 1011(b) and Regulation S-K Item 402(t)(2).

In the case of Dr. Lim and Mr. Hornby, the Compensation Committee of the Company Board took action on December 26, 2017,
to accelerate the vesting of 41,910 and 43,000 Company RSUs held by such named executive officers, respectively, in
anticipation of the Merger and to facilitate tax planning strategies for the Company and these individuals. Assuming a price per
share of $27.00, which is the Offer Price, the value of such accelerated vesting to such named executive officers would be
$1,131,570 and $1,161,000, respectively, and would be considered a “single trigger” benefit, as the accelerated vesting was not
tied to any termination of their employment. Because this accelerated vesting occurred on December 26, 2017, the value of such
vesting is not included in the foregoing tables. See Item 6 above where the accelerated vesting of these Company RSUs is
described.

(3) Consists of COBRA coverage for a period of 24 months (in the case of Dr. Lim) or 12 months (for the other named executive
officers) following the date of termination. The value is based upon the type of insurance coverage the Company carried for each
named executive officer as of January 5, 2018 and is valued at the premiums in effect on such date. These benefits are double-
trigger benefits in that they will be paid only if the executive officer experiences a qualifying termination of employment
following the Effective Time in accordance with the Severance Plan.

 
(4) In connection with the signing of the Merger Agreement, Dr. Lim entered into the Tax Reimbursement Agreement which provides

that, if the Merger is consummated and an excise tax is imposed on Dr. Lim under Section 4999 of the Code as a result of any
compensation or benefits provided to him in connection with the Merger, he will be entitled to a tax gross-up payment in an
amount equal to such excise tax (and any related taxes or penalties or interest on such excise taxes or any such tax-gross up
payment). All such tax gross-up payments related solely to the equity award acceleration are single-trigger (closing of the Offer
and the Merger) benefits that will be received solely because of the Merger and regardless of whether a named executive officer’s
employment is terminated.

In addition to calculating any gross-up related to the equity award acceleration, the gross-up payment quantified in the table
assumes the payment of severance. Any tax gross-up payments related to Dr. Lim’s severance payments are a double-trigger
benefit in that they will be paid only if Dr. Lim experiences a qualifying termination of employment in accordance with the
Severance Plan.

With respect to Mr. Hornby and Dr. Multani, the severance benefits prescribed by the Severance Plan are subject to a
Section 280G better-off cutback provision, which provides that, in the event that the benefits provided to the named executive
officer pursuant to the Severance Plan or otherwise constitute parachute payments with the meaning of Section 280G of the Code,
the severance benefits under the Severance Plan will either be delivered in full or reduced to the extent necessary to avoid an
excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code, whichever would result in the named executive officer receiving the largest amount of
severance benefits on an after-tax basis. The amounts reported in this table do not reflect any such reductions for Mr. Hornby or
Dr. Multani as a result of the limit under Section 280G of the Code.

the heading “Arrangements with Current Executive Officers and Directors of the Company” which is incorporated herein by reference.

Stockholder Approval Not Required.

Parent and Purchaser have represented and warranted to the Company in the Merger Agreement that neither Parent nor any of its
subsidiaries, including Purchaser, is, nor at any time for the past three years has been, an “interested stockholder” of the Company as
defined in Section 203 of the DGCL. Section 251(h) of the DGCL provides that following consummation of a successful tender offer
for a public corporation, and subject to certain statutory provisions, if the acquirer holds at least the amount of shares of each class of
stock of the acquired corporation that would otherwise be required to approve a merger for the acquired corporation, and the other
stockholders receive the same consideration for their stock in the merger as was payable in the tender offer, the acquirer can effect a
merger without the action of the other stockholders of the acquired corporation. Accordingly, if Purchaser consummates the Offer, the
Merger Agreement contemplates that the parties will effect the closing of the Merger without a vote of the stockholders of the
Company in accordance with Section 251(h) of the DGCL. If the Merger is effected, (i) Company stockholders who do not tender their
Shares in the Offer will be entitled to appraisal rights under

Delaware law, provided that the relevant requirements under the DGCL have been satisfied, and (ii) Company stockholders who do not
validly exercise appraisal rights under Delaware law will receive the same cash consideration for their Shares as was payable in the
Offer following the consummation of the Merger.

Appraisal Rights.

Holders of Shares will not have appraisal rights in connection with the Offer. However, if Purchaser purchases Shares in the Offer, and
the Merger is consummated, holders of Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time will be entitled to appraisal rights under
Section 262 of the DGCL, provided they comply with the applicable statutory procedures under Section 262. Holders whose Shares
are tendered pursuant to the Offer will not be entitled to appraisal rights.

The following discussion summarizes appraisal rights of stockholders under the DGCL in connection with the Merger
assuming that the Merger is consummated pursuant to Section 251(h) of the DGCL and is qualified in its entirety by the full
text of Section 262 of the DGCL, which is attached to this Schedule 14D-9 as Annex III. All references in Section 262 of the
DGCL and in this summary to a “stockholder” or “holder” are to the record holder of Shares immediately prior to the
Effective Time as to which appraisal rights are asserted. A person having a beneficial interest in Shares held of record in the
name of another person, such as a broker or nominee, must act promptly to cause the record holder to follow the steps
summarized below properly and in a timely manner to perfect appraisal rights. Stockholders should carefully review the full
text of Section 262 of the DGCL as well as the information discussed below.

Under the DGCL, if the Merger is completed, holders of Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time and who (i) did not tender
their Shares in the Offer, (ii) follow the procedures set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL and (iii) do not thereafter withdraw their
demand for appraisal of such Shares or otherwise lose their appraisal rights, in each case in accordance with the DGCL, will be entitled
to have their Shares appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive payment in cash of the “fair value” of such shares,
exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with a fair rate of interest, if
any, as determined by such court on the amount determined to be the fair value (or, in certain circumstances described below, on the
difference between the amount determined to be the fair value and the amount paid by the Surviving Corporation to each stockholder
entitled to appraisal prior to the entry of judgment in the appraisal proceeding). The “fair value” as so determined by the court could be
greater than, less than or the same as the Offer Price.

Under Section 262 of the DGCL, where a merger is approved under Section 251(h), either a constituent corporation before the effective
date of the merger, or the surviving corporation within ten days thereafter, shall notify each of the holders of any class or series of stock
of such constituent corporation who are entitled to appraisal rights of the approval of the merger or consolidation and that appraisal
rights are available for any or all shares of such class or series of stock of such constituent corporation, and shall include in such notice
a copy of Section 262. This Schedule 14D-9 constitutes the formal notice of appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL.
Any holder of Shares who wishes to exercise such appraisal rights or who wishes to preserve his, her or its right to do so, should
review the following discussion and Annex III carefully because failure to timely and properly comply with the procedures specified
will result in the loss of appraisal rights under the DGCL.

Any stockholder wishing to exercise appraisal rights is urged to consult legal counsel before attempting to exercise such rights.

If a stockholder elects to exercise appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL and the Merger is consummated pursuant to
Section 251(h) of the DGCL, such stockholder must do all of the following:
 

 

•  within the later of the consummation of the Offer and 20 days after the date of mailing of this Schedule 14D-9 (which date
of mailing is January 10, 2018), mail or otherwise transmit to the Company at the address indicated below a written demand
for appraisal of Shares held, which demand must reasonably inform the Company of the identity of the stockholder and that
the stockholder is demanding appraisal;

 

 •  not tender such stockholder’s Shares in the Offer;

•  continuously hold of record such Shares from the date on which the written demand for appraisal is made through the

Effective Time; and
 

 
•  any stockholder (or beneficial owner of Shares) who has otherwise perfected his, her or its appraisal rights or the Surviving

Corporation must file a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery demanding a determination of the fair value of the stock
of all such stockholders within 120 days after the Effective Time.

Notwithstanding a stockholder’s compliance with the foregoing requirements, the Court of Chancery shall dismiss the appraisal
proceedings as to all stockholders who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights, and such stockholders will effectively lose their
appraisal rights, unless (1) the total number of Shares entitled to appraisal rights exceeds 1% of the outstanding Shares eligible for
appraisal or (2) the value of the consideration provided in the Merger for such total number of Shares entitled to appraisal rights
exceeds $1 million.

If the Merger is consummated pursuant to Section 251(h) of the DGCL, Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to deliver an
additional notice of the effective date of the Merger to all stockholders of the Company who delivered a written demand to the
Company pursuant to the first bullet above within 10 days of the closing of the Merger, as required by Section 262(d)(2) of the DGCL.
However, only stockholders who have provided notice in accordance with the first bullet above will receive such notice of the effective
date. If the Merger is consummated pursuant to Section 251(h) of the DGCL, a failure to deliver a written demand for appraisal in
accordance with the time periods specified in the first bullet above (or to take any of the other steps specified in the above bullets or
summarized below) will be deemed to be a waiver or a termination of your appraisal rights.

Written Demand by the Record Holder

All written demands for appraisal should be addressed to Ignyta, Inc. 4545 Towne Centre Court, San Diego, CA 92121, Attention:
Corporate Secretary. The written demand for appraisal must be executed by or for the record holder of Shares and must reasonably
inform the Company of the identity of the stockholder of record, and that such stockholder intends thereby to demand appraisal of his,
her or its Shares. If the Shares are owned of record in a fiduciary capacity, such as by a trustee, guardian or custodian, execution of the
demand must be made in that capacity, and if the Shares are owned of record by more than one person, such as in a joint tenancy or
tenancy in common, the demand must be executed by or for all joint owners. An authorized agent, including one of two or more joint
owners, may execute the demand for appraisal for a holder of record. However, the agent must identify the record owner(s) and
expressly disclose the fact that, in executing the demand, the agent is acting as agent for the record owner(s).

A beneficial owner of Shares held in “street name” who wishes to exercise appraisal rights should take such actions as may be
necessary to ensure that a timely and proper demand for appraisal is made by the record holder of the Shares. If Shares are held through
a brokerage firm, bank or other nominee who in turn holds the Shares through a central securities depository nominee, such as Cede &
Co., a demand for appraisal of such Shares must be made by or on behalf of the depository nominee, and must identify the depository
nominee as the record holder. Any beneficial owner who wishes to exercise appraisal rights and holds Shares through a nominee holder
is responsible for ensuring that the demand for appraisal is timely made by the record holder. The beneficial holder of the Shares
should instruct the nominee holder that the demand for appraisal should be made by the record holder of the Shares, which may be a
central securities depository nominee if the Shares have been so deposited.

A record holder, such as a broker, bank, fiduciary, depository or other nominee, who holds Shares as a nominee for several beneficial
owners may exercise appraisal rights with respect to the Shares held for one or more beneficial owners while not exercising such rights
with respect to the Shares held for other beneficial owners. In such case, the written demand must set forth the number of Shares
covered by the demand. Where the number of Shares is not expressly stated, the demand will be presumed to cover all Shares held in
the name of the record owner.

Filing a Petition for Appraisal

Within 120 days after the Effective Time, but not thereafter, the Surviving Corporation, or any holder of Shares who has complied with
Section 262 of the DGCL and is entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262, or the beneficial

Table of Contents

owner of any such shares, may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery demanding a
determination of the fair value of the Shares held by all holders who did not tender their shares in the Offer and who timely and
properly demanded appraisal. If no such petition is filed within that 120-day period, appraisal rights will be lost for all holders of
Shares who had previously demanded appraisal of their Shares. The Company is under no obligation to and has no present intention to
file a petition and holders should not assume that the Company will file a petition or that it will initiate any negotiations with respect to
the fair value of the Shares. Accordingly, it is the obligation of the holders of Shares to initiate all necessary action to perfect their
appraisal rights in respect of the Shares within the period prescribed in Section 262 of the DGCL.

Within 120 days after the Effective Time, any holder of Shares who has complied with the requirements for exercise of appraisal rights
will be entitled, upon written request, to receive from the Surviving Corporation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of
Shares not tendered into the Offer and with respect to which demands for appraisal have been received and the aggregate number of
holders of such Shares. Such statement must be mailed within 10 days after a written request therefor has been received by the
Surviving Corporation or within 10 days after the expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal, whichever is later.
Notwithstanding the foregoing requirement that a demand for appraisal must be made by or on behalf of the record owner of the
Shares, a person who is the beneficial owner of Shares held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person, and as to
which demand has been properly made and not effectively withdrawn, may, in such person’s own name, file a petition for appraisal or
request from the Surviving Corporation the statement described in this paragraph.

Upon the filing of such petition by any such holder of Shares, service of a copy thereof must be made upon the Surviving Corporation,
which will then be obligated within 20 days to file with the Delaware Register in Chancery a duly verified list (the “Verified List”)
containing the names and addresses of all stockholders who have demanded payment for their Shares and with whom agreements as to
the value of their Shares have not been reached. Upon the filing of any such petition, the Delaware Court of Chancery may order that
notice of the time and place fixed for the hearing on the petition be mailed to the Surviving Corporation and all of the stockholders
shown on the Verified List. Such notice will also be published at least one week before the day of the hearing in a newspaper of general
circulation published in the City of Wilmington, Delaware, or in another publication determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery.
The costs of these notices are borne by the Surviving Corporation.

After notice to the stockholders as required by the Delaware Court of Chancery, the Court of Chancery is empowered to conduct a
hearing on the petition to determine those stockholders who have complied with Section 262 of the DGCL and who have become
entitled to appraisal rights thereunder. The Court of Chancery may require the stockholders who demanded payment for their Shares to
submit their stock certificates to the Delaware Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceeding
and, if any stockholder fails to comply with the direction, the Court of Chancery may dismiss the proceedings as to that stockholder.
Notwithstanding a stockholder’s compliance with the requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL, the Court of Chancery shall dismiss
the proceedings as to all stockholders who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless (1) the total number of Shares entitled to
appraisal rights exceeds 1% of the outstanding Shares eligible for appraisal or (2) the value of the consideration provided in the Merger
for such total number of Shares entitled to appraisal rights exceeds $1 million.

Determination of Fair Value

After the Delaware Court of Chancery determines which stockholders are entitled to appraisal, the appraisal proceeding will be
conducted in accordance with the rules of the Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings.
Through such proceeding, the Court of Chancery will determine the fair value of the Shares, exclusive of any element of value arising
from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the
fair value (or, in certain circumstances described below, on the difference between the amount determined to be the fair value and the
amount paid by the Surviving Corporation to each stockholder entitled to appraisal prior to the entry of judgment in the appraisal
proceeding). Unless the Court of Chancery in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest from the Effective
Time through the date of payment of the judgment will be compounded quarterly and will accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve
discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the Effective Time and the date of
payment of the judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any

Table of Contents

time before the entry of judgment in the proceedings, the Surviving Corporation may pay to each stockholder entitled to appraisal an
amount in cash, in which case interest shall accrue thereafter as provided in the immediately preceding sentence only upon the sum of
(1) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair value of the Company Shares as determined by the Court of
Chancery, and (2) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time. The Company and Parent have made no determination as to
whether such a payment may be made if the Merger is consummated, and the Company reserves the right to make such a payment
upon the consummation of the Merger.

In determining fair value, the Delaware Court of Chancery will take into account all relevant factors. In Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the
Supreme Court of Delaware discussed the factors that could be considered in determining fair value in an appraisal proceeding, stating
that “proof of value by any techniques or methods that are generally considered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise
admissible in court” should be considered, and that “fair price obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the
value of a company.” The Delaware Supreme Court stated that, in making this determination of fair value, the Court of Chancery must
consider market value, asset value, dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the enterprise and any other facts that could be
ascertained as of the date of the merger that throw any light on future prospects of the merged corporation. Section 262 of the DGCL
provides that fair value is to be “exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger.” In
Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court stated that such exclusion is a “narrow exclusion that does not
encompass known elements of value,” but which rather applies only to the speculative elements of value arising from such
accomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger, the Supreme Court of Delaware also stated that “elements of future value, including the
nature of the enterprise, which are known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the merger and not the product of speculation, may
be considered.”

Stockholders considering appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their Shares as so determined could be more than, the same as
or less than the Offer Price and that an investment banking opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the
consideration payable in a sale transaction, such as the Offer and the Merger, is not an opinion as to, and does not otherwise address,
“fair value” under Section 262 of the DGCL. Although the Company believes that the Offer Price is fair, no representation is made as
to the outcome of the appraisal of fair value as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, and stockholders should recognize that
such an appraisal could result in a determination of a value higher or lower than, or the same as, the Offer Price. Neither Parent nor the
Company anticipates offering more than the Offer Price to any stockholder exercising appraisal rights, and they reserve the right to
assert, in any appraisal proceeding, that for purposes of Section 262 of the DGCL, the fair value of a Share is less than the Offer Price.

Upon application by the Surviving Corporation or by any holder of Shares entitled to participate in the appraisal proceeding, the
Delaware Court of Chancery may, in its discretion, proceed to trial upon the appraisal prior to the final determination of the
stockholders entitled to an appraisal. Any holder of Shares whose name appears on the Verified List and who has submitted such
stockholder’s certificates of stock to the Delaware Register in Chancery, if such is required, may participate fully in all proceedings
until it is finally determined that such stockholder is not entitled to appraisal rights. The Court of Chancery will direct the payment of
the fair value of the Shares, together with interest, if any, on the amount determined to be the fair value (or, in certain circumstances
described herein on the difference between the amount determined to be the fair value and the amount paid by the Surviving
Corporation to each stockholder entitled to appraisal prior to the entry of judgment in the appraisal proceeding), by the Surviving
Corporation to the stockholders entitled thereto. Payment will be so made to each such stockholder upon the surrender to the Surviving
Corporation of such stockholder’s certificates. The Court of Chancery’s decree may be enforced as other decrees in such court may be
enforced.

If a petition for appraisal is not timely filed, or if both (1) the total number of Shares entitled to appraisal rights does not exceed 1% of
the outstanding Shares eligible for appraisal and (2) the value of the consideration provided in the Merger for such total number of
Shares entitled to appraisal rights does not exceed $1 million, then the right to an appraisal will cease. The costs of the action (which
do not include attorneys’ fees or the fees and expenses of experts) may be determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery and taxed
upon the parties as the Court of Chancery deems equitable. Upon application of a stockholder, the Court of Chancery may order all or a
portion of the expenses incurred by a stockholder in connection with an appraisal proceeding, including, without limitation, reasonable
attorneys’ fees and the fees and expenses of experts utilized in the appraisal proceeding, to be charged pro rata against the value of all
the Shares entitled to appraisal. In the absence of such determination or assessment, each party bears its own expenses.

Any stockholder who has duly demanded and perfected appraisal rights in compliance with Section 262 of the DGCL will not, after the
Effective Time, be entitled to vote his or her Shares for any purpose or be entitled to the payment of dividends or other distributions
thereon, except dividends or other distributions payable to holders of record of Shares as of a date prior to the Effective Time.

If any stockholder who demands appraisal of Shares under Section 262 of the DGCL fails to perfect, successfully withdraws or loses
such holder’s right to appraisal, such stockholder’s Shares will be deemed to have been converted at the Effective Time into the right to
receive the consideration payable in connection with the Merger (which is equal to the Offer Price, without interest). A stockholder will
fail to perfect, or effectively lose, the stockholder’s right to appraisal if no petition for appraisal is filed within 120 days after the
Effective Time. Moreover, the Court of Chancery shall dismiss the proceedings as to all stockholders who are otherwise entitled to
appraisal rights and such stockholders will effectively lose their appraisal rights, unless either (1) the total number of Company Shares
entitled to appraisal rights exceeds 1% of the outstanding Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time or (2) the value of the
consideration provided in the Merger for such total number of Company Shares entitled to appraisal rights exceeds $1 million. In
addition, as indicated above, a stockholder may withdraw his, her or its demand for appraisal in accordance with Section 262 of the
DGCL and accept the consideration payable in connection with the Merger by delivering to the Surviving Corporation a written
withdrawal of such stockholder’s demand for appraisal and acceptance of the merger either within 60 days after the effective date of
the Merger or thereafter with the written approval of the Surviving Corporation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no appraisal
proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery shall be dismissed as to any stockholder without the approval of the court, and such
approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the court deems just; provided, however, that the limitation set forth in this sentence
shall not affect the right of any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named
party to withdraw such stockholder’s demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the Merger within 60 days after the
effective date of the Merger.

If you wish to exercise your appraisal rights, you must not tender your Shares in the Offer and must strictly comply with the
procedures set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL. If you fail to take any required step in connection with the exercise of
appraisal rights, it will result in the termination or waiver of your appraisal rights.

The foregoing summary of the rights of the Company’s stockholders to seek appraisal rights under Delaware law does not
purport to be a complete statement of the procedures to be followed by the stockholders of the Company desiring to exercise
any appraisal rights available thereunder and is qualified in its entirety by reference to Section 262 of the DGCL. The proper
exercise of appraisal rights requires strict adherence to the applicable provisions of the DGCL. A copy of Section 262 of the
DGCL is included as Annex III to this Schedule 14D-9.

Anti-Takeover Statutes.

As a Delaware corporation, the Company is subject to Section 203 of the DGCL (“Section 203”). In general, Section 203 restricts an
“interested stockholder” (in general, a person who owns or has the right to acquire 15% or more of a corporation’s outstanding voting
stock) from engaging in a “business combination” (defined to include mergers and certain other actions) with a Delaware corporation
for three years following the date such person became an interested stockholder unless: (i) before such person became an interested
stockholder, the board of directors of the corporation approved the transaction in which the interested stockholder became an interested
stockholder or approved the business combination; (ii) upon consummation of the transaction which resulted in the interested
stockholder becoming an interested stockholder, the interested stockholder owned at least 85% of the voting stock of the corporation
outstanding at the time the transaction commenced, excluding for purposes of determining the voting stock outstanding (but not the
outstanding voting stock owned by the interested stockholder) those shares owned by (A) persons who are directors and also officers
and (B) employee stock plans in which employee participants do not have the right to determine confidentially whether shares held
subject to the plan will be tendered in a tender or exchange offer; or (iii) following the transaction in which such person became an
interested stockholder, the business combination is (A) approved by the board of directors of the corporation and

(B) authorized at an annual or special meeting of stockholders, and not by written consent, by the affirmative vote of the holders of at
least 66 2/3% of the outstanding voting stock of the corporation not owned by the interested stockholder. In accordance with the
provisions of Section 203, the Company Board has approved the Merger Agreement and the Tender and Support Agreement and the
transactions contemplated thereby, as described in this Schedule 14D-9 and, Parent has represented that neither it nor its subsidiaries
(including, without limitation, Purchaser) are or have been an interested stockholder at any time during the past three years. Therefore,
the restrictions of Section 203 are inapplicable to the Merger and the transactions contemplated under the Merger Agreement and the
Tender and Support Agreement.

Many other states also have adopted laws and regulations applicable to attempts to acquire securities of corporations that are
incorporated or have substantial assets, stockholders, principal executive offices or principal places of business or whose business
operations otherwise have substantial economic effects in such states. In the event it is asserted that any such provisions apply to the
Offer or the Merger, the Company may be required to take certain actions with respect to such provisions.

Regulatory Approvals.

Under the HSR Act and the rules promulgated thereunder, certain acquisition transactions may not be consummated unless certain
information has been furnished to the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the “Antitrust Division”) and the Federal Trade
Commission (“FTC”) in Notification and Report Forms provided by the acquiring and acquired persons, and certain waiting period
requirements have been satisfied. The initial waiting period for a cash tender offer is 15 days, but (i) this period may be shortened if the
reviewing agency grants “early termination,” or (ii) it may be restarted if the acquiring person voluntarily withdraws and re-files its
Notification and Report Form (a “pull-and-refile”), and/or (iii) it may be extended if the reviewing agency issues a request for
additional information and documentary material, in which case the waiting period expires 10 days after the date when the acquiring
person has substantially complied with such request. The purchase of Shares pursuant to the Offer is subject to such requirements. The
Company and Parent each filed a Premerger Notification and Report Form under the HSR Act with the FTC and the Antitrust Division
in connection with the purchase of Shares in the Offer on January 8, 2018. The required waiting period with respect to the Offer will
expire at 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time on January 23, 2018, unless (a) the period is shortened and the transaction receives “early
termination,” (b) the period is lengthened by a pull-and-refile, and/or (c) the period is lengthened by a reviewing agency that issues a
request for additional information and documentary material. The Antitrust Division and the FTC assess the legality under the antitrust
laws of transactions such as the acquisition of Shares by Purchaser pursuant to the Offer. At any time before or after the consummation
of any such transactions, the Antitrust Division or the FTC could take such action under the antitrust laws of the United States as it
deems necessary or desirable in the public interest, including seeking to enjoin the purchase of Shares pursuant to the Offer or seeking
divestiture of the Shares so acquired or divestiture of assets of Parent and/or the Company. Private parties and individual States of the
United States may also bring legal actions under the antitrust laws of the United States. The Company does not believe that the
consummation of the Offer will result in a violation of any applicable antitrust laws. However, there can be no assurance that a
challenge to the Offer on antitrust grounds will not be made, or if such a challenge is made, what the result would be.

The Company is not aware of any other filings, approvals or other actions by or with any governmental authority or administrative or
regulatory agency (other than the forgoing filings under the HSR Act, consents as may be required by federal or state securities laws,
and the filing and recordation of the certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and such filings with any
other governmental authorities to satisfy the applicable laws of states and foreign jurisdictions in which the Company is qualified to do
business) that would be required for Parent’s or Purchaser’s acquisition or ownership of the Shares pursuant to the Offer or the Merger.

ANNEX I

Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated

December 21, 2017
The Board of Directors
Ignyta, Inc.
4545 Towne Centre Court
San Diego, California 92121

Members of the Board of Directors:

We understand that Ignyta, Inc. (“Ignyta”) proposes to enter into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, (the “Agreement”), among Ignyta,
Roche Holdings, Inc. (“Roche”) and Abingdon Acquisition Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of Roche (“Purchaser”), pursuant to
which, among other things, Purchaser will commence a cash tender offer to acquire all outstanding shares of the common stock, par
value $0.0001 per share, of Ignyta (“Ignyta Common Stock”) at a purchase price of $27.00 per share in cash (the “Consideration” and,
such offer, the “Tender Offer”) and, following consummation of the Tender Offer, Purchaser will merge with and into Ignyta and each
outstanding share of Ignyta Common Stock not tendered in the Tender Offer will be converted into the right to receive the
Consideration (the “Merger” and, together with the Tender Offer, the “Transaction”). The terms and conditions of the Transaction are
more fully set forth in the Agreement.

You have requested our opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Ignyta Common Stock (other than, to
the extent applicable, Roche and its affiliates) of the Consideration to be received by such holders in the Transaction.

In connection with this opinion, we have, among other things:
 

 (1) reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information relating to Ignyta;
 

 

(2) reviewed certain internal financial and operating information with respect to the business, operations and prospects of Ignyta
furnished to or discussed with us by the management of Ignyta, including certain financial forecasts relating to Ignyta,
including with respect to rates of growth of Ignyta’s unlevered free cash flow after the forecast period, prepared by the
management of Ignyta and containing two different cases, one which reflects U.S. tax law as in in effect as of the date of this
opinion (the “Current Tax Law Case”) and one which reflects U.S. tax law assuming the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act, as passed by
both the U.S. Senate and the U.S. House of Representatives as of the date of this opinion, is signed into law (the “Pending
Tax Law Case”, and together with the Current Tax Law Case, collectively, the “Ignyta Forecasts”);

(3) reviewed and discussed with members of the management of Ignyta their estimates of the amount and utilization of certain

net operating losses (collectively, “NOLs”);
 

 
(4) discussed with members of the management of Ignyta their assessments as to the product candidates of Ignyta, including the

likelihood of technical, clinical and regulatory success of such product candidates;
 

 
(5) discussed the past and current business, operations, financial condition and prospects of Ignyta with members of

management of Ignyta;
 

 
(6) reviewed the trading history for Ignyta Common Stock and a comparison of that trading history with the trading histories of

other companies we deemed relevant;
 

 
(7) compared certain financial and stock market information of Ignyta with similar information of other companies we deemed

relevant;
 

 
(8) compared certain financial terms of the Transaction to financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of other transactions

we deemed relevant;
 

 
(9) considered the results of our efforts on behalf of Ignyta to solicit, at the direction of Ignyta, indications of interest and

definitive proposals from third parties with respect to a possible acquisition of Ignyta;
 

 (10) reviewed a draft, dated December 21, 2017, of the Agreement (the “Draft Agreement”); and
 

 (11) performed such other analyses and studies and considered such other information and factors as we deemed appropriate.

In arriving at our opinion, we have assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the accuracy and completeness of the
financial and other information and data publicly available or provided to or otherwise reviewed by or discussed with us and have
relied upon the assurances of the management of Ignyta that it is not aware of any facts or circumstances that would make such
information or data inaccurate or misleading in any material respect. With respect to the Ignyta Forecasts and the NOLs, we have been
advised by Ignyta, and have assumed, at your direction, that they have been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently
available estimates and good faith judgments of the management of Ignyta as to the future financial performance of Ignyta under the
two tax scenarios reflected in the Ignyta Forecasts and as to the other matters covered thereby. We have relied, at the direction of
Ignyta, on the assessments of the management of Ignyta as to the ability of Ignyta to utilize the NOLs and have been advised by Ignyta,
and have assumed, at the direction of Ignyta, that such NOLs will be utilized in the amounts and at the times projected. We have also
relied, at the direction of Ignyta, on the assessments as to the product candidates of Ignyta, including the likelihood of technical,
clinical and regulatory success of such product candidates. We have not made or been provided with any

independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of Ignyta or any other entity, nor have we made
any physical inspection of the properties or assets of Ignyta or any other entity. We also have not evaluated the solvency or fair value of
Ignyta or any other entity under any state, federal or other laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. We have assumed,
at the direction of Ignyta, that the Transaction will be consummated in accordance with its terms and in compliance with all applicable
laws, relevant documents and other requirements, without waiver, modification or amendment of any material term, condition or
agreement and that, in the course of obtaining the necessary governmental, regulatory and other approvals, consents, releases and
waivers for the Transaction, no delay, limitation, restriction or condition, including any divestiture requirements or amendments or
modifications, will be imposed that would have an adverse effect on Ignyta or the contemplated benefits of the Transaction. We also
have assumed, at the direction of Ignyta, that the final executed Agreement will not differ in any material respect from the Draft
Agreement reviewed by us.

We express no view or opinion as to any terms or other aspects or implications of the Transaction (other than the Consideration to the
extent expressly specified herein), including, without limitation, the form or structure of the Transaction or any arrangements,
agreements or understandings entered into in connection with or related to the Transaction or otherwise. Our opinion is limited to the
fairness, from a financial point of view, of the Consideration to be received by holders of Ignyta Common Stock (other than, to the
extent applicable, Roche and its affiliates) and no opinion or view is expressed with respect to any consideration received in connection
with the Transaction by the holders of any class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of any party. In addition, no opinion or
view is expressed with respect to the fairness (financial or otherwise) of the amount, nature or any other aspect of any compensation to
any of the officers, directors or employees of any party to the Transaction, or class of such persons, relative to the Consideration or
otherwise. Furthermore, no opinion or view is expressed as to the relative merits of the Transaction in comparison to other strategies or
transactions that might be available to Ignyta or in which Ignyta might engage or as to the underlying business decision of Ignyta to
proceed with or effect the Transaction. In addition, we are not expressing any view or opinion with respect to, and we have relied with
the consent of Ignyta upon the assessments of Ignyta and its representatives regarding, legal, regulatory, accounting, tax and similar
matters relating to Ignyta and the Transaction as to which we understand that Ignyta obtained such advice as it deemed necessary from
qualified professionals. In addition, we express no opinion or recommendation as to whether any stockholder should tender their shares
of Ignyta Common Stock in the Tender Offer or as to how any stockholder should vote or act in connection with the Transaction or any
other matter.

We have acted as financial advisor to Ignyta in connection with the Transaction and will receive a fee for our services, a portion of
which is payable upon delivery of this opinion and the principal portion of which is contingent upon consummation of the Transaction.
In addition, Ignyta has agreed to reimburse our expenses and indemnify us against certain liabilities arising out of our engagement.

We and our affiliates comprise a full service securities firm and commercial bank engaged in securities, commodities and derivatives
trading, foreign exchange and other brokerage activities, and principal investing as well as providing investment, corporate and private
banking, asset and

effect transactions in equity, debt or other securities or financial instruments (including derivatives, bank loans or other obligations) of
Ignyta, Roche and certain of their respective affiliates.

We and our affiliates in the past have provided, currently are providing, and in the future may provide, investment banking, commercial

for the rendering of these services, including (i) having acted or acting as a lender under certain leasing facilities of Roche and/or
certain of its affiliates, (ii) having provided or providing certain trading services to Roche and/or certain of its affiliates, (iii) having
provided or providing certain managed investments services and products to Roche and/or certain of its affiliates, and (iv) having
provided or providing certain treasury management products and services to Roche and/or certain of its affiliates.

It is understood that this letter is for the benefit and use of the Board of Directors of Ignyta (in its capacity as such) in connection with
and for purposes of its evaluation of the Transaction.

Our opinion is necessarily based on financial, economic, monetary, market, tax (other than as noted above) and other conditions and
circumstances as in effect on, and the information made available to us as of, the date hereof. It should be understood that subsequent
developments may affect this opinion, and we do not have any obligation to update, revise, or reaffirm this opinion. The issuance of
this opinion was approved by a fairness opinion review committee of Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated.

Based upon and subject to the foregoing, including the various assumptions and limitations set forth herein, we are of the opinion on
the date hereof that the Consideration to be received in the Transaction by holders of Ignyta Common Stock (other than, to the extent
applicable, Roche and its affiliates) is fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.

Very truly yours,

Ignyta, Inc.
4545 Towne Centre Court
San Diego, California 92121

Members of the Board of Directors:

You have requested our opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of common stock, par value $0.0001
per share (the “Company Common Stock”), of Ignyta, Inc. (the “Company”) of the consideration to be paid to such holders in the
proposed Tender Offer and Merger (each as defined below) pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Agreement”), among
the Company, Roche Holdings, Inc. (the “Acquiror”) and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Abingdon Acquisition Corp. (“Acquisition
Sub”). Pursuant to the Agreement, the Acquiror will cause Acquisition Sub to commence a tender offer for all the shares of the
Company Common Stock (the “Tender Offer”) at a price for each share equal to $27.00 (the “Consideration”), payable in cash. The
Agreement further provides that, following completion of the Tender Offer, Acquisition Sub will be merged with and into the Company
(the “Merger”) and each outstanding share of Company Common Stock, other than Excluded Shares or Dissenting Shares (each as
defined in the Agreement), will be converted into the right to receive an amount equal to the Consideration in cash. The Tender Offer
and Merger, together and not separately, are referred to herein as the “Transaction”.

In connection with preparing our opinion, we have (i) reviewed a draft, dated December 21, 2017, of the Agreement; (ii) reviewed
certain publicly available business and financial information concerning the Company and the industries in which it operates;
(iii) compared the proposed financial terms of the Transaction with the publicly available financial terms of certain transactions
involving companies we deemed relevant and the consideration paid for such companies; (iv) compared the financial and operating
performance of the Company with publicly available information concerning certain other companies we deemed relevant and
reviewed the current and historical market prices of the Company Common Stock and certain publicly traded securities of such other
companies; (v) reviewed certain internal financial analyses and forecasts prepared by the management of the Company relating to its
business; and (vi) performed such other financial studies and analyses and considered such other information as we deemed appropriate
for the purposes of this opinion.

In addition, we have held discussions with certain members of the management of the Company with respect to certain aspects of the
Transaction, and the past and current business operations of the Company, the financial condition and future prospects and operations
of the Company, and certain other matters we believed necessary or appropriate to our inquiry.

In giving our opinion, we have relied upon and assumed the accuracy and completeness of all information that was publicly available
or was furnished to or discussed with us by the Company or otherwise reviewed by or for us. We have not independently verified any
such information or its accuracy or completeness and, pursuant to our engagement letter with the Company, we did not assume any
obligation to undertake any such independent verification. We have not conducted or been provided with any valuation or appraisal of
any assets or liabilities, nor have we evaluated the solvency of the Company or the Acquiror under any state or federal laws relating to
bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. In relying on financial analyses and forecasts provided to us or derived therefrom, we have
assumed that they have been reasonably prepared based on assumptions (including assumptions relating to tax) reflecting the best
currently available estimates and judgments by management as to the expected future results of operations and financial condition of
the Company to which such analyses or forecasts relate.

We express no view as to such analyses or forecasts or the assumptions on which they were based. We have also assumed that the
Transaction and the other transactions contemplated by the Agreement will be consummated as described in the Agreement and that the
definitive Agreement will not differ in any material respects from the draft thereof furnished to us. We have also assumed that the
representations and warranties made by the Company and the Acquiror in the Agreement and the related agreements are and will be
true and correct in all respects material to our analysis. We are not legal, regulatory or tax experts and have relied on the assessments
made by advisors to the Company with respect to such issues. We have further assumed that all material governmental, regulatory or
other consents and approvals necessary for the consummation of the Transaction will be obtained without any adverse effect on the
Company or on the contemplated benefits of the Transaction.

Our opinion is necessarily based on economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to us as
of, the date hereof. It should be understood that subsequent developments may affect this opinion and that we do not have any
obligation to update, revise, or reaffirm this opinion. Our opinion is limited to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the
Consideration to be paid to the holders of the Company Common Stock in the proposed Transaction and we express no opinion as to
the fairness of any consideration paid in connection with the Transaction to the holders of any other class of securities, creditors or
other constituencies of the Company or as to the underlying decision by the Company to engage in the Transaction. Furthermore, we
express no opinion with respect to the amount or nature of any compensation to any officers, directors, or employees of any party to the
Transaction, or any class of such persons relative to the Consideration to be paid to the holders of the Company Common Stock in the
Transaction or with respect to the fairness of any such compensation.

We have acted as financial advisor to the Company with respect to the proposed Transaction and will receive a fee from the Company
for our services, a substantial portion of which will become payable only if the proposed Transaction is consummated. In addition, the
Company has agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities arising out of our engagement. During the two years preceding the date of
this letter, we and our affiliates have had commercial or investment banking relationships with the Company, for which we and such
affiliates have received customary compensation. Such services during such period have included acting as joint lead bookrunner on
the Company’s offerings of equity securities in April 2016, May 2017 and October 2017. During the two years preceding the date of
this letter, neither we nor our affiliates have had any material financial advisory or other material commercial or investment banking

relationships with the Acquiror. In addition, we and our affiliates hold, on a proprietary basis, less than 1% of the outstanding common
stock of each of the Company and the Acquiror. In the ordinary course of our businesses, we and our affiliates may actively trade the
debt and equity securities or financial instruments (including derivatives, bank loans or other obligations) of the Company or the
Acquiror for our own account or for the accounts of customers and, accordingly, we may at any time hold long or short positions in
such securities or other financial instruments.

On the basis of and subject to the foregoing, it is our opinion as of the date hereof that the Consideration to be paid to the holders of the
Company Common Stock in the proposed Transaction is fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.

The issuance of this opinion has been approved by a fairness opinion committee of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC. This letter is provided
to the Board of Directors of the Company (in its capacity as such) in connection with and for the purposes of its evaluation of the
Transaction. This opinion does not constitute a recommendation to any stockholder of the Company as to whether such stockholder
should tender its shares into the Tender Offer or how such stockholder should vote with respect to the Transaction or any other matter.
This opinion may not be disclosed, referred to, or communicated (in whole or in part) to any third party for any purpose whatsoever
except with our prior written approval. This opinion may be reproduced in full in any proxy or information statement mailed to
stockholders of the Company but may not otherwise be disclosed publicly in any manner without our prior written approval.

Very truly yours,

ANNEX III

SECTION 262 OF THE DELAWARE GENERAL CORPORATION LAW—RIGHTS OF APPRAISAL

Appraisal Rights.

(a) Any stockholder of a corporation of this State who holds shares of stock on the date of the making of a demand pursuant to
subsection (d) of this section with respect to such shares, who continuously holds such shares through the effective date of the merger
or consolidation, who has otherwise complied with subsection (d) of this section and who has neither voted in favor of the merger or
consolidation nor consented thereto in writing pursuant to § 228 of this title shall be entitled to an appraisal by the Court of Chancery
of the fair value of the stockholder’s shares of stock under the circumstances described in subsections (b) and (c) of this section. As
used in this section, the word “stockholder” means a holder of record of stock in a corporation; the words “stock” and “share” mean
and include what is ordinarily meant by those words; and the words “depository receipt” mean a receipt or other instrument issued by a
depository representing an interest in 1 or more shares, or fractions thereof, solely of stock of a corporation, which stock is deposited
with the depository.

(b) Appraisal rights shall be available for the shares of any class or series of stock of a constituent corporation in a merger or
consolidation to be effected pursuant to § 251 (other than a merger effected pursuant to § 251(g) of this title and, subject to paragraph
(b)(3) of this section, § 251(h) of this title), § 252, § 254, § 255, § 256, § 257, § 258, § 263 or § 264 of this title:

(1) Provided, however, that, except as expressly provided in § 363(b) of this title, no appraisal rights under this section shall be
available for the shares of any class or series of stock, which stock, or depository receipts in respect thereof, at the record date
fixed to determine the stockholders entitled to receive notice of the meeting of stockholders to act upon the agreement of merger
or consolidation, were either: (i) listed on a national securities exchange or (ii) held of record by more than 2,000 holders; and
further provided that no appraisal rights shall be available for any shares of stock of the constituent corporation surviving a
merger if the merger did not require for its approval the vote of the stockholders of the surviving corporation as provided in §
251(f) of this title.

(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1) of this section, appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the shares of any
class or series of stock of a constituent corporation if the holders thereof are required by the terms of an agreement of merger or
consolidation pursuant to §§ 251, 252, 254, 255, 256, 257, 258, 263 and 264 of this title to accept for such stock anything except:

a. Shares of stock of the corporation surviving or resulting from such merger or consolidation, or depository receipts in
respect thereof;

b. Shares of stock of any other corporation, or depository receipts in respect thereof, which shares of stock (or depository
receipts in respect thereof) or depository receipts at the effective date of the merger or consolidation will be either listed on a
national securities exchange or held of record by more than 2,000 holders;

c. Cash in lieu of fractional shares or fractional depository receipts described in the foregoing paragraphs (b)(2)a. and b. of
this section; or

d. Any combination of the shares of stock, depository receipts and cash in lieu of fractional shares or fractional depository
receipts described in the foregoing paragraphs (b)(2)a., b. and c. of this section.

(3) In the event all of the stock of a subsidiary Delaware corporation party to a merger effected under § 251(h), § 253 or § 267 of
this title is not owned by the parent immediately prior to the merger, appraisal rights shall be available for the shares of the
subsidiary Delaware corporation.

(4) In the event of an amendment to a corporation’s certificate of incorporation contemplated by § 363(a) of this title, appraisal
rights shall be available as contemplated by § 363(b) of this title, and the procedures of this section, including those set forth in
subsections (d) and (e) of this section, shall apply as nearly as practicable, with the word “amendment” substituted for the words
“merger or consolidation,” and the word “corporation” substituted for the words “constituent corporation” and/or “surviving or
resulting corporation.”

Table of Contents

(c) Any corporation may provide in its certificate of incorporation that appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the
shares of any class or series of its stock as a result of an amendment to its certificate of incorporation, any merger or consolidation in
which the corporation is a constituent corporation or the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the corporation. If the certificate
of incorporation contains such a provision, the provisions of this section, including those set forth in subsections (d), (e), and (g) of this
section, shall apply as nearly as is practicable.

(d) Appraisal rights shall be perfected as follows:

(1) If a proposed merger or consolidation for which appraisal rights are provided under this section is to be submitted for approval
at a meeting of stockholders, the corporation, not less than 20 days prior to the meeting, shall notify each of its stockholders who
was such on the record date for notice of such meeting (or such members who received notice in accordance with § 255(c) of this
title) with respect to shares for which appraisal rights are available pursuant to subsection (b) or (c) of this section that appraisal
rights are available for any or all of the shares of the constituent corporations, and shall include in such notice a copy of this
section and, if 1 of the constituent corporations is a nonstock corporation, a copy of § 114 of this title. Each stockholder electing
to demand the appraisal of such stockholder’s shares shall deliver to the corporation, before the taking of the vote on the merger
or consolidation, a written demand for appraisal of such stockholder’s shares. Such demand will be sufficient if it reasonably
informs the corporation of the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to demand the appraisal of such
stockholder’s shares. A proxy or vote against the merger or consolidation shall not constitute such a demand. A stockholder
electing to take such action must do so by a separate written demand as herein provided. Within 10 days after the effective date of
such merger or consolidation, the surviving or resulting corporation shall notify each stockholder of each constituent corporation
who has complied with this subsection and has not voted in favor of or consented to the merger or consolidation of the date that
the merger or consolidation has become effective; or

(2) If the merger or consolidation was approved pursuant to § 228, § 251(h), § 253, or § 267 of this title, then either a constituent
corporation before the effective date of the merger or consolidation or the surviving or resulting corporation within 10 days
thereafter shall notify each of the holders of any class or series of stock of such constituent corporation who are entitled to
appraisal rights of the approval of the merger or consolidation and that appraisal rights are available for any or all shares of such
class or series of stock of such constituent corporation, and shall include in such notice a copy of this section and, if 1 of the
constituent corporations is a nonstock corporation, a copy of § 114 of this title. Such notice may, and, if given on or after the
effective date of the merger or consolidation, shall, also notify such stockholders of the effective date of the merger or
consolidation. Any stockholder entitled to appraisal rights may, within 20 days after the date of mailing of such notice or, in the
case of a merger approved pursuant to § 251(h) of this title, within the later of the consummation of the offer contemplated by §
251(h) of this title and 20 days after the date of mailing of such notice, demand in writing from the surviving or resulting
corporation the appraisal of such holder’s shares. Such demand will be sufficient if it reasonably informs the corporation of the
identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to demand the appraisal of such holder’s shares. If such notice
did not notify stockholders of the effective date of the merger or consolidation, either (i) each such constituent corporation shall
send a second notice before the effective date of the merger or consolidation notifying each of the holders of any class or series of
stock of such constituent corporation that are entitled to appraisal rights of the effective date of the merger or consolidation or
(ii) the surviving or resulting corporation shall send such a second notice to all such holders on or within 10 days after such
effective date; provided, however, that if such second notice is sent more than 20 days following the sending of the first notice or,
in the case of a merger approved pursuant to § 251(h) of this title, later than the later of the consummation of the offer
contemplated by § 251(h) of this title and 20 days following the sending of the first notice, such second notice need only be sent
to each stockholder who is entitled to appraisal rights and who has demanded appraisal of such holder’s shares in accordance with
this subsection. An affidavit of the secretary or assistant secretary or of the transfer agent of the corporation that is required to
give either notice that such notice has been given shall, in the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein.
For purposes of determining the stockholders entitled to receive either notice, each constituent corporation may fix, in advance, a
record date that shall be

Table of Contents

not more than 10 days prior to the date the notice is given, provided, that if the notice is given on or after the effective date of the
merger or consolidation, the record date shall be such effective date. If no record date is fixed and the notice is given prior to the
effective date, the record date shall be the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the notice is given.

(e) Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, the surviving or resulting corporation or any stockholder
who has complied with subsections (a) and (d) of this section hereof and who is otherwise entitled to appraisal rights, may commence
an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Court of Chancery demanding a determination of the value of the stock of all such
stockholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, any
stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party shall have the right to
withdraw such stockholder’s demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the merger or consolidation. Within 120 days
after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, any stockholder who has complied with the requirements of subsections (a) and
(d) of this section hereof, upon written request, shall be entitled to receive from the corporation surviving the merger or resulting from
the consolidation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the merger or consolidation and with
respect to which demands for appraisal have been received and the aggregate number of holders of such shares. Such written statement
shall be mailed to the stockholder within 10 days after such stockholder’s written request for such a statement is received by the
surviving or resulting corporation or within 10 days after expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal under
subsection (d) of this section hereof, whichever is later. Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, a person who is the beneficial
owner of shares of such stock held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person may, in such person’s own name,
file a petition or request from the corporation the statement described in this subsection.

(f) Upon the filing of any such petition by a stockholder, service of a copy thereof shall be made upon the surviving or resulting
corporation, which shall within 20 days after such service file in the office of the Register in Chancery in which the petition was filed a
duly verified list containing the names and addresses of all stockholders who have demanded payment for their shares and with whom
agreements as to the value of their shares have not been reached by the surviving or resulting corporation. If the petition shall be filed
by the surviving or resulting corporation, the petition shall be accompanied by such a duly verified list. The Register in Chancery, if so
ordered by the Court, shall give notice of the time and place fixed for the hearing of such petition by registered or certified mail to the
surviving or resulting corporation and to the stockholders shown on the list at the addresses therein stated. Such notice shall also be
given by 1 or more publications at least 1 week before the day of the hearing, in a newspaper of general circulation published in the
City of Wilmington, Delaware or such publication as the Court deems advisable. The forms of the notices by mail and by publication
shall be approved by the Court, and the costs thereof shall be borne by the surviving or resulting corporation.

(g) At the hearing on such petition, the Court shall determine the stockholders who have complied with this section and who have
become entitled to appraisal rights. The Court may require the stockholders who have demanded an appraisal for their shares and who
hold stock represented by certificates to submit their certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the
pendency of the appraisal proceedings; and if any stockholder fails to comply with such direction, the Court may dismiss the
proceedings as to such stockholder. If immediately before the merger or consolidation the shares of the class or series of stock of the
constituent corporation as to which appraisal rights are available were listed on a national securities exchange, the Court shall dismiss
the proceedings as to all holders of such shares who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless (1) the total number of shares
entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of the class or series eligible for appraisal, (2) the value of the consideration
provided in the merger or consolidation for such total number of shares exceeds $1 million, or (3) the merger was approved pursuant to
§ 253 or § 267 of this title.

(h) After the Court determines the stockholders entitled to an appraisal, the appraisal proceeding shall be conducted in accordance with
the rules of the Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings. Through such proceeding the
Court shall determine the fair value of the shares exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of
the merger or consolidation, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. In determining
such fair value, the Court shall take into account all relevant factors. Unless the Court in its discretion determines otherwise for good
cause shown, and except as provided in this subsection, interest from the effective date of the merger through the date of payment of
the judgment shall be compounded quarterly and shall accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as
established from time to time during the period between the effective date of the merger and the date of payment of the judgment. At
any time before the entry of judgment in the proceedings, the

surviving corporation may pay to each stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which case interest shall accrue thereafter
as provided herein only upon the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair value of the shares as
determined by the Court, and (2) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time. Upon application by the surviving or resulting
corporation or by any stockholder entitled to participate in the appraisal proceeding, the Court may, in its discretion, proceed to trial
upon the appraisal prior to the final determination of the stockholders entitled to an appraisal. Any stockholder whose name appears on
the list filed by the surviving or resulting corporation pursuant to subsection (f) of this section and who has submitted such
stockholder’s certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery, if such is required, may participate fully in all proceedings until it is
finally determined that such stockholder is not entitled to appraisal rights under this section.

(i) The Court shall direct the payment of the fair value of the shares, together with interest, if any, by the surviving or resulting
corporation to the stockholders entitled thereto. Payment shall be so made to each such stockholder, in the case of holders of
uncertificated stock forthwith, and the case of holders of shares represented by certificates upon the surrender to the corporation of the
certificates representing such stock. The Court’s decree may be enforced as other decrees in the Court of Chancery may be enforced,
whether such surviving or resulting corporation be a corporation of this State or of any state.

(j) The costs of the proceeding may be determined by the Court and taxed upon the parties as the Court deems equitable in the
circumstances. Upon application of a stockholder, the Court may order all or a portion of the expenses incurred by any stockholder in
connection with the appraisal proceeding, including, without limitation, reasonable attorney’s fees and the fees and expenses of experts,
to be charged pro rata against the value of all the shares entitled to an appraisal.

(k) From and after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, no stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights as provided in
subsection (d) of this section shall be entitled to vote such stock for any purpose or to receive payment of dividends or other
distributions on the stock (except dividends or other distributions payable to stockholders of record at a date which is prior to the
effective date of the merger or consolidation); provided, however, that if no petition for an appraisal shall be filed within the time
provided in subsection (e) of this section, or if such stockholder shall deliver to the surviving or resulting corporation a written
withdrawal of such stockholder’s demand for an appraisal and an acceptance of the merger or consolidation, either within 60 days after
the effective date of the merger or consolidation as provided in subsection (e) of this section or thereafter with the written approval of
the corporation, then the right of such stockholder to an appraisal shall cease. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no appraisal proceeding
in the Court of Chancery shall be dismissed as to any stockholder without the approval of the Court, and such approval may be
conditioned upon such terms as the Court deems just; provided, however that this provision shall not affect the right of any stockholder
who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such stockholder’s demand
for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the merger or consolidation within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or
consolidation, as set forth in subsection (e) of this section.

(l) The shares of the surviving or resulting corporation to which the shares of such objecting stockholders would have been converted
had they assented to the merger or consolidation shall have the status of authorized and unissued shares of the surviving or resulting
corporation.
