JOINT PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS

Dear Stockholders:

            We are pleased to report that American Axle & Manufacturing Holdings, Inc. (which we refer to as AAM) and Metaldyne Performance Group Inc. (which we refer to as
MPG) have entered into an agreement and plan of merger (which we refer to as the merger agreement) pursuant to which Alpha SPV I, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of AAM
(which we refer to as Merger Sub), will merge with and into MPG, upon which MPG will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of AAM (which we refer to as the merger).

            In the merger, each outstanding share of MPG common stock (other than shares held in the treasury of MPG, shares owned by AAM or any direct or indirect subsidiary of
AAM (including Merger Sub), and shares with respect to which appraisal rights are properly exercised and not withdrawn) will be converted into the right to receive the following
(which we refer to collectively as the merger consideration):

• $13.50 in cash, without interest; and 

• 0.5 of a share of AAM common stock.

            Each unvested MPG stock option outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger will be accelerated in full and become fully vested and, at the effective
time of the merger, all MPG stock options will be cancelled and the holders thereof will receive an amount in cash (without interest and subject to applicable withholding of taxes)
equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the aggregate number of shares of MPG common stock that were issuable upon exercise of the MPG stock option immediately prior
to the effective time of the merger, by (y) the value of the merger consideration (with the AAM common stock issued in the merger valued based on the closing price of a share of
AAM common stock as of the trading day immediately preceding the closing date), less the per share exercise price of the MPG stock option. If the exercise price payable upon
exercise of an MPG stock option equals or exceeds the value of the merger consideration (with the AAM common stock issued in the merger valued based on the closing price of a
share of AAM common stock as of the trading day immediately preceding the closing date), the MPG stock option will be cancelled for no consideration. Each outstanding share of
restricted MPG common stock will be cancelled and terminated as of the effective time of the merger, and each holder thereof will receive the merger consideration for each share of
restricted MPG common stock (subject to applicable withholding of taxes). Each MPG restricted stock unit award outstanding will become fully vested immediately prior to the
effective time of the merger and, at the effective time of the merger, will be cancelled and terminated, and each holder thereof will receive an amount equal to the merger
consideration multiplied by the number of shares of MPG common stock subject to such cancelled MPG restricted stock unit award (subject to applicable withholding of taxes).

            AAM intends to apply to list the shares of AAM common stock to be issued in the merger on the New York Stock Exchange where, subject to official notice of issuance, they
will trade under the symbol "AXL", under which existing shares of AAM common stock already trade. Based on the number of shares of MPG common stock, the number of shares
of restricted MPG common stock and the number of shares of MPG common stock subject to MPG restricted stock unit awards, in each case outstanding as of the close of business
on Friday, February 24, 2017, the total number of shares of AAM common stock expected to be issued in connection with the merger is approximately 34.7 million.

            Before the merger can be completed, the stockholders of AAM must vote to approve the issuance of shares of AAM common stock in the merger to securityholders of MPG
on the terms and conditions set out in the merger agreement, and the stockholders of MPG must vote to adopt the merger agreement and approve the transactions contemplated by the
merger agreement. AAM and MPG are sending you this joint proxy statement/prospectus to ask you to vote in favor of these matters, as applicable.

            AAM will hold a special meeting of its stockholders on April 5, 2017 at the time and place indicated in the enclosed notice of special meeting to AAM stockholders to
consider and vote on (i) the issuance of the shares of AAM common stock in the merger and (ii) a proposal to adjourn the AAM special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit
additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes at the time of the meeting to approve the issuance of the shares of AAM common stock in the merger.

            MPG will hold a special meeting of its stockholders on April 5, 2017 at the time and place indicated in the enclosed notice of special meeting to MPG stockholders to consider
and vote on (i) the adoption of the merger agreement and the approval of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, (ii) a non-binding, advisory proposal to approve the
compensation that may be paid or become payable to MPG's named executive officers in connection with the merger and (iii) a proposal to adjourn the MPG special meeting, if
necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes at the time of the meeting to adopt the merger agreement and approve the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement.

            The receipt of the merger consideration in exchange for shares of MPG common stock pursuant to the merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax
purposes and may also be taxable under state, local and non-U.S. income and other tax laws. We encourage stockholders of MPG to read the discussion of the material U.S. tax
considerations of the merger in this joint proxy statement/prospectus under the caption "The Merger—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger" beginning on
page 107.

            YOUR VOTE IS VERY IMPORTANT.    AAM and MPG cannot complete the merger unless both (i) AAM stockholders approve the issuance of the shares of AAM
common stock in the merger and (ii) MPG stockholders adopt the merger agreement and approve the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. Whether or not you plan to
attend your special meeting, please take the time to submit your proxy by completing, signing, dating and returning the accompanying proxy card or by appointing your proxy by
telephone or via the Internet as soon as possible. If you hold your shares in "street name," you should instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote in accordance with the
voting instruction form you receive from your bank, broker or other nominee. Returning the proxy card does NOT deprive you of your right to attend your special meeting and to vote
your shares in person.

            Contemporaneously with the execution of the merger agreement, ASP MD Investco L.P. (which we refer to as the AS stockholder), a stockholder of MPG and an affiliate of
American Securities LLC, entered into a voting agreement with AAM with respect to all shares of MPG common stock owned by the AS stockholder, which constituted
approximately 77% of the issued and outstanding shares of MPG common stock as of the date of the voting agreement. Under the voting agreement, the AS stockholder has agreed to,
among other things and subject to the terms and conditions of the voting agreement, vote shares of MPG common stock owned by the AS stockholder constituting approximately 38%
of the issued and outstanding shares of MPG common stock as of the date of the voting agreement in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement and the approval of the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, and vote all other shares of MPG common stock owned by the AS stockholder in the same proportion as the manner in which the
shares of MPG common stock not owned by the AS stockholder are voted.

            This joint proxy statement/prospectus provides detailed information concerning the merger, the merger agreement and the proposals to be considered at the special meetings.
Additional information regarding AAM and MPG has been filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and is publicly available. We encourage you to read carefully

this entire joint proxy statement/prospectus, including all of its annexes and the section entitled "Risk Factors" beginning on page 34.

            We enthusiastically support the proposed combination of AAM and MPG. The AAM board of directors unanimously approved the merger agreement and the issuance of
shares of AAM common stock and declared their advisability and recommends that AAM stockholders vote "FOR" the issuance of the shares of AAM common stock in the merger.
The MPG board of directors unanimously approved the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and declared the merger
agreement and the merger advisable and recommends that MPG stockholders vote "FOR" the adoption of the merger agreement and the approval of the transactions contemplated by
the merger agreement.

            Neither the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission nor any state securities commission has approved or disapproved any of the transactions described in this
joint proxy statement/prospectus or the shares of AAM common stock to be issued by AAM under this document or passed upon the adequacy or accuracy of this
document. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense.

This joint proxy statement/prospectus is dated March 6, 2017 and is first being mailed to
AAM stockholders and MPG stockholders on or about March 7, 2017.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE MERGER AND THE SPECIAL MEETINGS 

        The following questions and answers are intended to address briefly some commonly asked questions regarding the merger, the
merger agreement and the special meetings. These questions and answers highlight only some of the information contained in this
joint proxy statement/prospectus and may not contain all the information that is important to you. You should read carefully this
entire joint proxy statement/prospectus, including the Annexes and the documents incorporated by reference into this joint proxy
statement/prospectus, to understand fully the merger and the voting procedures for the special meetings. See "Where You Can Find
More Information" beginning on page 196.

Q1: What is the merger? 

A: American Axle & Manufacturing Holdings, Inc. (which we refer to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as AAM), Alpha
SPV I, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of AAM (which we refer to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as Merger Sub),
and Metaldyne Performance Group Inc. (which we refer to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as MPG) have entered
into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of November 3, 2016, as it may be amended from time to time (which we
refer to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the merger agreement). A copy of the merger agreement is attached as
Annex A to this joint proxy statement/prospectus. The merger agreement contains the terms and conditions of the proposed
acquisition of MPG by AAM. Under the merger agreement, subject to satisfaction or, where permissible under applicable law,
waiver of the conditions to the merger set forth in the merger agreement and described hereinafter, Merger Sub will merge
with and into MPG, with MPG continuing as the surviving corporation and as a wholly-owned subsidiary of AAM (which we
refer to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the merger). The merger will be effective at the time (which we refer to in
this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the effective time of the merger) the certificate of merger is filed with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware (or at a later time, if agreed upon by the parties and specified in the certificate of merger filed
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware). 

Q2: Why am I receiving this joint proxy statement/prospectus? 

A: You are receiving this joint proxy statement/prospectus in connection with the proposed acquisition of MPG by AAM
because you were a stockholder of record as of the record date for the AAM special meeting and/or MPG special meeting, as
applicable. The proposed acquisition is contemplated by the merger agreement. 

In order to complete the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, the stockholders of AAM must approve the
issuance of shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of AAM (which we refer to in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus as AAM common stock) as part of the merger consideration to be paid to stockholders of MPG pursuant
to the merger agreement (which we refer to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the AAM share issuance), and the
stockholders of MPG must adopt the merger agreement and approve the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.
AAM and MPG will hold separate special meetings of their stockholders to obtain such required approvals, and you are
receiving this joint proxy statement/prospectus in connection with those special meetings. For a summary of certain
provisions of the merger agreement, see the section entitled "The Merger Agreement" beginning on page 123. In addition, a
copy of the merger agreement is attached to this joint proxy statement/prospectus as Annex A. We urge you to read carefully
this joint proxy statement/prospectus and the merger agreement in their entirety.

Q3: What are AAM stockholders being asked to vote on and how many votes are required? 

A: AAM stockholders are being asked to vote to: 

• approve the AAM share issuance (which we refer to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the AAM share
issuance proposal), which requires approval by the affirmative vote of holders of a majority in voting power of the
shares of AAM common stock present in person or represented by proxy at the AAM special meeting and entitled to
vote on the AAM share issuance; and 

• approve the adjournment of the AAM special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to permit further solicitation of
proxies if there are not sufficient votes at the time of the AAM special meeting to approve the AAM share issuance
(which we refer to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the AAM adjournment proposal), which requires the
affirmative vote of holders of a majority in voting power of the AAM common stock present in person or represented
by proxy, and entitled to vote on the proposal at the AAM special meeting. 

Q4: What are MPG stockholders being asked to vote on and how many votes are required? 

A: MPG stockholders are being asked to vote to: 

• adopt the merger agreement and approve the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, which requires the
affirmative vote of the majority of the shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of MPG (which we refer
to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as MPG common stock) that are outstanding as of the record date for the
MPG special meeting and entitled to vote on the adoption of the merger agreement and the approval of the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement at the MPG special meeting; 

• approve, on an advisory non-binding basis, the compensation that may be paid or become payable to MPG's named
executive officers in connection with the merger (which we refer to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the
MPG merger-related compensation proposal), which requires the affirmative vote of the majority of the shares of
MPG common stock present in person or represented by proxy and voting on the proposal at the MPG special
meeting; and 

• approve the adjournment of the MPG special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to permit further solicitation of
proxies if there are not sufficient votes at the time of the MPG special meeting to adopt the merger agreement and
approve the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement (which we refer to in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus as the MPG adjournment proposal), which requires the affirmative vote of the majority of the
shares of MPG common stock present in person or represented by proxy and voting on the proposal at the MPG
special meeting.

Contemporaneously with the execution of the merger agreement, ASP MD Investco L.P. (which we refer to in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus as the AS stockholder), a stockholder of MPG and an affiliate of American Securities LLC (which we
refer to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as American Securities), entered into a voting agreement with AAM (which
we refer to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the voting agreement) with respect to all shares of MPG common stock
owned by the AS stockholder, which constituted approximately 77% of the issued and outstanding shares of MPG common
stock as of the date of the voting agreement. Under the voting agreement, the AS stockholder has agreed to, among other
things and subject to the terms and conditions of the voting agreement, vote shares of MPG common stock owned by the AS
stockholder constituting approximately 38% of the issued and outstanding shares of MPG common stock as of the date of the
voting agreement in favor

of the adoption of the merger agreement and the approval of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, and vote
all other shares of MPG common stock owned by the AS stockholder in the same proportion as the manner in which the
shares of MPG common stock not owned by the AS stockholder are voted. As a result, assuming approximately 20% of the
outstanding shares of MPG common stock not owned by the AS stockholder vote in favor of the adoption of the merger
agreement and approval of the transactions contemplated thereby, that proposal will be adopted by the requisite vote. You
should read "The Voting Agreement" beginning on page 155 for a more complete discussion of the terms and conditions
contained in the voting agreement. A copy of the voting agreement is attached to this joint proxy statement/prospectus as
Annex B.

Q5: What will MPG stockholders receive in the merger? 

A: At the effective time of the merger, each share of MPG common stock (other than MPG excluded shares, as described below)
will be converted into the right to receive the following (which we collectively refer to in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus as the merger consideration): 

• $13.50 in cash, without interest (which we refer to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the cash consideration);
and 

• 0.5 (which we refer to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the exchange ratio) of a share of AAM common
stock (which we refer to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the stock consideration).

In lieu of the issuance of any fractional share of AAM common stock to which an MPG stockholder would otherwise be
entitled, an MPG stockholder will be entitled to receive an amount in cash, without interest and rounded down to the nearest
whole cent (and subject to applicable withholding of taxes), equal to the product obtained by multiplying (a) the fractional
share of AAM common stock to which the stockholder would otherwise be entitled (after taking into account all fractional
share interests then held by the stockholder) by (b) the average of the volume weighted averages of the trading prices of
shares of AAM common stock on the NYSE on each of the 5 consecutive trading days ending on the trading day that is 2
trading days prior to the closing date of the merger (which we refer to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the closing
date).

Shares of MPG common stock held in the treasury of MPG or that are owned by AAM or any direct or indirect subsidiary of
AAM (including Merger Sub), which will automatically be canceled in the merger, and shares of MPG common stock with
respect to which appraisal rights are properly exercised and not withdrawn (which we refer to collectively in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus as the MPG excluded shares) will not be converted into the right to receive the merger consideration.

Q6: How will AAM pay the cash consideration component of the merger consideration? 

A: AAM's obligation to complete the merger is not conditioned upon its obtaining financing. AAM anticipates that
approximately $990 million will be required to pay the aggregate cash consideration to the MPG stockholders. AAM intends
to fund the cash consideration of the merger through sources of debt financing. 

For a more complete description of sources of funding for the merger and related costs, see "Financing Relating to the
Merger" beginning on page 121.

its stockholders, (ii) approved the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger and the
AAM share issuance, and declared their advisability, and (iii) recommends that AAM stockholders vote "FOR" the AAM

transactions contemplated thereby (including the merger) is fair to, and in the best interests of, MPG and its stockholders,
(ii) approved the merger agreement, the merger and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and declared the

merger agreement and the approval of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, "FOR" the MPG merger-
related compensation proposal and "FOR" the MPG adjournment proposal. 

Q9: Are there risks involved in undertaking the merger? 

A: Yes. In evaluating the merger, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in the section of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus entitled "Risk Factors" beginning on page 34, as well as the other information about AAM and MPG
contained or included in the documents incorporated by reference in this joint proxy statement/prospectus. 

Q10: When and where is the AAM special meeting? 

A: The AAM special meeting will be held on Wednesday, April 5, 2017, at 8:00 a.m., local time, at AAM World Headquarters
Auditorium, One Dauch Drive, Detroit, Michigan 48211. AAM stockholders may attend the AAM special meeting and vote
their shares in person, or may appoint a proxy by completing, signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy card for the
AAM special meeting. AAM stockholders may also follow the instructions on the proxy card or voting instruction form to
appoint a proxy by telephone or via the Internet. If you hold your shares of AAM common stock in "street name" through a
bank, broker or other nominee, you should follow the instructions provided to you by that nominee in order to vote your
shares. 

Q11: When and where is the MPG special meeting? 

A: The MPG special meeting will be held on Wednesday, April 5, 2017, at 8:30 a.m., local time, at Two Towne Square,
Suite 110, Conference Center, Southfield, Michigan 48076. MPG stockholders of record may attend the MPG special meeting
and vote their shares in person, or may appoint a proxy by completing, signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy card
for the MPG special meeting. MPG stockholders may also follow the instructions on the proxy card or voting instruction
form to appoint a proxy by telephone or via the Internet. If you hold your shares of MPG common stock in "street name"

joint proxy statement/prospectus as the AAM record date). As of the AAM record date, there were 76,476,788 shares of
AAM common stock outstanding.

Q13: Who can vote at the MPG special meeting? 

A: You can vote at the MPG special meeting if you were the record holder of shares of MPG common stock as of the close of
business on Friday, February 24, 2017 (which we refer to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the MPG record date).
As of the MPG record date, there were 67,917,752 shares of MPG common stock outstanding. 

Q14: What is the quorum requirement for the AAM special meeting? 

A: Stockholders who hold shares representing a majority in voting power of the shares of AAM common stock issued and
outstanding and entitled to vote at the AAM special meeting, present in person or represented by proxy, will constitute a
quorum for the transaction of business at the AAM special meeting. Abstentions will be treated as present at the AAM special
meeting for purposes of determining the presence or absence of a quorum for the transaction of all business. Because all of
the matters to be voted on are considered "non-routine" under New York Stock Exchange (which we refer to in this joint
proxy statement/prospectus as the NYSE) Rule 452, there can be no broker non-votes at the AAM special meeting.
Accordingly, failure to provide instructions to your bank, broker or other nominee on how to vote will result in your shares
not being counted as present for establishing a quorum at the AAM special meeting. 

Q15: What is the quorum requirement for the MPG special meeting? 

A: Stockholders of record who hold shares representing a majority in voting power of the shares of MPG common stock entitled
to vote at the MPG special meeting, present in person or represented by proxy, will constitute a quorum for the transaction of
business at the MPG special meeting. Abstentions will be treated as present at the MPG special meeting for purposes of
determining the presence or absence of a quorum for the transaction of all business. Because all of the matters to be voted on
are considered to be "non-routine" under NYSE Rule 452, there can be no broker non-votes at the MPG special meeting.
Accordingly, failure to provide instructions to your bank, broker or other nominee on how to vote will result in your shares
not being counted as present for establishing a quorum at the MPG special meeting. 

Q16: What do AAM stockholders need to do now? 

A: After carefully reading and considering the information contained, or incorporated by reference, in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus, please complete, sign and date your proxy card and return it in the enclosed postage-paid return
envelope or appoint your proxy by telephone or via the Internet as soon as possible, so that your shares may be represented at
the AAM special meeting. If you hold your shares through a bank, broker or other nominee, you should direct the vote of
your shares in accordance with the voting instructions received from your bank, broker or other nominee. 

If you are an AAM stockholder of record, if you sign and send in your proxy card and do not indicate how you want to vote,
the persons named in the proxy card will vote the shares represented by that proxy "FOR" each of the proposals to be voted
on at the AAM special meeting described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus, as recommended by the AAM board of
directors.

Table of Contents

Q17: What are the consequences of not voting or abstaining from voting at the AAM special meeting? 

A: Approval of the AAM share issuance requires the affirmative vote of holders of a majority in voting power of the shares of
AAM common stock present in person or represented by proxy at the AAM special meeting and entitled to vote on the AAM
share issuance. Abstentions will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the AAM share issuance, while shares not
present at the AAM special meeting (i.e., where there has been a failure to submit a proxy card or to vote in person, or a
failure to provide voting instructions to your bank, broker or other nominee) will have no effect on the vote to approve the
AAM share issuance. 

Approval of the AAM adjournment proposal requires the affirmative vote of holders of a majority in voting power of the
shares of AAM common stock present in person or represented by proxy at the AAM special meeting and entitled to vote on
such proposal. Abstentions will have the same effect as votes "AGAINST" this proposal, while shares not present at the AAM
special meeting will have no effect on the outcome of this proposal.

Q18: What do MPG stockholders need to do now? 

A: After carefully reading and considering the information contained, or incorporated by reference, in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus, please complete, sign and date your proxy card and return it in the enclosed postage-paid return
envelope or appoint your proxy by telephone or via the Internet as soon as possible, so that your shares may be represented at
the MPG special meeting. If you hold your shares through a bank, broker or other nominee, you should direct the vote of your
shares in accordance with the voting instructions received from your bank, broker or other nominee. 

If you are an MPG stockholder of record, if you sign and send in your proxy card and do not indicate how you want to vote,
the persons named in the proxy card will vote the shares represented by that proxy "FOR" each of the proposals to be voted
on at the MPG special meeting described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus, as recommended by the MPG board of
directors.

Q19: What are the consequences of not voting or abstaining from voting at the MPG special meeting? 

A: Approval of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement and approve the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement
requires the affirmative vote of the majority of the shares of MPG common stock that are outstanding as of the record date for
the MPG special meeting and entitled to vote thereon. Abstentions and shares not present at the MPG special meeting
(i.e., where there has been a failure to submit a proxy card or to vote in person, or a failure to provide voting instructions to
your bank, broker or other nominee) will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the proposal to adopt the merger
agreement and approve the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. 

Approval of each of the MPG merger-related compensation proposal and the MPG adjournment proposal requires the
affirmative vote of the majority of the shares of MPG common stock present in person or represented by proxy and voting on
such proposals at the MPG special meeting. Abstentions and shares not present at the MPG special meeting will have no
effect on the outcome of these proposals.

Q20: If my shares are held in "street name" by my bank, broker or other nominee, will my bank, broker or other nominee vote
my shares for me? 

A: Your bank, broker or other nominee will not vote your shares and your shares will not be present at a meeting unless you
provide instructions on how to vote. There will be no broker

non-votes because the only proposals to be voted on at the special meetings are "non-routine" under NYSE Rule 452. Shares
for which no instructions have been given will be treated as not present at the respective special meetings. You should follow
the directions and instructions provided by your bank, broker or other nominee regarding how to instruct your bank, broker or
other nominee to vote your shares.

Q21: What happens to MPG stock options and other equity-based awards at the effective time of the merger? 

A: Each unvested MPG stock option outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger will be accelerated in full
and become fully vested immediately prior to the effective time of the merger and, at the effective time of the merger, all
MPG stock options will be cancelled and the holders thereof will receive an amount in cash (without interest and subject to
applicable withholding of taxes) equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the aggregate number of shares of MPG
common stock that were issuable upon exercise of the MPG stock option immediately prior to the effective time of the
merger, by (y) the value of the merger consideration (with the AAM common stock issued in the merger valued based on the
closing price of a share of AAM common stock as of the trading day immediately preceding the closing date) less the per
share exercise price of the MPG stock option. If the exercise price payable upon exercise of an MPG stock option equals or
exceeds the value of the merger consideration (with the AAM common stock issued in the merger valued based on the closing
price of a share of AAM common stock as of the trading day immediately preceding the closing date), the MPG stock option
will be cancelled for no consideration. 

Each outstanding share of MPG common stock that is unvested or subject to a repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other
condition under an equity plan of MPG (which we refer to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as restricted MPG
common stock), immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, will be cancelled and terminated at the effective time
of the merger and the holder thereof will receive the per share merger consideration for such share of restricted MPG
common stock (subject to applicable withholding of taxes).

Each outstanding MPG restricted stock unit award under an MPG equity plan will become fully vested immediately prior to
the effective time of the merger and will be cancelled and terminated as of the effective time of the merger, and the holder of
the MPG restricted stock unit award will be paid the merger consideration multiplied by the number of shares of MPG
common stock subject to the MPG restricted stock unit award (subject to applicable withholding of taxes).

Q22: What happens if the non-binding advisory proposal to approve compensation that will or may be paid or become payable
by MPG to its named executive officers in connection with the merger is not approved? 

A: Approval, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, of compensation that will or may be paid or become payable by MPG to its
named executive officers in connection with the merger is not a condition to completion of the merger. The vote is an
advisory vote and is not binding. See "Interests of MPG Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger" for a description of
the compensation that may be paid or become payable to MPG's named executive officers in connection with the merger. 

Q23: What if I hold shares in both AAM and MPG? 

A: You will receive separate proxy or voting instruction cards for each company and must complete, sign and date each proxy or
voting instruction card and return each proxy or voting instruction

card in the appropriate postage-paid envelope or, if available, by submitting a proxy or voting instructions by telephone or via
the Internet for each company.

Q24: What happens if I sell my shares of AAM common stock before the AAM special meeting? 

A: The record date for the AAM special meeting is earlier than the date of the AAM special meeting and the date that the merger
is expected to be completed. If you transfer your shares of AAM common stock after the AAM record date, but before the
AAM special meeting, then, unless the transferee requests a proxy, you will retain your right to vote at the AAM special
meeting. 

Q25: What happens if I sell my shares of MPG common stock before the MPG special meeting? 

A: The record date for the MPG special meeting is earlier than the date of the MPG special meeting and the date that the merger
is expected to be completed. If you transfer your shares of MPG common stock after the MPG record date, but before the
MPG special meeting, then, unless the transferee requests a proxy, you will retain your right to vote at the MPG special
meeting but will have transferred any right to receive the merger consideration applicable to such shares if the merger is
completed. In order to receive the merger consideration applicable to your shares of MPG common stock as set out in the
merger agreement, you must hold your shares through the completion of the merger. 

Q26: What happens if I sell my shares of MPG common stock after the MPG special meeting, but before the completion of the
merger? 

A: If you transfer your shares of MPG common stock after the MPG special meeting, but before the completion of the merger,
you will have transferred any right to receive the merger consideration applicable to such shares if the merger is completed. In
order to receive the merger consideration for your shares of MPG common stock as set out in the merger agreement, you must
hold your shares through the completion of the merger. 

Q27: Do AAM stockholders have to vote on the AAM share issuance at the AAM special meeting if the AAM board of directors
has changed its recommendation to vote in favor of such proposal? 

A: Yes. Unless the merger agreement is terminated before the AAM special meeting (which MPG has the right to do in the event
the AAM board of directors changes its recommendation with respect to the AAM share issuance), AAM will notify AAM
stockholders before the AAM special meeting if the AAM board of directors has changed its recommendation that AAM
stockholders vote to approve the AAM share issuance. However, unless the merger agreement is terminated before the AAM
special meeting, AAM stockholders will be asked to vote on the AAM share issuance even if the AAM board of directors has
so changed its recommendation. Under certain circumstances specified in the merger agreement, the AAM board of directors
may terminate the merger agreement in addition to changing its recommendation, in which case the AAM special meeting
would not occur and the AAM stockholders would not have to vote on the AAM share issuance. You should read "The
Merger Agreement—Termination of the Merger Agreement" beginning on page 134 for a more complete discussion of the
rights of MPG and AAM to terminate the merger agreement.

Q28: Do MPG stockholders have to vote on the adoption of the merger agreement and the approval of the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement at the MPG special meeting if the MPG board of directors has changed its
recommendation to vote in favor of such proposal? 

A: Yes. Unless the merger agreement is terminated before the MPG special meeting (which AAM has the right to do in the event
that the MPG board of directors changes its recommendation that MPG stockholders vote to adopt the merger agreement and
approve the transactions contemplated thereby), MPG will notify MPG stockholders before the MPG special meeting if the
MPG board of directors has changed its recommendation that MPG stockholders vote to approve the adoption of the merger
agreement and approve the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. However, unless the merger agreement is
terminated before the MPG special meeting, MPG stockholders will be asked to vote on such adoption and approval even if
the MPG board of directors has so changed its recommendation. Under certain circumstances specified in the merger
agreement, the MPG board of directors may terminate the merger agreement in addition to changing its recommendation, in
which case the MPG special meeting would not occur and the MPG stockholders would not have to vote on the adoption of
the merger agreement and the approval of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. You should read "The
Merger Agreement—Termination of the Merger Agreement" beginning on page 134 for a more complete discussion of the
rights of MPG and AAM to terminate the merger agreement. 

Q29: If I am an AAM stockholder, can I revoke my proxy after I have mailed my signed proxy? 

A: Yes. You can revoke your proxy before your proxy is voted at the AAM special meeting, including in the event that the AAM
board of directors changes its recommendation. You can revoke your proxy in one of three ways: 

• you can send a written notice to AAM's Secretary stating that you would like to revoke your proxy; 

• you can complete and submit a new valid proxy bearing a later date by mail, telephone or via the Internet; or 

• you can attend the AAM special meeting and vote in person.

Attendance at the AAM special meeting will not, in and of itself, constitute revocation of a proxy; you must also vote by
ballot at the AAM special meeting to revoke a prior proxy.

If you are an AAM stockholder and you choose to send a written notice of revocation or to mail a new proxy, you must
submit your notice of revocation or your new proxy to American Axle & Manufacturing Holdings, Inc., Attention: Secretary,
One Dauch Drive, Detroit, Michigan 48211-1198, and it must be received at any time before the start of the AAM special
meeting. Any proxy that you submitted via the Internet or by telephone may be revoked by submitting a new proxy via the
Internet or by telephone, not later than 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on Tuesday, April 4, 2017, or by voting in person at the
meeting. If your shares are held in the name of a bank, broker or other nominee, you should contact your bank, broker or
other nominee to change your vote.

Q30: If I am an MPG stockholder, can I revoke my proxy after I have mailed my signed proxy?

A: Yes. You can revoke your proxy at any time before your proxy is voted at the MPG special meeting, including in the event
that the MPG board of directors changes its recommendation. You can revoke your proxy in one of three ways: 

• you can send a written notice to MPG's Secretary stating that you would like to revoke your proxy; 

• you can complete and submit a new valid proxy bearing a later date by telephone or via the Internet; or 

• you can attend the MPG special meeting and vote in person.

Attendance at the MPG special meeting will not, in and of itself, constitute revocation of a proxy; you must also vote by
ballot at the MPG special meeting to revoke a prior proxy.

If you are an MPG stockholder and you choose to send a written notice or to mail a new proxy, you must submit your notice
of revocation or your new proxy to Metaldyne Performance Group Inc., Attention: Secretary, One Towne Square, Suite 550,
Southfield, Michigan 48076, and it must be received at any time before the vote is taken at the MPG special meeting. Any
proxy that you submitted may also be revoked by submitting a new proxy via the Internet or by telephone, not later than
11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on Tuesday, April 4, 2017, or by voting in person at the meeting. If your shares are held in the name
of a bank, broker or other nominee, you should contact them to change your vote.

Q31: Where can I find the results of the AAM special meeting or the MPG special meeting? 

A: Each of AAM and MPG intends to announce preliminary voting results at the applicable special meeting and publish final
results through a Current Report on Form 8-K that each company will file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
(which we refer to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the SEC) within four business days of the applicable special
meeting. 

Q32: If I am an MPG stockholder and my shares are represented by physical stock certificates, should I send in my stock
certificates now? 

A: No. After the merger is completed, you will receive a transmittal form with instructions for the surrender of your MPG
common stock certificates. Please do not send in your stock certificates with your proxy card. 

Q33: Is the merger expected to be taxable to MPG stockholders? 

A: The receipt of the merger consideration in exchange for MPG common stock pursuant to the merger will be a taxable
transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes and may also be taxable under state, local and non-U.S. income and other tax
laws. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, if you held MPG common stock as a capital asset, you will generally recognize
capital gain or loss as a result of the merger measured by the difference, if any, between (1) the sum of (a) the amount of cash
you receive in the merger including amounts, if any, withheld from the merger consideration otherwise payable to you and
paid to taxing authorities by AAM or other applicable withholding agents and (b) the fair market value, at the effective time
of the merger, of the shares of AAM common stock you receive in the merger and (2) the adjusted tax basis in your shares of
MPG common stock immediately prior to the effective time of the merger. You should read "The Merger—Material U.S.
Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger" beginning on page 107 for a more detailed discussion of the material U.S.
federal income tax consequences of the merger.

Q34: When do you expect the merger to be completed? 

A: AAM and MPG are working to complete the merger as quickly as possible. Subject to obtaining the required approvals of our
stockholders described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus at our respective special meetings, and satisfaction of the
other conditions set out in the merger agreement, AAM and MPG currently expect that the merger will be completed during
the first half of 2017. However, it is possible that factors outside of our control could require us to complete the merger at a
later time or not complete it at all. Either party may terminate the merger agreement if the merger is not completed by
August 3, 2017, subject to an automatic 90 day extension under certain circumstances related to the receipt of certain required
regulatory approvals and absence of certain restraints, unless the failure of the party seeking to terminate the merger
agreement to have fulfilled any of its obligations under the merger agreement was the principal cause of, or resulted in, the
failure of the merger to have occurred by such date. For a description of certain matters that could delay or prevent the
completion of the merger, please refer to "Risk Factors" beginning on page 34. 

Q35: What are the conditions to the completion of the merger? 

A: In addition to the approval of the AAM share issuance by AAM stockholders and the adoption of the merger agreement and
the approval of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement by MPG stockholders, the completion of the merger is
subject to the satisfaction of a number of other conditions, including receipt of certain regulatory approvals. For additional
information on the regulatory approvals required to complete the merger, please see the section titled "The Merger—
Regulatory Matters" beginning on page 113. For further information on the conditions to the completion of the merger, please
see the section titled "The Merger Agreement—Conditions to the Completion of the Merger" beginning on page 126. 

Q36: Will I be paid dividends prior to the merger? 

A: MPG has historically paid quarterly cash dividends to its stockholders. Under the merger agreement, MPG may continue to
make its regular quarterly cash dividends consistent with past practice (including as to the record date, timing of payment and
amount thereof) in an aggregate amount per quarter not in excess of $0.0925 per share of MPG common stock. On
February 24, 2017, the MPG board of directors declared a dividend of $0.0925 per share of MPG common stock. The
dividend is payable on March 24, 2017 to holders of record of MPG common stock as of March 10, 2017. MPG expects to
make additional public announcements from time to time prior to the completion of the merger with respect to the declaration
and timing of the payment of dividends to its stockholders. 

AAM has not paid cash dividends to its stockholders since 2008 and does not intend to pay (and is prohibited under the
merger agreement from paying) dividends prior to the merger.

Q37: Can I seek appraisal of my shares of MPG common stock? 

A: Under Delaware law, holders of shares of MPG common stock who do not vote in favor of adoption of the merger agreement
are entitled to demand appraisal of their shares of MPG common stock in accordance with the applicable provisions of
Delaware law, and, if such rights are properly demanded, perfected and are not withdrawn or otherwise lost and the merger is
completed, such stockholders will receive a payment in cash of the judicially determined fair value of such stockholders'
shares of MPG common stock and will not be entitled to receive the merger consideration for their shares. To exercise such
rights, MPG stockholders must strictly follow the procedures prescribed by Delaware law. The failure to strictly follow such
procedures can result in the loss of such rights. These procedures are summarized under the section entitled

Merger Consideration to be Received by MPG Stockholders (page 106)

        At the effective time of the merger, each share of MPG common stock (other than MPG excluded shares) will be converted into
the right to receive (a) $13.50 in cash, without interest, and (b) 0.5 of a share of AAM common stock.

Treatment of MPG Stock Options and Other Equity-Based Awards (page 124)

        Each unvested MPG stock option outstanding under an equity plan of MPG will be accelerated in full and become fully vested
immediately prior to the effective time of the merger and, at the effective time of the merger, all MPG stock options will be cancelled
and the holders thereof will receive an amount in cash (without interest and subject to applicable withholding of taxes) equal to the
product of (x) the aggregate number of shares of MPG common stock that were issuable upon exercise of the MPG stock option
immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, and (y) the cash value of the merger consideration, less the per share exercise
price of each such MPG stock option. For purposes of the cash payment with respect to the MPG stock options, the stock
consideration is valued based on the closing price of a share of AAM common stock as of the trading day immediately preceding the
closing date of the merger. If the exercise price payable upon exercise of an MPG stock option equals or exceeds the value of the
merger consideration, the MPG stock option will be cancelled for no consideration.

        At the effective time of the merger, each outstanding share of restricted MPG common stock outstanding under an equity plan of
MPG will be cancelled and terminated, and each holder thereof will receive the merger consideration for each share of restricted
MPG common stock (subject to applicable withholding of taxes).

        Immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, each MPG restricted stock unit award outstanding under an equity plan of
MPG will become fully vested and will, at the effective time of the merger, be cancelled and terminated in return for an amount equal
to the merger consideration multiplied by the number of shares of MPG common stock subject to such cancelled MPG restricted
stock unit award (subject to applicable withholding of taxes).

AAM Board of Directors Following Completion of the Merger

        The merger agreement provides that AAM, prior to the effective time of the merger, will increase the number of members of the
AAM board of directors from 8 to 11 and appoint 3 individuals designated by American Securities (who we collectively refer to in
this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the AS designees) to serve as new directors, each as a member of a different class, on the
AAM board of directors (we refer to each AS designee, after being elected to the AAM board of directors, in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus as an AS director) as of the effective time of the merger. Other than such additional directors, no changes to the
AAM board of directors are expected in connection with the consummation of the merger. One AS director will also be appointed to
each of the committees of the AAM board of directors, subject to applicable requirements or qualifications under applicable law or
applicable stock exchange rules (including with respect to director independence).

        The AS designees to the AAM board of directors are current MPG directors George Thanopoulos, Kevin S. Penn and Loren S.
Easton.

Appraisal Rights (page 114)

        Under Delaware law, holders of shares of MPG common stock who do not vote in favor of adoption of the merger agreement are
entitled to demand appraisal of their shares of MPG common stock in accordance with the applicable provisions of Delaware law,
and, if such rights are properly demanded, perfected and are not withdrawn or otherwise lost and the merger is completed, those

stockholders will be entitled to obtain payment of the judicially determined fair value of such stockholders' shares of MPG common
stock and will not be entitled to receive the merger consideration. To exercise such rights, MPG stockholders must strictly follow the
procedures prescribed by Delaware law. The failure to strictly follow such procedures can result in the loss of such rights. It is
possible that the fair value of shares of MPG common stock as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery may be more or less
than, or the same as, the merger consideration.

Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger (page 107)

        The receipt of the merger consideration in exchange for MPG common stock pursuant to the merger will be a taxable transaction
for U.S. federal income tax purposes and may also be taxable under state, local and non-U.S. income and other tax laws. For U.S.
federal income tax purposes, if you held MPG common stock as a capital asset, you will generally recognize capital gain or loss as a
result of the merger measured by the difference, if any, between (1) the sum of (a) the amount of cash you receive in the merger
including amounts, if any, withheld from the merger consideration otherwise payable to you and paid to taxing authorities by AAM
or other applicable withholding agents and (b) the fair market value, at the effective time of the merger, of the shares of AAM
common stock you receive in the merger and (2) the adjusted tax basis in your shares of MPG common stock immediately prior to
the effective time of the merger. You should read "The Merger—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger"
beginning on page 107 for a more detailed discussion of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger. Tax
matters can be complicated, and the tax consequences of the merger to you will depend on your particular tax situation. We urge you
to consult your tax advisor to determine the tax consequences of the merger to you, including the effect of U.S. federal, state and
local and non-U.S. income and other tax laws.

Recommendation of the AAM Board of Directors (page 70)

        The AAM board of directors unanimously (i) determined that the merger is fair to, and in the best interests of, AAM and its
stockholders, (ii) approved the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the merger
and the AAM share issuance, and declared their advisability, and (iii) recommends that AAM stockholders vote "FOR" the AAM
share issuance and "FOR" the AAM adjournment proposal.

        To review the background of, and AAM's reasons for, the merger, as well as certain risks related to the merger, see "The Merger
—Background to the Merger" beginning on page 57, "The Merger—AAM's Reasons for the Merger and Recommendation of the AAM
Board of Directors" beginning on page 70 and "Risk Factors" beginning on page 34, respectively.

Recommendation of the MPG Board of Directors (page 74)

        The MPG board of directors unanimously (i) determined that entering into the merger agreement and consummating the
transactions contemplated thereby (including the merger) is fair to, and in the best interests of, MPG and its stockholders,
(ii) approved the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and declared the
merger agreement and the merger advisable, and (iii) recommends that MPG stockholders vote "FOR" the adoption of the merger

compensation proposal and "FOR" the MPG adjournment proposal.

AAM's financial advisor, delivered to the AAM board of directors an oral opinion on November 2, 2016, which was subsequently

consideration to be paid by AAM to holders of the shares of MPG common stock pursuant to the merger agreement. The full text of
Greenhill's written opinion dated November 2, 2016, which describes, among other things, the assumptions made, procedures
followed, matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken in connection with the opinion, is attached as Annex C to this

strategies that might be available to AAM or in which AAM might engage or as to the underlying business decision of AAM to
proceed with or effect the merger. Greenhill provided its opinion to the AAM board of directors for the benefit and use of the AAM
board of directors in connection with and for purposes of its evaluation of the merger consideration from a financial point of view
and Greenhill's opinion does not address any other aspect of the merger. The opinion is addressed to the AAM board of directors only
and does not constitute a recommendation to the AAM board of directors as to whether they should approve the merger or the merger
agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, nor does it constitute a recommendation as to whether AAM stockholders or
MPG stockholders should approve the merger or the AAM share issuance, as applicable, at any meeting of the stockholders of AAM
or MPG, as the case may be, convened in connection with the merger.

Interests of MPG Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger (page 100)

        In considering the recommendation of the MPG board of directors that MPG stockholders vote to adopt the merger agreement
and approve the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, you should be aware that certain of MPG's directors and
executive officers have interests in the merger that differ from, or are in addition to, the interests of MPG stockholders generally. The
MPG board of directors was aware of, and considered the interests of, MPG's directors and executive officers in approving the
merger agreement. These interests are summarized below and in more detail in the section entitled The Merger—Interests of MPG
Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger" beginning on page 100.

Indemnification

        The officers and directors of MPG will have the right to indemnification, exculpation from liabilities and advancement of
expenses for events occurring at or prior to the effective time of the merger by the surviving corporation following the merger. Those
officers and directors will also have coverage equivalent to that provided under MPG's directors' and officers' liability insurance
and/or fiduciary liability insurance policy in effect on the date of the merger agreement with respect to claims arising from facts or
events that occurred on or prior to the effective time of the merger for a period of 6 years following the effective time of the merger
(and until such later date as of which any action commenced during such 6-year period shall have been finally disposed of).

Employee Benefits Matters

Employment Agreements

        MPG maintains employment agreements with certain of its executive officers. If the applicable executive officer's employment
with MPG is terminated by MPG without "cause" or by such executive for "good reason," the executive will be entitled to severance
benefits as set forth in the executive's employment agreement. The employment agreements provide that these benefits will be
available whether or not the termination occurs in connection with a change in control of MPG.

Change in Control Severance Plan

        Certain of MPG's executive officers are eligible to participate in the MPG Change in Control Severance Plan, which was
adopted pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement and provides for the payment of severance to such officers in different tiers to
the extent such officers are not party to an employment or other agreement that provides for severance benefits. The merger will
constitute a "Change in Control" for purposes of eligibility for severance benefits under the MPG Change in Control Severance Plan.

Comparison of Stockholders' Rights (page 183)

        MPG stockholders, whose rights are currently governed by MPG's amended and restated certificate of incorporation and
amended and restated bylaws and Delaware law, will, upon the completion of the merger, become stockholders of AAM and their
rights will be governed by AAM's certificate of incorporation and second amended and restated by-laws and Delaware law.

        For a more complete description of the comparison of stockholders' rights, please see the section of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus entitled "Comparison of Stockholders' Rights" beginning on page 183.

Committee, in each case, effective as of the effective time of the merger.

Termination of the Merger Agreement; Payment of Termination Fees (pages 134 and 138)

        The merger agreement contains provisions addressing the circumstances under which AAM and/or MPG may terminate the
merger agreement. In certain circumstances, upon termination of the merger agreement, AAM will be required to pay a termination
fee to MPG ranging from $50,897,000 to $101,794,000, depending on the circumstances giving rise to the termination of the merger
agreement, and MPG will be required to pay to AAM a termination fee of $50,897,000. In addition, in the event the merger
agreement is terminated, in certain circumstances, either party may be required to reimburse the other party for its transaction-related
expenses, subject to a $15 million limit. The amount of any expenses paid by either AAM or MPG to the other party will be credited
against any termination fee to be paid by such party if the termination fee subsequently becomes payable.

Regulatory Matters (page 113)

        AAM, Merger Sub and MPG have agreed to use their respective reasonable best efforts to consummate and make effective the
merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including, among other things, using reasonable best efforts
to obtain (and cooperating with the other party to obtain) all regulatory approvals that may be or become necessary for the
consummation of the transactions.

        However, in no event will AAM or Merger Sub or their subsidiaries be obligated to take any action in connection with obtaining
any required regulatory approval that would require the divestiture of any assets of AAM or MPG or any of their subsidiaries, would
limit AAM's freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to retain, MPG and its subsidiaries or any portion thereof or any of
AAM's or its affiliates' other assets or businesses, or would, in AAM's reasonable judgment, be expected to have, either individually
or in the aggregate, a material adverse impact on any of AAM's businesses or the MPG businesses to be acquired in the merger,
except that, if necessary to obtain the regulatory consents or approvals discussed below, AAM will agree to the divestiture of the
assets or businesses or products or product lines of MPG and its subsidiaries that, individually or in the aggregate, generated total
worldwide revenues of up to $150,000,000 in the twelve month period ended September 30, 2016.

        Under the HSR Act and the rules promulgated thereunder by the Federal Trade Commission (which we refer to in this joint
proxy statement/prospectus as the FTC), the merger may not be completed until notification and report forms have been filed by
AAM and MPG with the FTC and the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (which we refer to in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus as the DOJ) and the applicable waiting period has expired or been terminated. AAM and MPG filed their
respective notification and report forms under the HSR Act with the FTC and the DOJ on November 18, 2016. To provide the FTC
additional time to review the proposed transaction, AAM withdrew its HSR filing effective December 19, 2016 and refiled it on
December 21, 2016. On January 20, 2017, at 11:59 p.m. Eastern Standard Time, the HSR Act waiting period expired.

        The merger is also subject to antitrust review by governmental authorities in several foreign jurisdictions in which the
companies have a sufficient market presence to require filings. As of the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, the parties
have made filings in Austria, Germany, Mexico and South Korea. On December 22, 2016, the merger was granted early clearance in
Germany. On January 10, 2017, the merger was cleared in Austria. On January 26, 2017, the merger was granted approval in
South Korea. On February 16, 2017, the parties refiled their application with respect to the merger with the Federal Economic
Competition Commission of Mexico (which we refer to in this joint

proxy statement/prospectus as COFECE) to include additional information requested by COFECE. Approval by COFECE is the only
remaining required governmental approval.

No Solicitation (page 129)

        The merger agreement contains restrictions on each of MPG's and AAM's ability to solicit or engage in discussions or
negotiations with a third party regarding certain alternative transactions involving each company and/or their respective subsidiaries.
Notwithstanding these restrictions, under certain circumstances and subject to certain conditions, prior to the receipt of their
respective stockholder approvals, each of MPG and AAM may respond to, and engage in discussions and negotiations with respect
to, an unsolicited acquisition proposal. In addition, at any time prior to the receipt of their respective stockholder approvals and
subject to certain conditions, in response to an unsolicited written acquisition proposal that the party's board of directors determines
provides for a superior proposal, the board of directors of such party may change its recommendation that its stockholders vote to
adopt the merger agreement and approve the transactions contemplated thereby, in the case of MPG, or approve the AAM share
issuance, in the case of AAM, approve an alternative transaction and/or terminate the merger agreement if such party's board of
directors determines that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law.

Accounting Treatment (page 179)

        The merger will be accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting with AAM as the acquiror.

Timing of the Transaction

        The merger is currently expected to be completed during the first half of 2017. However, it is possible that factors outside of
each company's control could require them to complete the merger at a later time or not to complete the merger at all.

The Voting Agreement 

        Contemporaneously with entering into the merger agreement, AAM entered into the voting agreement with the AS stockholder
with respect to all shares of MPG common stock owned by the AS stockholder, which constituted approximately 77% of the issued
and outstanding shares of MPG common stock as of the date of the voting agreement. Under the voting agreement, the AS
stockholder has agreed to, among other things and subject to the terms and conditions of the voting agreement, vote shares of MPG
common stock owned by the AS stockholder constituting approximately 38% of the issued and outstanding shares of MPG common
stock as of the date of the voting agreement in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement and the approval of the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement, and vote all other shares of MPG common stock owned by the AS stockholder in the same
proportion as the manner in which the shares of MPG common stock not owned by the AS stockholder are voted. For a more
complete description of the voting agreement, see "The Voting Agreement" beginning on page 155.

The Stockholders' Agreement 

        AAM, the AS stockholder and, for certain limited purposes, American Securities will enter into a stockholders' agreement
(which we refer to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the stockholders' agreement) in connection with, and as a condition to,
the consummation of the merger, effective as of the effective time of the merger. The stockholders' agreement will contain, among
other things, certain voting obligations and transfer and standstill restrictions with respect to the shares of AAM common stock
owned following the effective time of the merger by the AS stockholder and any other controlled affiliate of American Securities to
whom shares of AAM common stock are transferred. The stockholders' agreement will also grant certain director nomination rights,
registration rights and preemptive rights to the AS stockholder. For a more complete description of the stockholders' agreement, see
"Stockholders' Agreement" beginning on page 158.

Selected Historical Consolidated Financial Data of MPG 

        The selected historical consolidated financial data of MPG for each of the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 and
as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 has been derived from MPG's audited consolidated financial statements included in MPG's
Current Report on Form 8-K, filed with the SEC on March 2, 2017, which is incorporated by reference herein. The selected historical
consolidated financial data of MPG presented for each of the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 and as of December 31,
2014, 2013 and 2012 has been derived from MPG's consolidated financial statements not incorporated by reference herein. The
results for any historical period are not necessarily indicative of future results of MPG or the combined company following
completion of the merger.

        MPG was formed through the combination of ASP HHI Holdings, Inc. (which, together with its subsidiaries, we refer to in this
joint proxy statement/prospectus as HHI), ASP MD Holdings, Inc. (which, together with its subsidiaries, we refer to in this joint
proxy statement/prospectus as Metaldyne), and ASP Grede Intermediate Holdings LLC (which, together with its subsidiaries, we
refer to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as Grede) on August 4, 2014 (which we refer to in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus as the combination). Each of the three operating groups was owned primarily by certain private equity funds
affiliated with American Securities. American Securities acquired its interest in HHI in October 2012, Metaldyne in December 2012,
and Grede in June 2014. Each of these acquisitions was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting, with the respective
purchase price allocated to the identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquired entity, with any excess purchase price recorded as
goodwill. Effective December 12, 2014, MPG completed an initial public offering of its common stock.

        HHI is presented as the predecessor to MPG for financial reporting purposes. We refer to the period prior to October 6, 2012 as
the predecessor period in this joint proxy statement/prospectus and we refer to the period from October 6, 2012 to December 31,
2016 as the successor period in this joint proxy statement/prospectus. The combination was accounted for as a reorganization of
entities under common control in a manner similar to a pooling of interests, and, as such, the bases of accounting of HHI, Metaldyne
and Grede were carried over to MPG. The selected historical consolidated financial statement data reflects the retrospective
application of MPG's capital structure and consolidated presentation of the combination for the successor period.

        As a result of the above transactions, the selected historical consolidated financial data includes:

• the results of HHI for the five years ended December 31, 2016; 

• the results of Metaldyne from December 18, 2012 through December 31, 2012 and for the years ended December 31,
2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016; and 

• the results of Grede from June 2, 2014 through December 31, 2014 and for the years ended December 31, 2015 and
2016.

        This financial data should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes incorporated by
reference in this joint proxy statement/prospectus, as well as other information that has been filed by MPG with the SEC. See "Where
You Can Find More Information" beginning on page 196 for more information on where you can obtain copies of this information.

Financing 

        The obligations of AAM and Merger Sub under the merger agreement are not subject to any conditions regarding their ability to
finance, or obtain financing for, the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, and they are obligated under the merger
agreement to have sufficient funds available to satisfy their obligations under the merger agreement. AAM has obtained
commitments for financing (i) to pay (A) the cash consideration payable in connection with the merger and (B) related fees and
expenses, (ii) to refinance any indebtedness outstanding under the existing AAM senior secured revolving credit facility and certain
existing indebtedness of MPG and (iii) for general corporate purposes.

        AAM's financing commitments consist of amounts up to the following:

• $100 million in commitments for a senior secured term loan A facility; 

• $1.55 billion in commitments for a senior secured term loan B facility; 

• $800 million in commitments for a senior secured revolving credit facility; and 

• $1.2 billion in commitments for a senior unsecured bridge facility, to be provided if, prior to the completion date of
the merger, AAM has not received gross proceeds of at least $1.2 billion in new senior unsecured notes.

        Under the documentation for the financing commitments, AAM has the option to reduce those commitments by up to
$400 million.

        AAM intends to enter into definitive documentation for the financing on or prior to the completion of the merger.

        For more information, see "Financing Relating to the Merger" beginning on page 121.

RISK FACTORS 

        In addition to the other information included and incorporated by reference in this joint proxy statement/prospectus, AAM stockholders
and MPG stockholders should consider carefully the matters described below in determining whether to approve the AAM share issuance
or to adopt the merger agreement and approve the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, as applicable, and the other related
matters described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

Risks Related to the Merger 

         We cannot provide any assurance that the merger will be completed.

        The completion of the merger is subject to customary closing conditions described in the merger agreement, including, among others,
(i) adoption by MPG stockholders of the merger agreement and approval of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement,
(ii) approval by AAM stockholders of the AAM share issuance, (iii) obtaining antitrust and other regulatory approvals in the United States
and certain other jurisdictions and (iv) the absence of any event, circumstance, change, condition, occurrence or effect that, individually or
in the aggregate, has or would reasonably be expected to have, a material adverse effect on MPG's or AAM's business. See "The Merger
Agreement—Conditions to the Completion of the Merger" beginning on page 126.

        Although each of MPG and AAM has agreed in the merger agreement to use its reasonable best efforts to consummate and make
effective the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, these and other conditions to the merger may not be
satisfied. In addition, satisfying the conditions to the merger may take longer than, and could cost more than, AAM and MPG expect. Any
delay in completing the merger may adversely affect the benefits that AAM and MPG expect to achieve from the merger and the integration
of their businesses.

         The exchange ratio is fixed and will not be adjusted for changes affecting the market price of either shares of AAM common stock
or shares of MPG common stock. Because the market value of shares of AAM common stock may fluctuate, MPG stockholders cannot
be sure of the market value of the stock consideration they will receive in the merger.

        The stock consideration that MPG stockholders will receive is a fixed number of shares of AAM common stock; it is not a number of
shares with a particular fixed market value. See "The Merger—Merger Consideration" beginning on page 106. The market value of shares
of AAM common stock and MPG common stock at the effective time of the merger may vary significantly from their respective values on
the date the merger agreement was executed or at other later dates, including the date on which MPG stockholders vote on the adoption of
the merger agreement and the approval of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and the date on which AAM stockholders
vote on the approval of the AAM share issuance proposal. Because the exchange ratio relating to the stock consideration will not be
adjusted to reflect any changes in the market value of shares of AAM common stock or MPG common stock, the market value of the shares
of AAM common stock issued in connection with the merger and the MPG common stock converted in connection with the merger may be
higher or lower than the values of those shares on earlier dates. Stock price changes may result from a variety of factors, including changes
in the business, operations or prospects of AAM or MPG, regulatory considerations, and general business, market, industry or economic
conditions.

        Neither AAM nor MPG is permitted to terminate the merger agreement solely because of changes in the market price of either party's
respective common stock.

        However, in certain other circumstances, each of the AAM board of directors and the MPG board of directors may withdraw its
recommendation to their respective stockholders that they approve the AAM share issuance or adopt the merger agreement and approve the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, as applicable, if such board of directors determines in good faith (after consultation

with its outside legal counsel) that the failure to make a change in recommendation would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable law. See "The Merger Agreement—No Solicitation—Board Recommendation Change" beginning on page 132.

         The merger is subject to the receipt of consents and approvals from regulatory authorities that may impose conditions that could
have an adverse effect on AAM, MPG or the combined company following the merger or, if not obtained, could prevent the completion
of the merger.

        Before the merger may be completed, applicable waiting periods must expire or terminate under antitrust and competition laws and
clearances or approvals must be obtained from various regulatory authorities. In deciding whether to grant antitrust or regulatory clearances
or approvals, the relevant governmental entities will consider the effect of the merger on competition within their relevant jurisdiction. The
terms and conditions of the clearances or approvals that are granted may impose requirements, limitations or costs or place restrictions on
the conduct of the combined company's business. Despite the parties' commitments to use their reasonable best efforts to comply with
conditions imposed by regulatory entities, under the terms of the merger agreement, AAM is not be required to take actions that would
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse impact on the business of AAM or MPG as the surviving corporation after the merger,
except that, if necessary to obtain the required regulatory consents or approvals, AAM will agree to the divestiture of the assets or
businesses or products or product lines of MPG that, individually or in the aggregate, generated total worldwide revenues of up to
$150,000,000 in the twelve month period ended September 30, 2016. See "The Merger Agreement—Additional Terms—Reasonable Best
Efforts" beginning on page 147. There can be no assurance that regulatory authorities will not impose conditions, terms, obligations or
restrictions and that such conditions, terms, obligations or restrictions will not have the effect of delaying the completion of the merger,
imposing additional material costs on or materially limiting the revenues of the combined company following the merger or otherwise
reduce the anticipated benefits of the merger if the merger were consummated successfully within the expected timeframe. In addition,
neither AAM nor MPG can provide assurance that any such conditions, terms, obligations or restrictions will not result in the delay or
abandonment of the merger. Additionally, the completion of the merger is conditioned on the absence of certain restraining orders or
injunctions by judgment, court order or law that would prohibit the completion of the merger. For a more detailed description of the
regulatory review process, please see the section titled "The Merger—Regulatory Matters" beginning on page 113.

         AAM's inability to satisfy and comply with conditions under its existing financing arrangements or raise additional or replacement
financing could delay or prevent the completion of the merger.

        The obligations of AAM and Merger Sub under the merger agreement are not subject to any conditions regarding their ability to
finance, or obtain financing for, the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, and they are obligated under the merger agreement
to have sufficient funds available to satisfy their obligations under the merger agreement. If AAM is unable to satisfy the conditions
required under its financing commitments or any definitive financing documentation, AAM may not have available the funds necessary to
fund the cash portion of the merger consideration. In addition, one or more financing sources under the financing commitments may default
on its obligation to provide the financing and the commitments of any such defaulting financing source may not be replaced on a timely
basis. Any such failure to have available the necessary funds to fund the cash portion of the merger consideration could delay or prevent the
completion of the merger. See "The Merger Agreement—Financing" beginning on page 150.

         AAM and MPG will incur transaction and integration costs in connection with the merger.

        AAM and MPG expect that they will incur significant, non-recurring costs in connection with consummating the merger. In addition,
AAM will incur integration and restructuring costs following the completion of the merger as AAM integrates the businesses of the two
companies. There can be no

Table of Contents

assurances that the expected benefits and efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses will be realized to offset these transaction,
integration and restructuring costs over time. AAM and MPG may also incur additional costs to maintain employee morale and to retain key
employees. AAM will also incur significant fees and expenses relating to the financing arrangements in connection with the merger. AAM
and MPG will also incur significant legal, financial advisor, accounting, banking and consulting fees, fees relating to regulatory filings and
notices, SEC filing fees, printing and mailing fees and other costs associated with the merger. Some of these costs are payable regardless of
whether the merger is completed. See "The Merger Agreement—Payment of Certain Fees and Expenses" beginning on page 138.

         The merger agreement restricts AAM's and MPG's conduct of business prior to the completion of the merger and limits both
parties' ability to pursue an alternative acquisition proposal to the merger.

        Under the merger agreement, AAM and MPG are subject to certain restrictions on the conduct of their respective businesses prior to
completing the merger, which restrictions may adversely affect AAM's and MPG's ability to exercise certain of their respective business
strategies. See "The Merger Agreement—Conduct of Business Pending the Merger" beginning on page 140. These restrictions may prevent
AAM and MPG from pursuing otherwise attractive business opportunities and making other changes to their respective businesses prior to
the completion of the merger or termination of the merger agreement.

        In addition, the merger agreement prohibits AAM and MPG from (A) soliciting, initiating, facilitating or encouraging any inquiry,
proposal or offer relating to alternative business combination transactions, or (B) engaging in discussions or negotiations regarding, or
providing any nonpublic information in connection with, proposals relating to alternative business combination transactions, in each case,
subject to certain exceptions set forth in the merger agreement. See "The Merger Agreement—No Solicitation" beginning on page 129. In
certain circumstances, upon termination of the merger agreement, AAM will be required to pay a termination fee to MPG ranging from
$50,897,000 to $101,794,000, depending on the circumstances giving rise to the right to terminate the merger agreement, or MPG will be
required to pay a termination fee of $50,897,000 to AAM, and each party will be required to reimburse the other party for its transaction-
related expenses, subject to a $15 million limit (provided that the amount of any expenses paid by either AAM or MPG to the other party
will be credited against any termination fee to be paid by such party if the termination fee subsequently becomes payable). See "The Merger
Agreement—Payment of Certain Fees and Expenses" beginning on page 138. These provisions may limit AAM's and MPG's respective
ability to pursue offers from third parties that could result in greater value to their respective stockholders than the value resulting from the
merger. The termination fee may also discourage third parties from pursuing an alternative acquisition proposal with respect to AAM or
MPG, or might result in third parties proposing to pay a lower value per share to acquire MPG or AAM than it might otherwise have been
willing to pay.

         While the merger is pending, AAM and MPG will be subject to business uncertainties that could adversely affect their businesses.

        Uncertainty about the effect of the merger on employees, customers and suppliers may have an adverse effect on AAM and MPG.
These uncertainties may impair AAM's and MPG's ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the merger is consummated and
for a period of time thereafter, and could cause both parties' respective customers, suppliers and other business partners to delay or defer
certain business decisions or to seek to change existing business relationships with AAM or MPG. Employee retention may be particularly
challenging during the pendency of the merger because employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined
company. If, despite AAM's and MPG's retention efforts, key employees depart because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of
integration or a desire not to remain with the companies as combined, AAM's and

Table of Contents

MPG's businesses could be seriously harmed. Any delay in completing the merger may further increase such uncertainties and the adverse
effects related thereto.

         If the merger is not completed by a certain outside date, either AAM or MPG may choose not to proceed with the merger.

        Either AAM or MPG may terminate the merger agreement if the merger has not been completed by August 3, 2017 (which date will be
extended automatically for an additional 90 days if the delay is the result of a failure to obtain any required regulatory approval) unless the
failure of the party seeking to terminate the merger agreement to have fulfilled any of its obligations under the merger agreement was the
principal cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the merger to have occurred by such date. See "The Merger Agreement—Termination of the
Merger Agreement" beginning on page 134.

         Failure to complete the merger could materially and adversely impact the financial conditions, results of operations or stock prices
of AAM and MPG.

        As described above, the conditions to the completion of the merger may not be satisfied. If the merger is not completed for any reason,
AAM and MPG will be subject to several risks, including the following:

• being required to pay a termination fee ranging from $50,897,000 to $101,794,000, in the case of AAM, and of $50,897,000
in the case of MPG, under certain circumstances provided in the merger agreement (see "The Merger Agreement—Payment
of Certain Fees and Expenses" beginning on page 138); 

• being required to reimburse the other party for certain fees and expenses relating to the merger, such as legal, financial
advisor, accounting, banking, consulting and printing fees and expenses up to $15 million under certain circumstances
provided in the merger agreement (provided that the amount of any expenses paid by either AAM or MPG to the other party
will be credited against any termination fee to be paid by such party if the termination fee subsequently becomes payable)
(see "The Merger Agreement—Payment of Certain Fees and Expenses" beginning on page 138); 

• having had the focus of their respective management diverted from day-to-day operations and other opportunities that could
have been beneficial to AAM or MPG; 

• the market prices of shares of AAM common stock and shares of MPG common stock might decline to the extent that the
current market prices reflect a market assumption that the merger will be completed; 

• customers and suppliers may seek to modify their respective relationships with AAM or MPG and both companies' ability to
attract new employees and retain existing employees may be harmed by the failure to complete the merger; 

• being subject to potential litigations related to a failure to complete the merger or to enforce their respective obligations
under the merger agreement; and 

• if AAM or MPG seeks out another merger or business combination following termination of the merger agreement, it may
not be able to negotiate a transaction with another party on terms comparable to, or better than, the terms of the merger
agreement.

        Any such events could have a material adverse impact on AAM's or MPG's financial condition, results of operations or stock price.

         The directors and executive officers of MPG may have certain interests in the merger that may be different from, or in addition to,
the interests of MPG stockholders.

        In considering the information in this joint proxy statement/prospectus, you should be aware that certain of the directors and executive
officers of MPG may have certain interests in the merger that differ from, or are in addition to, the interests of MPG stockholders. These
interests include, but are not limited to, continued employment of certain executive officers of MPG with the combined company, the
continued service of certain directors and/or executive officers of MPG as directors of AAM, the treatment in the merger of outstanding
MPG stock options, restricted MPG common stock and MPG restricted stock unit awards, severance agreements and the adoption by MPG
of the Change in Control MPG Severance Plan, and the indemnification of former MPG directors and executive officers by MPG as the
surviving corporation in the merger.

        In addition, current MPG directors George Thanopoulos, Kevin S. Penn and Loren S. Easton have been designated to serve on the
AAM board of directors as the AS designees, effective as of the effective time of the merger. The MPG board of directors was aware of
these interests at the time it approved the merger agreement. These interests may cause MPG's directors and executive officers to view the
proposal regarding the merger agreement differently and more favorably than you may view it. See "The Merger—Interests of MPG
Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger" beginning on page 100.

         Completion of the merger may trigger change in control or other provisions in certain agreements to which MPG is a party.

        The completion of the merger may trigger change in control or other provisions in certain agreements to which MPG is a party. If
AAM and MPG are unable to negotiate waivers of those provisions, the counterparties may exercise their rights and remedies under the
agreements, potentially terminating the agreements or seeking monetary damages. Even if AAM and MPG are able to negotiate waivers, the
counterparties may require a fee for such waivers or seek to renegotiate the agreements on terms that may be less favorable to MPG or the
combined company.

         A lawsuit has been filed against MPG and members of the MPG board of directors challenging the disclosures concerning the
merger, and additional lawsuits may be filed; an adverse ruling in any of such lawsuits may prevent the merger from becoming effective
within the expected timeframe.

        MPG and members of the MPG board of directors are named as defendants in a purported class action lawsuit brought by and on
behalf of MPG stockholders challenging the disclosures concerning the merger, seeking, among other things, to enjoin the stockholder vote
on the merger at the MPG special meeting. See "Certain Litigation" on page 120. If the plaintiffs are successful in obtaining an injunction,
then such injunction may prevent the merger from becoming effective within the expected timeframe. If the completion of the merger is
delayed, it could result in substantial costs to AAM and MPG. In addition, AAM and MPG could incur significant costs in connection with
the lawsuit, including costs associated with the indemnification of MPG's directors and officers. MPG and the members of the MPG board
of directors believe that the claims asserted in this lawsuit are without merit.

Risks Related to the Combined Company 

         The market price of shares of AAM common stock after the merger may be affected by factors different from those currently
affecting the prices of shares of AAM common stock and shares of MPG common stock.

        The businesses of AAM and MPG differ in many respects. As such, many of the factors affecting AAM's results of operations and
stock price are different from those affecting MPG's results of operations and stock price. Additionally, AAM's results of operations and the
market price of shares of AAM common stock after the merger may be affected by factors different from those currently

affecting the independent results of operations and stock prices of each of AAM's and MPG's common stock prior to the merger. For a
discussion of AAM's and MPG's businesses and operations and the risks associated therewith, see the sections entitled "Risk Factors" and
"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in the documents incorporated by reference in
this joint proxy statement/prospectus and referred to under "Where You Can Find More Information" beginning on page 196.

         The issuance of shares of AAM common stock in connection with the merger could decrease the market price of shares of AAM
common stock.

        In connection with the merger and as part of the merger consideration, AAM will issue shares of AAM common stock to MPG
stockholders. The issuance of shares of AAM common stock in the merger may result in fluctuations in the market price of shares of AAM
common stock, including a share price decrease.

         AAM will incur substantial additional indebtedness in connection with financing the merger.

        The indebtedness of AAM and MPG as of December 31, 2016 was approximately $1,404.2 million and $1,846.1 million (inclusive of
capitalized lease obligations), respectively. If the merger had been completed on December 31, 2016, AAM would have had
$4,187.0 million of indebtedness on a pro forma combined basis. See "Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements"
beginning on page 165. As a result, following the merger, AAM, on a combined basis, will have substantial additional indebtedness and
related debt service obligations. This additional indebtedness and related debt service obligations could have important consequences,
including:

• reducing flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in AAM's businesses, the competitive environment and the
industries in which it operates, and to technological and other changes; 

• lowering credit ratings; 

• reducing access to capital and increasing borrowing costs generally or for any additional indebtedness to finance future
operating and capital expenses and for general corporate purposes; 

• reducing funds available for operations, capital expenditures and other activities; and 

• creating competitive disadvantages relative to other companies with lower debt levels.

         If the merger is completed, the combined company may not be able to successfully integrate the businesses of MPG and AAM and
therefore may not be able to realize the anticipated benefits of the merger.

        As a result of the merger, AAM and MPG expect to realize certain operational synergies. Realization of the synergies and the other
anticipated benefits in the merger will depend, in part, on the combined company's ability to successfully integrate the businesses and
operations of AAM and MPG. The management of the combined company will be required to devote significant attention and resources to
integrating the business, operations and support functions of AAM and MPG, including the IT networks and systems of MPG with AAM's.
Management may encounter unforeseen difficulties in that integration and the combined company may not realize the anticipated benefits
of the merger on a timely basis or at all. Any such difficulties, including in connection with the security and integration of IT systems, could
require additional management attention and divert attention from management's day-to-day operation of the business of the combined
company. The diversion of management's attention and any delays or difficulties encountered in connection with the merger and the
integration of the two companies' operations could have an adverse effect on the business, financial results or financial condition of the
combined company or the stock price of AAM following the merger. The success of the combined company after the completion of the
merger will also depend in part upon the ability of AAM and MPG to retain key employees of both companies during the periods

before and after the merger is completed. The integration process may also result in additional and unforeseen expenses. There can be no
assurance that the contemplated benefits anticipated from the merger will be realized. If the combined company is not successfully
integrated, the anticipated benefits of the merger may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected. There can be
no assurances that the expected benefits and efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses will be realized to offset the integration
and restructuring costs over time.

         The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements included in this joint proxy statement/prospectus may not be
indicative of what the combined company's actual financial position or results of operations would have been.

        The unaudited pro forma financial information in this joint proxy statement/prospectus is illustrative and is for informational purposes
only. The results of operations and financial positions reflected therein are not necessarily indicative of what the combined company's actual
financial position or results of operations would have been had the merger been completed on the date(s) indicated. The preparation of the
pro forma financial information is based upon available information and certain assumptions and estimates that AAM and MPG currently
believe are reasonable. The results and balances reflected therein are not intended to be a projection of future results or balances, which may
vary materially from the results reflected because of various factors, including those discussed in this "Risk Factors" section. The unaudited
pro forma financial information reflects adjustments, which are based upon preliminary estimates, to allocate the purchase price to MPG's
net assets. The purchase price allocation reflected in this joint proxy statement/prospectus is preliminary, and the final allocation of the
purchase price will be based upon the actual purchase price and the fair value of the assets and liabilities of MPG as of the date of the
completion of the merger. In addition, subsequent to the completion of the merger, there may be further refinements of the purchase price
allocation as additional information becomes available. Accordingly, the final purchase accounting adjustments may differ materially from
the pro forma adjustments reflected in this joint proxy statement/prospectus. See "Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial
Statements" beginning on page 165.

         AAM stockholders will have a reduced ownership and voting interest in AAM after the merger and will exercise less influence over
the board of directors, management and policies of AAM.

        AAM stockholders currently have the right to vote in the election of the AAM board of directors and on other matters affecting AAM.
Since new shares of AAM common stock will be issued to MPG stockholders in connection with the completion of the merger, each AAM
stockholder's percentage ownership of AAM will be smaller than such stockholder's percentage ownership of AAM prior to the merger.
After the merger, based on the outstanding shares of AAM common stock and outstanding shares of MPG common stock as of the close of
business on Friday, February 24, 2017, the current stockholders of AAM, as a group, will own shares constituting approximately 69% of
shares of AAM common stock expected to be outstanding immediately after the merger. Because of this, current AAM stockholders, as a
group, may have less influence on the board of directors, management and policies of AAM than they now have on the board of directors,
management and policies of AAM.

         MPG stockholders will have an ownership and voting interest in AAM after the merger that is smaller than their current
ownership and voting interest in MPG and will exercise less influence over the board of directors, management and policies of AAM
than they did over the board of directors, management and policies of MPG.

        MPG stockholders currently have the right to vote in the election of the MPG board of directors and on other matters affecting MPG.
Since new shares of AAM common stock will be issued to MPG stockholders in connection with the completion of the merger, each MPG
stockholder will become a stockholder of AAM with a percentage ownership of AAM that is smaller than such stockholder's percentage
ownership of MPG. Based on the number of outstanding shares of MPG common stock and

outstanding shares of AAM common stock as of the close of business on Friday, February 24, 2017, the stockholders of MPG, as a group,
will receive shares in the merger constituting approximately 31% of shares of AAM common stock expected to be outstanding immediately
after the merger. Because of this, current MPG stockholders, as a group, will have less influence on the board of directors, management and
policies of AAM (as the combined company following the merger) than they now have on the board of directors, management and policies
of MPG.

         The merger will result in changes to the AAM board of directors that may affect the strategy and operations of the combined
company as compared to that of AAM and MPG as they currently exist.

        If the merger is completed, the composition of the AAM board of directors will change. Upon completion of the merger, the board of
directors of the combined company will consist of eleven members, including three new members designated by American Securities. There
can be no assurance that the newly constituted board of directors of the combined company will function effectively as a team and that there
will not be any adverse effect on the combined company's business as a result.

         The obligations and liabilities of MPG, some of which may be unanticipated or unknown, may be greater than anticipated, which
may diminish the value of AAM's shares.

        MPG's obligations and liabilities, some of which may be unanticipated or unknown, may be greater than anticipated or reflected or
reserved for in MPG's historical financial statements. The obligations and liabilities of MPG could have a material adverse effect on AAM's
business, reputation, financial condition, or results of operations following the merger. AAM stockholders will not be entitled to
indemnification from MPG under the merger agreement with respect to obligations or liabilities of MPG, whether known or unknown. Any
such liabilities could substantially reduce AAM's earnings and cash flows or otherwise materially and adversely affect its business, financial
condition, or results of operations following the merger.

        MPG's subsidiary, Grede Wisconsin Subsidiaries LLC (which we refer to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as Grede Wisconsin),
is currently under investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice and the Environmental Protection Agency for alleged Clean Air Act
violations and alleged obstruction of justice relating to the January 2012 removal of debris from the roof of a heat treat oven that was
purported to contain asbestos at Grede Wisconsin's now closed facility in Berlin, Wisconsin. The United States Attorney, Eastern District of
Wisconsin, indicated to the MPG attorneys handling this matter that the government intends to imminently seek an indictment relating to
this matter. If an indictment is brought, MPG intends to defend against this matter.

         The merger may result in a loss of customers, clients, suppliers and strategic alliances.

        Some of the customers, clients, suppliers, potential customers or clients or strategic partners of AAM or MPG may terminate their
business relationship with AAM or MPG following the merger. Potential clients, suppliers, or strategic partners may delay entering into, or
decide not to enter into, a business relationship with AAM or MPG because of the merger. Further, certain of MPG's existing customer
contracts may require the purchaser's consent to the change of control of MPG, and there can be no assurance that such consent will be
forthcoming. If customer, supplier or client relationships or strategic alliances are adversely affected by the merger, AAM's business and
financial performance following the merger could suffer.

Additional Risks Relating to AAM and MPG after the Merger 

        AAM's and MPG's businesses are, and will continue to be, subject to the risks described in (i) Part I, Item 1A in AAM's Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 and (ii) Part I, Item 1A in MPG's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal
year ended December 31, 2015, in each case, as such risks may be updated or supplemented in MPG's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 and in each company's subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q or Current Reports on Form 8-K,
all of which are filed with the SEC and incorporated by reference in this joint proxy statement/prospectus. See "Where You Can Find More
Information" beginning on page 196.

SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

        This joint proxy statement/prospectus contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities

flow generation, costs and cost synergies, portfolio diversification, economic trends, outlook and all other information relating to matters

otherwise affect the completion of the proposed transaction on the anticipated terms and timing, including the risk that
MPG's stockholders may not approve the merger or that AAM's stockholders may not approve the AAM share issuance
proposal, that the necessary regulatory approvals may not be obtained or may be obtained subject to conditions that are not

European Union, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and other non-governmental organization
pronouncements and the change in the presidential administration in the United States) and the potential incurrence of
significant costs, liabilities and obligations in connection therewith; 

• volatility in the global economy impacting demand for new vehicles and automotive products; 

• a decline in vehicle production levels, particularly with respect to platforms for which AAM or MPG is a significant
supplier, or the financial distress of any of AAM's or MPG's major customers;

THE AAM SPECIAL MEETING 

        AAM is providing this joint proxy statement/prospectus to AAM stockholders as of the close of business on Friday, February 24, 2017,
the AAM record date, in connection with the solicitation of proxies from those stockholders by the AAM board of directors for use at the
AAM special meeting or at any adjournment or postponement thereof, for the purposes set forth in the accompanying notice of the AAM
special meeting.

Date, Time and Place 

        The AAM special meeting will be held on Wednesday, April 5, 2017, at 8:00 a.m., local time, at AAM World Headquarters
Auditorium, One Dauch Drive, Detroit, Michigan 48211, unless adjourned or postponed.

Purpose of the Special Meeting 

        The purpose of the AAM special meeting is for AAM stockholders to consider and vote on (1) a proposal to approve the AAM share
issuance, and (2) a proposal to approve the adjournment of the AAM special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to permit further
solicitation of proxies if there are not sufficient votes at the time of the AAM special meeting to approve the AAM share issuance. Only
business that is stated in the notice of the AAM special meeting may be conducted at the AAM special meeting. As of the date of this joint
proxy statement/prospectus, the AAM board of directors is not aware of any other business to be acted upon at the AAM special meeting
except the matters described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus. Any action may be taken on the items of business described above at
the AAM special meeting on the date specified above, or on any date or dates to which, by original or later adjournment, the AAM special
meeting may be adjourned.

Proposal 1—Approval of AAM Share Issuance

        As discussed elsewhere in this joint proxy statement/prospectus, AAM stockholders will consider and vote on a proposal to approve
the AAM share issuance. AAM stockholders must approve the AAM share issuance in order for the merger to occur. If AAM stockholders
fail to approve the AAM share issuance, the merger will not occur.

        Accordingly, we are asking AAM stockholders to vote to approve the AAM share issuance, either by attending the special meeting and
voting in person or by submitting a proxy.

        For the AAM share issuance proposal, you may vote "FOR" or "AGAINST" or "ABSTAIN." An abstention will have the same effect
as voting "AGAINST" the AAM share issuance. If your shares are not present at the AAM special meeting, it will have no effect on the
outcome of the vote on the AAM share issuance proposal.

Board Recommendation

        The AAM board of directors unanimously recommends that you vote "FOR" the AAM share issuance proposal.

Proposal 2—Adjournment to Solicit Additional Proxies, if Necessary or Appropriate

        The AAM special meeting may be adjourned to another time and place, if necessary or appropriate, to permit further solicitation of
proxies if there are not sufficient votes at the time of the AAM special meeting to approve the AAM share issuance.

        Accordingly, we are asking AAM stockholders to vote to approve any adjournment of the AAM special meeting, if necessary or
appropriate, to permit further solicitation of proxies if there are not

sufficient votes at the time of the AAM special meeting to approve the AAM share issuance, either by attending the special meeting and
voting in person or by submitting a proxy.

        For the AAM adjournment proposal, you may vote "FOR" or "AGAINST" or "ABSTAIN." An abstention will have the same effect as
voting "AGAINST" the AAM adjournment proposal. If your shares are not present at the AAM special meeting, it will have no effect on the
outcome of the vote on the AAM adjournment proposal.

Board Recommendation

        The AAM board of directors unanimously recommends that you vote "FOR" the AAM adjournment proposal.

Record Date; Shares Entitled to Vote; Quorum 

        Only holders of record of shares of AAM common stock at the close of business on Friday, February 24, 2017, the AAM record date,
are entitled to notice of the AAM special meeting. Only holders of record of shares of AAM common stock on the AAM record date are
entitled to vote at the AAM special meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof. Holders of record of shares of AAM common
stock are entitled to one vote in person or by proxy for each outstanding share of AAM common stock in such holder's name on the books
of AAM on the AAM record date on each matter submitted to a vote at the AAM special meeting. On the AAM record date, 76,476,788
shares of AAM common stock were issued and outstanding and such shares were held by approximately 235 holders of record.

        If your shares of AAM common stock are held in your name, you have the right to vote in person at the meeting or to appoint a proxy
to vote on your behalf. If your shares of AAM common stock are held in "street name", that is, in an account with a bank, broker or other
nominee, you are considered the beneficial owner of such shares held in street name. As a beneficial owner, you may also attend the
meeting. You may not, however, vote such shares held in street name at the AAM special meeting unless you obtain a "proxy" from your
bank, broker or other nominee that is the record holder of the shares, which proxy gives you the right to vote the shares at the meeting.

        Stockholders of record who hold shares representing a majority in the voting power of the shares of AAM common stock issued and
outstanding and entitled to vote at the AAM special meeting must be present in person or represented by proxy to constitute a quorum for
the voting on the AAM share issuance proposal and the AAM adjournment proposal at the AAM special meeting. Once a share is
represented for any purpose at the AAM special meeting, it will be deemed present for quorum purposes for the remainder of the AAM
special meeting and for any adjournment of the AAM special meeting, unless a new voting record date is set for the adjourned AAM special
meeting. Abstentions will be treated as present at the AAM special meeting for purposes of determining the presence or absence of a
quorum for the transaction of all business.

        Under NYSE rules, banks, brokers and other nominees may use their discretion to vote "uninstructed" shares (i.e., shares held of record
by banks, brokerage firms or other nominees but with respect to which the beneficial owner of such shares has not provided instructions on
how to vote on a particular proposal) with respect to matters that are considered to be "routine," but not with respect to "non-routine"
matters. "Non-routine" matters are matters that may substantially affect the rights or privileges of stockholders, such as mergers,
stockholder proposals, elections of directors (even if not contested), executive compensation (including any advisory stockholder votes on
executive compensation) and certain corporate governance proposals, even if management-supported. A "broker non-vote" occurs on an
item when (i) a broker, nominee or intermediary has discretionary authority to vote on one or more proposals to be voted on at a meeting of
stockholders, but is not permitted to vote on other proposals without instructions from the beneficial owner of the shares and (ii) the

Table of Contents

beneficial owner fails to provide the broker, nominee or intermediary with such instructions. Because none of the proposals to be voted on
at the AAM special meeting are routine matters for which brokers may have discretionary authority to vote, there can be no broker non-
votes at the AAM special meeting. Consequently, failure to provide instructions to your bank, broker or other nominee on how to vote will
result in your shares not being counted as present for establishing a quorum at the AAM special meeting.

Vote Required 

        Approval of the AAM share issuance proposal requires the affirmative vote of holders of a majority in voting power of the shares of
AAM common stock present in person or represented by proxy at the AAM special meeting and entitled to vote on the AAM share
issuance. Abstentions will have the same effect as votes "AGAINST" the AAM share issuance proposal. Shares not present at the AAM
special meeting will have no effect on the outcome of the vote on the AAM share issuance proposal.

        Approval of the AAM adjournment proposal requires the affirmative vote of holders of a majority in voting power of the shares of
AAM common stock present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on the proposal at the AAM special meeting.
Abstentions will have the same effect as votes "AGAINST" the AAM adjournment proposal. Shares not present at the AAM special
meeting will have no effect on the outcome of the vote on the AAM adjournment proposal.

Shares Owned by AAM Directors and Executive Officers 

        On the AAM record date, directors and executive officers of AAM beneficially owned and were entitled to vote 332,129 shares of
AAM common stock, which represented less than 1% of the outstanding shares of AAM common stock entitled to vote at the AAM special
meeting on such date. Each of the directors and executive officers of AAM has advised AAM that, as of the date hereof, he or she currently
expects to vote his or her shares, or cause his or her shares to be voted, "FOR" the AAM share issuance proposal and "FOR" the AAM
adjournment proposal.

How to Vote 

        AAM stockholders may vote using any of the following methods:

By Proxy via Telephone or via the Internet

        If you were a record holder of AAM common stock on the AAM record date, you may vote by proxy by calling the toll-free telephone
number on your proxy card from a touchtone telephone or by accessing the website indicated on your proxy card. Please have your proxy
card available when you call or go online.

        If your shares are held in street name through a broker, bank or other nominee, you must either direct your nominee on how to vote
your shares or obtain a proxy from such nominee to vote in person at the AAM special meeting. The availability of telephone and Internet
proxies for beneficial owners will depend on the voting processes of your bank, broker or other nominee. Therefore, AAM recommends that
you follow the voting instructions in the materials you receive from your bank, broker or other nominee.

By Proxy via Mail

        If you were a record holder of AAM common stock on the AAM record date and received your AAM special meeting materials by
mail, you may vote by marking, signing and dating the enclosed proxy card and returning it in the prepaid envelope provided. If you are an
AAM stockholder of record

Table of Contents

and you return your signed proxy card but do not indicate your voting preferences, the persons named in the proxy card will vote the shares
represented by that proxy "FOR" each of the proposals to be voted on at the AAM special meeting described in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus, as recommended by the AAM board of directors.

        If your shares are held in street name, AAM recommends that you mark, date, sign and promptly mail the voting instruction form
provided by your bank, broker or other nominee in accordance with the instructions provided by such nominee.

In Person at the AAM Special Meeting

        All AAM stockholders of record as of the AAM record date may vote in person by completing a ballot at the AAM special meeting.
Such stockholders may also be represented by another person at the AAM special meeting by executing a proper proxy designating that
person.

        If your shares are held in street name, you may only vote in person at the AAM special meeting if you have proof of ownership of your
shares of AAM common stock as of the AAM record date and obtain a valid legal proxy from your bank, broker or other nominee that is the
record holder of such shares and present such items at the AAM special meeting.

By Granting a Proxy or Submitting Voting Instructions

        You may vote by granting a proxy to someone else or, for shares held in "street name," by submitting voting instructions to your bank,
broker or other nominee. Please note that if you hold your shares in street name, you must provide voting instructions to your bank, broker
or other nominee in order for your shares to be represented at the AAM special meeting.

Voting of Proxies 

        All shares of AAM common stock properly voted by proxy via the Internet or by telephone at or prior to 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on
Tuesday, April 4, 2017 and all shares of AAM common stock represented by properly executed proxies submitted by mail and received
prior to or at the AAM special meeting and, in each case, not revoked, will be voted in accordance with the instructions so provided. If no
specific instructions are given with respect to the proposals to be acted upon at the AAM special meeting, the persons named in the proxy
card will vote the shares represented by that proxy "FOR" each of the proposals to be voted on at the AAM special meeting described in
this joint proxy statement/prospectus, as recommended by the AAM board of directors. If a quorum is not present and there is a proposal to
adjourn the AAM special meeting, the persons named in the proxy card solicited by AAM will have discretion to vote on such proposal.

        A properly submitted proxy marked "ABSTAIN" is counted for purposes of determining whether there is a quorum and for purposes of
determining the number of shares represented and entitled to vote at the AAM special meeting, and is also considered a vote cast. Therefore,
with respect to each of the proposals, an abstention will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" such proposal.

        If you hold your shares in street name, AAM recommends that you follow the voting instructions provided by your bank, broker or
other nominee in order to properly vote your shares or to obtain a proxy to vote your shares at the AAM special meeting. Because the
approvals of the AAM share issuance and the AAM adjournment proposal are regarded as "non-routine" matters, there can be no broker
non-votes at the AAM special meeting. Consequently, the failure to provide instructions to your bank, broker or other nominee on how to
vote your shares will result in your shares not being counted as present at the meeting. Shares not present at the AAM special meeting will
have no effect on the outcome of the vote on the AAM share issuance proposal or the AAM adjournment proposal.

Revocability of Proxies 

        You may revoke your proxy prior to its use by delivering a signed notice of revocation or a later dated signed proxy or by attending the
meeting and voting in person. Attendance at the AAM special meeting will not in itself constitute the revocation of a proxy. If you are an
AAM stockholder of record and you choose to send a written notice of revocation or to mail a new proxy, you must submit your notice of
revocation or your new proxy to American Axle & Manufacturing Holdings, Inc., Attention: Secretary, One Dauch Drive, Detroit, Michigan
48211, and it must be received at any time before the start of the AAM special meeting. Any proxy that you submitted via the Internet or by
telephone may be revoked by submitting a new proxy via the Internet or by telephone, not later than 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on Tuesday,
April 4, 2017, or by voting in person at the meeting. If your shares are held in the name of a bank, broker or other nominee, you should
contact them to change your vote.

Solicitation of Proxies 

        AAM is soliciting proxies for the AAM special meeting from AAM stockholders of record as of the AAM record date. AAM will bear
all of the costs of soliciting proxies from AAM stockholders, other than certain costs related to the production and distribution of this joint
proxy statement/prospectus, which will be shared equally with MPG pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement. AAM has retained
Georgeson LLC to assist in the solicitation of proxies for the special meeting for a fee of approximately $20,000, plus reimbursement of
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses. In addition, AAM's directors, officers and other employees may also solicit proxies, without special
compensation, personally and by mail, e-mail, telephone, facsimile or other means of communication. AAM will also reimburse brokers,
banks and other holders of record for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with forwarding the proxy materials to
AAM stockholders.

Householding 

        The SEC's proxy rules permit companies and intermediaries, such as brokers and banks, to satisfy proxy statement delivery
requirements for two or more stockholders sharing an address by delivering one proxy statement to those stockholders. This procedure,
known as "householding," reduces the amount of duplicate information that stockholders receive and lowers printing and mailing costs.

        Some banks, brokers and other intermediaries or nominee record holders may use "householding" for the AAM special meeting notice
or this joint proxy statement/prosepctus. This means that only one copy each of the notice, or the proxy statement, as the case may be, may
have been sent to your address if multiple stockholders share your address. AAM will promptly send a separate copy of these documents to
you if you send a request to American Axle & Manufacturing Holdings, Inc., Attention: Investor Relations, One Dauch Drive, Detroit,
Michigan 48211, USA, or if you contact AAM's Investor Relations department by telephone at 313-758-2404. If you prefer to opt out of the
householding procedure and receive separate copies of such documents in the future, or if you are receiving multiple copies and would like
to receive only one copy for your household, you should contact your bank, broker or other nominee, or you may contact us at the above
address or phone number.

THE MPG SPECIAL MEETING 

        MPG is providing this joint proxy statement/prospectus to MPG stockholders as of the close of business on Friday, February 24, 2017,
the MPG record date, in connection with the solicitation of proxies from those stockholders by the MPG board of directors for use at the
MPG special meeting or at any adjournment or postponement thereof, for the purposes set forth in the accompanying notice of the MPG
special meeting.

Date, Time and Place 

        The MPG special meeting will be held on Wednesday, April 5, 2017, at 8:30 a.m., local time, at Two Towne Square, Suite 110,
Conference Center, Southfield, Michigan 48076, unless adjourned or postponed.

Purpose of the Special Meeting 

        The purpose of the special meeting is for MPG stockholders to consider and vote on (1) a proposal to adopt the merger agreement and
approve the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, (2) a proposal to approve, on an advisory non-binding basis, the
compensation that may be paid or become payable to MPG's named executive officers in connection with the merger and (3) a proposal to
approve the adjournment of the MPG special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to permit further solicitation of proxies if there are not
sufficient votes at the time of the MPG special meeting to approve the proposal to adopt the merger agreement and approve the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement.

        Only business that is stated in the notice of the MPG special meeting or otherwise properly brought before the special meeting in
accordance with MPG's amended and restated bylaws may be conducted at the MPG special meeting. As of the date of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus, the MPG board of directors is not aware of any other business to be acted upon at the MPG special meeting except the
matters described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus. Any action may be taken on the items of business described above at the MPG
special meeting on the date specified above, or on any date or dates to which, by original or later adjournment, the MPG special meeting
may be adjourned.

Proposal 1—Adoption of the Merger Agreement

        As discussed elsewhere in this joint proxy statement/prospectus, MPG stockholders will consider and vote on a proposal to adopt the
merger agreement and approve the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. MPG stockholders must adopt the merger
agreement and approve the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement in order for the merger to occur. If MPG stockholders fail to
adopt the merger agreement and approve the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, the merger will not occur.

        Accordingly, we are asking MPG stockholders to vote to approve the adoption of the merger agreement and the approval of the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, either by attending the special meeting and voting in person or by submitting a proxy.
You should carefully read this joint proxy statement/prospectus in its entirety for more detailed information concerning the merger
agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby. In particular, you are urged to read the merger agreement in its entirety, which is
attached as Annex A to this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

        For the proposal to adopt the merger agreement and approve the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, you may vote
"FOR" or "AGAINST" or "ABSTAIN." If you abstain or if your shares are not present at the MPG special meeting, it will have the same
effect as a vote "AGAINST" the adoption of the merger agreement and the approval of the transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement.

Table of Contents

Board Recommendation

        The MPG board of directors unanimously recommends that you vote "FOR" the proposal to adopt the merger agreement and approve
the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

Proposal 2—Advisory Vote Regarding Certain Executive Compensation

        Section 14A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (which we refer to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the
Exchange Act) requires MPG to seek a non-binding, advisory vote on compensation that may be paid or become payable to MPG's named
executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the merger. For a summary of such compensation, including any agreements or
understandings with respect to any such compensation arrangements, see "The Merger—Interests of MPG Directors and Executive Officers
in the Merger" beginning on page 100. We refer to this proposal in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the MPG merger-related
compensation proposal.

        Accordingly, MPG is asking you to vote to approve the following resolution by voting "FOR" the MPG merger-related compensation
proposal, either by attending the special meeting and voting in person or by submitting a proxy.

        "RESOLVED, that the compensation that may be paid or become payable to the named executive officers of Metaldyne Performance
Group Inc. in connection with the merger, as disclosed pursuant to Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K in the table titled "Golden Parachute
Compensation" on page 105 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, including the associated narrative discussion, and the agreements and
plans pursuant to which such compensation may be paid or become payable, are hereby APPROVED."

        For the MPG merger-related compensation proposal, you may vote "FOR" or "AGAINST" or "ABSTAIN." Abstentions and shares not
present at the MPG special meeting will have no effect on the outcome of the vote on the MPG merger-related compensation proposal.

        The vote on the MPG merger-related compensation proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote to adopt the merger agreement
and approve the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. Accordingly, you may vote in favor of the adoption of the merger
agreement and the approval of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and against the MPG merger-related compensation
proposal, or vice versa. Approval of the MPG merger-related compensation proposal, on a non-binding, advisory basis, is not a condition to
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, and it is advisory in nature only, meaning it will not be
binding on MPG or AAM. Because there is a contractual obligation to pay the compensation, if the transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement are completed, the compensation will be payable, subject only to the conditions applicable to such compensation payments,
regardless of the outcome of the advisory vote.

Board Recommendation

        The MPG board of directors unanimously recommends that you vote "FOR" the MPG merger-related compensation proposal.

Proposal 3—Adjournment to Solicit Additional Proxies, if Necessary or Appropriate

        The MPG special meeting may be adjourned to another time and place, if necessary or appropriate, to permit further solicitation of
proxies if there are not sufficient votes at the time of the MPG special meeting to adopt the merger agreement and approve the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement.

Table of Contents

        Accordingly, we are asking MPG stockholders to vote to approve any adjournment of the MPG special meeting, if necessary or
appropriate, to permit further solicitation of proxies if there are not sufficient votes at the time of the MPG special meeting to adopt the
merger agreement and approve the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, either by attending the special meeting and voting in
person or by submitting a proxy.

        For the MPG adjournment proposal, you may vote "FOR" or "AGAINST" or "ABSTAIN." Abstentions and shares not present at the
MPG special meeting will have no effect on the outcome of the vote on the MPG adjournment proposal.

Board Recommendation

        The MPG board of directors unanimously recommends that you vote "FOR" the MPG adjournment proposal.

Record Date; Shares Entitled to Vote; Quorum 

        Only holders of record of shares of MPG common stock at the close of business on Friday, February 24, 2017, the MPG record date,
are entitled to notice of the MPG special meeting. Only holders of record of shares of MPG common stock on the MPG record date are
entitled to vote at the MPG special meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof. Holders of record of shares of MPG common
stock are entitled to one vote in person or by proxy for each share of MPG common stock outstanding in such holder's name on the books of
MPG on the MPG record date on each matter submitted to a vote at the MPG special meeting. On the MPG record date, 67,917,752 shares
of MPG common stock were issued and outstanding and such shares were held by approximately 23 holders of record.

        If your shares of MPG common stock are held in your name, you have the right to vote in person at the meeting or to appoint a proxy
to vote on your behalf. If your shares of MPG common stock are held in "street name", that is, in an account with a bank, broker or other
nominee, you are considered the beneficial owner of such shares held in street name. As a beneficial owner, you may also attend the
meeting. You may not, however, vote such shares held in street name at the MPG special meeting unless you obtain a "proxy" from your
bank, broker or other nominee that is the record holder of the shares, which proxy gives you the right to vote the shares at the meeting.

        Stockholders of record who hold shares representing a majority in voting power of the shares of MPG common stock entitled to vote at
the MPG special meeting must be present in person or represented by proxy to constitute a quorum for voting on the proposal to adopt the
merger agreement and approve the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, the MPG merger-related compensation proposal and
the MPG adjournment proposal at the MPG special meeting. Once a share is represented for any purpose at the MPG special meeting, it will
be deemed present for quorum purposes for the remainder of the MPG special meeting and for any adjournment of the MPG special
meeting, unless a new voting record date is set for the adjourned MPG special meeting. Abstentions will be treated as present at the MPG
special meeting for purposes of determining the presence or absence of a quorum for the transaction of all business.

        Under NYSE rules, banks, brokers and other nominees may use their discretion to vote "uninstructed" shares (i.e., shares held of record
by banks, brokerage firms or other nominees but with respect to which the beneficial owner of such shares has not provided instructions on
how to vote on a particular proposal) with respect to matters that are considered to be "routine," but not with respect to "non-routine"
matters. "Non-routine" matters are matters that may substantially affect the rights or privileges of stockholders, such as mergers,
stockholder proposals, elections of directors (even if not contested), executive compensation (including any advisory stockholder votes on
executive compensation) and certain corporate governance proposals, even if management-supported. A "broker

Table of Contents

non-vote" occurs on an item when (i) a broker, nominee or intermediary has discretionary authority to vote on one or more proposals to be
voted on at a meeting of stockholders, but is not permitted to vote on other proposals without instructions from the beneficial owner of the
shares and (ii) the beneficial owner fails to provide the broker, nominee or intermediary with such instructions. Because none of the
proposals to be voted on at the MPG special meeting are routine matters for which brokers may have discretionary authority to vote, there
can be no broker non-votes at the MPG special meeting. Consequently, failure to provide instructions to your bank, broker or other nominee
on how to vote will result in your shares not being counted as present at the meeting.

Vote Required 

        Adoption of the merger agreement and approval of the transactions contemplated thereby requires the affirmative vote of the majority
of the shares of MPG common stock that are outstanding as of the MPG record date and entitled to vote thereon. Abstentions and shares not
present at the MPG special meeting will have the same effect as votes "AGAINST" the adoption of the merger agreement and the approval
of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

        Approval of the MPG merger-related compensation proposal requires the affirmative vote of the majority of the shares of MPG
common stock present in person or represented by proxy and voting on such proposal at the MPG special meeting. Abstentions and shares
not present at the MPG special meeting will have no effect on the outcome of the vote on the MPG merger-related compensation proposal.

        Approval of the MPG adjournment proposal requires the affirmative vote of the majority of the shares of MPG common stock present
in person or represented by proxy and voting on such proposal at the MPG special meeting. Abstentions and shares not present at the MPG
special meeting will have no effect on the outcome of the vote on the MPG adjournment proposal.

Shares Owned by MPG Directors and Executive Officers 

        On the MPG record date, directors and executive officers of MPG owned and were entitled to vote 2,185,575 shares of MPG common
stock, which represented approximately 3.2% of the outstanding shares of MPG common stock entitled to vote at the MPG special meeting
on such date. Each of the directors and executive officers of MPG has advised MPG that, as of the date hereof, he or she currently expects
to vote his or her shares, or cause his or her shares to be voted, "FOR" the adoption of the merger agreement and the approval of the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, "FOR" the MPG merger-related compensation proposal and "FOR" the MPG
adjournment proposal.

How to Vote 

        MPG stockholders may vote using any of the following methods:

By Proxy via Telephone or via the Internet

        If you were a record holder of MPG common stock on the record date, you may vote by proxy by calling the toll-free telephone
number on your proxy card from a touchtone telephone or by accessing the website indicated on your proxy card. Please have your proxy
card available when you call or go online.

        If your shares are held in street name through a broker, bank or other nominee, you must either direct your nominee on how to vote
your shares or obtain a proxy from such nominee to vote in person at the MPG special meeting. The availability of telephone and Internet
proxies for beneficial owners will depend on the voting processes of your bank, broker or other nominee. Therefore, MPG

recommends that you follow the voting instructions in the materials you receive from your bank, broker or other nominee.

By Proxy via Mail

        If you were a record holder of MPG common stock on the record date and received your MPG special meeting materials by mail, you
may vote by marking, signing and dating the enclosed proxy card and returning it in the prepaid envelope provided. If you are a MPG
stockholder of record and you return your signed proxy card but do not indicate your voting preferences, the persons named in the proxy
card will vote the shares represented by that proxy "FOR" each of the proposals to be voted on at the MPG special meeting described in this
joint proxy statement/prospectus, as recommended by the MPG board of directors.

        If your shares are held in street name, MPG recommends that you mark, date, sign and promptly mail the voting instruction form
provided by your bank, broker or other nominee in accordance with the instructions provided by such nominee.

In Person at the MPG Special Meeting

        All MPG stockholders of record as of the MPG record date may vote in person by completing a ballot at the MPG special meeting.
Such stockholders may also be represented by another person at the MPG special meeting by executing a proper proxy designating that
person.

        If your shares are held in street name, you may only vote in person at the MPG special meeting if you have proof of ownership of your
shares of MPG common stock as of the MPG record date and obtain a valid legal proxy from your bank, broker or other nominee that is the
record holder of such shares and present such items at the MPG special meeting.

By Granting a Proxy or Submitting Voting Instructions

        You may vote by granting a proxy to someone else or, for shares held in "street name," by submitting voting instructions to your bank,
broker or other nominee. Please note that if you hold your shares in street name, you must provide voting instructions to your bank, broker
or other nominee in order for your shares to be represented at the MPG special meeting.

Voting of Proxies 

        All shares of MPG common stock properly voted by proxy via the Internet or by telephone at or prior to 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on
Tuesday, April 4, 2017 and all shares of MPG common stock represented by properly executed proxies submitted by mail and received at or
prior to the MPG special meeting and, in each case, not revoked, will be voted in accordance with the instructions so provided. If no
specific instructions are given with respect to the proposals to be acted upon at the MPG special meeting, the persons named in the proxy
card will vote the shares represented by that proxy "FOR" each of the proposals to be voted on at the MPG special meeting described in this
joint proxy statement/prospectus, as recommended by the MPG board of directors and will vote the shares in accordance with their best
judgment on any other matter that is properly presented and voted on at the MPG special meeting. As of the date hereof, the proposals
described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus are the only items the MPG board of directors expects to be acted upon at the MPG
special meeting.

        A properly submitted proxy marked "ABSTAIN" is counted for purposes of determining whether there is a quorum and for purposes of
determining the number of shares represented and entitled to vote at the MPG special meeting. Therefore, with respect to the proposal to
adopt the merger agreement and approve the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, an abstention will

Table of Contents

have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" such proposal. For the merger-related compensation proposal and the adjournment proposal, an
abstention will have no effect on the outcome of the vote.

        Because there can be no broker non-votes at the MPG special meeting, the failure to provide instructions to your bank, broker or other
nominee on how to vote your shares will result in your shares not being counted as present at the meeting and will count as a vote
"AGAINST" the merger proposal. For the merger-related compensation proposal and the adjournment proposal, the failure to provide
instructions to your bank, broker or other nominee on how to vote your shares will have no effect on the outcome of the vote. If you hold
your shares in street name, MPG therefore recommends that you follow the voting instructions provided by your bank, broker or other
nominee in order to properly vote your shares or to obtain a proxy to vote your shares at the MPG special meeting.

Revocability of Proxies 

        You may revoke your proxy prior to its use by delivering a signed notice of revocation or a later dated signed proxy or by attending the
meeting and voting in person. Attendance at the MPG special meeting will not in itself constitute the revocation of a proxy. If you are an
MPG stockholder of record and you choose to send a written notice of revocation or to mail a new proxy, you must submit your notice of
revocation or your new proxy to Metaldyne Performance Group Inc., Attention: Secretary, One Towne Square, Suite 550, Southfield,
Michigan 48076, and it must be received at any time before the start of the MPG special meeting. Any proxy that you submitted via the
Internet or by telephone may be revoked by submitting a new proxy via the Internet or by telephone, not later than 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time
on Tuesday, April 4, 2017, or by voting in person at the meeting. If your shares are held in the name of a bank, broker or other nominee, you
should contact them to change your vote.

Solicitation of Proxies 

        MPG is soliciting proxies for the MPG special meeting from MPG stockholders of record as of the MPG record date. MPG will bear
all of the costs of soliciting proxies from MPG stockholders, other than certain costs related to the production and distribution of this joint
proxy statement/prospectus, which will be shared equally with AAM pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement. MPG has retained
MacKenzie Partners, Inc. to assist in the solicitation of proxies for the special meeting for a fee of approximately $15,000 plus
reimbursement of reasonable out-of-pocket expenses. MPG's directors, officers and other employees may also solicit proxies, without
additional compensation, personally and by mail, e-mail, telephone, and other means of communication. MPG will also reimburse brokers
and other persons holding MPG common stock in their names or in the names of their nominees for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses
incurred in distributing the proxy materials to MPG stockholders.

Householding 

        The SEC's proxy rules permit companies and intermediaries, such as brokers and banks, to satisfy proxy statement delivery
requirements for two or more stockholders sharing an address by delivering one proxy statement to those stockholders. This procedure,
known as "householding," reduces the amount of duplicate information that stockholders receive and lowers printing and mailing costs.

        Some banks, brokers and other intermediaries or nominee record holders may use householding for the MPG special meeting notice or
this joint proxy statement/prospectus. This means that only one copy each of the notice, or this joint proxy statement/prospectus, as the case
may be, may have been sent to your address if multiple stockholders share your address. MPG will promptly send a separate copy of these
documents to you if you send a request to Metaldyne Performance Group Inc., One Towne Square, Suite 550, Southfield, Michigan 48076,
Attention: Investor Relations, or if you contact MPG's Investor Relations department by telephone at 248-727-1829.

        If you prefer to opt out of the householding procedure and receive separate copies of such documents in the future, or if you are
receiving multiple copies and would like to receive only one copy for your household, you should contact your bank, broker or other
nominee, or you may contact us at the above address or phone number.

THE MERGER

General

        On the terms and conditions set out in the merger agreement, Merger Sub, a wholly-owned subsidiary of AAM, will merge with and
into MPG, with MPG as the surviving corporation in the merger. Following the completion of the merger, MPG will be a wholly-owned
subsidiary of AAM and shares of MPG common stock will no longer be publicly traded.

        At the effective time of the merger, each share of MPG common stock (other than MPG excluded shares) will be converted into the
right to receive (i) $13.50 in cash, without interest, and (ii) 0.5 of a share of AAM common stock.

Background to the Merger 

        Each of the AAM board of directors and the MPG board of directors and their respective managements regularly review and evaluate
potential strategic alternatives relating to their respective companies and businesses, including possible acquisitions, divestitures and
business combination transactions, with the goal of maximizing stockholder value. Those discussions regularly analyze market conditions
and the companies' respective balance sheet profiles, operating forecasts and constraints associated with operating on a standalone basis. In
addition, because AAM is a customer of MPG, representatives of MPG and AAM are in frequent contact, and members of management of
MPG and AAM engage in periodic discussions about their respective businesses and commercial relationship.

        As part of AAM's regular review and evaluation of strategic alternatives, AAM has consulted with Greenhill and other advisors.
During the summer of 2015, the potential acquisition candidates considered by AAM included MPG.

        In August 2015, AAM contacted Greenhill to begin the process of exploring a potential acquisition of MPG. Thereafter, beginning in
September 2015, Greenhill had several meetings and other discussions with David C. Dauch, the Chairman of the AAM board of directors
and Chief Executive Officer of AAM, Michael K. Simonte, the President of AAM, and other members of AAM's management specifically
to evaluate a potential acquisition of MPG, including the potential synergies that could be achieved from such a business combination, the
potential price payable in the transaction and the implications of the additional debt required by AAM to finance any such acquisition.

        On October 28, 2015, at a meeting of AAM's Strategy and Technology Committee, members of AAM management provided a
presentation to the committee regarding various strategic initiatives, which included several potential acquisition candidates, of which MPG
was one. The members of the committee expressed support for further investigation by AAM management of a possible transaction with
MPG.

        In late November 2015, at the direction of AAM's management, a representative of Greenhill contacted Kevin Penn, the Chairman of
the MPG board of directors and a Managing Director of American Securities, an affiliate of MPG's largest stockholder, to express AAM's
interest in a potential business combination transaction with MPG. Following that conversation, AAM and MPG agreed to arrange a
meeting to discuss further a potential transaction involving AAM and MPG.

        In the middle of November 2015, AAM engaged Shearman & Sterling LLP (which we refer to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus
as Shearman) to begin evaluating the legal considerations involved in a potential acquisition of MPG.

        On December 18, 2015, Messrs. Dauch and Simonte, Norman Willemse, President—Metal Formed Products of AAM, and a
representative of Greenhill met with Mr. Penn and Loren Easton, a member of the MPG board of directors and a Managing Director of
American Securities, at American Securities' office in New York, New York to discuss a potential transaction involving MPG and AAM.

Following that meeting, Messrs. Penn and Easton updated certain members of the MPG board of directors regarding the meeting, including
George Thanopoulos, Chief Executive Officer of MPG.

        On January 12 and January 13, 2016, respectively, MPG and AAM gave presentations at the Deutsche Bank Global Auto Industry
Conference in Detroit, Michigan regarding their respective businesses and outlook for the future. During that conference on January 12,
Mr. Dauch reiterated to Mr. Thanopoulos that AAM would be interested in exploring a potential transaction involving AAM and MPG. In
addition, on January 13, 2016, Messrs. Penn and Easton met with Messrs. Dauch, Simonte and Willemse to begin exploring in more detail a
potential transaction involving AAM and MPG.

        On February 1, 2016, Mr. Thanopoulos and Douglas Grimm, Chief Operating Officer of MPG, met with Messrs. Dauch, Simonte and
Willemse in Birmingham, Michigan to further discuss a potential transaction involving the two companies. Three days later, on February 4,
2016, during a phone call between Messrs. Dauch and Thanopoulos, Mr. Thanopoulos expressed support for exploring the combination of
AAM's and MPG's businesses.

        During meetings of the AAM Strategy and Technology Committee and AAM board of directors held on February 3, 2016 and
February 4, 2016, respectively, Mr. Dauch provided updates to both the committee and the board with respect to the status of discussions
with MPG regarding a potential business combination between the two companies.

        On February 22, 2016, Mr. Dauch spoke telephonically with Mr. Penn to discuss in more detail a potential transaction involving AAM
and MPG. During this phone call, Mr. Penn stated to Mr. Dauch that Mr. Penn would not be inclined to recommend to the MPG board of
directors an acquisition of MPG below a range of $20 to $22 per share. However, as a result of general market conditions in the automotive
industry that negatively affected the stock prices of many companies in the industry, including AAM and MPG, both companies
reconsidered the timing and value of a potential transaction and whether it would be more appropriate to explore the merits and specific
terms of a potential transaction when the market had stabilized.

        During this time, AAM and MPG were also engaged in ongoing negotiations regarding the terms of the supplier agreement between
AAM and MPG that would be expiring by its terms at the end of 2016.

        In late March 2016, Mr. Thanopoulos traveled to China to visit MPG's Chinese operations. During this visit to China, Mr. Thanopoulos
was invited by the Chairman of a China-based automotive conglomerate (which we refer to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as
Company A), with whom Mr. Thanopoulos had been previously familiar, to tour the facilities of Company A. Following such tour,
Mr. Thanopoulos invited representatives of Company A to conduct a reciprocal visit to MPG's facilities in Michigan.

        On May 5, 2016, at a meeting of the AAM board of directors, members of AAM management and representatives of Greenhill made
presentations to the AAM board regarding the potential acquisition of MPG, noting that, after the changes to market conditions in the
automotive industry earlier that year, trading prices of the two companies' stock had stabilized and recovered to the point that a resumption
of discussions regarding a potential transaction might be appropriate. The participants in the meeting discussed, among other things, an
updated financial analysis prepared by Greenhill regarding an acquisition of MPG under alternative price and leverage scenarios and with
various synergy assumptions, and the potential implications of MPG's largest stockholder holding a significant ownership interest in AAM
in the event any such an acquisition included AAM common stock as part of the consideration paid to MPG stockholders. The AAM board
of directors authorized AAM management to move forward in discussions regarding a potential transaction with MPG and concluded that
an offer to acquire all of the outstanding equity of MPG at a price of up to $21 per share of MPG

common stock was appropriate given the potential synergies that could be achieved by the combined company.

        On May 15, 2016, Messrs. Dauch and Penn discussed telephonically resuming the discussions with respect to a potential transaction
involving AAM and MPG. Mr. Dauch indicated to Mr. Penn that AAM might be willing to pay up to $21 per share of MPG common stock
for such an acquisition. In response, Mr. Penn noted that MPG's stock price had previously traded as high as $24.50 per share.

        Between December 2015 and June 2016, Messrs. Thanopoulos, Penn and Easton periodically provided updates to the MPG board of
directors with respect to their discussions with AAM. In addition, Messrs. Penn and Easton periodically provided updates to the MPG board
of directors with respect to several unsolicited approaches that had been made to them in their capacities as directors of MPG in early 2016
by representatives of private equity sponsors and operating companies other than AAM to gauge MPG's interest in engaging in a transaction
of some nature. Given the amount of such interest from potential transaction counterparties and concerns about operating as a standalone
company, in late May 2016, the MPG board of directors determined to engage a financial advisor to better understand and evaluate the
potential strategic options available to MPG.

        On June 1, 2016, with the approval of the MPG board of directors, MPG engaged BofA Merrill Lynch as its financial advisor to assist
MPG in its evaluation and consideration of a potential transaction.

        On June 7, 2016, Messrs. Penn and Easton, together with a representative of American Securities, met with representatives of BofA
Merrill Lynch to discuss potential strategic alternatives available to MPG, based on consideration by the MPG board of directors of the
prospects for MPG to continue as a standalone company and the potential for a strategic transaction involving MPG. Messrs. Penn and
Easton, the representative of American Securities and representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch discussed the fact that potential counterparties
in a strategic transaction could include parties with whom MPG had existing business relationships, companies which had previously
approached MPG in the past to gauge interest in a potential transaction, or other companies which may have a strong strategic fit with
MPG. On June 13, 2016, members of MPG management met with representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch, during which meeting the
representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch provided an overview of a proposed timeline for a strategic process and discussed with MPG
management certain considerations if MPG were to undertake such a process.

        On June 14, 2016, Messrs. Penn and Dauch further discussed telephonically a potential transaction between AAM and MPG, including
the potential synergies that could be achieved by a combined company.

        On June 27, 2016, Messrs. Dauch and Thanopoulos met in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan to again discuss a potential transaction
involving AAM and MPG and the potential synergies that could be achieved by a combined company.

        On July 7, 2016, representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch met with members of MPG management to discuss AAM's verbal expression
of interest in a potential transaction between the two companies and MPG's proposed response, as well as to consider identifying and
evaluating other potential counterparties for MPG who could be contacted in connection with BofA Merrill Lynch's market check process
were such process to be undertaken. The next day, on July 8, 2016, Mr. Dauch contacted Mr. Thanopoulos to discuss the potential
transaction and indicated to Mr. Thanopoulos that AAM would be submitting to MPG a formal indication of interest.

        On July 13, 2016, Messrs. Thanopoulos and Penn conducted a tour of MPG's Royal Oak and Fraser, Michigan facilities with the
Chairman and other representatives of Company A. Following the tour, a representative of Company A orally expressed to
Messrs. Thanopoulos and Penn an interest in exploring a potential investment or other strategic transaction with MPG. Messrs. Thanopoulos
and Penn informed the representative of Company A that MPG would be open to discussions regarding a

potential transaction and encouraged the representative to engage with representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch with respect thereto.

        During June and July 2016, Mr. Thanopoulos also held periodic meetings with a significant customer of MPG (which we refer to in
this joint proxy statement/prospectus as Company B) as part of MPG's customary practice to engage in discussions with customers of MPG.
During some of those meetings, representatives of Company B expressed interest in potentially exploring a transaction involving MPG and
Company B, but also expressed reservations about the timing for such a transaction, the amount of indebtedness Company B would be
required to incur in order to finance such a transaction and the amount of equity Company B would need to issue in order to consummate
any potential transaction. Mr. Thanopoulos encouraged the representatives of Company B to engage with representatives of BofA Merrill
Lynch regarding any potential transaction Company B might be contemplating.

        On July 14, 2016, the AAM board of directors met telephonically to discuss with representatives of Greenhill and AAM management
the recent conversations between Mr. Dauch and Messrs. Penn and Thanopoulos regarding a potential transaction involving AAM and
MPG. At the board meeting, representatives of Greenhill made a presentation to the AAM board of directors evaluating the potential
acquisition of MPG, including the potential synergies that could be achieved from such a combination, various considerations related to the
potential purchase price that AAM would be required to pay in connection with a transaction and the implications of the additional debt
required by AAM to finance the acquisition. At the meeting, the AAM board of directors authorized AAM management to deliver an initial
written offer to acquire all of the outstanding equity of MPG for between $19 and $21 per share of MPG common stock, with the merger
consideration to be comprised of approximately 55% cash and 45% shares of AAM common stock (which we refer to in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus as AAM's initial offer).

        On July 15, 2016, Mr. Dauch delivered to Mr. Thanopoulos AAM's initial offer. AAM's initial offer also stated that AAM would
provide American Securities, as MPG's largest stockholder, with customary registration rights and the right to nominate one member to the
AAM board of directors for so long as American Securities maintained a meaningful equity position in the combined company. AAM's
initial offer further proposed that the parties enter into a confidentiality agreement to permit them to commence their respective due
diligence reviews.

        In mid-July, MPG engaged Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP (which we refer to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as Weil) as its
legal counsel in connection with any potential transaction involving MPG.

        On July 19, 2016, the MPG board of directors met telephonically to review with representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch and Weil and
MPG management AAM's initial offer, including the strategic rationale for the potential transaction, potential synergy opportunities, due
diligence review that would be undertaken, regulatory considerations and the ability of AAM to finance the potential transaction, and to
discuss MPG's proposed response to the offer. A representative of Weil also reviewed and discussed with the MPG board of directors the
directors' fiduciary duties. Following such meeting, at the direction of the MPG board of directors and with advice from BofA Merrill
Lynch, Mr. Thanopoulos contacted Mr. Dauch and indicated that AAM's initial offer undervalued MPG and was inadequate and that AAM
would need to revise and clarify the terms of its offer, including by providing a single purchase price, rather than a range, and additional
details regarding the pro forma ownership structure of the combined company and assumed synergies, before the MPG board of directors
would take any formal action with respect thereto.

        On July 20, 2016, AAM delivered to MPG a revised written offer (which we refer to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as AAM's
July 20 offer) to acquire all of the outstanding equity of MPG at a price of $20 per share of MPG common stock, with the merger
consideration proposed to be

comprised of approximately 60% cash and 40% shares of AAM common stock. The remaining terms of AAM's July 20 offer were
consistent with those proposed in AAM's initial offer.

        On July 26, 2016, with advice from BofA Merrill Lynch and after discussion with certain members of the MPG board of directors,
Mr. Thanopoulos contacted Mr. Dauch and indicated that AAM's July 20 offer continued to undervalue MPG and was inadequate, and that
AAM would need to revise and clarify the terms of its offer, including the valuation of MPG, pro forma ownership structure of the
combined company and assumed synergies before the MPG board of directors would take any formal action with respect thereto.

        On July 27, 2016, at a meeting of AAM's Strategy and Technology Committee, Mr. Dauch informed the members of the committee
about the points raised by Mr. Thanopoulos in their phone call the night before and also briefly reviewed the history of communications
between the two companies regarding the proposed transaction involving AAM and MPG. The members of the committee and
representatives of Greenhill, who were also in attendance, discussed certain risks and certain of the expected benefits of a proposed
acquisition of MPG. The committee then concluded that AAM should continue to pursue a potential acquisition of MPG and determined
how to respond to the points raised by Mr. Thanopoulos in AAM's next offer.

        On July 29, 2016, AAM delivered a third written offer (which we refer to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as AAM's July 29
offer) to acquire all of the outstanding equity of MPG at a price in the range of $20 to $21 per share of MPG common stock, which was
proposed to be comprised of approximately 60% cash and 40% shares of AAM common stock. The remaining terms of the offer were again
consistent with those proposed in AAM's initial offer.

        On August 3, 2016, the MPG board of directors met to consider and review with representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch and MPG
management AAM's July 29 offer. Following discussions among the members of the MPG board of directors, MPG management and
representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch, the MPG board of directors determined that, given the value of AAM's July 29 offer relative to
AAM's two preceding written offers, MPG should seek to negotiate and enter into a nondisclosure agreement with AAM and then
commence mutual due diligence in an effort to solicit a further improved offer from AAM. The MPG board of directors further instructed
BofA Merrill Lynch to contact other potential counterparties.

        Between the end of July and late August, representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch contacted sixteen other potential counterparties
regarding a potential strategic transaction with MPG. The sixteen other potential counterparties included Company A, Company B and other
companies and financial sponsors that had previously indicated interest in a potential transaction involving MPG, as well as other
companies and financial sponsors that BofA Merrill Lynch, MPG management and certain members of the MPG board of directors believed
could have a strong strategic fit with MPG or that otherwise may be capable or interested in a potential transaction with MPG. Other than
Company A, none of the potential counterparties contacted by BofA Merrill Lynch expressed any interest in a potential transaction with
MPG, and none engaged in any meetings with MPG management or otherwise were provided any non-public information about MPG
despite BofA Merrill Lynch contacting certain of such potential counterparties on multiple occasions.

        On August 4, 2016, Company A delivered an all cash written offer to acquire all of the outstanding equity of MPG that valued MPG at
5.5-6.0 times MPG's last twelve month EBITDA, but without specifying any purchase price. Later that day, following discussions with
members of the MPG board of directors and MPG management, representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch, on behalf of MPG, communicated
to representatives of Company A that Company A would need to provide a single purchase price in its offer, and that Company A's offer
undervalued MPG and was therefore inadequate, but that Company A should consider delivering a revised offer.

        On August 5, 2016, Mr. Thanopoulos met with Mr. Dauch in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, and informed Mr. Dauch that AAM's July 29
offer continued to undervalue MPG and was therefore inadequate but indicated that MPG would be willing to negotiate and enter into a
nondisclosure agreement with AAM and commence preliminary mutual due diligence.

        On August 18, 2016, Mr. Thanopoulos met with Messrs. Dauch and Simonte to discuss the potential terms of the proposed transaction,
to review and discuss a proposed timeline for the potential transaction and to discuss the proposed scope of the due diligence review with
respect to the two companies.

        On August 23, 2016, AAM and MPG entered into a mutual confidentiality agreement containing a two-year standstill restricting each
of AAM's and MPG's ability to, among other things, acquire securities in the other and seek to control or influence the other's management
or the voting of any securities of the other party. American Securities also agreed to a one-year standstill with respect to AAM.

        On August 30, 2016, Company A delivered a revised, all cash written offer to acquire all of the outstanding equity of MPG at a price in
the range of $16.36 to $20 per share of MPG common stock, subject to the completion of Company A's due diligence review of MPG, or, in
the alternative, to acquire a majority interest in MPG with the expectation of subsequently consummating a series of follow-on transactions.
Following discussion with members of the MPG board of directors and MPG management, including with respect to the fact that Company
A's offer continued to be less than the latest offer from AAM, on the same day, representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch communicated to
representatives of Company A, on behalf of MPG, that Company A's offer continued to undervalue MPG and was inadequate, and that
Company A would need to provide a single purchase price (rather than a range) in its offer, but that Company A should consider delivering
a revised offer.

        On August 31, 2016, Mr. Thanopoulos met with Messrs. Dauch and Simonte in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, to further discuss the
potential terms of the proposed transaction involving AAM and MPG.

        On September 7, 2016, members of management of MPG, including Mr. Thanopoulos, Mr. Grimm and MPG Chief Financial Officer
Mark Blaufuss and Messrs. Penn and Easton met in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, with members of AAM management, including
Messrs. Dauch, Simonte and Willemse, and AAM Chief Financial Officer Christopher May, and representatives of a consulting firm
engaged by AAM, and conducted management presentations for each other regarding their respective businesses as well as MPG's bases for
its belief that AAM's July 29 offer undervalued MPG and was deemed inadequate. Representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch and Greenhill
also participated. Following the meeting, representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch requested that AAM submit an updated proposal with a
single purchase price, rather than a range.

        On September 8 and 9, 2016, AAM and MPG exchanged initial requests for due diligence information via their respective financial
advisors.

        On September 9, 2016, at a telephonic meeting of the AAM board of directors, members of AAM management and representatives of
Greenhill provided the AAM board with an update on the status of discussions with MPG. At the conclusion of the meeting, the AAM
board of directors directed AAM management to continue discussions regarding a potential acquisition of MPG and authorized Mr. Dauch
to increase AAM's offer price to up to $21.25 per share, comprised of approximately 60% cash and 40% shares of AAM common stock. To
address discussions between Messrs. Penn and Dauch regarding American Securities' representation rights on the AAM board of directors,
the AAM board of directors further authorized Mr. Dauch to offer American Securities the right to nominate two directors to the AAM
board following any potential transaction for so long as American Securities maintained a meaningful equity position in the combined
company.

        On September 12, 2016, BofA Merrill Lynch delivered a presentation to Greenhill (based on information provided by MPG) that
highlighted the potential value creation that, in their view, could

result from an acquisition of MPG by AAM due to a number of factors, including the reduction of AAM's customer concentration,
improved financial metrics, an enhanced public market profile and potential cost synergies. The presentation included preliminary financial
analyses performed by BofA Merrill Lynch on the basis of information provided by MPG and based on an illustrative offer price of $24.00
per share of MPG common stock and BofA Merrill Lynch's views regarding the extent of AAM's capacity to finance the cash portion of the
consideration to be paid to MPG stockholders.

        On September 16, 2016, AAM delivered to MPG a revised written offer (which we refer to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as
AAM's September 16 offer) to acquire all of the outstanding equity of MPG at an increased stock price of $21.25 per share of MPG
common stock, comprised of $12.63 to $13.34 per share of cash (representing aggregate cash consideration of $900 million to $950 million)
and the remainder in shares of AAM common stock. This represented merger consideration of approximately 59% in cash and 41% in
shares assuming $900 million of aggregate cash consideration and 63% in cash and 37% in shares assuming $950 million of aggregate cash
consideration. AAM's September 16 offer maintained that AAM was willing to give American Securities the right to nominate one director
to the AAM board of directors following any potential transaction for so long as American Securities maintained a meaningful equity
position in the combined company. AAM's September 16 offer also indicated that AAM expected to complete its due diligence review and
finalize documentation in connection with the potential transaction by early November 2016.

        On September 19, 2016, following discussions between representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch, members of the MPG board of
directors and MPG management, those members of the MPG board of directors indicated that $22.00 per share of MPG common stock may
be acceptable to the MPG board of directors. Mr. Thanopoulos then communicated to Mr. Dauch that AAM's September 16 offer was still
inadequate and would need to be increased for MPG to consider continuing with a potential transaction.

        On September 19, 2016, Messrs. Dauch and Penn had a telephone conversation during which Mr. Penn, at the direction of the MPG
board of directors, proposed a purchase price of $24.00 per share of MPG common stock, consisting of $12.00 per share in cash and $12.00
per share in AAM common stock. During this conversation, Mr. Dauch informed Mr. Penn that AAM would not agree to pay $24.00 and
reiterated AAM's current offer of $21.25 per share of MPG common stock.

        From September 21 through September 23, 2016, Messrs. Dauch and Penn held a series of telephone conversations during which
Mr. Penn indicated that MPG may be willing to proceed on the basis of an offer at $22.00 per share of MPG common stock, consisting of
$13.50 per share in cash and the remainder in shares of AAM common stock. Mr. Penn also insisted that American Securities have the right
to designate a number of the members of the AAM board of directors following any potential transaction that would be proportionate to
American Securities' equity position in AAM immediately following the consummation of the transaction and for so long as American
Securities and its affiliates owned at least a certain ownership percentage of AAM's outstanding common stock. Mr. Penn proposed that
American Securities be entitled to designate three directors on an enlarged ten-member AAM board of directors or four directors on a
twelve-member AAM board of directors, and during the course of multiple exchanges, proposed, among other things, that such number of
designees would not change for so long as American Securities and its affiliates owned at least 5% of the outstanding shares of AAM
common stock. Mr. Dauch did not commit to any particular initial number of designees, but suggested, among other things, that AAM
might be willing to consider permitting American Securities to maintain such initial number of designees for so long as American Securities
and its affiliates owned at least 10% of the outstanding shares of AAM common stock.

        On September 23, 2016, the AAM board of directors met telephonically. AAM management provided an update on the status of
discussions with MPG and American Securities since September 9, 2016 and the proposed terms of the potential transaction.
Representatives of Greenhill also provided the AAM board of directors with a summary of certain preliminary financial analyses regarding
the

potential transaction. At the meeting, the AAM board of directors authorized AAM management to deliver a revised offer to acquire all of
the outstanding equity of MPG at a price of up to $22 per share of MPG common stock, with the merger consideration proposed to be
comprised of approximately 61% cash and 39% shares of AAM common stock, and to offer American Securities the right to nominate up to
four directors on an enlarged twelve-member AAM board of directors following such acquisition.

        Later on September 23, 2016, Mr. Dauch spoke with Mr. Penn telephonically to deliver a revised offer (which we refer to in this joint
proxy statement/prospectus as AAM's September 23 offer) to acquire all of the outstanding equity of MPG at a price of $22 per share of
MPG common stock, with the merger consideration comprised of approximately 61% cash and 39% shares of AAM common stock.
Mr. Dauch stated that as part of AAM's September 23 offer, AAM was willing to give American Securities the right to nominate three
members of an enlarged eleven-member AAM board of directors following such acquisition and for so long as American Securities and its
affiliates owned at least 7.5% of the shares of AAM common stock outstanding. Mr. Dauch indicated to Mr. Penn that AAM's September 23
offer was AAM's best and final offer.

        Between September 24, 2016 and September 26, 2016, Mr. Dauch had a series of separate telephone conversations with each of
Messrs. Penn and Thanopoulos to discuss the terms of AAM's September 23 offer, ongoing due diligence, the proposed timing of the
transaction and certain of the other terms and conditions of the proposed transaction.

        During September and October 2016, AAM and MPG, with the assistance of their respective financial, legal and other advisors,
continued to conduct legal, financial, operational and other due diligence on each other, including visits to each other's key production
facilities, and held regular telephonic discussions regarding due diligence matters.

        On September 26, 2016, a representative of Company A contacted Mr. Thanopoulos to discuss certain considerations relating to a
potential transaction between MPG and Company A, including, among other things, potential synergies and valuation matters.

        On September 27, 2016, the MPG board of directors met to review and discuss with representatives of Weil and representatives of
BofA Merrill Lynch AAM's September 23 offer as well as the results and current status of BofA Merrill Lynch's outreach to certain other
parties identified as potentially being interested in a strategic transaction with MPG and the potential timeline for the proposed transaction
with AAM. A representative of Weil also reviewed and discussed with the members of the MPG board of directors the directors' fiduciary
duties and potential key terms that may be negotiated in connection with the potential transaction with AAM. Following discussions among
the members of the MPG board of directors and their advisors with respect to, among other things, the premium represented by AAM's
September 23 offer over the share price of MPG common stock, the implied adjusted enterprise value for MPG represented by such
proposed offer price and the strategic rationale for the potential transaction and potential synergies, the MPG board of directors determined
to proceed with mutual due diligence based on AAM's September 23 offer and authorized MPG management and MPG's legal and financial
advisors to continue negotiations regarding the potential terms of a transaction and to continue due diligence with respect thereto.

        On September 30, 2016, David Barnes, General Counsel, Secretary and Chief Compliance Officer of AAM, met with Thomas M.
Dono, Jr, Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary of MPG, to discuss legal due diligence and other legal matters in
connection with the proposed transaction.

        On October 3, 2016, each of AAM and MPG opened to representatives of the other company and their advisors access to an electronic
data room for the purposes of permitting further due diligence on their respective companies.

        On October 5, 2016, Messrs. Dauch and Willemse met with Mr. Thanopoulos to discuss potential synergy opportunities from a

and Penn spoke telephonically to discuss a number of matters related to American Securities' and its affiliates' ownership stake in AAM
following the proposed transaction, including director designation rights and registration rights as well as voting and standstill obligations
that AAM proposed would apply to American Securities and its affiliates.

        On October 6, 2016, Shearman sent to Weil a term sheet reflecting the proposed terms of a stockholders' agreement that would be
entered into between AAM and American Securities in connection with the consummation of the proposed transaction. The term sheet
included, among other things, proposed terms with respect to certain governance rights, including American Securities' right to designate a
number of directors to the AAM board of directors, and registration rights that American Securities and its affiliates would have with
respect to shares of AAM common stock received in the proposed transaction, as well as proposed voting and standstill obligations that
would apply to American Securities and its affiliates with respect to shares of AAM common stock owned by them following the proposed
transaction.

        On October 10, 2016, Shearman sent Weil initial drafts of a merger agreement and a voting agreement that AAM proposed be entered
into between AAM and an affiliate of American Securities, in each case, in connection with the proposed transaction.

        On October 13, 2016, following discussions among representatives of MPG, American Securities, Weil and BofA Merrill Lynch, BofA
Merrill Lynch communicated to Greenhill certain key transaction concerns identified by MPG with respect to the drafts of the merger
agreement and voting agreement and the stockholders' agreement term sheet as previously provided to MPG, including, among other things,
with respect to the treatment of outstanding MPG equity awards, the ability of MPG to solicit or consider alternative transactions following
the execution of definitive documentation in connection with the proposed transaction, the measurement period for determining the
exchange ratio, the inclusion of a provision in the merger agreement that would require MPG to submit the potential transaction to a vote of
its stockholders even if the MPG board of directors had changed its recommendation with respect thereto, the inability of MPG to terminate
the merger agreement in order to accept a superior proposal, the termination fees that could become payable under the merger agreement,
and the scope of the proposed standstill applicable to American Securities and its affiliates and its board designation rights under the
stockholders' agreement.

        On the same day, Company A delivered to BofA Merrill Lynch a revised, written all cash offer to acquire all of the outstanding equity
of MPG for a stock price in the range of $21 to $22 per share of MPG common stock. Company A's offer was contingent on MPG granting
Company A exclusivity through the end of 2016 with respect to the negotiation of a potential transaction and indicated that Company A
expected that it would be able to complete its due diligence review of MPG, finalize its financing and negotiate definitive documentation by
the end of 2016. In addition, Company A reiterated its expectation that key members of MPG management and other employees would
remain with MPG and acquire an equity interest in the combined company following the consummation of any transaction. However,
Company A did not specify what information it would need to complete its due diligence review with respect to MPG. Following
discussions with members of the MPG board of directors and MPG management, later that same day, representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch
communicated to Company A that Company A would need to provide a single purchase price, rather than a range, in its offer, that MPG
would not grant Company A exclusivity and that Company A should state the information it would require in due diligence in order to
increase any offer for MPG.

        On October 16, 2016, following discussions between representatives of Weil and Shearman with respect to certain of the key
transaction issues identified by BofA Merrill Lynch to Greenhill, Weil sent Shearman a material issues list relating to the draft transaction
documents and stockholders' agreement term sheet.

        From October 17 to October 23, 2016, the parties, assisted by their respective legal and financial advisors, negotiated certain of the
critical terms of the proposed transaction included in the material issues list sent by Weil to Shearman.

        On October 20, 2016, Company A delivered to representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch a further revised, written all cash offer that
would result in MPG stockholders receiving a stock price in the range of $21 to $22.50 per share of MPG common stock. Company A
indicated that it would be prepared to consider such transaction on a non-exclusive basis with the intention of entering into definitive
documentation with respect to such a transaction prior to the end of 2016, but that it would require several weeks to complete its due
diligence review in connection with a potential transaction in order to be able to deliver a final offer. Company A also provided a support
letter from its proposed financing source. Following discussions with members of the MPG board of directors and MPG management,
representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch again communicated to Company A that Company A would need to submit an offer at a single
purchase price per share, rather than a range. In addition, on several occasions representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch requested that
Company A indicate what information would be required in connection with its due diligence review, but Company A never provided any
specific requests.

        On October 23, 2016, Weil sent Shearman revised drafts of the merger agreement and voting agreement following a series of
telephonic negotiations among the parties and their advisors and reflecting MPG's positions with respect to the terms and conditions of these
agreements. On October 25, 2016, Weil also sent Shearman an initial draft of the stockholders' agreement reflecting the terms discussed
among the parties and their advisors during such negotiations and MPG's position with respect to the other terms and conditions of such
agreement. During this period, the parties also continued their ongoing respective due diligence reviews, including legal, financial,
operational and other due diligence.

        On October 27, 2016, senior management of AAM and MPG as well as representatives of American Securities and their respective
legal and financial advisors met, at the offices of Shearman in New York, to discuss certain open issues with respect to the proposed
transaction, including, among other things, the treatment of outstanding MPG equity awards, the regulatory risk associated with the
transaction and actions AAM and/or MPG may be required to take to obtain certain required regulatory approvals, certain conditions to the
consummation of the proposed transaction, the commitment of the affiliate of American Securities to vote in favor of the transaction, the
fees payable by the respective parties in the event the merger agreement were terminated in certain circumstances, the exchange ratio to be
used in connection with the proposed transaction in order to reflect the agreed merger consideration of $22.00 per share for each share of
MPG common stock, the restrictions on the conduct of each party's business prior to the consummation of the transaction, and American
Securities' board designation rights, voting obligations and transfer restrictions under the stockholders' agreement. During the meeting,
AAM and MPG agreed, among other things, to base the exchange ratio to be used in connection with the potential transaction on an agreed
$17.00 per share price of AAM common stock, resulting in an exchange ratio of $13.50 in cash and 0.5 shares of AAM common stock for
each share of MPG common stock payable in connection with the proposed merger.

        Later on October 27, 2016, the MPG board of directors held a telephonic meeting, in which members of MPG management and
representatives of Weil and BofA Merrill Lynch participated, to discuss and summarize the negotiations with respect to the proposed
transaction with AAM that had occurred that day and to engage in a discussion of the terms of the revised offer from Company A. The
MPG board of directors, following discussions with its legal and financial advisors, determined that due to, among other things, the
purchase price range included in Company A's offer, the significant amount of time it would take Company A to finalize its due diligence
review and negotiate a definitive transaction agreement, Company A's failure to identify the information it would require to complete its
due diligence review and concerns with regulatory approval requirements of a potential transaction with Company A, that MPG should
proceed with negotiating the terms of the potential transaction with

AAM. At the meeting, the participants also discussed the proposed timeline to finalize definitive documentation in connection with the
proposed transaction with AAM and the potential timeline with respect to a transaction with Company A, and the ability of MPG to respond
to unsolicited offers under the proposed terms of the merger agreement with AAM, including from Company A.

        On October 28, 2016, Weil sent a revised draft of the voting agreement to Shearman reflecting the discussions among the parties at the
October 27 meeting.

        Also on October 28, 2016, at a meeting of the AAM board of directors, AAM management and representatives of Shearman, Greenhill
and a consulting firm engaged by AAM made presentations regarding the proposed transaction, including, among others, a presentation by
AAM management regarding the results of its due diligence review and the status of financing discussions with JPMorgan Chase Bank,
N.A. (which we refer to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as JPMorgan), a presentation by Greenhill regarding the financial aspects of
the proposed transaction and the pro forma financial profile of the combined company, a presentation by the consulting firm regarding the
potential synergy opportunities of the combined company, and a presentation by Shearman regarding the AAM board of directors' fiduciary
duties in connection with the proposed transaction, terms of the transaction documents and open issues remaining in the negotiation thereof.
Following these presentations and further discussion among the participants at the meeting, the AAM board of directors authorized AAM
management to complete the negotiation of the transaction documents, subject to final approval of the terms and conditions by the AAM
board of directors.

        On October 29, 2016, MPG delivered to AAM and Weil provided to Shearman an initial draft of the MPG disclosure schedule to be
delivered in connection with the merger agreement. Later that same day, Shearman sent Weil revised drafts of the merger agreement and
voting agreement reflecting discussions among the parties at and since the October 27 meeting as well as an initial draft of the AAM
disclosure schedule to be delivered in connection with the merger agreement.

        On the morning of October 30, 2016, the MPG board of directors met telephonically to review and discuss with members of MPG
senior management and representatives of Weil and BofA Merrill Lynch the status of discussions with AAM and the proposed terms of the
transaction. The MPG board of directors discussed with BofA Merrill Lynch the process conducted to consider various strategic
alternatives, including the review of MPG's continued operation on a standalone basis given its financial profile and potential constraints
associated with such operation, the other potential counterparties contacted by representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch regarding a potential
strategic transaction with MPG, none of which, other than Company A, had expressed any definitive interest in pursuing a potential
transaction with MPG, and the consideration of whether there were any other potential counterparties that may be interested in a potential
transaction with MPG that would provide for greater value than the potential transaction involving AAM. A representative of BofA Merrill
Lynch then discussed with the MPG board of directors the status of negotiations with AAM, and the terms and status of the offer received
from Company A, including that representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch had requested that Company A increase its proposed purchase price
but that Company A had indicated it would require additional time and information about MPG, which information still had not been
specified by Company A, in order to provide a revised offer and that the upper end of its proposed purchase price range was the maximum
purchase price Company A would be willing to offer, subject to due diligence. A representative of BofA Merrill Lynch also reviewed with
the MPG board of directors the status of the ongoing mutual due diligence review with AAM, the strategic rationale for the proposed
transaction with AAM and the preliminary results of BofA Merrill Lynch's valuation analysis of the proposed transaction with AAM and the
potential pro forma position of the combined company. Next, a representative of Weil reviewed with the MPG board of directors the
proposed terms of the transaction, including with respect to the proposed merger consideration, treatment of outstanding MPG equity
awards, the ability of MPG to consider alternative transactions (including an unsolicited offer from Company A if Company A were to
make such an offer), the ability of the MPG board of directors to change its recommendation, the obligation of AAM to agree to certain
divestitures if

required in order to obtain required regulatory approvals, the parties' respective termination rights and the relative termination fees the
parties' must pay if the merger agreement were terminated in certain circumstances. A representative of Weil also provided an overview of
the current terms of the voting agreement and stockholders' agreement proposed to be entered into between the affiliate of American
Securities and AAM in connection with the transaction. Following discussion among members of the MPG board of directors and its legal
and financial advisors, the MPG board of directors determined that, given the uncertainty with respect to the value of the offer from
Company A, as well as the anticipated time required to finalize a potential transaction with Company A, Company A's failure to specify its
due diligence requirements, the additional regulatory requirements and uncertainties with respect to consummating any potential transaction
with Company A, and the ability of Company A to make a subsequent unsolicited offer to acquire MPG under the proposed terms of the
merger agreement with AAM, MPG should continue to negotiate and seek to finalize the terms of the proposed transaction with AAM.

        Later on October 30, 2016, AAM delivered to MPG and American Securities a draft of the commitment papers in connection with
AAM's debt financing for the proposed transaction.

        From October 30, 2016 through the early morning of November 3, 2016, the parties, assisted by their respective legal and financial
advisors, continued to negotiate the terms of, and the legal advisors continued to exchange drafts of, the transaction agreements and the
respective disclosure schedules to be delivered in connection with the merger agreement, and the parties and their respective advisors
completed their respective due diligence reviews. These negotiations covered various aspects of the transaction, including, among other
things, the representations and warranties made by the parties, the restrictions on the conduct of each party's business, the scope of the non-
solicitation restrictions contained in the merger and voting agreements, the parties' respective matching rights with respect to competing
proposals, MPG's obligations to assist AAM in obtaining its debt financing for the transaction, certain termination provisions and the
triggers of each party's termination rights, the ability to receive a termination fee and expense reimbursement, the outside date for the
proposed transaction and the divestiture obligations of AAM, and the disclosures made by each of AAM and MPG in their respective
disclosure schedules.

        On the afternoon of November 1, 2016, the MPG board of directors held a telephonic meeting to resume their discussion and
consideration of the proposed transaction. Members of senior management and representatives of Weil and BofA Merrill Lynch also
participated in the meeting. The MPG board of directors again discussed with BofA Merrill Lynch the process conducted to consider
various strategic alternatives, including the review of MPG's continued operation on a standalone basis given its financial profile and
potential constraints associated with such operation, the other potential counterparties contacted by representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch
regarding a potential strategic transaction with MPG, none of which, other than Company A, had expressed any definitive interest in
pursuing a potential transaction with MPG, and the consideration of whether there were any other potential counterparties that may be
interested in a potential transaction with MPG that would provide for greater value than the potential transaction involving AAM. The MPG
board of directors next discussed with BofA Merrill Lynch the due diligence review of AAM by MPG management and MPG's advisors,
including the various AAM facilities that had been toured and the discussions that had taken place in connection with MPG's due diligence
review. BofA Merrill Lynch then reviewed with the MPG board of directors its preliminary financial analysis of the merger consideration to
be received by MPG stockholders in connection with the transaction. The MPG board of directors discussed with representatives of BofA
Merrill Lynch the procedures used by BofA Merrill Lynch to perform their preliminary financial analyses, the results of the efforts of BofA
Merrill Lynch to solicit counterparty interest in a potential transaction involving MPG, and BofA Merrill Lynch's view, based on such
results, that receipt in the near term of an alternative proposal providing for greater value than AAM's offer was unlikely. Next, a
representative of Weil reviewed and discussed with the MPG board of directors the directors' fiduciary duties, a summary of the terms of the
proposed transaction and the

principal terms of the various agreements to be entered into in connection with the proposed transaction, including a description of the
transaction structure, exchange ratio, representations and warranties, interim operating covenants, termination rights and fees and expense
reimbursement obligations, the closing conditions, the voting agreement to be entered into by the affiliate of American Securities, and the
stockholders' agreement granting American Securities certain governance and registration rights with respect to AAM common stock to be
received in the merger following the consummation of the merger. A representative of Weil also identified and discussed with the members
of the MPG board of directors the remaining open issues in the various transaction agreements. Following discussion among the directors,
members of MPG management and MPG's advisors, the MPG board of directors instructed MPG management (with the assistance of
MPG's advisors) to complete negotiation of the remaining issues and to finalize the terms of the various transaction agreements.

        In the evening of November 2, 2016, the MPG board of directors held a telephonic meeting to review and discuss the final terms of and
to consider and vote upon the proposed transaction. A representative of Weil provided the MPG board of directors with an update on the
status of the various transaction documents and the parties' negotiations and reviewed with the MPG board of directors the material changes
to the terms of such documents since the MPG board of directors' meeting the previous day, including, among other things, the agreement
that the outside date for the transaction would be 9 months following the execution of the merger agreement, subject to a three-month
extension if certain required regulatory approvals had not been received, the parties' discussions regarding a potential exception to the
material adverse effect standard related to MPG's due diligence review of AAM, and certain developments related to a procedural failure by
MPG to make a historical tax election and the parties' agreement that AAM would not be required to pay a termination fee if the transaction
fails to be consummated due to AAM's failure to obtain its required financing if the cause of such failure related to such tax election failure.
Next, representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch presented their financial analysis of the merger consideration and confirmed to the MPG board
of directors that there had been no material changes to such analyses from the presentation made by BofA Merrill Lynch to the MPG board
of directors the previous day. Representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch then delivered orally to the MPG board of directors BofA Merrill
Lynch's opinion, later confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated November 2, 2016, to the effect that, as of the date of, and subject to
the various assumptions and limitations described in its opinion, the merger consideration to be received by holders of MPG common stock
in the merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. The opinion of BofA Merrill Lynch is more fully described in the
section titled "The Merger—Opinion of MPG's Financial Advisor" beginning on page 85. Following discussion, the MPG board of directors
unanimously approved the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby on the terms described therein and recommended
that the MPG stockholders vote for the adoption of the merger agreement and the approval of the transactions contemplated thereby at the
special meeting of MPG stockholders to be held to consider and vote on the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby,
subject to the MPG board of directors' right to change its recommendation in the event of a superior proposal or intervening event on the
terms set forth in the merger agreement. For further information concerning the factors considered by the MPG board of directors in
reaching its decision that the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger, are in the best interests of
the MPG stockholders, its decision to approve the merger agreement and its decision to recommend that MPG stockholders vote to adopt
the merger agreement and approve the transactions contemplated thereby, see "—MPG's Reasons for the Merger and Recommendation of
the MPG Board of Directors" beginning on page 74.

        Also in the evening of November 2, 2016, the AAM board of directors held a telephonic meeting to review and discuss the final terms
of and to consider and vote upon the proposed transaction. Representatives of Shearman reviewed for the board of directors their fiduciary
duties in considering the proposed transaction before providing an update on the status of the various transaction documents

and identifying the few remaining significant issues outstanding in the negotiations and MPG's most recent proposals for the resolution
thereof. The AAM board of directors discussed these remaining issues and the relative risks of the parties' positions with respect thereto and
provided Shearman with its preferred resolution of each such issue. Next, representatives of Greenhill presented their financial analysis of
the merger consideration and confirmed to the AAM board of directors that there had been no material changes to such analyses from the
presentation made by Greenhill during the October 28 meeting of the AAM board of directors. Representatives of Greenhill then delivered
orally to the AAM board of directors Greenhill's opinion, which was subsequently confirmed in writing, that, as of the date of the opinion
and based on and subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters and factors considered and limitations and qualifications
on the review undertaken set forth therein, the merger consideration to be paid by AAM to the holders of the shares of MPG common stock
pursuant to the merger agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to AAM. Following further discussion, the AAM board of
directors unanimously approved the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby on the terms described therein and
recommended that the AAM stockholders vote for the AAM share issuance. For further information concerning the factors considered by
the AAM board of directors in reaching its decision that the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the
merger, are in the best interests of the AAM stockholders, its decision to approve the merger agreement and its decision to recommend that
AAM stockholders vote to approve the AAM share issuance, see "—AAM's Reasons for the Merger and Recommendation of the AAM
Board of Directors" beginning on page 70.

        Following MPG's and AAM's respective board meetings on November 2, 2016, and through the morning of November 3, 2016, the
parties finalized and entered into the merger agreement and voting agreement and finalized the terms of the disclosure schedules delivered
by each party and the form of stockholders' agreement. Before the opening of trading on the NYSE on November 3, 2016, AAM and MPG
issued a joint press release announcing their entry into definitive agreements with respect to the transaction.

AAM's Reasons for the Merger and Recommendation of the AAM Board of Directors 

        At a special meeting of the AAM board of directors held on November 2, 2016, the AAM board of directors unanimously determined
that the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement are advisable, fair to, and in the best interests of,
AAM and AAM stockholders and unanimously approved the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.
The AAM board of directors unanimously recommends that AAM stockholders vote "FOR" the AAM share issuance proposal and "FOR"
the AAM adjournment proposal.

        In reaching its decision that the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement are advisable, fair to,
and in the best interests of, AAM and AAM stockholders, and to recommend that AAM stockholders vote to approve the AAM share
issuance, the AAM board of directors consulted with AAM management and AAM's financial, legal and other advisors and, at its
November 2, 2016 meeting and at other meetings at which it considered the proposed merger, the AAM board of directors considered a
number of factors, including, but not limited to, those listed below:

• the complementary businesses of AAM and MPG, and the view that the combined company will form a premier, global
Tier 1 supplier; 

• the view that the combined company will be a global leader in powertrain, drivetrain and driveline solutions and will have
the ability to deliver a wide range of high quality, highly engineered components, modules and sub-systems across multiple
engine, transmission and driveline applications;

        The AAM board of directors also considered the following potentially negative factors associated with the merger:

• the right of the MPG board of directors under the merger agreement to change its recommendation to the MPG stockholders
that they adopt the merger agreement and approve the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement in certain
circumstances, as more fully described under "The Merger Agreement—No Solicitation—Board Recommendation Change"
beginning on page 132, and the fact that the AS stockholder is not required to vote its shares of MPG common stock in favor
of the adoption of the merger agreement and approval of the transactions contemplated thereby in the event of any such
change in recommendation, as more fully described under "The Voting Agreement" beginning on page 155; 

• the right of the MPG board of directors to terminate the merger agreement in certain circumstances, as more fully described
under "The Merger Agreement—Termination of the Merger Agreement—Termination" beginning on page 134; 

• the fact that AAM will incur substantial indebtedness in connection with financing the merger that will, at least in the short
term, among other things, reduce funds available for potential acquisitions and general corporate purposes and potentially
increase the cost of capital;

• the fact that future global and/or North American light vehicle production volumes may be lower than those assumed by
AAM, which could negatively impact the combined company's profitability, cash flow and ability to reduce indebtedness; 

• the fact that the exchange ratio for shares of MPG common stock is fixed and will not adjust for any increase in the trading
price of shares of AAM common stock prior to completion of the merger; 

• the fact that AAM stockholders will have a reduced ownership and voting interest in AAM after the merger and will exercise
less influence over the board of directors, management and policies of AAM; 

• the fact that AAM is obligated to pay MPG a termination fee ranging from $50,897,000 to $101,794,000 depending on the
circumstances giving rise to the termination of the merger agreement, as more fully described under "The Merger Agreement
—Payment of Certain Fees and Expenses—Payment of Termination Fees" beginning on page 138; 

• the fact that AAM is obligated to reimburse MPG for up to $15 million of its documented and reasonable out-of-pocket fees
and expenses under certain circumstances, as more fully described under "The Merger Agreement—Payment of Certain Fees
and Expenses—Payment of Certain Expenses" beginning on page 140; 

• the potential diversion of management resources from operational matters and the opportunity costs associated with the
merger prior to the completion or abandonment of the merger; 

• the fact that the transaction requires adoption of the merger agreement and approval of the transactions contemplated by the
merger agreement by MPG stockholders, which may not be obtained; 

• the fact that the merger agreement contains certain customary restrictions on the ability of AAM to conduct its business in
the period between signing and closing, in that MPG's consent is required in respect of the issuance of shares of AAM
capital stock other than for limited purposes, certain acquisitions that would be material to AAM, and other matters
commonly subject to pre-closing restrictions, as more fully described under "The Merger Agreement—Conduct of Business
Pending the Merger—Conduct of Business by AAM" beginning on page 143; 

• the risk that the potential benefits of the merger may not be realized or that AAM will not be successful in implementing its
business plan for the combined company; 

• the risks arising from the challenges of integrating the businesses, management teams, strategies, cultures and organizations
of the two companies, including the possibility that the merger and the resulting integration process could result in the loss
of key employees, the disruption of on-going business and the loss of customers; 

• the risk that the pendency of the merger or announcement of its completion could adversely affect AAM's relationships with
its customers, suppliers and any other persons with whom AAM has a business relationship, or pose difficulties in attracting
and retaining key employees; 

• the risk that the merger might not be completed on a timely basis or at all despite the parties' efforts, and, if the merger is not
completed by the outside date for completion of the merger, the fact that the merger agreement may be terminated by either
party; 

• the risks inherent in requesting regulatory approvals from certain government agencies both in and outside of the United
States, that the required regulatory approvals will not be obtained or that obtaining the required regulatory approvals will
significantly delay the completion of the merger;

• the fact that AAM is required under the merger agreement to agree to certain divestitures or dispositions of assets of MPG
and its subsidiaries if required to obtain certain required regulatory consents and approvals, as more fully described under
"The Merger Agreement—Additional Terms—Reasonable Best Efforts" beginning on page 147; 

• the impact of costs and expenses related to the merger, including integration expenses, on AAM's financial position; and 

• other applicable risks described in the section of this joint proxy statement/prospectus entitled "Risk Factors" beginning on
page 34.

        In the judgment of the AAM board of directors, however, these potential risks were significantly offset by the potential benefits of the
merger discussed above.

        The foregoing discussion is not intended to be exhaustive, but AAM believes it addresses the material information and factors
considered by the AAM board of directors in its consideration of the merger, including factors that may support the merger, as well as
factors that may weigh against it. In view of the variety of factors and the amount of information considered, the AAM board of directors
did not find it practicable to quantify or otherwise assign relative weights to and did not make specific assessments of the factors considered
in reaching its determination, and individual members of the AAM board of directors may have given different weights to different factors.
The AAM board of directors did not reach any specific conclusion with respect to any of the factors or reasons considered.

        The above factors are not listed in any particular order of priority. This explanation of the factors and reasoning set forth above
contains forward-looking statements and should be read in conjunction with the section of this joint proxy statement/prospectus entitled
"Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" beginning on page 42.

MPG's Reasons for the Merger and Recommendation of the MPG Board of Directors 

        At a special meeting of the MPG board of directors held on November 2, 2016, the MPG board of directors unanimously approved the
merger agreement, including the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and declared the merger
agreement and the merger advisable. The MPG board of directors unanimously recommends that MPG stockholders vote "FOR" each of
the merger proposal, the MPG merger-related compensation proposal and the MPG adjournment proposal.

        Throughout the process of considering the proposed merger, and in reaching its decision to unanimously approve the merger
agreement, including the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, its decision to declare the merger
agreement and the merger advisable and its decision to recommend that MPG stockholders vote to adopt the merger agreement and approve
the transactions contemplated thereby, the MPG board of directors consulted with MPG management as well as MPG's financial and legal
advisors and carefully considered a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, the following:

• the value of the merger consideration to be received by MPG stockholders as determined at that date, representing a
premium of 50.2% to the closing price of MPG common stock of $14.65 on November 1, 2016, a 43.3% premium over the
volume-weighted average price for shares of MPG common stock over the 90-trading-day period ended November 1, 2016
and a 6.7x multiple of MPG's $493 million 2016 pro forma adjusted EBITDAP estimated by MPG management; 

• the fact that a significant portion of the merger consideration will be paid in cash, providing certainty of value with respect to
the cash portion of the merger consideration and enabling MPG stockholders to realize value for a significant portion of their
investment immediately upon the completion of the merger;

• the opportunity afforded by the stock portion of the merger consideration for MPG stockholders to participate in the future
earnings and growth of the combined company and future appreciation in the value of AAM common stock following the
merger; 

• the fact that American Securities had agreed to support the transaction and that the AS Stockholder had agreed to vote 50%
of its shares of MPG common stock in favor of the transaction, and that the remaining 50% of such shares would be voted
proportionally with the other stockholders of MPG; 

• the fact that the adoption of the merger agreement and approval of the transactions contemplated thereby is subject to the
approval of MPG stockholders and that MPG stockholders other than American Securities have the ability to vote against
the adoption of the merger agreement for any reason; 

• the belief that the merger is more favorable to MPG stockholders than the other strategic alternatives available, which belief
was formed in part based on the responses to outreach by BofA Merrill Lynch to parties determined by MPG's management,
after discussion with BofA Merrill Lynch, to be the parties most likely to be interested in a strategic transaction with MPG; 

• the expectation that the merger will create a global leader in advanced powertrain, drivetrain and driveline solutions with a
more diversified customer base and end-markets than MPG on a stand-alone basis, resulting in the ability of MPG
stockholders to participate in the future earnings and growth of the combined company; 

• the benefits to the combined company that could result from the merger, including the increased market capitalization,
improved access to the capital markets, increased EBITDA growth potential, enhanced free cash flow generation, expanded
expertise in light-weighting, fuel efficiency, vehicle safety and performance solutions technologies providing for improved
innovation and product capabilities, increased diversity in the products offered and geographic areas served and the potential
to realize certain synergies; 

• the expectation that the combined company will have an enhanced public market profile as a result of its increased scale
(including pro forma EBITDA), expanded manufacturing footprint, including the breadth, scale and complementary
technologies of MPG and AAM, and an improved credit profile with moderate leverage and strong cash flow; 

• the expectation that the combined company would achieve approximately $100-120 million in synergies by 2018, including
from reduced corporate overhead, elimination of redundant public company costs and elimination of SG&A, opportunities
for savings from the combined company's ability to leverage its larger scale to combine global purchasing and undertake
insourcing initiatives, and avoided capital expenditures from capacity optimization; 

• the financial presentation by BofA Merrill Lynch and the opinion of BofA Merrill Lynch, delivered orally to the MPG board
of directors on November 2, 2016, and subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion, dated November 2, 2016, to
the effect that, as of such date and based on and subject to the various assumptions and limitations described in such opinion
and more fully described in the section titled "The Merger—Opinion of MPG's Financial Advisor" beginning on page 85, the
merger consideration to be received by holders of MPG common stock was fair, from a financial point of view, to such
holders; 

• the right of the MPG board of directors under the merger agreement to, in response to unsolicited offers and competing
acquisition proposals, provide information to, and discuss or negotiate alternative transactions with, third parties in certain
circumstances, as more fully described under "The Merger Agreement—No Solicitation" beginning on page 129; 

• the right of the MPG board of directors under the merger agreement to change its recommendation that MPG stockholders
vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement

Agreement—No Solicitation" beginning on page 129;

• the fact that the AS Stockholder would not be obligated to vote its shares of MPG common stock in favor of the adoption of
the merger agreement and the approval of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement in the event that the MPG
board of directors changed its recommendation with respect thereto, as more fully described under "The Voting Agreement"
beginning on page 155; 

• the right of the MPG board of directors under the merger agreement to terminate the merger agreement to enter into a
superior acquisition proposal, subject to the payment of a termination fee in certain circumstances, as more fully described
under "The Merger Agreement—Termination of the Merger Agreement" beginning on page 134; 

• the fact that the approximately $51 million termination fee payable in certain circumstances by MPG is equal to
approximately 3.25% of MPG's equity value based on the value of the merger consideration and the reimbursement of
AAM's out-of pocket expenses is capped at $15 million, which the MPG board of directors viewed, after consultation with
MPG's financial and legal advisors, as reasonable and not likely to preclude any other party from making an unsolicited offer
or a competing acquisition proposal; 

• the fact that the obligations of AAM and Merger Sub under the merger agreement to complete the merger are not
conditioned upon receipt of financing and the fact that AAM obtained a commitment letter with respect to the debt financing
necessary to pay the aggregate cash portion of the merger consideration, which, based on the terms of the commitments and
the reputation of the commitment parties, in the judgment of the MPG board of directors, after consultation with MPG's
financial and legal advisors, increases the likelihood of such financings being completed; 

• the fact that the merger agreement expressly contemplates that MPG may, in certain circumstances, obtain specific
performance of AAM's obligations under the merger agreement and will be entitled to receive a termination fee of
approximately $102 million in the event MPG is unable to specifically enforce AAM's and Merger Sub's obligation to cause
the financing to be funded as a result of the financing not being available or there not being sufficient proceeds thereof; 

• the fact that AAM is obligated to pay MPG a termination fee of approximately $51 million in the event the AAM board of
directors were to change its recommendation that the AAM stockholders vote in favor of the AAM share issuance and
approximately $62 million in the event the AAM board of directors were to terminate the merger agreement in order to enter
into a superior acquisition proposal, as more fully described under "The Merger Agreement—Payment of Certain Fees and
Expenses" beginning on page 138; 

• the fact that AAM is obligated to reimburse MPG for up to $15 million in out-of-pocket expenses under certain
circumstances in the event of termination of the merger agreement, as more fully described under "The Merger Agreement—
Payment of Certain Fees and Expenses" beginning on page 138; 

• the fact that AAM is required under the merger agreement to agree to certain divestitures or dispositions of assets of MPG
and its subsidiaries if required to obtain certain required regulatory consents and approvals, as more fully described under
"The Merger Agreement—Additional Terms—Reasonable Best Efforts" beginning on page 147;

regulatory approvals and consents are not

Expenses" beginning on page 138;

American Securities will be appointed to serve on the board of directors of AAM upon completion of the merger and will
therefore have a role in directing the management and policies of the combined company following the merger; and 

• the fact that appraisal rights would be available to holders of MPG common stock under Delaware law.

        The MPG board of directors also considered the following potentially negative factors associated with the merger:

• the lack of opportunity for MPG stockholders to participate in MPG's potential upside as a stand-alone company, other than
indirectly as a part of the combined company through the stock portion of the merger consideration, after the completion of
the merger; 

• the potential decrease of the implied value of the merger consideration which would result from a decrease in the trading
price of AAM common stock because the stock portion of the merger consideration is based on a fixed exchange ratio and
the merger agreement does not provide MPG with a price-based termination right or adjustment for fluctuations in the
trading price of AAM common stock; 

• the execution risks associated with the implementation of the combined company's long term business plan and strategy,
which may be different from the execution risks related only to MPG's business; 

• the risk that the combined company may not be able to successfully integrate the businesses of MPG and AAM and
therefore may not be able to realize the anticipated benefits of the merger; 

• the fact that the transaction structure requires (i) approval of the AAM share issuance by the affirmative vote of holders of a
majority in voting power of the shares of AAM common stock present in person or represented by proxy at the AAM special
meeting and entitled to vote on the AAM share issuance and (ii) adoption of the merger agreement and approval of the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement by the affirmative vote of the majority of the shares of MPG common
stock that are outstanding as of the record date for the MPG special meeting and entitled to vote with respect thereto, either
or both of which may not be obtained; 

• the possibility that AAM will be unable to obtain the financing required for the merger, including the debt financing
proceeds contemplated by the commitment letter it obtained; 

• the possibility that the indebtedness of the combined company will have a material impact on the ability of the combined
company to achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger; 

• the risk that the merger might not be completed on a timely basis or at all despite the parties' efforts, and, if the merger is not
completed, the materially adverse impact such event could have on MPG's financial condition, results of operations,
business condition or stock price; 

• the possible disruption to MPG's business that may result from the pendency of the merger or announcement of its
completion and the resulting distraction of management's attention from the day-to-day operations of the business; 

• the risk that the pendency of the merger or announcement of its completion could adversely affect MPG's relationships with
its customers, suppliers and any other persons with whom MPG has a business relationship, or pose difficulties in attracting
and retaining key employees; 

• the risk of incurring substantial transaction and integration costs in connection with the merger;

merger, which may delay or prevent MPG from undertaking business opportunities that may arise during such interim
period, as more fully described under "The Merger Agreement—Conduct of Business Pending the Merger" beginning on
page 140; 

• the possibility that the $51 million termination fee and the expense reimbursement of up to $15 million payable by MPG in
the event of termination of the merger agreement under certain circumstances, and other provisions in the merger agreement,
might discourage other bidders from making a competing offer to acquire MPG; 

• the fact that some of MPG's directors and executive officers have interests in the merger that are different from, or in
addition to, the interests of MPG stockholders generally, as more fully described under "The Merger—Interests of MPG
Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger" beginning on page 100;

generally be taxable to MPG stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes, as more fully described under "The Merger
—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger" beginning on page 107;

Opinion of AAM's Financial Advisor 

        AAM has retained Greenhill as its financial advisor to advise the AAM board of directors in connection with the merger. At the
meeting of the AAM board of directors on November 2, 2016, Greenhill delivered its oral opinion, which was subsequently confirmed in
writing, that, as of the date of the opinion and based on and subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters and factors
considered and limitations and qualifications on the review undertaken set forth therein, the merger consideration to be paid by AAM to the
holders of the shares of MPG common stock pursuant to the merger agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to AAM.

review undertaken in connection with the opinion, is attached as Annex C to this joint proxy statement/prospectus and is incorporated by
reference herein in its entirety. The summary of Greenhill's opinion that follows is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the
opinion. You are urged to read the opinion in its entirety.

        In arriving at its opinion, Greenhill, among other things:

• reviewed the draft of the merger agreement dated as of November 2, 2016 and certain related documents; 

• reviewed certain publicly available financial statements of each of AAM and MPG that Greenhill deemed relevant; 

• reviewed certain other publicly available business, operating and financial information relating to each of AAM and MPG
that Greenhill deemed relevant; 

• reviewed certain information relating to MPG provided by MPG's management, including financial forecasts as adjusted by
the management of AAM, which we refer to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the adjusted MPG forecasts (for a
further description of the adjusted MPG forecasts, see below under "—Certain Unaudited Prospective Financial Information
of AAM" beginning on page 97); 

• reviewed certain information relating to AAM provided by AAM's management, including financial forecasts, which we
refer to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the AAM management forecasts (for a further description of the AAM
management forecasts, see below under "—Certain Unaudited Prospective Financial Information of AAM" beginning on
page 97); 

• discussed the past and present operations and financial condition and the prospects of MPG with senior executives of MPG; 

• discussed the past and present operations and financial condition and the prospects of AAM with senior executives of AAM;

• reviewed certain information regarding the amount and timing of potential cost efficiencies expected to result from the
merger (which we refer to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the synergies) prepared by management of AAM, with
input from a management consultation firm retained by AAM in connection with the merger; 

• reviewed the pro forma impact of the merger on certain financial metrics and ratios for AAM, including AAM's earnings,
capitalization and net leverage; 

• reviewed the historical market prices and trading activity for the MPG common stock and analyzed its implied valuation
multiples; 

• compared the value of the merger consideration with the trading valuations of certain publicly traded companies that
Greenhill deemed relevant; 

• compared the value of the merger consideration with that paid in certain publicly available transactions that Greenhill
deemed relevant; 

• compared the value of the merger consideration to the valuation derived by discounting future cash flows and a terminal
value of the business of MPG based upon the adjusted MPG forecasts (assuming no synergies) at discount rates Greenhill
deemed appropriate; 

• compared the value of the merger consideration to the valuation derived by discounting future cash flows and a terminal
value of the business of MPG based upon the adjusted MPG forecasts (assuming phased in synergies) at discount rates
Greenhill deemed appropriate; 

• participated in discussions and negotiations among representatives of AAM and its legal advisors and representatives of
MPG and its legal and financial advisors; and

• performed such other analyses and considered such other factors as Greenhill deemed appropriate.

        Greenhill's written opinion was addressed to the AAM board of directors. It was not a recommendation to the AAM board of directors
as to whether it should approve the merger or the merger agreement or take any other action in connection therewith, nor does it constitute a
recommendation as to whether the stockholders of MPG or AAM should approve the merger or the AAM share issuance related thereto, as
applicable, at any meeting of the stockholders of MPG or AAM, as the case may be, convened in connection with the merger. Greenhill has
not expressed any opinion as to any aspect of the merger, other than the fairness, from a financial point of view, to AAM of the merger
consideration to be paid by AAM to the holders of MPG common stock pursuant to the merger agreement. Greenhill's opinion did not
address in any manner the price at which AAM shares will trade at any future time. Greenhill was not requested to opine as to, and its
opinion does not in any manner address, the relative merits of the merger in comparison to any alternative transactions or strategies that
might be available to AAM or in which AAM might engage or as to the underlying business decision of AAM to proceed with or effect the
merger.

        In conducting its review and analysis and rendering its opinion, Greenhill assumed and relied upon, without independent verification,
the accuracy and completeness of the information publicly available, supplied or otherwise made available to it by representatives and
management of AAM and MPG for the purposes of its opinion and further relied upon the assurances of representatives and management of
AAM and MPG, as applicable, that they were not aware of any facts or circumstances that would make such information inaccurate or
misleading.

        With respect to synergies, the financial forecasts and projections and other data that have been furnished or otherwise provided to
Greenhill, Greenhill has assumed that such synergies, financial forecasts, projections and data were reasonably prepared on a basis
reflecting the best currently available estimates and good faith judgments of the management of AAM and MPG, as applicable, as to those
matters, and Greenhill relied upon such forecasts and other data in arriving at its opinion. Greenhill expressed no opinion with respect to
such synergies, financial forecasts, projections and data or the assumptions upon which they are based.

        Greenhill did not make any independent valuation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities of MPG, nor was it furnished with any such
appraisals. Greenhill assumed that the merger will be consummated in accordance with the terms set forth in the final, executed merger
agreement, which Greenhill further assumed would be substantially similar in all material respects to the latest draft thereof it reviewed, and
without waiver of any material terms or conditions set forth in the merger agreement. Greenhill further assumed that all material
governmental, regulatory and other consents and approvals necessary for the consummation of the merger will be obtained without any
material effect on AAM, MPG, the merger or the contemplated benefits of the merger meaningful to its analyses.

        Greenhill is not a legal, regulatory, accounting or tax expert and it has relied on the assessments made by AAM and MPG and their
respective advisors with respect to such issues. Greenhill's opinion is necessarily based on financial, economic, market and other conditions
as in effect on, and the information made available to it as of, the date of its opinion. It should be understood that subsequent developments
may affect Greenhill's opinion, and Greenhill does not have any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm its opinion. The most recent market
data used by Greenhill was as of November 1, 2016.

        The following is a summary of the material financial and comparative analyses provided by Greenhill to the AAM board of directors in
connection with rendering its opinion described above. The summary set forth below does not purport to be a complete description of the
analyses performed by Greenhill, nor does the order of analyses described represent relative importance or weight given to those analyses
by Greenhill. Some of the summaries of the financial analyses include information

presented in tabular format. The tables must be read together with the full text of each summary and are not alone a complete description of
Greenhill's analyses.

Selected Comparable Company Analysis

        Greenhill compared selected financial information, ratios and multiples for MPG to the corresponding data for the following publicly
traded companies selected by Greenhill:

• American Axle & Manufacturing Holdings, Inc.; 

• BorgWarner Inc.; 

• Cooper-Standard Automotive Inc.; 

• Dana Incorporated; 

• GKN plc; 

• Lear Corporation; 

• Linamar Corporation; 

• Magna International Inc.; 

• Meritor, Inc.; 

• The Schaeffler Technologies AG & Co. KG; and 

• Tenneco Inc.

        Although none of the selected companies is directly comparable to MPG, Greenhill chose these companies because they are publicly
traded companies in the automotive supplier industry with operations that, for purposes of Greenhill's analysis, may be considered similar or
reasonably comparable to the operations of MPG. However, because of the inherent differences between the business, operations and
prospects of MPG and those of the selected companies, Greenhill believed that it was inappropriate to, and therefore did not, rely solely on
the numerical results of the selected company analysis. Accordingly, Greenhill also made qualitative judgments concerning differences
between the business, financial and operating characteristics and prospects of MPG and the selected companies that could affect the public
trading values of each in order to provide a context in which to consider the results of the quantitative analysis. These qualitative judgments
related primarily to the differing sizes, growth prospects, revenue mix, profitability levels and degree of operational risk between MPG and
the companies included in the selected company analysis. Greenhill also made judgments as to the relative comparability of the various
valuation parameters with respect to those companies.

        For each of the selected companies, Greenhill reviewed, among other information, the ratio of enterprise value (which we refer to in
this section of this joint proxy statement/prospectus as EV) which was calculated as fully diluted equity value derived by multiplying the
number of fully diluted outstanding shares of that company as reported in its most recent SEC filings by the company's common stock
closing share price on November 1, 2016, plus the book value of debt, plus minority interest, less cash and cash equivalents, less
investments in unconsolidated affiliates, as a multiple of estimated earnings from operations before interest expense, income taxes and
depreciation and amortization (which we refer to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as EBITDA) for 2016 and 2017.

        For each of the selected companies, Greenhill also reviewed, the ratio of EV as adjusted for tax-affected underfunded pension and
other post-employment benefits (which we refer to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as OPEB) liabilities as a multiple of EBITDAP,
which was calculated as EBITDA, adjusted for income or expenses associated with pension and OPEB plans (which we refer to in this joint
proxy statement/prospectus as EBITDAP), for 2016 and 2017.

Table of Contents

        Publicly available information for Linamar Corporation, GKN plc and The Schaeffler Technologies AG & Co. KG was adjusted to
account for capitalized development cost as these companies report under IFRS accounting standards.

        Greenhill compared financial information and calculated such ratios with respect to the selected companies and MPG based on
information it obtained from public filings and from consensus estimates as published by FactSet Research Systems Inc. The multiple
ranges resulting from these analyses are summarized below:

        The average multiples exclude MPG and AAM. From this data, and based on its professional judgment and experience in the
automotive supplier industry, Greenhill derived ranges of multiples it deemed most meaningful for its analysis.

        Greenhill then calculated a range of implied equity values of MPG by (i) applying 2016 adjusted EV to EBITDA multiples of 4.75x to
6.25x to MPG's estimated 2016 EBITDA from the adjusted MPG forecasts, (ii) applying 2016 adjusted EV to EBITDAP multiples of 5.00x
to 6.50x to MPG's estimated 2016 EBITDAP derived from the adjusted MPG forecasts, (iii) applying 2017 adjusted EV to EBITDA
multiples of 4.25x to 5.75x to MPG's estimated 2017 EBITDA derived from the adjusted MPG forecasts and (iv) applying 2017 adjusted
EV to EBITDAP multiples of 4.50x-6.00x to MPG's estimated 2017 EBITDAP from the adjusted MPG forecasts. At the direction of AAM,
Greenhill calculated MPG's estimated EBITDAP by adjusting MPG's estimated EBITDA from the adjusted MPG forecasts to exclude
pension expense. This analysis indicated the following ranges of implied prices per share of MPG common stock:

        Greenhill compared these ranges of implied prices per share to the implied offer price of $22.00 per share (which we refer to in this
joint proxy statement/prospectus as the implied offer price), calculated based on an agreed $17.00 per share price of AAM common stock
and the implied value of the consideration payable per share of MPG common stock as of November 1, 2016 of $22.03 (which we refer to
in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the implied value of the merger consideration).

Precedent Transaction Analysis

        Greenhill performed an analysis of selected precedent transactions in the automobile supplier industry since October 2011 that in
Greenhill's judgment were relevant for its analysis. The following

Table of Contents

table identifies the 17 transactions reviewed by Greenhill in this analysis (which we refer to in this section of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus as the precedent transactions):

        The above precedent transactions occurred in the auto parts and equipment, brakes and wheel bearings, steering and suspension system
components or transmissions and power train parts industries since 2011. Greenhill used its judgment to determine those transactions that
were most relevant for its analysis based on the size, industry classification and relative performance of the target companies involved in
such transactions.

        Although Greenhill analyzed the multiples implied by the precedent transactions, none of the precedent transactions or associated
companies is identical to the merger or to MPG. Accordingly, Greenhill's analysis of the precedent transactions necessarily involved
complex considerations and judgments concerning the differences in financial and operating characteristics, the parties involved and terms
of their transactions and other factors that would necessarily affect the implied value of MPG compared to the values of the companies in
the precedent transactions. In evaluating the precedent transactions, Greenhill made judgments and assumptions concerning industry
performance, general business, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters. Greenhill also made judgments as to the
relative comparability of those companies to MPG and judgments as to the relative comparability of the various valuation parameters with
respect to the companies.

        Using publicly available information for the precedent transactions, Greenhill reviewed the consideration paid in each such transaction
and analyzed the transaction value implied by such consideration as a multiple of last 12 months (which we refer to in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus as LTM) EBITDA. The following table summarizes the reference range of valuation multiples for all precedent
transactions Greenhill derived from the precedent transactions:

        From this data, Greenhill derived a range of multiples of 5.5x to 8.5x based on its professional judgment and experience in the
automotive supplier industry and applied such range of multiples to

MPG's estimated 2016 EBITDA from the adjusted MPG forecasts, which indicated the range of implied prices per share of MPG common
stock of $13.31-$33.12. Greenhill compared these implied share prices to the implied offer price and the implied value of the merger
consideration.

Discounted Cash Flow Analysis

        Greenhill performed a discounted cash flow analysis of MPG with and without taking into account the benefit of potential phased-in
synergies resulting from the merger using the adjusted MPG forecasts for calendar years 2017 through 2020. Greenhill calculated a range of
implied present values of the unlevered, after-tax free cash flows, with and without taking into account the synergies, using discount rates
ranging from 10% to 11%, reflecting Greenhill's estimate of MPG's weighted average cost of capital, derived using the capital asset pricing
model. Greenhill also calculated a range of estimated terminal values for MPG as of December 31, 2020, with and without taking into
account the synergies, by applying perpetuity growth rates of 2.25% to 2.75% which were selected based on Greenhill's professional
judgment and taking into consideration, among other things, the implied exit multiples of 5.1x-6.2x (not including synergies) and 5.6x-6.8x
(including synergies) at these perpetuity growth rates. Greenhill then added the net present values of the unlevered, after-tax free cash flows,
with and without taking into account the synergies, for 2017-2020 to the present value of the estimated terminal values, in each case
discounted to March 31, 2017, to derive an implied enterprise value for MPG. Greenhill then calculated an implied share price for the shares
of MPG by subtracting MPG total debt and minority interest and adding MPG's cash to the implied enterprise value that it derived for MPG,
and dividing the results by the number of fully diluted shares of MPG common stock outstanding as of October 31, 2016, calculated using
the treasury stock method. This analysis resulted in a range of implied prices per share of MPG common stock of $18.07 to $25.71 (on a
standalone basis, without the benefit of the synergies) and $28.77 to $38.63 (taking into account the synergies). Greenhill compared these
implied share prices to the implied offer price and the implied value of the merger consideration.

Other Considerations

        The summary set forth above does not purport to be a complete description of the analyses performed by Greenhill, but simply
describes, in summary form, the material analyses that Greenhill conducted in connection with rendering its opinion. The preparation of a
fairness opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. In arriving at its opinion,
Greenhill did not attribute any particular weight to any analyses or factors considered by it and did not form an opinion as to whether any
individual analysis or factor, considered in isolation, supported or failed to support its opinion. Rather, Greenhill considered the totality of
the factors and analyses performed in determining its opinion. Accordingly, Greenhill believes that the summary set forth above and its
analyses must be considered as a whole and that selecting portions thereof, without considering all of its analyses, could create an
incomplete view of the processes underlying its analyses and opinion. Greenhill based its analyses on assumptions that it deemed
reasonable, including assumptions concerning general business and economic conditions and industry-specific factors. Analyses based on
forecasts or projections of future results are inherently uncertain, as they are subject to numerous factors or events beyond the control of the
parties or their advisors. Accordingly, Greenhill's analyses are not necessarily indicative of actual values or actual future results that might
be achieved, which values may be higher or lower than those indicated. Moreover, Greenhill's analyses are not and do not purport to be
appraisals or otherwise reflective of the prices at which businesses actually could be bought or sold. In addition, no company or transaction
used in Greenhill's analysis as a comparison is directly comparable to AAM or the contemplated merger. Because these analyses are
inherently subject to uncertainty, being based on numerous factors or events beyond the control of the parties or their respective advisors,
neither AAM nor any other person assumes responsibility if future results are materially different from those forecasts or projections.

        The merger consideration was determined through arms' length negotiations between AAM and MPG and was approved by the AAM
board of directors. Greenhill provided advice to the AAM board of directors during these negotiations. Greenhill did not, however,
recommend any specific amount of consideration to AAM or the AAM board of directors or that any specific amount of consideration
constituted the only appropriate consideration for the merger. Greenhill's opinion did not in any manner address the underlying business
decision to proceed with or effect the merger.

        Greenhill has acted as financial advisor to AAM in connection with the merger. During the two years ended November 2, 2016,
Greenhill has not been engaged by, performed any services for or received any compensation from AAM, MPG or any other parties to the
merger agreement, other than (i) amounts that were paid to it, or were owing to it, under the letter agreement pursuant to which Greenhill
was retained as a financial advisor to AAM in connection with the merger (including the reimbursement of approximately $48,000 for out-
of-pocket expenses) and (ii) certain financial advisory services performed for AAM for which Greenhill did not receive any compensation
or reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses (Greenhill also received a $100,000 retainer in connection with such financial services,
although such retainer was received more than two years prior to November 2, 2016).

        In connection with the merger, AAM has agreed to pay Greenhill a fee of $16,500,000, of which $100,000 was paid upon the execution
of the engagement letter, $2,500,000 was paid in connection with the delivery of the opinion and the remainder of which is contingent on
completion of the merger. In negotiating the fee payable to Greenhill, AAM considered the fact that Greenhill acted as primary financial
advisor and, taking into account its financial analysis of the merger, the fees that it expected should be payable to its financial advisor. AAM
has also agreed to reimburse Greenhill for certain out-of-pocket expenses incurred by it in connection with its engagement and will
indemnify Greenhill against certain liabilities that may arise out of its engagement.

        Greenhill's opinion was one of the many factors considered by the AAM board of directors in evaluating the merger and should not be
viewed as determinative of the views of the AAM board of directors with respect to the merger.

        In selecting Greenhill as its financial advisor in connection with the merger, AAM considered, among other things, its qualifications,
capabilities and reputation for providing high-quality financial advisory services. In addition, Greenhill has a long-standing relationship and
is familiar with AAM and has substantial knowledge of and experience in the automotive supplier, metals and industrials sectors. Greenhill
is an internationally recognized investment banking firm which regularly engages in the valuation of businesses and their securities in
connection with mergers and acquisitions, underwritings, competitive bids and private placements. For the foregoing reasons, AAM
selected Greenhill as its financial advisor.

Opinion of MPG's Financial Advisor 

        MPG has retained BofA Merrill Lynch to act as its financial advisor in connection with the merger. BofA Merrill Lynch is an
internationally recognized investment banking firm which is regularly engaged in the valuation of businesses and securities in connection
with mergers and acquisitions, negotiated underwritings, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements and
valuations for corporate and other purposes. MPG selected BofA Merrill Lynch to act as MPG's financial advisor in connection with the
merger on the basis of BofA Merrill Lynch's experience in transactions similar to the merger, its reputation in the investment community
and its familiarity with MPG and its business.

        On November 2, 2016, at a meeting of the MPG board of directors held to evaluate the merger, BofA Merrill Lynch delivered to the
MPG board of directors an oral opinion, which was confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated November 2, 2016, to the effect that,
as of the date of the opinion and based on and subject to various assumptions and limitations described in its opinion, the merger

consideration to be received in the merger by holders of MPG common stock was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.

        The full text of BofA Merrill Lynch's written opinion, dated November 2, 2016, to the MPG board of directors, which describes,
among other things, the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken, is attached as
Annex D to this joint proxy statement/prospectus and is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. The following summary of BofA
Merrill Lynch's opinion is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the opinion. BofA Merrill Lynch delivered its opinion to
the MPG board of directors for the benefit and use of the MPG board of directors (in its capacity as such) in connection with and
for purposes of its evaluation of the merger. BofA Merrill Lynch's opinion does not address any other aspect or implication of the
merger, and no opinion or view was expressed as to the relative merits of the merger in comparison to other strategies or
transactions that might be available to MPG or in which MPG might engage or as to the underlying business decision of MPG to
proceed with or effect the merger. BofA Merrill Lynch's opinion does not constitute a recommendation to any stockholder as to how
to vote or act in connection with the merger or any other matter.

        In connection with rendering its opinion, BofA Merrill Lynch, among other things:

• reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information relating to MPG and AAM; 

• reviewed certain internal financial and operating information with respect to the business, operations and prospects of MPG
furnished to or discussed with BofA Merrill Lynch by the management of MPG, including certain financial forecasts relating
to MPG prepared by the management of MPG (which we refer to in this section of this joint proxy statement/prospectus as
the MPG forecasts); 

• reviewed certain internal financial and operating information with respect to the business, operations and prospects of AAM
furnished to or discussed with BofA Merrill Lynch by the management of AAM, including certain financial forecasts
relating to AAM prepared by the management of AAM and approved for BofA Merrill Lynch's use by the management of
MPG (which we refer to in this section of this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the AAM forecasts); 

• reviewed certain estimates as to the amount and timing of cost savings, revenue enhancements and/or operational synergies
(which we refer to in this section of this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the synergies) anticipated by the managements
of MPG and AAM to result from the merger; 

• discussed the past and current business, operations, financial condition and prospects of MPG with members of senior
managements of MPG and AAM, and discussed the past and current business, operations, financial condition and prospects
of AAM with members of senior managements of MPG and AAM; 

• reviewed the potential pro forma financial impact of the merger on the future financial performance of AAM, including the
potential effect on AAM's estimated earnings per share; 

• reviewed the trading histories for MPG common stock and AAM common stock and a comparison of such trading histories
with each other and with the trading histories of other companies BofA Merrill Lynch deemed relevant; 

• compared certain financial and stock market information of MPG and AAM with similar information of other companies
BofA Merrill Lynch deemed relevant; 

• compared certain financial terms of the merger to financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of other transactions BofA
Merrill Lynch deemed relevant;

• reviewed the relative financial contributions of MPG and AAM to the future financial performance of the combined
company on a pro forma basis; 

• considered the results of BofA Merrill Lynch's efforts on behalf of MPG to solicit, at the direction of MPG, indications of
interest from third parties with respect to a possible acquisition of MPG; 

• reviewed drafts dated November 2, 2016 of the merger agreement and the stockholders' agreement, and a draft dated
October 31, 2016 of the voting agreement; and 

• performed such other analyses and studies and considered such other information and factors as BofA Merrill Lynch deemed
appropriate.

        In arriving at its opinion, BofA Merrill Lynch assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the accuracy and
completeness of the financial and other information and data publicly available or provided to or otherwise reviewed by or discussed with it
and relied upon the assurances of the managements of MPG and AAM that they were not aware of any facts or circumstances that would
make such information or data inaccurate or misleading in any material respect. With respect to the MPG forecasts, BofA Merrill Lynch
was advised by MPG, and assumed, that they were reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and good
faith judgments of the management of MPG as to the future financial performance of MPG. With respect to the AAM forecasts and
synergies, BofA Merrill Lynch was advised by AAM, and assumed at the direction and with the consent of MPG, that they were reasonably
prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and good faith judgments of the management of AAM as to the future
financial performance of AAM and other matters covered thereby. BofA Merrill Lynch relied, at the direction of MPG, on the assessments
of the managements of MPG and AAM as to AAM's ability to achieve the synergies and was advised by MPG and AAM, and assumed,
with the consent of MPG, that the synergies would be realized in the amounts and at the times projected.

        BofA Merrill Lynch did not make and was not provided with any independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities
(contingent or otherwise) of MPG or AAM, nor did BofA Merrill Lynch make any physical inspection of the properties or assets of MPG or
AAM. BofA Merrill Lynch did not evaluate the solvency or fair value of MPG or AAM under any state, federal or other laws relating to
bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. BofA Merrill Lynch assumed, at the direction of MPG, that the merger would be consummated in
accordance with its terms, without waiver, modification or amendment of any material term, condition or agreement and that, in the course
of obtaining the necessary governmental, regulatory and other approvals, consents, releases and waivers for the merger, no delay, limitation,
restriction or condition, including any divestiture requirements or amendments or modifications, would be imposed that would have an
adverse effect on MPG, AAM or the contemplated benefits of the merger. BofA Merrill Lynch also assumed, at the direction of MPG, that
the final executed merger agreement, voting agreement and stockholders' agreement would not differ in any material respect from the drafts
thereof reviewed by BofA Merrill Lynch.

        BofA Merrill Lynch expressed no view or opinion as to any terms or other aspects or implications of the merger (other than the merger
consideration to the extent expressly specified in its opinion), including, without limitation, the form or structure of the merger, any related
transactions, the voting agreement, the stockholders' agreement or any other agreement, arrangement or understanding entered into in
connection with or related to the merger or otherwise. BofA Merrill Lynch's opinion was limited to the fairness, from a financial point of
view, of the merger consideration to be received by holders of MPG common stock and no opinion or view was expressed with respect to
any other consideration received in connection with the merger by the holders of any class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of
any party. In addition, no opinion or view was expressed with respect to the fairness (financial or otherwise) of the amount, nature or any
other aspect of any compensation to any of the officers, directors or employees of any party to the merger, or class of such persons, relative
to

the merger consideration or otherwise. Furthermore, no opinion or view was expressed as to the relative merits of the merger in comparison
to other strategies or transactions that might be available to MPG or in which MPG might engage or as to the underlying business decision
of MPG to proceed with or effect the merger. BofA Merrill Lynch also did not express any view or opinion with respect to, and relied, at the
direction of MPG, upon, the assessments of representatives of MPG regarding, legal, regulatory, accounting, tax and similar matters relating
to MPG or the merger, as to which matters BofA Merrill Lynch understood that MPG obtained such advice as it deemed necessary from
qualified professionals. BofA Merrill Lynch also did not express any opinion as to what the value of AAM common stock actually would be
when issued or the prices at which MPG common stock or AAM common stock would trade at any time, including following
announcement or consummation of the merger. In addition, BofA Merrill Lynch expressed no opinion or recommendation as to how any
stockholder should vote or act in connection with the merger or any other matter. Except as described above, MPG imposed no other
limitations on the investigations made or procedures followed by BofA Merrill Lynch in rendering its opinion.

        BofA Merrill Lynch's opinion was necessarily based on financial, economic, monetary, market and other conditions and circumstances
as in effect on, and the information made available to BofA Merrill Lynch as of, the date of its opinion. It should be understood that
subsequent developments may affect BofA Merrill Lynch's opinion, and BofA Merrill Lynch does not have any obligation to update, revise,
or reaffirm its opinion. The issuance of BofA Merrill Lynch's opinion was approved by a fairness opinion review committee of BofA
Merrill Lynch.

        The discussion set forth below in the sections entitled "Summary of Material Financial Analyses of MPG" and "Summary of Material
Financial Analyses of AAM" represents a brief summary of the material financial analyses presented by BofA Merrill Lynch to the MPG
board of directors in connection with its opinion, dated November 2, 2016. The financial analyses summarized below include
information presented in tabular format. In order to fully understand the financial analyses performed by BofA Merrill Lynch, the
tables must be read together with the text of each summary. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the
financial analyses performed by BofA Merrill Lynch. Considering the data set forth in the tables below without considering the full
narrative description of the financial analyses, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying the analyses, could create a
misleading or incomplete view of the financial analyses performed by BofA Merrill Lynch. For purposes of the financial analyses
summarized below, the term "implied merger consideration" refers to $22.00 per share of MPG common stock, consisting of (i) the cash
consideration of $13.50 per share and (ii) the implied value of the stock consideration of $8.50 per share based on an agreed AAM common
stock price of $17.00 per share and the exchange ratio of 0.5. All implied per share equity values are rounded to the nearest $0.25. The
financial analyses summarized below reflect BofA Merrill Lynch's assumption, per MPG management, that MPG has total indebtedness of
$1,889 million, non-controlling interests with a value of $3 million, tax-effected unfunded pension/other postemployment benefits (which
we refer to in this section of this joint proxy statement/prospectus as OPEB) liabilities of $24 million and cash and cash equivalents of
$182 million as of August 31, 2016. Further, the financial analyses were based on the assumption that MPG's fully diluted share total is
accounted for under the treasury stock method, and the financial analyses were based on 66.696 million shares of MPG common stock
outstanding as of October 31, 2016, with 0.943 million outstanding MPG restricted stock unit awards, 0.799 million outstanding shares of
restricted MPG common stock and 6.430 million outstanding MPG stock options with a weighted average strike price of $12.60. The
financial analyses summarized below also reflect BofA Merrill Lynch's assumption, per AAM's management, that AAM has total
indebtedness of $1,416 million, tax-effected unfunded pension/OPEB liabilities of $312 million and cash and cash equivalents of
$416 million as of August 31, 2016. The financial analyses were also based on the assumption, per AAM's management, that AAM's fully
diluted share total is accounted for under the treasury stock method, and the financial analyses were based, per AAM's management, on
76.473 million shares of

Summary of Material Financial Analyses of MPG

        Selected Publicly Traded Companies Analysis.    BofA Merrill Lynch reviewed publicly available financial and stock market
information for MPG and the following eleven selected publicly traded companies in the automotive supplier industry that BofA Merrill
Lynch considered to have similar or reasonably comparable operations to MPG:

American Axle & Manufacturing Holdings, Inc.

BorgWarner Inc.

Cooper-Standard Automotive Inc.

Dana Incorporated

GKN plc

Lear Corporation

Linamar Corporation

Magna International Inc.

Martinrea International Inc.

Tenneco Inc.

The Schaeffler Technologies AG & Co. KG

        Publicly available information for Linamar Corporation, GKN plc, Martinrea International Inc. and The Schaeffler Technologies
AG & Co. KG was adjusted to account for capitalized development cost as these companies report under IFRS accounting standards.

        BofA Merrill Lynch reviewed, among other things, adjusted enterprise values of the selected publicly traded companies, calculated as
equity values based on closing stock prices on November 1, 2016, plus debt, less cash, plus minority interests, less equity in unconsolidated
affiliates, plus tax-effected pension and OPEB liabilities as a multiple of estimated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization
and associated pension carrying costs calculated as the net periodic benefit costs less service costs (which we refer to in this section of this
joint proxy statement/prospectus as EBITDAP) for calendar years 2016 and 2017. The overall low, mean, median and high calendar year
2016 EBITDAP multiples observed for the selected publicly traded companies were 4.2x, 5.4x, 5.2x and 7.3x, respectively, and the overall
low, mean, median and high calendar year 2017 EBITDAP multiples observed for the selected publicly traded companies were 3.8x, 5.1x,
4.9x and 6.7x, respectively. The mean and median EBITDAP multiples exclude MPG and AAM. BofA Merrill Lynch then applied
(i) calendar year 2016 EBITDAP multiples of 5.5x to 6.5x (derived from the selected publicly traded companies, based on information
BofA Merrill Lynch obtained from public filings, publicly available research analyst reports and consensus estimates as published by
FactSet Research Systems Inc.) to MPG's calendar year 2016 estimated EBITDAP, and (ii) calendar year 2017 EBITDAP multiples of 5.0x
to 6.0x (derived from the selected publicly traded companies, based on information BofA Merrill Lynch obtained from public filings,
publicly available research analyst reports and consensus estimates as published by FactSet Research Systems Inc.) to MPG's calendar year
2017 estimated EBITDAP. In both cases, at the direction of MPG, (A) BofA Merrill Lynch adjusted the estimated EBITDAP to exclude
non-recurring items, underfunded pension expense and stock-based compensation, and (B) BofA Merrill Lynch assumed MPG's ongoing
underfunded pension expense to be negligible.

Estimated financial data of the selected publicly traded companies were based on publicly available research analysts' estimates, and
estimated financial data of MPG were based on the MPG forecasts. This analysis yielded the following approximate implied per share
equity value reference ranges for MPG, as compared to the implied merger consideration:

        No company used in this analysis is identical or directly comparable to MPG. Accordingly, an evaluation of the results of this analysis
is not entirely mathematical. Rather, this analysis involves complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and
operating characteristics and other factors that could affect the public trading or other values of the companies to which MPG was
compared.

        Selected Precedent Transactions Analysis.    BofA Merrill Lynch reviewed, to the extent publicly available, financial information
relating to the following eighteen selected transactions involving companies in the automotive supplier industry since May 2012 that, in
BofA Merrill Lynch's judgment, were relevant for its analysis based on the size, industry classification and relative performance of the
target companies involved in such transactions:

        BofA Merrill Lynch reviewed transaction values, calculated as the enterprise value implied for the target company based on the
consideration payable in the selected transaction, as a multiple of the target company's twelve month estimated EBITDA. The overall low,
mean and high twelve month revenue multiples observed for the selected transactions were 4.8x, 7.1x and 10.6x, respectively. BofA Merrill
Lynch then applied twelve month adjusted EBITDA multiples of 5.5x to 7.0x (derived from the EBITDA multiple ranges of the selected
transactions, based on BofA Merrill Lynch's professional judgment) to MPG's calendar year 2016 estimated adjusted EBITDA. In doing so,
at the direction of MPG, BofA Merrill Lynch adjusted the estimated EBITDA to exclude non-recurring items and stock based
compensation. Estimated financial data of the selected transactions were based on publicly

available information at the time of announcement of the relevant transaction. Estimated financial data of MPG were based on the MPG
forecasts. This analysis yielded the following approximate implied per share equity value reference range for MPG, as compared to the
implied merger consideration:

        No company, business or transaction used in this analysis is identical or directly comparable to MPG or the merger. Accordingly, an
evaluation of the results of this analysis is not entirely mathematical. Rather, this analysis involves complex considerations and judgments
concerning differences in financial and operating characteristics and other factors that could affect the acquisition or other values of the
companies, business segments or transactions to which MPG and the merger were compared.

        Discounted Cash Flow Analysis.    BofA Merrill Lynch performed a discounted cash flow analysis of MPG to calculate the estimated
present value of the standalone unlevered, after-tax free cash flows (at assumed effective tax rates, with the approval of MPG management,
of 28.1% for the last four months of fiscal year 2016 and 28.5% for fiscal years 2017 through 2020) that MPG was forecasted to generate
from September 1, 2016 to December 31, 2016 and during MPG's fiscal years 2017 through 2020, which unlevered, after-tax free cash
flows were derived by BofA Merrill Lynch from the MPG forecasts to be approximately $81 million for the period from September 1, 2016
to December 31, 2016 and approximately $207 million, $241 million, $307 million and $339 million for each of the fiscal years ending
December 31, 2017 through 2020. BofA Merrill Lynch calculated terminal values for MPG by applying terminal forward multiples of 5.0x
to 6.0x (which range of terminal forward multiples was selected taking into consideration, among other things, EBITDAP multiples for the
selected publicly traded companies described above under "Summary of Material Financial Analyses of MPG—Selected Publicly Traded
Companies Analysis" and BofA Merrill Lynch's professional judgment with respect to the history of MPG's EBITDAP multiples relative to
those of the selected publicly traded companies) to MPG's fiscal year 2020 estimated adjusted EBITDAP (which BofA Merrill Lynch
assumed, at the direction of MPG, to include stock-based compensation, but not other non-recurring items or pension expense, which
pension expense BofA Merrill Lynch assumed to be negligible). The cash flows and terminal values were then discounted to present value
as of August 31, 2016, reflecting BofA Merrill Lynch's assumption for purposes of this analysis that the cash flows would occur at the mid-
point of a given year, and discount rates ranging from 9.0% to 11.0%, which reflect BofA Merrill Lynch's estimate of MPG's weighted
average cost of capital, derived using the capital asset pricing model. This analysis yielded the following approximate implied per share
equity value reference range for MPG, as compared to the implied merger consideration:

        Publicly available information for Linamar Corporation, GKN plc, Martinrea International Inc. and The Schaeffler Technologies
AG & Co. KG was adjusted to account for capitalized development costs as these companies report under IFRS accounting standards.

        BofA Merrill Lynch reviewed, among other things, adjusted enterprise values of the selected publicly traded companies, calculated as
equity values based on closing stock prices on November 1, 2016, plus debt, less cash, plus minority interests, less equity in unconsolidated

low, mean, median and high calendar year 2016 EBITDAP multiples observed for the selected publicly traded companies were 4.2x, 5.4x,
5.2x and 7.3x, respectively, and the overall low, mean, median and high calendar year 2017 EBITDAP multiples observed for the selected
publicly traded companies were 3.8x, 5.1x, 4.9x and 6.7x, respectively. The mean and median EBITDAP multiples exclude MPG and
AAM. BofA Merrill Lynch then applied (i) calendar year 2016 EBITDAP multiples of 4.5x to 5.5x (derived from the selected publicly

consensus estimates as published by FactSet Research Systems Inc.) to AAM's calendar year 2016 estimated EBITDAP, and (ii) calendar

Lynch obtained from public filings, publicly available research analyst reports and consensus estimates as published by FactSet Research
Systems Inc.) to AAM's calendar year 2017 estimated EBITDAP. In both cases, at the direction of MPG, (A) BofA Merrill Lynch adjusted
the estimated EBITDAP to exclude non-recurring items, underfunded pension expense and stock-based compensation, and (B) BofA
Merrill Lynch assumed AAM's ongoing underfunded pension expense to be $6 million per annum. Estimated financial data of the selected
publicly traded companies were based on publicly available research analysts' estimates, and estimated financial data of AAM were based
on the AAM forecasts. This analysis yielded the following approximate implied per share equity value reference ranges for AAM as
compared to the $17.06 per share closing price of AAM common stock on November 1, 2016:

from September 1, 2016 to December 31, 2016 and during AAM's fiscal years 2017 through 2020 based on the AAM forecasts. BofA
Merrill Lynch calculated terminal values for AAM by applying terminal forward multiples of 4.5x to 5.5x (which range of terminal forward
multiples was selected taking into consideration, among other things, EBITDAP multiples for the selected publicly traded companies
described above under "Summary of Material Financial Analyses of AAM—Selected Publicly Traded Companies Analysis" and BofA

to include stock-based compensation, but not other non-recurring items or pension expense). The cash flows and terminal values were then
discounted to present value as of August 31, 2016, reflecting BofA Merrill Lynch's assumption for purposes of this analysis that the cash

November 1, 2016:

Summary of Material Merger Consequences Analyses

        Pro Forma Accretion/Dilution Analysis.    BofA Merrill Lynch reviewed the potential pro forma financial effect of the merger on
AAM's calendar years 2017 and 2018 estimated earnings per share (which we refer to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as EPS) after
(i) taking into account the potential synergies anticipated by the managements of MPG and AAM to result from the merger by comparing
the relative pro forma EPS of AAM to the projected standalone EPS of AAM at synergies levels ranging from $25 million to $100 million
based on the synergies projected to result from the completion of the merger by AAM management, and (ii) assuming $100 million of run-
rate synergies, of which 50% would be realized in calendar year 2017 and 100% would be realized thereafter, with the approval of the
managements of AAM and MPG. Estimated financial data of AAM and MPG were based on the AAM forecasts and the MPG forecasts,
respectively. Based on the merger consideration, this analysis indicated that the merger could be (A) accretive to AAM's estimated cash EPS
for calendar years 2017 and 2018 (without burdening cash EPS for amortization expenses) by $0.37 to $0.53 (for calendar year 2017) and
$0.78 to $1.11 (for calendar year 2018) and (B) dilutive to AAM's estimated GAAP EPS for calendar year 2017 by $0.21 to $0.38 and
accretive to AAM's estimated GAAP EPS for calendar year 2018 by $0.03 to $0.37. For purposes of this analysis, cash EPS was obtained
by making certain adjustments to GAAP EPS, principally adding back the amount of certain intangibles that had been amortized in
calculating GAAP EPS. The actual results achieved by the combined company may vary from projected results and the variations may be
material.

        Pro Forma Trading Multiples Analysis.    BofA Merrill Lynch performed an analysis that examined the indicative value of the merger
consideration if the combined company's common stock traded at different hypothetical multiples of its estimated 2017 pro forma adjusted
EBITDAP of $1,196 million, assuming (i) the pro forma adjusted EBITDAP to exclude non-recurring items, underfunded pension expense
and stock-based compensation, (ii) MPG's ongoing pension expense to be negligible, and (iii) the amount of AAM's ongoing underfunded
pension expense to be $6 million. The multiples applied by BofA Merrill Lynch included the multiples of the closing trading prices of AAM
common stock and MPG common stock on November 1, 2016 to the respective estimated 2017 adjusted

EBITDAP of the companies, as well as an illustrative "re-rate" multiple at which the combined company's common stock hypothetically
could trade following the merger. BofA Merrill Lynch estimated that the aggregate amount of cash comprising the merger consideration
would be $984 million, including $23 million relating to cash settled options. This analysis yielded the following implied per share equity
values for MPG common stock on a pro forma basis:

        BofA Merrill Lynch further observed that the combined company's common stock would have to trade at a "breakeven" multiple of 4.7
times its estimated 2017 adjusted EBITDAP in order for the merger consideration to have an aggregate market value of $22.00 per share of
MPG common stock, the amount of the implied merger consideration. BofA Merrill Lynch noted that an increase in trading multiples for
the combined company relative to those of AAM could be expected due to the greater diversity of the combined company's customer base,
but that there could be no assurance that this would occur.

        Has/Gets Analysis.    BofA Merrill Lynch performed a has/gets analysis to calculate the theoretical change in value for MPG
stockholders resulting from the merger based on a comparison of (i) the value of the merger consideration, including the pro forma
ownership by MPG stockholders of the combined company following the merger, and (ii) the 100% ownership by MPG stockholders of the
MPG common stock on a stand-alone basis. For MPG on a stand-alone basis, BofA Merrill Lynch used the reference range obtained in its
discounted cash flow analysis described above under "Summary of Material Financial Analyses of MPG—Discounted Cash Flow Analysis."
BofA Merrill Lynch then performed the same analysis with respect to the combined company on a pro forma basis, giving effect to the
merger. For the pro forma analysis, BofA Merrill Lynch used the same discount rate range of 9.0% to 11.0% for the MPG contribution as it
had used for its analysis of MPG on a stand-alone basis, and 7.5% to 9.0% for the AAM contribution as it had used for its analysis of AAM
on a stand-alone basis. BofA Merrill Lynch also assumed, among other things, (i) with the approval of the managements of MPG and AAM,
$100 million in annual synergies, of which 50% would be realized in calendar year 2017 and 100% would be realized thereafter, (ii) with
the approval of MPG management, that $50 million of costs would be incurred in each of calendar years 2017 and 2018 in order to achieve
such synergies, and (iii) as discussed with MPG management, that the net synergies would grow perpetually at an annual rate of 0.0% to
1.0%. BofA Merrill Lynch estimated that the aggregate amount of cash comprising the merger consideration would be $984 million,
including $23 million relating to cash settled options. This analysis yielded the following implied per share equity value reference ranges
for MPG common stock on a stand-alone basis and for the merger consideration:

        BofA Merrill Lynch also noted certain additional factors that were not considered part of BofA Merrill Lynch's material financial
analyses with respect to its opinion but were referenced for informational purposes, including, among other things, the following:

Miscellaneous

        As noted above, the discussion set forth above in the sections entitled "Summary of Material Financial Analyses of MPG" and
"Summary of Material Financial Analyses of AAM" is a summary of the material financial analyses presented by BofA Merrill Lynch to the
MPG board of directors in connection with its opinion and is not a comprehensive description of all analyses undertaken or matters
considered by BofA Merrill Lynch in connection with its opinion. The preparation of a financial opinion is a complex analytical process
involving various determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant methods of financial analysis and the application of those methods
to the particular circumstances and, therefore, a financial opinion is not readily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. BofA
Merrill Lynch believes that its analyses summarized above must be considered as a whole. BofA Merrill Lynch further believes that
selecting portions of its analyses and the matters considered or focusing on information presented in tabular format, without considering all
analyses and matters or the narrative description of the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the processes underlying
BofA Merrill Lynch's analyses and opinion. The fact that any specific analysis has been referred to in the summary above, or the order in
which such analysis appears above, is not meant to indicate that such analysis was given greater weight than any other analysis referred to
in the summary.

        In performing its analyses, BofA Merrill Lynch considered industry performance, general business and economic conditions and other
matters, many of which are beyond the control of MPG, AAM or any other entity. The estimates of the future performance of MPG or AAM
in or underlying BofA Merrill Lynch's analyses are not necessarily indicative of actual values or actual future results, which may be
significantly more or less favorable than those estimates or those suggested by BofA Merrill Lynch's analyses. These analyses were
prepared solely as part of BofA Merrill Lynch's analysis of the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the merger consideration to be
received by holders of MPG common stock and were provided to the MPG board of directors in connection with the delivery of BofA
Merrill Lynch's opinion. The analyses do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which a company might actually be sold or
acquired or the prices at which any securities have traded or may trade at any time in the future. Accordingly, the estimates used in, and the
ranges of valuations resulting from, any particular analysis described above are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty and should not
be taken to be BofA Merrill Lynch's view of the actual values of MPG or AAM.

        The type and amount of consideration payable in the merger was determined through negotiations between MPG and AAM, rather than
by any financial advisor, and was approved by the MPG board of directors. The decision to enter into the merger agreement was solely that
of the MPG board of directors. As described above, BofA Merrill Lynch's opinion and analyses were only one of many matters considered
by the MPG board of directors in its evaluation of the proposed merger and should not be viewed as determinative of the views of the MPG
board of directors or management with respect to the merger or the merger consideration.

Certain Unaudited Prospective Financial Information of AAM and MPG

Certain Unaudited Prospective Financial Information of AAM

        AAM does not as a matter of course make public long-term projections as to future revenue, earnings or other results due to, among
other reasons, the uncertainty of the underlying assumptions and estimates. However, AAM is including in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus the AAM management forecasts, which consist of certain unaudited prospective financial information regarding
AAM's anticipated future operations that was made available to the AAM board of directors, AAM's financial advisor, the MPG board of
directors and MPG's financial advisor in connection with the merger. See also "—Opinion of AAM's Financial Advisor" beginning on
page 78 and "—Opinion of MPG's Financial Advisor" beginning on page 85. The AAM management forecasts included below were
prepared by AAM's management as part of AAM's long-range plan for its business for fiscal years 2016 through 2020 and treats AAM on a
standalone basis, without giving effect to the merger and as if the merger had not been contemplated by AAM. AAM uses certain non-
GAAP financial measures as supplemental measures which AAM's management believes are useful to both management and its
stockholders in their analysis of AAM's business and operating performance. AAM's management also uses this information for operational
planning and decision-making purposes. Non-GAAP financial measures are not and should not be considered a substitute for any GAAP
measure. Additionally, non-GAAP financial measures as presented by AAM may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by
other companies. In the view of AAM's management, the AAM forecasts were prepared on a reasonable basis based on the information
available to AAM's management at the time of their preparation.

AAM forecasts 

        In addition, AAM received and reviewed certain unaudited prospective financial information regarding MPG for the fiscal years 2016
through 2020, which were prepared by MPG's management as described below under "—Certain Unaudited Prospective Financial
Information of MPG" beginning on page 99. AAM's management reviewed and performed due diligence regarding such financial
information and made certain adjustments to such financial information, including the forecasted impact of MPG's acquisition of Brillion
Iron Works, resulting in the adjusted MPG forecasts. The adjusted MPG forecasts were also provided to Greenhill. We refer to the AAM
management forecasts and the adjusted MPG forecasts, collectively, in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the AAM forecasts.

Adjusted MPG forecasts 

        The AAM forecasts were prepared based on information available at the time of preparation and should not be relied upon as being
indicative of actual future results, and readers of this joint proxy statement/prospectus are cautioned not to place undue, or any, reliance on
this information. The inclusion of the AAM forecasts in this joint proxy statement/prospectus is not an admission or representation by AAM
that such information is material. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in the AAM forecasts. The AAM forecasts were
not prepared with a view toward compliance with the guidelines established by the SEC or the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants with respect to prospective financial information. Neither AAM's independent registered public accounting firm, nor any other
independent accountants, have compiled, examined, or performed any procedures with respect to the prospective financial information
contained in the AAM forecasts nor have they expressed any opinion or any other form of assurance with respect to such information or its
achievability, and assume no responsibility for, and disclaim any association with, the prospective financial information. By including in
this joint proxy statement/prospectus a summary of the AAM forecasts, neither AAM nor any of its advisors or other representatives has
made or makes any representation to any person regarding the ultimate performance of AAM compared to the information contained in the
AAM forecasts, whether in the merger agreement or otherwise.

        The summary of the AAM forecasts is not being included to influence your decision whether to vote for the AAM share issuance or the
adoption of the merger agreement and the approval of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement (as the case may be), but is
being provided because the AAM forecasts were considered in connection with the merger and were provided to AAM's financial advisor
and also to MPG and its financial advisor.

        The AAM forecasts were prepared based solely on information available at the time of preparation and are not a guarantee of actual
future results, and the information contained in such forecasts should not be relied upon as such. Financial forecasts involve risks,
uncertainties and assumptions, and the estimates and assumptions underlying the AAM forecasts involve judgments with respect to, among
other things, future economic, competitive, regulatory and financial market conditions and future business decisions that may not be
realized and that are inherently subject to significant uncertainties and contingencies, including, among others, risks and uncertainties
described in the sections of this joint proxy statement/prospectus entitled "Risk Factors" beginning on page 34 and "Special Note Regarding
Forward-Looking Statements" beginning on page 42, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond the control of
AAM. AAM cannot assure you that the AAM forecasts will be realized or that future financial results of AAM or MPG, as applicable, will
not materially vary from the AAM forecasts. The AAM forecasts cover multiple years and such information by its nature becomes subject
to greater uncertainty with each successive year. The AAM forecasts do not take into account any circumstances or events occurring after
the date they were prepared. As a result, the AAM forecasts cannot be considered predictive of actual future operating results, and this
information should not be relied on as such. AAM AND MPG DO NOT HAVE ANY OBLIGATION TO, AND WILL NOT, UPDATE
OR OTHERWISE REVISE THE FINANCIAL FORECASTS INCLUDED IN THIS JOINT PROXY
STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS TO REFLECT THE OCCURRENCE OF SUBSEQUENT EVENTS, EVEN IN THE EVENT THAT
ANY OR ALL OF THE ASSUMPTIONS UNDERLYING SUCH FINANCIAL FORECASTS ARE NO LONGER APPROPRIATE.

Interests of MPG Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger 

        In considering the recommendation of the MPG board of directors that MPG stockholders vote to adopt the merger agreement and
approve the transactions contemplated thereby, you should be aware that certain of MPG's directors and executive officers have interests in
the merger that differ from, or are in addition to, the interests of MPG stockholders generally. The MPG board of directors was aware of,
and considered the interests of, MPG's directors and executive officers in approving the merger agreement.

Board Membership

        The merger agreement provides that, prior to the effective time of the merger, AAM will (i) increase the size of the AAM board of
directors to 11 members, (ii) appoint to a different class of the AAM board of directors 3 individuals selected by American Securities and
(iii) cause 1 of the AS designees to be appointed to each of AAM's Executive Committee, Audit Committee, Compensation Committee and
Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee, in each case, effective as of the effective time of the merger. The appointment of each AS
designee to the AAM board of directors will be subject to such designee satisfying AAM's standard qualification requirements for directors
and, with respect to each committee appointment, will be subject to independence and other requirements for such committees set by the
NYSE and any applicable law. Each AS designee will serve on the AAM board of directors until the end of the term for the class of
directors to which the AS designee is appointed. It is a condition to MPG's obligation to complete the merger that AAM has taken each of
the foregoing actions. In addition, as a condition to each of MPG's, AAM's and Merger Sub's obligations to complete the merger, AAM, the
AS stockholder and, solely for limited purposes, American Securities will enter into a stockholders' agreement pursuant to which, among
other things, AAM has agreed to (a) nominate the AS designees (or any replacement designees) for election to the AAM board of directors
for so long as such stockholder (or any affiliate thereof) owns at least 7.5% of the outstanding shares of AAM common stock and
(b) recommend that the AAM stockholders vote in favor of the election of such designees and otherwise use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause such designees to be elected to the AAM board of directors.

        The AS designees to the AAM board of directors are current MPG directors George Thanopoulos, Kevin S. Penn and Loren S. Easton.

Treatment of Equity Awards

        As of the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, certain of MPG's executive officers and directors hold MPG stock options,
restricted MPG common stock and MPG restricted stock unit awards. The merger agreement provides for the treatment of outstanding
equity awards as described below.

MPG Stock Options

        Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, each unvested stock option outstanding under an equity plan of MPG will be
accelerated in full and become fully vested immediately prior to the effective time of the merger and, at the effective time of the merger, all
MPG stock options will be cancelled and the holders thereof will receive an amount in cash (without interest and subject to applicable
withholding of taxes) equal to the product of (x) the aggregate number of shares of MPG common stock that were issuable upon exercise of
such MPG stock option immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, and (y) the cash value of the merger consideration, less the per
share exercise price of each such MPG stock option. For purposes of the cash payment with respect to the MPG stock options, the stock
consideration is valued based on the closing price of a share of AAM common stock as of the trading day immediately preceding the
closing date of the merger. If the exercise price payable upon exercise of an MPG stock option equals or exceeds the value of the merger
consideration, the MPG stock option will be cancelled for no consideration.

Restricted MPG Common Stock

        At the effective time of the merger, pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, all restricted MPG common stock outstanding under
an equity plan of MPG will be cancelled and terminated, and each holder thereof will receive the merger consideration for each share of
restricted MPG common stock.

MPG Restricted Stock Unit Awards

        Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, each restricted stock unit award outstanding under an equity plan of MPG will become
fully vested immediately prior to the effective time and, at the effective time of the merger, will be cancelled and terminated in return for an
amount equal to the merger consideration multiplied by the number of shares of MPG common stock subject to such cancelled MPG
restricted stock unit award.

Payments to Executive Officers and Directors in Respect of MPG Equity Awards 

        The following table, along with its footnotes, shows the unvested MPG stock options, restricted MPG common stock and MPG
restricted stock unit awards held by MPG's named executive officers, other executive officers, and directors that will become vested and
payable, as described above, at the effective time of the merger.

proxy statement/prospectus as the MPG employment agreements) that provide for the following payments and benefits in the event that
such executive officer's employment is terminated by MPG, without "cause" or by such executive officer for "good reason" (each term as

• for Mr. Grimm only, an amount equal to 1.5 times his target annual bonus, payable in equal installments over 18 months; 

• payment of a pro rata portion (through the date of termination of employment) of the annual bonus that the executive officer
would have received for the year of termination, based on actual performance over the entire performance period (based on
target performance for Mr. Grimm); 

• continuation of health care benefits under COBRA for a period of up to 12 months (for Messrs. Thanopoulos and Dono) or
18 months (for Messrs. Blaufuss and Grimm) following termination of employment; and 

• for Mr. Grimm only, outplacement services for up to six months, such amount not to exceed $40,000.

        The MPG employment agreements provide the same severance benefits whether or not the termination of employment occurs in
connection with a change in control of MPG.

        As a condition of receipt of the above payments and benefits, the executive officer must execute a release of claims and continue to
comply with the confidentiality and the non-compete and non-solicit provisions in the MPG employment agreement for 18 months (for
Messrs. Thanopoulos and Grimm) or six months (for Messrs. Blaufuss and Dono) following his termination of employment.

Change in Control Severance Plan

        Mr. Bradley and another executive officer are eligible to participate in the MPG Change in Control Severance Plan, which was adopted
pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement and provides severance to four tiers of employees of MPG and its subsidiaries who are not
currently a party to an agreement providing for severance benefits. Mr. Bradley and another executive officer are eligible to receive
severance under the plan upon a termination of employment without "cause" or by the executive for "good reason" (each, as defined in the
plan) within two years following a change in control (as defined in the plan). Upon such termination of employment, Mr. Bradley and
another executive officer are eligible to receive 18 months of base salary and a pro-rata target bonus, each payable in a lump sum, and
18 months of continued participation in medical, dental and vision plans. If payments and benefits under the plan constitute "excess
parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code and would be subject to an excise tax imposed
under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code, then the payments and benefits will either be paid in full or reduced to the minimum
extent necessary to ensure no portion of the payment is subject to the excise tax, whichever provides the executive with the greatest amount
of payments and benefits on an after-tax basis.

        The merger will constitute a "Change in Control" for purposes of the MPG Change in Control Severance Plan. Messrs. Thanopoulos,
Blaufuss, Grimm and Dono are not eligible to receive severance under the MPG Change in Control Severance Plan.

Benefit Arrangements with the Combined Company

        The merger agreement requires AAM as the surviving corporation in the merger to provide the following with respect to any MPG
employee (including any executive officer) who remains employed following the effective time of the merger for one year following
completion of the merger:

• base salary or wages, incentive compensation opportunities and severance benefits, at least equal to the base salary or wages,
incentive compensation opportunities and severance benefits provided by MPG and its subsidiaries as of immediately prior
to the effective time of the merger; and

• employee benefits that are substantially comparable, in the aggregate, to the employee benefits provided by MPG and its
subsidiaries as of immediately prior to the effective time of the merger.

        In addition, MPG will pay fiscal 2016 year-end bonuses on or around March 2017, consistent with past practice, to executive officers
and employees. Furthermore, MPG may establish a bonus plan for 2017 in consultation with AAM, which will have substantially similar
target and maximum bonus percentages as the bonus plans adopted in prior years.

Directors' and Officers' Indemnification and Insurance

        The merger agreement provides that, from and after the effective time of the merger, AAM will cause MPG, as the surviving entity in
the merger, to do the following:

• indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, all individuals who, as of the date of the
merger agreement were, or who, prior to the effective time of the merger, commences, serving as a director or officer of
MPG or was or commences serving at the request of MPG as a director or officer of another entity against all claims, losses,
liabilities, damages, judgments, inquiries, fines, amounts paid in settlement and fees, costs and expenses (including
attorneys' fees and disbursements incurred in connection with any actual or threatened action), whether civil, criminal,
administrative, regulatory or investigative (and whether existing or occurring or alleged to occur at or prior to the effective
time of the merger) that arise from the fact that such individual is or was a director or officer of MPG or is or was serving at
the request of MPG as a director or officer of another entity, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the effective
time of the merger; 

• continue in full force and effect all rights to indemnification, advancement or reimbursement of expenses and exculpation
from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the effective time of the merger in favor of the current or former
directors, officers or employees of MPG and its subsidiaries under their respective organizational documents and any
indemnification or other similar agreements in effect as of the date of the merger agreement; and 

• maintain in effect provisions in the organizational documents of MPG and its subsidiaries with respect to indemnification,
advancement and reimbursement of expenses and exculpation from liabilities with respect to facts or circumstances
occurring at or prior to the effective time of the merger that are no less favorable than were in effect in the organizational
documents of MPG and its subsidiaries provided to AAM as in effect on the date of the merger agreement and, for a period
of 6 years after the effective time of the merger, not amend, repeal or otherwise modify such provisions in any manner that
would adversely affect the rights thereunder of individuals who at or prior to the effective time of the merger were directors,
officers, employees, fiduciaries or agents of MPG unless such modification is required by law.

In addition, the merger agreement provides that MPG will purchase a "tail" policy providing coverage to each person covered by MPG's
directors' and officers' insurance and/or fiduciary liability insurance policy in effect on the date of the merger agreement or at the effective
time of the merger for a period of 6 years from the effective time of the merger (and until such later time as an action commenced during
such 6-year period shall have been finally disposed of). The tail policy will provide coverage to such persons with respect to actions and
omissions occurring prior to the effective time of the merger in an amount not less than MPG's existing coverage and containing such other
terms and conditions that are no less favorable to the persons covered by such policies than those in MPG's policies in effect on the date of
the merger agreement.

Quantification of Payments and Benefits

        The following table sets forth the information required by Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K regarding the amounts of payments and
benefits that each named executive officer of MPG would receive in connection with the merger, based on the following assumptions:
completion of the merger occurred on April 5, 2017, the employment of the executive officer was terminated by the combined company
without cause or by the executive officer for good reason on such date and the merger consideration is $22.00 per share of MPG common
stock (assuming an agreed value of $17.00 per share of AAM common stock). As a result, the actual amounts, if any, to be received by
named executive officers may differ from the amounts set forth below.

Merger Consideration 

Merger Consideration to be Received by MPG Stockholders

        At the effective time of the merger, each share of MPG common stock (other than MPG excluded shares) issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the effective time of the merger will be converted into the right to receive:

• $13.50 in cash, without interest; and 

• 0.5 of a share of AAM common stock.

        In lieu of the issuance of any fractional share of AAM common stock to which an MPG stockholder would otherwise be entitled, an
MPG stockholder will be entitled to receive an amount in cash, without interest and rounded down to the nearest whole cent (and subject to
applicable withholding of taxes), equal to the product obtained by multiplying (a) the fractional share of AAM common stock to which the
stockholder would otherwise be entitled (after taking into account all fractional share interests then held by the stockholder) by (b) the
average of the volume weighted averages of the trading prices of shares of AAM common stock on the NYSE on each of the 5 consecutive
trading days ending on the trading day that is 2 trading days prior to the closing date.

Potential Adjustments

        The merger agreement provides that the exchange ratio will be adjusted to appropriately reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse
stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities of a subsidiary of AAM or MPG or of securities convertible
into shares of AAM common stock or shares of MPG common stock), extraordinary cash dividends, reorganization, recapitalization,
reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other like change with respect to shares of AAM common stock or shares of MPG
common stock with a record date occurring on or after the date of the merger agreement and prior to the effective time of the merger.

Ownership of AAM Following the Merger 

        If the merger had been completed on December 31, 2016, and based on the assumptions set forth under "Unaudited Pro Forma
Condensed Combined Financial Statements" beginning on page 165, MPG stockholders would have owned approximately 31% and AAM
stockholders would have owned approximately 69% of the pro forma outstanding shares of AAM common stock immediately following the
completion of the merger.

Conversion of Shares; Procedures for Exchange of Shares 

        The conversion of shares of MPG common stock (other than MPG excluded shares) into the right to receive the merger consideration
will occur automatically at the effective time of the merger. As promptly as practicable after the effective time of the merger, AAM will
cause Computershare Trust Company, N.A. (which we refer to in this this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the exchange agent) to mail a
letter of transmittal to each former holder of record of shares of MPG common stock. The letter of transmittal will specify that delivery will
be effected, and risk of loss and title to shares of MPG common stock will pass, only upon proper delivery of such shares to the exchange
agent in accordance with the procedures set forth in the letter of transmittal. The letter of transmittal will be accompanied by instructions for
surrendering certificates and book-entry shares representing shares of MPG common stock in exchange for the merger consideration,
including shares of AAM common stock, the cash portion of the merger consideration, any dividends or distributions payable pursuant to
the merger agreement and any cash in lieu of fractional shares. No interest will be paid or will accrue on any merger consideration, any cash
in lieu of any fractional shares of AAM common stock or any dividends or distributions payable to holders of shares of MPG common
stock. MPG stockholders should not return any stock certificates with the enclosed proxy card.

Effective Time of the Merger 

        The merger will become effective at the time at which the certificate of merger has been duly filed with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware or at such later date or time as is agreed upon by AAM and MPG and specified in the certificate of merger.

Stock Exchange Listing of AAM Shares 

        It is a condition to the completion of the merger that the shares of AAM common stock to be issued to MPG stockholders in the merger
be approved for listing on the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance.

Delisting and Deregistration of MPG Common Stock 

        Upon the completion of the merger, the shares of MPG common stock currently listed on the NYSE will cease to be listed on the
NYSE and will subsequently be deregistered under the Exchange Act.

Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger 

        The following general discussion addresses, subject to the limitations set forth below, the material U.S. federal income tax
consequences to U.S. holders and non-U.S. holders (in each case, as defined below) of shares of MPG common stock of the exchange of
shares of MPG common stock for the merger consideration in the merger and the ownership and disposition by them of shares of AAM
common stock received in the merger. The following discussion does not address any aspects of U.S. taxation other than U.S. federal
income taxation. This discussion does not address any non-income or other taxes or any foreign, state or local tax consequences of the
merger. The discussion below is for

general purposes only and is not a substitute for your own analysis of the tax consequences of the merger and the subsequent ownership and
disposition of AAM common stock.

        We urge you to consult your own tax advisor as to the specific tax consequences to you of the merger and the ownership of
AAM common stock received in the merger, including the applicability and effect of U.S. federal, state, local and non-U.S. income
and other tax laws in light of your particular circumstances.

        This discussion is not a complete analysis or listing of all potential tax considerations relating to the merger or subsequent ownership
and disposition of shares of AAM common stock, and does not address all tax considerations that may be relevant to MPG stockholders. In
particular, the discussion below addresses U.S. federal income tax consequences for persons who hold their shares of MPG common stock,
and will hold their shares of AAM common stock, solely as "capital assets" within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (which we refer to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the Code) (generally, property held for
investment). The discussion below does not address any tax consequences for stockholders who are subject to special rules under U.S.
federal income tax laws, such as:

• banks, thrifts, mutual funds, other financial institutions or insurance companies; 

• tax-exempt entities and pension funds; 

• individual retirement and other deferred accounts; 

• persons who hold shares as part of a straddle, hedge, integrated transaction or conversion transaction; 

• persons who have been, but are no longer, citizens or residents of the United States; 

• "passive foreign investment companies" or "controlled foreign corporations"; 

• a partnership or other pass-through entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes; 

• dealers or traders in securities, commodities or currencies; 

• grantor trusts; 

• persons subject to the alternative minimum tax; 

• U.S. persons whose "functional currency" is not the U.S. dollar; 

• regulated investment companies and real estate investment trusts; or 

• persons who received shares through the exercise of incentive stock options, through the issuance of restricted stock under
an equity incentive plan or through a tax qualified retirement plan or otherwise as compensation.

        This discussion is based on the Code, the Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder, and judicial and administrative interpretations
thereof, in each case as in effect and available on the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus and does not take into account potential
suggested or proposed changes in such tax laws which may impact the discussion below. Each of the foregoing is subject to change,
potentially with retroactive effect.

        For purposes of this discussion, a "U.S. holder" is a beneficial owner of shares of MPG common stock or, after the completion of the
merger, AAM common stock that for U.S. federal income tax purposes is:

• an individual citizen or resident alien of the United States; 

• a corporation (or other entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) created or organized in or under
the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia; 

• an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or

• a trust, if such trust validly has elected to be treated as a U.S. person for U.S. federal income tax purposes or if (i) a U.S.
court can exercise primary supervision over its administration and (ii) one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control
all of the substantial decisions of such trust.

        A "non-U.S. holder" is a beneficial owner of shares of MPG common stock or, after the completion of the merger, AAM common
stock, other than a U.S. holder or a partnership or an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes
(which we refer to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as a Partnership). If a Partnership is a beneficial owner of shares of MPG
common stock, the tax treatment of a partner in that Partnership will generally depend on the status of the partner and the activities of the
Partnership. Holders of shares of MPG common stock that are Partnerships, and partners in such Partnerships, should consult their own tax
advisors regarding the U.S. federal income tax considerations for them with respect to the merger and the subsequent ownership and
disposition of shares of AAM common stock.

Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders

Exchange of Shares of MPG Common Stock for Merger Consideration

        A U.S. holder's receipt of the merger consideration in exchange for its shares of MPG common stock in the merger will be a taxable
transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As such, a U.S. holder generally will recognize capital gain or loss for U.S. federal income
tax purposes in an amount equal to the difference between (1) the sum of (a) the amount of cash received by such holder in the merger
including amounts, if any, withheld from the merger consideration otherwise payable to such holder and paid to taxing authorities by AAM
or other applicable withholding agents and (b) the fair market value, at the effective time of the merger, of the shares of AAM common
stock received by such holder in the merger and (2) such holder's adjusted tax basis in shares of MPG common stock owned by such holder
immediately prior to the effective time of the merger. Any such gain or loss generally will be long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S.
holder's holding period in the shares of MPG common stock immediately prior to the merger is more than one year. The amount and
character of gain or loss must be calculated separately for each identifiable block of shares (generally, shares purchased at the same time in
the same transaction) of MPG common stock exchanged in the merger. For non-corporate U.S. holders, long-term capital gain generally is
taxed at preferential U.S. federal rates. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to certain limitations. Each U.S. holder is urged to
consult its tax advisor regarding the manner in which gain or loss should be calculated as a result of the merger.

        A U.S. holder's aggregate tax basis in shares of AAM common stock received in the merger will equal the fair market value of such
shares at the effective time of the merger, and the holding period for such shares will begin on the date immediately following the merger.

Consequences of Holding Shares of AAM Common Stock

Distributions

        Following the merger, distributions to U.S. holders on shares of AAM common stock that are paid out of AAM's current or
accumulated earnings and profits (as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes) will be treated as dividends for U.S. federal income
tax purposes. Dividends received by individual U.S. holders with respect to shares of AAM common stock generally should qualify for
preferential tax rates on "qualified dividend income" so long as certain holding period requirements are met. Dividends paid on shares of
AAM common stock will be eligible for the dividends received deduction if the U.S. holder is an otherwise qualifying corporate holder that
meets the holding period and other requirements for the dividends received deduction. Any distribution not constituting a dividend will be
treated first as reducing the adjusted basis in the U.S. holder's shares of AAM

Table of Contents

common stock and, to the extent it exceeds the adjusted basis in the U.S. holder's shares of AAM common stock, as gain from the sale or
exchange of such stock. Each U.S. holder is urged to consult its tax advisor regarding the U.S. federal income tax and other tax
consequences of holding shares of AAM common stock.

Gain on Sale or Other Disposition of AAM Common Stock

        Upon the sale or other taxable disposition of AAM common stock received in the merger, a U.S. holder generally will recognize capital
gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized on such sale or taxable disposition and the U.S. holder's adjusted tax basis
in the shares of AAM common stock sold. Any such gain or loss generally will be long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. holder's holding
period in the shares of AAM common stock sold is more than one year. For non-corporate U.S. holders, long-term capital gain generally is
taxed at preferential U.S. federal rates. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to certain limitations. Each U.S. holder is urged to
consult its tax advisor regarding the U.S. federal income tax and other tax consequences of a sale, redemption, or other taxable disposition
of shares of AAM common stock received in the merger.

Medicare Tax

        A U.S. holder that is an individual or estate, or a trust that does not qualify for exemption, will be subject to a 3.8% tax (which we refer
to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the Medicare Tax) on the lesser of (a) the U.S. holder's "net investment income" for the
relevant taxable year and (b) the excess of the U.S. holder's modified adjusted gross income for the taxable year over a certain threshold
(which in the case of individuals will be between $125,000 and $250,000 depending on the individual's circumstances). A U.S. holder's net
investment income will generally include dividends received on shares of AAM common stock and net gains from the disposition of shares
of MPG common stock or AAM common stock unless such dividend income or net gains are derived in the ordinary course of the conduct
of a trade or business (other than a trade or business that consists of certain passive or trading activities). A U.S. holder that is an individual,
estate or trust should consult its own tax advisor regarding the applicability of the Medicare Tax to the U.S. holder's dividend income and
gains in respect of the U.S. holder's investment in AAM common stock.

Information Reporting and Backup Withholding

        In general, payments received in connection with the exchange of shares of MPG common stock in the merger and payments of
dividends on, and proceeds of a disposition of, shares of AAM common stock received in the merger may be reported to the Internal
Revenue Service (which we refer to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the IRS). Backup withholding, currently at a rate of 28%,
may apply with respect to payments received in connection with the exchange of shares of MPG common stock in the merger and to
payments of dividends on, and proceeds of a disposition of, shares of AAM common stock received in the merger unless the U.S. holder
receiving such a payment (1) is an exempt holder (generally, a corporation or nonresident alien individual who or which, when required,
certifies as to his, her or its exempt status) or (2) provides a certificate (generally on IRS Form W-9) containing the holder's name, address,
correct federal taxpayer identification number and a statement that the holder is a U.S. person and is not subject to backup withholding.
Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules will be allowable as a refund or
credit against a holder's U.S. federal income tax liability provided the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.

Tax Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders

Exchange of Shares of MPG Common Stock for Merger Consideration

        In general, a non-U.S. holder will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on any gain realized upon the exchange of shares of MPG
common stock for merger consideration in the merger unless:

• the gain is effectively connected with a trade or business carried on by the non-U.S. holder within the United States (and, if
required by an applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to a U.S. permanent establishment of such non-U.S. holder); 

• the non-U.S. holder is an individual and is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of
disposition and certain other conditions are met; or 

• MPG is or has been a "U.S. real property holding corporation" within the meaning of Section 897 of the Code for U.S.
federal income tax purposes at any time within the shorter of the five-year period preceding such disposition or such non-
U.S. holder's holding period of its shares of MPG common stock and such non-U.S. holder beneficially owned more than
5% of the total fair market value of MPG common stock at any time during such period. MPG does not believe it is or has
been a U.S. real property holding corporation during the preceding five years and, although there can be no assurance, does
not anticipate becoming one prior to the merger.

        Gain that is described in the first bullet point immediately above generally will be subject to U.S. federal net income taxation at regular
graduated U.S. federal income tax rates. If the non-U.S. holder is a foreign corporation, a branch profits tax at a rate of 30% (or such lower
rate as may be specified by an applicable income tax treaty) also may apply to its effectively connected earnings and profits. An individual
non-U.S. holder described in the second bullet point immediately above generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a flat 30%
rate (or such lower rate specified by an applicable income tax treaty) on the gain derived from the exchange of shares of MPG common
stock for merger consideration, which may be offset by U.S. source capital losses (even though the individual is not considered a resident of
the United States), provided that the non-U.S. holder has timely filed U.S. federal income tax returns with respect to such losses. Any gain
that is described in the third bullet point immediately above if MPG was or is a "U.S. real property holding corporation" would be subject to
tax at generally applicable U.S. federal income tax rates. Each non-U.S. holder is urged to consult its tax advisor regarding the manner in
which gain or loss should be calculated as a result of the merger.

Consequences of Holding Shares of AAM Common Stock

Distributions

        In general, distributions to a non-U.S. holder with respect to shares of AAM common stock received in the merger that represent
dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes will be subject to U.S. withholding tax at a rate of 30% of the gross amount of the
distribution, unless the non-U.S. holder is eligible for a reduced rate of withholding tax under an applicable income tax treaty and the non-
U.S. holder provides proper certification of its eligibility for such reduced rate on IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E. A distribution will
constitute a dividend for U.S. federal income tax purposes to the extent of AAM's current or accumulated earnings and profits as determined
for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Any distribution not constituting a dividend will be treated first as reducing the adjusted basis in the
non-U.S. holder's shares of AAM common stock and, to the extent it exceeds the adjusted basis in the non-U.S. holder's shares of AAM
common stock, as gain from the sale or exchange of such stock.

        Dividends paid to a non-U.S. holder that are effectively connected with its conduct of a trade or business within the United States (and,
if an income tax treaty applies, are attributable to a U.S.

permanent establishment) will not be subject to U.S. withholding tax, as described above, if the non-U.S. holder complies with applicable
certification and disclosure requirements. Instead, such dividends generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net income basis,
in the same manner as if the non-U.S. holder were a resident of the United States, provided that the non-U.S. holder timely files a U.S.
federal income tax return. Dividends received by a foreign corporation that are effectively connected with its conduct of trade or business
within the United States may be subject to an additional branch profits tax at a rate of 30% (or such lower rate as may be specified by an
applicable income tax treaty). Each non-U.S. holder is urged to consult its tax advisor regarding the U.S. federal income tax and other tax
consequences of holding shares of AAM common stock.

Gain on Sale or Other Taxable Disposition of AAM Common Stock

        In general, a non-U.S. holder will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on any gain realized upon the sale or other taxable
disposition of the non-U.S. holder's shares of AAM common stock received in the merger unless:

• the gain is effectively connected with a trade or business carried on by the non-U.S. holder within the United States (and, if
required by an applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to a U.S. permanent establishment of such non-U.S. holder); 

• the non-U.S. holder is an individual and is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of
disposition and certain other conditions are met; or 

• AAM is or has been a "U.S. real property holding corporation" within the meaning of Section 897 of the Code for U.S.
federal income tax purposes at any time within the shorter of the five-year period preceding such disposition or such non-
U.S. holder's holding period of its shares of AAM common stock and either such non-U.S. holder beneficially owned more
than 5% of the total fair market value of AAM common stock at any time during such period or AAM common stock has
ceased to be publicly traded. AAM does not believe it is or has been a U.S. real property holding corporation during the
preceding five years and, although there can be no assurance, does not anticipate becoming one in the future.

        Gain that is described in the first bullet point immediately above generally will be subject to U.S. federal net income taxation at regular
graduated U.S. federal income tax rates. If the non-U.S. holder is a foreign corporation, a branch profits tax at a rate of 30% (or such lower
rate as may be specified by an applicable income tax treaty) also may apply to its effectively connected earnings and profits. An individual
non-U.S. holder described in the second bullet point immediately above generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a flat 30%
rate (or such lower rate specified by an applicable income tax treaty) on the gain derived from such sale or other disposition, which may be
offset by U.S. source capital losses (even though the individual is not considered a resident of the United States), provided that the non-U.S.
holder has timely filed U.S. federal income tax returns with respect to such losses. Any gain that is described in the third bullet point
immediately above if AAM was or is a "U.S. real property holding corporation" would be subject to tax at generally applicable U.S. federal
income tax rates. Each non-U.S. holder is urged to consult its tax advisor regarding the U.S. federal income tax and other tax consequences
of a sale, redemption, or other disposition of shares of AAM common stock received in the merger.

Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA)

        Legislation commonly known as FATCA generally imposes a U.S. federal withholding tax of 30% on dividends on, and the gross
proceeds of a disposition of, shares of AAM common stock in each case paid to a "foreign financial institution" (as defined in the Code),
unless such institution provides sufficient documentation, typically on IRS Form W-8BEN-E, evidencing its compliance (or deemed
compliance) with FATCA (which may alternatively be compliance with an intergovernmental agreement

with the United States) or otherwise establishes an exemption. FATCA also imposes a U.S. federal withholding tax of 30% on dividends on,
and the gross proceeds of a disposition of, shares of AAM common stock paid to a "non-financial foreign entity" (as defined in the Code)
unless such entity provides sufficient documentation, typically on IRS Form W-8BEN-E, identifying certain substantial direct and indirect
U.S. owners of the entity, certifies that there are no such owners, or otherwise establishes an exemption. The withholding taxes described
above currently apply to dividend payments and will apply in the future to payments of gross proceeds from dispositions occurring after
December 31, 2018. Under certain circumstances, a non-U.S. holder might be eligible for refunds or credits of such taxes. An
intergovernmental agreement between the United States and an applicable foreign country may modify the requirements described in this
paragraph. Non-U.S. holders are urged to consult with their own tax advisors regarding the possible implications of this legislation on their
ownership and disposition of shares of AAM common stock.

Information Reporting and Backup Withholding

        Information reporting and backup withholding may apply to payments made in connection with the merger and dividend payments on,
and proceeds from the disposition of, shares of AAM common stock received in the merger. Backup withholding will not apply, however, to
a non-U.S. holder who provides a certification of foreign status on the applicable IRS Form W-8 (typically IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-
E) or appropriate successor form (and the payor does not have actual knowledge or reason to know that such holder is a United States
person as defined in the Code) or is otherwise exempt from backup withholding. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts
withheld under the backup withholding rules may be allowed as a refund or a credit against a non-U.S. holder's U.S. federal income tax
liability, if any, provided the required information and refund claim is timely filed with the IRS. Non-U.S. holders should consult their tax
advisors regarding the application of the information reporting and backup withholding rules to them.

        The foregoing summary does not discuss all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to particular holders
of shares of MPG common stock. MPG stockholders should consult their own tax advisors as to the particular tax consequences to
them of the merger and the ownership and disposition of shares of AAM common stock received in the merger under any federal,
state, local, foreign or other tax laws.

Regulatory Matters 

        AAM, Merger Sub and MPG have agreed to use their respective reasonable best efforts to consummate and make effective the merger
and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including, among other things, using reasonable best efforts to obtain
(and cooperating with the other party to obtain) all regulatory approvals that may be or become necessary for the consummation of the
transactions.

        However, in no event will AAM or Merger Sub or their subsidiaries be obligated to take any action in connection with obtaining any
required regulatory approval that would require the divestiture of any assets of AAM or MPG or any of their subsidiaries, would limit
AAM's freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to retain, MPG and its subsidiaries or any portion thereof or any of AAM's or its
affiliates' other assets or businesses, or would in AAM's reasonable judgment, be expected to have a material adverse impact on any of
AAM's businesses or MPG's businesses, except that, if necessary to obtain the regulatory consents or approvals discussed below, AAM will
agree to the divestiture of the assets or businesses or products or product lines of MPG and its subsidiaries that, individually or in the
aggregate, generated total worldwide revenues of up to $150,000,000 in the twelve month period ended September 30, 2016.

Table of Contents

Consents and Approvals

        To consummate the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, AAM and MPG must obtain approvals or consents from, or
make filings with, a number of United States and foreign antitrust regulators. We describe below the material United States and foreign
antitrust approvals. If additional regulatory approvals, consents and filings are required to complete the transactions, AAM and MPG intend
to seek such consents and approvals and make such filings.

        Under the HSR Act and the rules promulgated thereunder by the FTC, the merger may not be completed until notification and report
forms have been filed by AAM and MPG with the FTC and the DOJ and the applicable waiting period has expired or been terminated.
AAM and MPG filed their respective notification and report forms under the HSR Act with the FTC and the DOJ on November 18, 2016.
To provide the FTC additional time to review the proposed transaction, AAM withdrew its HSR filing effective December 19, 2016 and
refiled it on December 21, 2016. On January 20, 2017, at 11:59 p.m. Eastern Standard Time, the HSR Act waiting period expired.

        The merger is also subject to antitrust review by governmental authorities in several foreign jurisdictions in which the companies have
a sufficient market presence to require filings. As of the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, the parties have made filings in
Austria, Germany, Mexico and South Korea. On December 22, 2016, the merger was granted early clearance in Germany. On January 10,
2017, the merger was cleared in Austria. On January 26, 2017, the merger was granted approval in South Korea. On February 16, 2017, the
parties refiled their application with respect to the merger with COFECE in Mexico to include additional information requested by
COFECE. Approval by COFECE is the only remaining required governmental approval.

Timing

        AAM and MPG cannot give any assurance as to the timing of these consents and approvals or as to AAM's and MPG's ultimate ability
to obtain such consents or approvals (or any additional consents or approvals which may otherwise become necessary) or that AAM and
MPG will obtain such consents or approvals on terms and subject to conditions satisfactory to AAM and MPG.

General

        It is possible that any of the governmental entities with which filings have been made or may be made may seek regulatory concessions
or impose additional conditions or that states or private parties may commence litigation to prevent the completion of the merger. There can
be no assurance that:

• AAM or MPG will be able to satisfy or comply with any conditions imposed; 

• compliance or non-compliance will not have adverse consequences on the combined company after the completion of the
merger; or 

• litigation, if any, will be resolved favorably to AAM and MPG.

Appraisal Rights 

        Holders of shares of MPG common stock who meet certain requirements are entitled to seek appraisal rights in connection with the
merger.

        This joint proxy statement/prospectus constitutes notice of such appraisal rights as required by Section 262 of the General Corporation
Law of the State of Delaware (which we refer to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the DGCL). The full text of Section 262 of the
DGCL (which we refer to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as Section 262) is attached to this proxy statement as Annex E. In
connection with the merger, any holder of shares of MPG common stock who wishes to exercise appraisal rights, or who wishes to preserve
such holder's right to do so, should review the

following discussion and Annex E carefully because failure to timely and properly comply with the procedures specified in Section 262
may result in the loss of appraisal rights. Because of the complexity of the procedures for exercising appraisal rights, any holder of
shares of MPG common stock who wishes to exercise such holder's appraisal rights should consider seeking legal and financial
advice. The following discussion is not a complete statement of the law pertaining to appraisal rights under the DGCL and is qualified in its
entirety by the full text of Section 262, which is attached to this joint proxy statement/prospectus as Annex E. The following summary does
not constitute any legal or other advice nor does it constitute a recommendation that MPG stockholders exercise their appraisal rights under
Section 262.

        Under Section 262, holders of shares of MPG common stock who do not vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement and the
approval of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and who otherwise comply with the procedures set forth in Section 262
will be entitled to have their shares appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and receive payment in cash of the "fair value" of the
shares, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, together with interest, if any,
determined as described below, unless the surviving corporation of the merger earlier pays an amount in cash to MPG stockholders entitled
to appraisal as described below. Only a holder of record can exercise appraisal rights and demand appraisal of the shares registered
in that holder's name. Failure to follow precisely any of the statutory requirements may result in the loss of your appraisal rights.

        All references in Section 262 and in this summary of appraisal rights applicable to MPG stockholders in connection with the merger
are to record holders of shares of MPG common stock immediately prior to the effective time of the merger. If you hold your shares of MPG
common stock through another person, such as a broker, fiduciary, depositary or other nominee, you must act promptly to cause the record
holder to follow the steps summarized below properly and in a timely manner to perfect appraisal rights. Accordingly, you should consult
with your bank, broker or other nominee to determine the appropriate procedures for the making of a demand for appraisal by the
bank, broker or other nominee.

        All written demands for appraisal pursuant to Section 262 should be delivered to the Secretary of MPG at Metaldyne
Performance Group Inc., Attention: Secretary, One Towne Square, Suite 550, Southfield, Michigan 48076.

Filing Written Demand

        Any holder of shares of MPG common stock wishing to exercise appraisal rights must deliver to MPG, before the vote on the adoption
of the merger agreement and the approval of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement at the MPG special meeting, a written
demand for the appraisal of such stockholder's shares. The demand must reasonably inform the surviving corporation of the merger of the
identity of the holder, as well as the intention of the holder to demand an appraisal of the "fair value" of the shares of MPG common stock
held by the holder. A stockholder's failure to deliver the written demand prior to the taking of the vote on the adoption of the merger
agreement and the approval of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement at the MPG special meeting will constitute a waiver
of appraisal rights. The stockholder also must not vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement and the approval of the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement at the MPG special meeting. A holder of shares of MPG common stock wishing to exercise
appraisal rights must hold the shares of record on the date the written demand for appraisal is made and must continue to hold the shares of
record through the effective time of the merger.

        If shares of MPG common stock are held through a bank, broker, depository or other nominee, the bank, broker, depository or other
nominee that is the record holder must demand appraisal of such shares. A broker, bank, fiduciary, depository or other nominee who holds
shares of MPG common

Table of Contents

stock as a nominee for several beneficial owners may exercise appraisal rights with respect to the shares of MPG common stock held for
one or more beneficial owners while not exercising such rights with respect to the shares of MPG common stock held for other beneficial
owners. In such case, the written demand must set forth the number of shares of MPG common stock covered by the demand. Where the
number of shares of MPG common stock is not expressly stated, the demand will be presumed to cover all shares of MPG common stock
held in the name of the record owner. Stockholders who hold their shares of MPG common stock in bank, brokerage accounts or other
nominee forms and who wish to exercise appraisal rights are urged to consult with their bank, broker or other nominee to determine the
appropriate procedures for the making of a demand for appraisal by such nominee.

        If the shares of MPG common stock are owned of record in a fiduciary capacity, such as by a trustee, guardian or custodian, execution
of the demand should be made in that capacity, and if the shares of MPG common stock are owned of record by more than one person, as in
a joint tenancy and tenancy in common, the demand should be executed by or on behalf of all joint owners. An authorized agent, including
an agent for two or more joint owners, may execute a demand for appraisal on behalf of a holder of record; however, the agent must identify
the record owner or owners and expressly disclose that, in executing the demand, the agent is acting as agent for the record owner or
owners.

Waiver of Appraisal Rights

        A proxy that is submitted by a holder of record of MPG common stock that does not contain voting instructions will, unless revoked,
be voted at the MPG special meeting in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement and the approval of the transactions contemplated by
the merger agreement. A proxy without any instructions will therefore result in the waiver of the stockholder's right of appraisal and will
nullify any previously delivered written demand for appraisal. Consequently, a stockholder who submits a proxy and who wishes to exercise
appraisal rights must submit a proxy containing instructions to vote against the adoption of the merger agreement and the approval of the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement or abstain from voting on the adoption of the merger agreement and the approval of the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. Voting against the adoption of the merger agreement and the approval of the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement or abstaining from voting or failing to vote on the proposal to adopt the merger
agreement will not by itself constitute a written demand for appraisal satisfying the requirements of Section 262. The written demand for
appraisal must be in addition to and separate from any proxy or vote against the adoption of the merger agreement and the approval of the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

Notice by the Surviving Corporation

        If the merger is completed, within 10 days after the effective time of the merger, the surviving corporation of the merger will notify
each holder of shares of MPG common stock who has made a written demand for appraisal pursuant to Section 262, and who has not voted
in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement and the approval of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, that the
merger has become effective and the effective date thereof.

Filing a Petition for Appraisal

        Within 120 days after the effective time of the merger, but not thereafter, the surviving corporation of the merger or any holder of
shares of MPG common stock who has complied with Section 262 and is entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262 may file a petition in
the Delaware Court of Chancery demanding a determination of the fair value of the shares of MPG common stock held by all holders who
have properly demanded appraisal of their shares. The surviving corporation of the merger is under no obligation to, and has no present
intention to, file such a petition, and holders of shares of MPG common stock should assume that the surviving corporation of the merger
will not file a petition

Table of Contents

or initiate any negotiations with respect to the fair value of shares of MPG common stock. Accordingly, any holders of shares of MPG
common stock who desire to have their shares appraised should initiate all necessary action to perfect their appraisal rights in respect of
shares of MPG common stock within the time prescribed in Section 262.

        Within 120 days after the effective time of the merger, any holder of shares of MPG common stock who has complied with the
requirements for exercise of appraisal rights under Section 262 will be entitled, upon written request, to receive from the surviving
corporation of the merger a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares of MPG common stock not voted in favor of the adoption
of the merger agreement and the approval of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and with respect to which demands for
appraisal have been received and the aggregate number of holders of such shares. The statement must be mailed to the stockholder within
ten days after a written request therefor has been received by the surviving corporation of the merger or within ten days after the expiration
of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal, whichever is later. A beneficial owner of shares held either in a voting trust or by a
nominee on behalf of such person may, in such person's own name, file a petition seeking appraisal or request the foregoing statement. As
noted above, however, the demand for appraisal can only be made by a stockholder of record.

Initial Hearing

        If a petition for an appraisal is timely filed by a holder of shares of MPG common stock and a copy thereof is served upon the
surviving corporation of the merger, the surviving corporation will then be obligated within 20 days to file with the Delaware Register in
Chancery a duly verified list containing the names and addresses of all stockholders who have demanded appraisal of their shares of MPG
common stock and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares have not been reached. After notice to the stockholders as required
by the court, the Delaware Court of Chancery is empowered to conduct a hearing on the petition to determine those stockholders who have
complied with Section 262 and who have become entitled to appraisal rights thereunder. The Delaware Court of Chancery may require the
stockholders who demanded appraisal of their shares of MPG common stock to submit their stock certificates to the Delaware Register in
Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceeding, and if any stockholder fails to comply with the direction, the
Delaware Court of Chancery may dismiss the appraisal proceedings as to such stockholder.

        Section 262 further provides that the Delaware Chancery Court shall dismiss the proceedings as to all holders of such shares who are
otherwise entitled to appraisal rights if, immediately prior to a transaction such as the merger, the shares of the class or series of stock of the
constituent corporation as to which appraisal rights are available were listed on a national securities exchange, unless (i) the total number of
shares entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of the class or series eligible for appraisal or (ii) the value of the
consideration provided in the merger for such total number of shares exceeds $1 million.

Judicial Determination of Fair Value

        After determining the holders of shares of MPG common stock entitled to appraisal, the Delaware Court of Chancery will appraise the
"fair value" of their shares, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, together with
interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. In determining fair value, the Delaware Court of Chancery will
take into account all relevant factors. The appraisal proceeding will be conducted in accordance with the rules of the Delaware Court of
Chancery, including any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings.

        In Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the Supreme Court of Delaware discussed the factors that could be considered in determining fair value in
an appraisal proceeding, stating that "proof of value by any

117

Table of Contents

techniques or methods that are generally considered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court" should be
considered, and that "fair price obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of a company." The Delaware
Supreme Court stated that, in making this determination of fair value, the Delaware Court of Chancery must consider market value, asset
value, dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the enterprise and any other facts that could be ascertained as of the date of the merger
that throw any light on future prospects of the merged corporation. Section 262 provides that fair value is to be "exclusive of any element of
value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger[.]" In Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court
stated that such exclusion is a "narrow exclusion that does not encompass known elements of value," but which rather applies only to the
speculative elements of value arising from such accomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger, the Supreme Court of Delaware also stated
that "elements of future value, including the nature of the enterprise, which are known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the merger
and not the product of speculation, may be considered."

        Stockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the "fair value" of their shares as so determined could be more than,
the same as or less than the consideration they would receive pursuant to the merger agreement if they did not seek appraisal of their shares.
Although the parties to the merger agreement believe that the merger consideration is fair, no representation is made as to the
outcome of the appraisal of fair value as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, and MPG stockholders should recognize
that such an appraisal could result in a determination of a value higher or lower than, or the same as, the value of the merger
consideration. You should be aware that an investment banking opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the
consideration payable in a sale transaction, such as the merger, is not an opinion as to, and does not otherwise address, fair value under
Section 262. Neither MPG nor AAM anticipate offering more than the merger consideration to any MPG stockholder exercising appraisal
rights, and each of MPG and AAM reserves the right to assert, in any appraisal proceeding, that for purposes of Section 262, the "fair value"
of a share of MPG common stock is less than the value of the merger consideration, and that the methods that are generally considered
acceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court should be considered in the appraisal proceedings.

        Unless the court in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest from the effective date of the merger through the
date of payment of the judgment shall be compounded quarterly and shall accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including
any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period from the effective date of the merger and the date of payment of the
judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time before the entry of the judgment in the appraisal proceedings, the surviving
corporation of the merger may pay to each MPG stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which case interest will accrue after
such date only with respect to the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the amount paid by the surviving corporation of the merger and
the fair value of the shares of MPG common stock as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, and (2) interest accrued until such
date of payment, unless paid at such time.

Costs and Expenses

        The costs of the action (which do not include attorneys' fees or the fees and expenses of experts) may be determined by the Delaware
Court of Chancery, and the parties will be responsible for such fees and expenses as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems equitable under
the circumstances. The Delaware Court of Chancery may also order that all or a portion of the expenses incurred by a stockholder in
connection with an appraisal, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and the fees and expenses of experts utilized in the
appraisal proceeding, be charged pro rata against the value of all the shares entitled to be appraised.

No Rights as a MPG Stockholder

        From and after the effective time of the merger, no dissenting stockholder shall have any rights of a MPG stockholder with respect to
that holder's shares for any purpose, except to receive payment of fair value and to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on
the holder's shares of MPG common stock, if any, payable to MPG stockholders of record as of a time prior to the effective time of the
merger; provided, however, that if a dissenting stockholder delivers to the surviving corporation of the merger a written withdrawal of the
demand for an appraisal within 60 days after the effective time of the merger and acceptance of the merger, or subsequently with the written
approval of the surviving corporation of the merger, then the right of that dissenting stockholder to an appraisal will cease and the dissenting
stockholder will be entitled to receive the merger consideration in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement.

Withdrawal

        Any holder of shares of MPG common stock who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined such proceeding as a named
party may withdraw his, her or its demand for appraisal and accept the consideration offered pursuant to the merger agreement by delivering
to the surviving corporation of the merger a written withdrawal of the demand for appraisal and an acceptance of the merger; however, any
such attempt to withdraw the demand made more than 60 days after the effective date of the merger will require written approval of the
surviving corporation of the merger. No appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery will be dismissed after such 60 day period
without the approval of the Delaware Court of Chancery, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Delaware Court of
Chancery deems just; provided, that this restriction will not affect the right of any former MPG stockholder who has not commenced an
appraisal proceeding or joined such proceeding as a named party to withdraw such stockholder's demand for appraisal and to accept the
merger consideration within 60 days after the date of the merger.

        If any stockholder who demands appraisal of shares of MPG common stock under Section 262 fails to perfect, or withdraws or
otherwise loses, such holder's right to appraisal, the stockholder's shares of MPG common stock will be deemed to have been converted at
the effective time of the merger into the right to receive the merger consideration applicable to such shares. A stockholder will fail to
perfect, or lose or withdraw, the holder's right to appraisal if no petition for appraisal is filed within 120 days after the effective time of the
merger or if the stockholder delivers to the surviving corporation of the merger a written withdrawal of the holder's demand for appraisal
and an acceptance of the merger consideration in accordance with Section 262.

        Failure to comply strictly with all of the procedures set forth in Section 262 may result in the loss of a stockholder's statutory
appraisal rights. Consequently, any MPG stockholder wishing to exercise appraisal rights is urged to consult legal and financial
advisors before attempting to exercise those rights.

CERTAIN LITIGATION 

        On February 16, 2017, a purported class action complaint was filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of
Michigan, captioned Stephen Bushansky v. Metaldyne Performance Group Inc., et al., Case No. 2:17-cv-10508-MAG-DRG. The complaint
asserts claims for alleged violations of Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder, and names
MPG and the members of the MPG board of directors as defendants. The complaint alleges, among other things, that the defendants issued
materially incomplete and misleading disclosures in the preliminary registration statement on Form S-4 relating to the merger. The
complaint seeks, among other things, injunctive relief and an award of attorneys' fees. MPG and the members of the MPG board of directors
believe that the claims asserted in this lawsuit are without merit.

FINANCING RELATING TO THE MERGER

        The obligations of AAM and Merger Sub under the merger agreement are not subject to any conditions regarding their ability to
finance, or obtain financing for, the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, and they are obligated under the merger agreement
to have sufficient funds available to satisfy their obligations under the merger agreement. AAM has obtained commitments for financing
(i) to pay (A) the cash consideration payable in connection with the merger and (B) related fees and expenses, (ii) to refinance any
indebtedness outstanding under the existing AAM senior secured revolving credit facility and certain existing indebtedness of MPG and
(iii) for general corporate purposes. Under the documentation for such financing commitments, AAM has the option to reduce such
commitments by up to $400 million.

Commitment Letter

        On November 3, 2016, in connection with its entry into the merger agreement, AAM entered into a commitment letter (which we refer
to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the commitment letter) with JPMorgan (we refer to JPMorgan and the other financial
institutions joining the commitment letter and providing commitments thereunder collectively in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the
Commitment Parties), pursuant to which the Commitment Parties agreed to provide commitments for (a) a senior secured term loan A
facility (which we refer to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the term loan A facility) in an aggregate principal amount of up to
$100 million, (b) a senior secured term loan B facility (which we refer to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the term loan B facility)
in an aggregate principal amount of up to $1.55 billion (we refer to the term loan A facility and the term loan B facility collectively in this
joint proxy statement/prospectus as the term loan facilities) and (c) a senior unsecured bridge facility (which we refer to in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus as the bridge facility) in an aggregate principal amount of up to $1.2 billion to be provided if and to the extent, prior to
the date of the completion of the merger, up to $1.2 billion in gross proceeds from the issuance and sale of senior unsecured notes (which
we refer to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the senior notes) are not received by AAM.

        In addition, pursuant to the commitment letter, JPMorgan agreed to provide a senior secured revolving credit facility in an aggregate
principal amount not to exceed $800 million (which we refer to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the revolving facility).

        The commitment letter sets out the principal terms of the term loan facilities, the bridge facility and the revolving facility. The funding
of each of the facilities is subject to customary conditions precedent for acquisition financings, including entry into definitive credit
documentation and the completion of the merger.

Term Loan Facilities and Revolving Facility

        On or prior to the date of the completion of the merger, AAM expects to enter into a senior secured credit facility agreement
documenting the term loan facilities and the revolving facility pursuant to which the lenders thereunder will provide up to $1.65 billion in
term loans and up to $800 million in revolving loans to American Axle & Manufacturing, Inc. (which we refer to in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus as the Borrower), a wholly-owned subsidiary of AAM. The term loan facilities and the revolving facility will be
guaranteed by AAM and certain of AAM's direct and indirect wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries subject to customary exceptions (we
refer to these subsidiaries and AAM collectively in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the Guarantors). The term loan facilities and the
revolving facility will be secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all assets of the Borrower and the Guarantors, including
a pledge of the stock of all restricted direct domestic subsidiaries and 66% of the stock of restricted direct, first-tier foreign subsidiaries,
subject to customary exceptions.

Table of Contents

        Amounts borrowed under the term loan facilities are intended to be used to fund a portion of the cash consideration payable in
connection with the merger, pay related fees and expenses, refinance any indebtedness outstanding under the existing AAM senior secured
revolving credit facility and certain existing indebtedness of MPG (including, without limitation, existing credit facilities), and for general
corporate purposes. The term loan A facility is contemplated to mature on the date that is 5 years after its incurrence. The term loan B
facility is contemplated to mature on the date that is 7 years after its incurrence.

        Amounts borrowed under the revolving facility are intended to be used for working capital and for general corporate purposes
(including, without limitation, funding the merger and related costs). The revolving facility is contemplated to mature on the date that is
5 years after the closing date.

        The interest rate payable on amounts outstanding under the term loan facilities and the revolving facility will be equal to either
(i) LIBOR (subject to a 0.75% floor for the term loan B facility) or (ii) an alternate base rate (to be defined as the highest of (a) JPMorgan's
prime rate, (b) the Federal Funds effective rate plus 0.50% and (c) one month LIBOR plus 1.00%), plus, in each case, an applicable margin,
which in the case of the term loan A facility and the revolving facility will be in accordance with a pricing grid to be agreed.

        The documentation for the term loan facilities and the revolving facility will contain events of default, representations and warranties
and covenants reasonably consistent with the Borrower and MPG's respective existing credit facilities. The term loan A facility and the
revolving facility will also be subject to financial maintenance covenants requiring the Borrower to maintain a leverage ratio at or below a
maximum level to be agreed and a consolidated EBITDA to cash interest expense ratio at or above a minimum level to be agreed.

New Senior Notes or Bridge Facility

        AAM intends to finance part of the cash portion of the merger consideration, pay related fees and expenses and refinance certain
existing indebtedness of MPG with an issuance of up to $1.2 billion in new senior unsecured notes, subject to market conditions. Any such
notes may be issued into escrow or carry a mandatory redemption provision such that, if the merger is not completed prior to the outside
date, such notes would be redeemed. To the extent that, prior to the date of the completion of the merger, AAM has not received gross
proceeds of at least $1.2 billion from such issuance, AAM expects to enter into a new senior unsecured credit facility agreement for the
bridge facility pursuant to which the lenders thereunder will provide loans in place of such notes. The bridge facility would be guaranteed
by each of the Guarantors.

        Amounts borrowed under the bridge facility are intended to be used to fund a portion of the cash consideration payable in connection
with the merger, pay related fees and expenses and refinance certain existing indebtedness of MPG. Proceeds of any equity issuances and
debt incurred by AAM (in each case subject to certain customary exceptions, including receivables financing) will be used to mandatorily
repay the bridge facility. If the bridge facility remains outstanding on the one-year anniversary of the completion of the merger, its maturity
date will automatically be extended to the eighth anniversary of the completion of the merger.

        The interest rate payable on amounts outstanding under the bridge facility will be equal to the greater of (i) 0.75% and (ii) LIBOR,
plus, in each case, 6.25%, plus an additional 0.50% every 90 days following the completion of the merger, until the first anniversary of the
completion of the merger. The bridge facility documentation would contain events of default, representations and warranties and covenants
reasonably consistent with, but not more restrictive than, those in the documentation for the term loan facilities and the revolving facility.

THE MERGER AGREEMENT 

        The following is a summary of the material provisions of the merger agreement. The following summary of the merger agreement does
not purport to be complete and may not contain all of the information about the merger agreement that is important to you. The summary of
the material terms of the merger agreement below and elsewhere in this joint proxy statement/prospectus is subject to, and qualified in its
entirety by reference to the full text of, the merger agreement, which is attached as Annex A to this joint proxy statement/prospectus and is
incorporated herein by reference. You should read the entire merger agreement carefully and in its entirety because it, and not the
description below or elsewhere in this joint proxy statement/prospectus, is the legal document that governs the merger.

        The merger agreement and the discussion under this heading "The Merger Agreement" have been included to provide you with
information regarding its material terms. They are not intended to provide any other financial or other information about AAM, MPG, or
their respective subsidiaries and affiliates. Information about AAM and MPG can be found elsewhere in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus and in the other filings AAM and MPG make with the SEC. See "Where You Can Find More Information" on
page 196.

The Merger 

        The merger agreement provides for the merger of Merger Sub with and into MPG, upon the terms, and subject to the satisfaction or
written waiver (where permissible under applicable law) of the conditions to the obligations of the parties to consummate the merger. The
merger will become effective as of the effective time of the merger. As the surviving corporation, MPG will survive the merger and continue
to exist as a wholly-owned subsidiary of AAM. The certificate of incorporation and bylaws of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to
the merger will be the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of MPG as the surviving corporation following the completion of the merger,
except that the certificate of incorporation will be amended and restated to reflect MPG as the name of the surviving corporation.

Closing of the Merger 

        Unless another time is agreed to by AAM and MPG or the merger agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms, the
closing of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement (which we refer to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the closing)
will occur on the third business day after satisfaction or written waiver (where permissible under applicable law) of the conditions set forth
in the merger agreement (except for any conditions that by their nature can only be satisfied on the closing date, but subject to the
satisfaction or valid written waiver of such conditions) (which date we refer to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the closing date).

Merger Consideration Received by MPG Stockholders; No Fractional Shares 

        At the effective time of the merger, as a result of the merger, each share of MPG common stock (other than MPG excluded shares)
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger will be converted into the right to receive:

• $13.50 per share in cash, without interest; and 

• 0.5 fully paid, non-assessable shares of AAM common stock.

        In lieu of the issuance of any fractional share of AAM common stock to which an MPG stockholder would otherwise be entitled, the
stockholder will be entitled to receive an amount in cash, without interest and rounded down to the nearest whole cent and subject to
applicable withholding of taxes, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (a) the fractional share of AAM common stock to which the
stockholder would otherwise be entitled (after taking into account all fractional share

interests then held by the stockholder) by (b) the average of the volume weighted averages of the trading prices of shares of AAM common
stock on the NYSE on each of the 5 consecutive trading days ending on the trading day that is 2 trading days prior to the closing date.

Treatment of MPG Stock Options and Other Equity-Based Awards 

Treatment of MPG Stock Options

        Each unvested MPG stock option outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger will be accelerated in full and
become fully vested immediately prior to the effective time of the merger and, at the effective time of the merger, all MPG stock options
will be cancelled and the holders thereof will receive an amount in cash (without interest and subject to applicable withholding of taxes)
equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the aggregate number of shares of MPG common stock that were issuable upon exercise of
the MPG stock option immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, and (y) the cash value of the merger consideration, less the per
share exercise price of the MPG stock option. For purposes of the cash payment with respect to the MPG stock options, the stock
consideration is valued based on the closing price of a share of AAM common stock as of the trading day immediately preceding the
closing date of the merger. If the exercise price payable upon exercise of an MPG stock option equals or exceeds the value of the merger
consideration, the MPG stock option will be cancelled for no consideration.

Treatment of Restricted MPG Common Stock

        At the effective time of the merger, each outstanding share of restricted MPG common stock outstanding under an equity plan of MPG
will be cancelled and terminated, and each holder thereof will receive the merger consideration for each share of restricted MPG common
stock (subject to applicable withholding of taxes).

Treatment of MPG Restricted Stock Unit Awards

        Each MPG restricted stock unit award outstanding under an equity plan of MPG will become fully vested immediately prior to the
effective time of the merger and, at the effective time of the merger, will be cancelled and terminated, and each holder thereof will receive
the merger consideration multiplied by the number of shares of MPG common stock subject to the MPG restricted stock unit award (subject
to applicable withholding of taxes).

Conversion of Shares; Exchange of Certificates 

        The conversion of shares of MPG common stock (other than MPG excluded shares) into the right to receive the merger consideration
will occur automatically at the effective time of the merger. In addition, at the effective time of the merger, each share of MPG common
stock held in the treasury of MPG or that is owned by AAM or any direct or indirect subsidiary of AAM (including Merger Sub) will
automatically be canceled, without any payment or distribution being made with respect thereto, and each outstanding share of common
stock of Merger Sub will be converted into and become one share of common stock of MPG as the surviving corporation in the merger.
Shares of MPG common stock with respect to which appraisal rights are properly exercised and not withdrawn will not be converted into
the right to receive the merger consideration but will be treated as described below under "Appraisal Rights."

        AAM will deposit with the exchange agent, (i) promptly following the effective time of the merger on the closing date, cash in an
amount sufficient to pay the cash portion of the merger consideration, (ii) at or prior to the effective time of the merger, book-entry shares of
AAM common stock sufficient to pay the stock portion of the merger consideration and (iii) cash, from time to time, in an amount

sufficient to pay any cash required to be paid in lieu of fractional shares of AAM common stock and other amounts required to be paid
under the merger agreement.

        As promptly as practicable after the effective time of the merger, AAM will cause the exchange agent to mail to each person who was,
at the effective time of the merger, a holder of record of shares of MPG common stock entitled to receive the merger consideration: (a) a
letter of transmittal, which will specify that delivery of shares of MPG common stock will be effected, and risk of loss and title to shares of
MPG common stock will pass, only upon proper delivery of the shares of MPG common stock to the exchange agent) and (b) instructions
for use in effecting the surrender of shares of MPG common stock pursuant to the letter of transmittal.

        Upon (i) surrender to the exchange agent of a certificate representing shares MPG common stock for cancellation, together with a
properly completed and executed letter of transmittal, or (ii) receipt by the exchange agent of an "agent's message" in the case of book-entry
shares of MPG common stock, and, in each case, all other documents as may be required pursuant to the instructions, a holder of shares of
MPG common stock will be entitled to receive (x) a check in the amount equal to the aggregate cash consideration that the holder has the
right to receive, including any cash in lieu of any fractional shares of AAM common stock and any dividends or other distributions with
respect to shares of AAM common stock that the holder is entitled to receive under the merger agreement, and (y) book-entry shares
representing the aggregate stock consideration that the holder has the right to receive. Any certificates or book-entry shares of MPG
common stock that are surrendered to the exchange agent will be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any merger
consideration, any cash in lieu of any fractional shares of AAM common stock or any dividends or other distributions payable to holders of
shares of MPG common stock. MPG stockholders should not return stock certificates with the enclosed proxy card.

        Until surrendered as contemplated in the preceding paragraph, each certificate or book-entry share representing shares of MPG
common stock will be deemed at all times after the effective time of the merger to represent only the right to receive, upon surrender, the
merger consideration (without interest), cash in lieu of any fractional shares of AAM common stock and any dividends or other distributions
with respect to shares of AAM common stock such holder is entitled to receive under the merger agreement. Upon payment of the merger
consideration, any cash in lieu of any fractional shares of AAM common stock and any dividends or other distributions with respect to
shares of AAM common stock, MPG stockholders will have no further rights with respect to their shares of MPG common stock.

        AAM, Merger Sub, MPG or the exchange agent is entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant
to the merger agreement to any former holder of shares of MPG common stock, MPG stock options, restricted MPG common stock or MPG
restricted stock unit awards such amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld under the Code, including the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder, or under any provision of applicable state, local or foreign law. If AAM determines that any amount is required by
law to be deducted or withheld, or that any tax forms are necessary to establish that no deduction or withholding is required, AAM will use
commercially reasonable efforts to notify the holder at least 3 business days prior to the deduction or withholding (or as soon as practicable
thereafter if AAM makes such determination within the 5-day period prior to the closing date). Any amount deducted or withheld and duly
paid over to the applicable governmental authority will be treated as having been paid to such stockholder in respect of which such
deduction or withholding was made.

Termination of Exchange Fund 

        Any portion of the amounts deposited with the exchange agent for the benefit of MPG stockholders (including proceeds of any
investment thereof) that remains undistributed to MPG

stockholders on the one-year anniversary of the effective time of the merger will be delivered to AAM, or its designee, and any MPG
stockholders who have not yet received the merger consideration as described above may thereafter look only to AAM for payment of their
claim to the merger consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of AAM common stock and any dividends or other distributions with
respect to AAM common stock to which they are entitled under the merger agreement.

Surviving Corporation Directors and Officers 

        Upon the effective time of the merger, the directors of Merger Sub will become the directors of MPG, as the surviving corporation in
the merger, and will hold office in accordance with the terms of the organizational documents of the surviving corporation.

        Prior to the effective time of the merger, AAM will determine, in consultation with MPG, the individuals who will become officers of
MPG, as the surviving corporation, upon the effective time of the merger. Such officers will hold office until their respective successors are
duly elected and qualified or until such officer's earlier death, resignation or removal.

Appraisal Rights 

        Under Section 262 of the DGCL, holders of shares of MPG common stock who do not vote in favor of the adoption of the merger
agreement and approval of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, or consent thereto in writing, and who otherwise
properly follow the procedures set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL to demand appraisal of their shares of MPG common stock and perfect
their right to appraisal thereunder will be entitled to have their shares appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive payment
in cash of the "fair value" of the shares, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger,
together with a fair rate of interest, if any, as determined by the court (subject to any reduction in interest if voluntary payments are made to
MPG stockholders who have perfected their appraisal rights prior to the Delaware Court of Chancery granting a final judgment regarding
fair value). This value could be more than, less than or the same as the value of the merger consideration. If such procedures are properly
followed and the appraisal request not withdrawn, the holder of MPG common stock will have no right to receive the merger consideration,
but rather only such "fair value" of the shares in cash. For a more complete description of the available appraisal rights, see "The Merger—
Appraisal Rights" beginning on page 114. MPG has agreed to allow AAM and Merger Sub to participate in and direct all proceedings with
respect to appraisal demands by MPG stockholders.

Conditions to the Completion of the Merger 

Conditions to Each Party's Obligations to Complete the Merger

        AAM, MPG and Merger Sub are obligated to complete the merger subject to the satisfaction, or, where permissible under applicable
law, written waiver, of the following conditions:

the date of the merger agreement and as of the effective time of the merger as though made on and as of such date or time
(or, in the case of representations and warranties that address matters only as of a particular date, as of such date) except
where the failure of such representations and warranties to be so true and correct does not have, and would not reasonably be
expected to have, an MPG material adverse effect; 

• MPG having performed or complied, in all material respects, with all obligations required to be performed or complied with
by it under the merger agreement at or prior to the effective time of the merger;

Committee, Audit Committee, Compensation Committee, and Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee, in each case,
effective as of the effective time of the merger.

        The merger agreement provides that a "material adverse effect" means, when used in connection with AAM or MPG, any event,
circumstance, change, condition, occurrence or effect that, individually or in the aggregate with any other event, circumstance, change,
condition, occurrence or effect, (a) has had, or would reasonably be expected to have, a material adverse effect on the assets, liabilities,
business, condition (financial or otherwise) or results of operations of the relevant party and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (b) has, or
would reasonably be expected to have, a material adverse effect on, or prevents or materially delays, the ability of the relevant party to
consummate the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

        With respect to clause (a) in the preceding paragraph, however, none of the following, alone or in combination, will be deemed to
constitute, or will be taken into account in determining whether there has been, a material adverse effect on the relevant party:

• any event, circumstance, change, condition, occurrence or effect resulting from or relating to: 

• a change in general economic, political, regulatory, business, economic, financial, credit or capital market conditions,
or any changes therein, including interest or exchange rates; 

• any change in accounting requirements or principles required by GAAP (or any authoritative interpretations thereof)
or required by any change in applicable laws (or any authoritative interpretations thereof) following the date of the
merger agreement; 

• any adoption, implementation, promulgation, repeal or modification of any law following the date of the merger
agreement;

disasters; 

• changes proximately caused by the announcement of the execution of the merger agreement, unless related to the
relevant party's representations and warranties with respect to the absence of conflicts or violation of laws (or the
ability of the relevant party to make such representations and warranties at closing); or 

• compliance with the express terms of, or the taking of any action expressly required by, the merger agreement
(excluding the relevant party operating in the ordinary course of business) or the taking of any action consented to or
requested in writing by the other party prior to the taking of such action.

except that the exceptions in the first four sub-bullet points above shall only apply to the extent that the event, circumstance,
change or effect does not have, or would not reasonably be expected to have, a disproportionate impact on the relevant party
and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, compared to other companies that operate in the industries in which the relevant party
and its subsidiaries operate; or

• any failure to meet internal or published projections, forecasts, performance measures, operating statistics or revenue or
earnings predictions for any period or any change in the price or trading volume of the relevant party's common stock or the
credit rating of the relevant party (except that the underlying causes of such failure or change may be considered in
determining whether there is a material adverse effect).

No Solicitation 

        AAM and MPG have agreed to, and have agreed to cause their respective subsidiaries, and to instruct (and use their respective
reasonable best efforts to cause) their respective representatives, to:

• immediately cease, following the time of execution of the merger agreement, any ongoing solicitations, discussions,
communications or negotiations with any person with respect to an acquisition proposal (as defined below), or any inquiry,
proposal or offer that would reasonably be expected to lead to an acquisition proposal; and 

• request within 2 business days of the date of the merger agreement (and use reasonable best efforts to cause) the prompt
return or destruction of all confidential information previously furnished to any person in connection with any such
solicitations, discussions, communications or negotiations with respect to an acquisition proposal and immediately terminate
all physical and electronic dataroom access previously granted to any such person, its affiliates or representatives.

        Additionally, AAM and MPG (a) will not, and will cause their respective subsidiaries not to, terminate, waive, amend or modify any
provision of any existing standstill or confidentiality agreement to which any of them are a party, and (b) will, and will cause their
respective subsidiaries to, enforce the provisions of any such agreement, except, in each case, the relevant party may grant a waiver of, and
shall not be obligated to enforce, any such provision (i) to the extent required to permit a party thereto to submit an acquisition proposal,
and (ii) if the board of directors of the relevant party (or any committee thereof) has determined in good faith, after consultation with
outside legal counsel, that the failure to grant such waiver would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law.

        Prior to the closing, neither AAM nor MPG will, and they have agreed to cause their respective subsidiaries and their and their
subsidiaries' respective directors, officers and employees not to, and to use reasonable best efforts to cause their representatives not to,
except as described below:

• solicit, initiate, facilitate or encourage any inquiries or the implementation or submission of any acquisition proposal, or any
proposals or offers that would be reasonably expected to lead to an acquisition proposal; 

• engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions, communications or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any
person any non-public information in connection with, or for the purpose of facilitating or encouraging, any inquiries,
proposals or offers that constitute, or would be reasonably expected to lead to, an acquisition proposal, except to notify such
person of the existence of the non-solicitation provisions in the merger agreement; or 

• execute or enter into any written letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle or any merger
agreement, acquisition agreement or similar contract relating to or intended to result in or that would reasonably be expected
to lead to an acquisition proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement entered into in accordance with the terms of the
merger agreement).

        Each of AAM and MPG may, however, grant a waiver, amendment or release under any confidentiality or standstill agreement, solely
to the extent necessary to allow a confidential acquisition proposal to be made to it or its board of directors (or any committee thereof) so
long as (x) its board of directors has determined in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that the failure to grant the
waiver would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law, and (y) it promptly (and, in any event, within 24 hours) notifies
the other party of the waiver, amendment or release.

        Additionally, prior to the receipt of their respective stockholder approvals, nothing in the non-solicitation provisions of the merger
agreement will prevent AAM, MPG or their respective boards of directors (or any committee thereof) from furnishing information to, or
engaging in discussions, communications or negotiations with, any person that made a bona fide acquisition proposal that did not result
from a breach (or deemed breach) of the non-solicitation provisions of the merger agreement, if prior to taking action:

• the board of directors of the relevant party (i) determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside advisors) that the
acquisition proposal is, or would reasonably be expected to result in, a superior proposal (as defined below), and
(ii) determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that its failure to take such actions would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law; 

• the relevant party provides written notice to the other party of the determination referenced in the bullet above promptly
(and, in any event, within 24 hours of such determination); and 

• the relevant party receives from the person that made such bona fide acquisition proposal an executed a confidentiality
agreement entered into in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement.

        The relevant party has also agreed to deliver to the other party a copy of any such executed confidentiality agreement promptly (and, in
any event, within 24 hours) following its execution, as well as any non-public information concerning the relevant party or any of its
subsidiaries provided to any person entering into the confidentiality agreement that has not been previously provided to the other party prior
to or substantially concurrently with the time it is provided to such person.

        AAM and MPG have also agreed to promptly (and, in any event, within 24 hours) notify the other party of the receipt of any
acquisition proposal or any inquiries, proposals or offers received by it or any of its subsidiaries or representatives concerning an acquisition
proposal, as well as the identity of the person making the acquisition proposal and an unredacted copy of the acquisition proposal or written
inquiry, offer, proposal or request. For any oral inquiry, offer, proposal or request concerning an acquisition proposal, notice is required only
if the relevant party reasonably believes that such oral acquisition proposal, inquiry, offer, proposal or request is likely to result in a written
acquisition proposal, inquiry, offer, proposal or request. In such event, the notice will include a reasonably detailed description of the oral
acquisition proposal, inquiry, offer, proposal or request. The relevant party will also promptly (and, in any event, within 24 hours) provide
the other party and its outside counsel with copies of all drafts and final versions of definitive agreements, including schedules and exhibits
thereto (which may be redacted as necessary to protect confidential information of the person making the acquisition proposal), relating to
the acquisition proposal that are exchanged by the relevant party (or its representatives) and the person making the acquisition proposal (or
its representatives), and will keep the other party reasonably informed (and, in any event, within 24 hours of any material development) of
the status and details (including with respect to any change in price or other material amendments) of any acquisition proposal or any
inquiry, offer, proposal or request concerning an acquisition proposal. AAM and MPG will promptly (and, in any event, within 48 hours)
notify the other party of any determination by its respective board of directors (or any committee thereof) that an acquisition proposal is a
superior proposal.

        For purposes of the merger agreement, the term "acquisition proposal" means, with respect to each of AAM and MPG, any proposal or
offer from any person, entity or group (other than the other party) relating to, in a single transaction or series of related transactions, any:

• direct or indirect acquisition of more than 20% of the consolidated assets (whether based on the fair market value, revenue
generation or net income) of such party and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, including through the acquisition of one or
more subsidiaries of such party; 

• direct or indirect acquisition of more than 20% of any class of equity securities, or securities convertible into or
exchangeable for equity securities, of such party or any of its subsidiaries; 

• tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result, directly or indirectly, in any person, entity or group (or the
stockholders thereof) owning 20% or more of any class of equity securities, or securities convertible into or exchangeable
for equity securities, of such party or any of its subsidiaries; or 

• merger, consolidation, business combination, share exchange, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or other similar
transaction involving such party or any of its subsidiaries that would result in any person, entity or group (or the
stockholders thereof) owning, directly or indirectly, more than 20% of any class of equity securities, or securities convertible
into or exchangeable for equity securities, of such party or any of its subsidiaries or 20% of the voting power of the
surviving entity in a merger involving such party or any of its subsidiaries or the resulting direct or indirect parent of such
party, any of its subsidiaries or such surviving entity (or any securities convertible into, or exchangeable for, securities
representing such voting power).

        For purposes of the merger agreement, the term "superior proposal" means, with respect to each of AAM and MPG, a bona fide written
acquisition proposal (as defined above, except references to "20%" will be replaced with "50%") made by any person, entity or group (other
than the other party or its subsidiaries) after the date of the merger agreement that (x) did not result from a breach (or deemed breach) of the
non-solicitation provisions of the merger agreement, (y) is on terms that the relevant party's board of directors determines in good faith
(after receiving the advice of its financial advisor(s) and outside legal counsel and taking into account all the terms and conditions thereof)
are more favorable to its stockholders from a financial point of view than the merger and the transactions

contemplated thereby and (z) the relevant party's board of directors determines (after receiving the advice of its financial advisor(s) and
outside legal counsel) is reasonably capable of being consummated in accordance with its terms, taking into account all financial,
regulatory, legal, timing and other aspects of such proposal, including certainty of closing, certainty of financing and the identity of the
person, entity or group making the acquisition proposal.

Board Recommendation Change

        Each of AAM and MPG has also agreed that it and its board of directors will not, and will not publicly propose to, (i) withhold,
withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to the other party, its recommendation to its stockholders to approve the AAM share issuance, in
the case of AAM, or to adopt the merger agreement and approve the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, in the case of
MPG, (ii) approve or recommend any acquisition proposal, (iii) enter into any agreement relating to or providing for an acquisition proposal
(other than a confidentiality agreement entered into in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement); or (iv) refrain from
recommending against (and reaffirming its recommendation to its stockholders) any acquisition proposal that is a tender offer or exchange
offer within 10 business days after the commencement thereof, except that, at any time prior to the receipt of the applicable stockholder
approval, the applicable board of directors may take any of the actions in the preceding clauses (i), (ii) or (iv) (each of which actions we
refer to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as a change in recommendation):

• if the relevant party receives an unsolicited, written acquisition proposal that such party's board of directors determines in
good faith (after consultation with its outside advisors) is a superior proposal and that its failure to take such actions would
be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law; or 

• if an intervening event (as defined below) occurs and as a result thereof the applicable board of directors determines in good
faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that the failure to make a change in recommendation would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law.

        For purposes of the merger agreement, the term "intervening event" means, with respect to each of AAM and MPG, any material
event, circumstance, change, effect, development or condition relating to such party and its subsidiaries (other than an acquisition proposal
or any inquiry, offer or proposal that would reasonably be expected to lead to an acquisition proposal) first occurring or arising after the date
of the merger agreement that was not known or reasonably foreseeable by the relevant board of directors as of the date of the merger
agreement (or, if known, the magnitude or material consequences of which were not known or reasonably foreseeable by the board of
directors as of the date of the merger agreement). No event, circumstance, change, effect, development or condition, however, that has had
or would reasonably be expected to have an adverse effect on the assets, liabilities, business, condition (financial or otherwise) or results of
operations of the other party and its subsidiaries (including, with respect to MPG, following the closing, the surviving corporation and its
subsidiaries), or the market price of the securities of the other party or any of its subsidiaries (including, with respect to MPG, following the
closing, the surviving corporation and its subsidiaries), will constitute an "intervening event."

        In addition to the ability of the applicable board of directors to make a change in recommendation as described above, the board of
directors of each of AAM and MPG may, at any time prior to the receipt of its stockholder approval, terminate the merger agreement in
order to concurrently enter into an acquisition agreement with respect to a superior proposal if the relevant party receives an unsolicited,
written acquisition proposal that such party's board of directors determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside advisors) is a
superior proposal and that its failure to take such actions would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law. Neither AAM
nor MPG,

however, may terminate the merger agreement for this reason if it has committed (or has been deemed to have committed) an intentional
breach of the non-solicitation provisions of the merger agreement that would have an adverse impact on the ability of the other party to
propose or negotiate any amendments or modifications to the merger agreement, as described below. Furthermore, if AAM or MPG
terminates the merger agreement for this reason, such party would have to pay to the other party, and such termination would be contingent
upon payment of, a termination fee (as described below in connection with the AAM superior proposal termination right and the MPG
superior proposal termination right under "—Termination of the Merger Agreement" beginning on page 134).

        Any change in the recommendation of the board of directors with respect to a superior proposal or termination of the merger agreement
under the circumstances described in the immediately preceding paragraph may only occur after:

• the relevant party has notified the other party in writing that it intends to make a change in recommendation or terminate the
merger agreement; 

• the relevant party has provided the other party with a summary of the material terms and conditions of the superior proposal;

• if requested to do so by the other party, the relevant party has discussed and negotiated in good faith with the other party for
a period of 4 days any bona fide proposed modifications to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement; and 

• no earlier than the end of such 4 day period, the relevant party's board of directors (after consultation with its outside legal
counsel and financial advisor(s)) has determined in good faith, after considering the terms of any proposed amendment or
modification to the merger agreement proposed by the other party during the 4 day period, that the superior proposal still
constitutes a superior proposal and that the failure to make a change in recommendation or terminate the merger agreement
in connection therewith would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law.

Any change to the financial or other material terms of a proposal that was previously the subject of a notice as described above will require
a new notice to the other party as provided above, except that the length of the second negotiation period will be 2 days instead of 4 days.

        Any change in the recommendation of the board of directors with respect to an intervening event may only occur after:

• the relevant party has notified the other party in writing that it intends to make a change in recommendation due to an
intervening event, describing in reasonable detail the reasons for such change in recommendation; 

• if requested to do so by the other party, the relevant party has discussed and negotiated in good faith with the other party for
a period of 4 days any bona fide proposed modifications to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement; and 

• no earlier than the end of such 4 day period, the relevant party's board of directors has determined in good faith, after
considering the terms of any proposed amendment or modification to the merger agreement proposed by the other party
during the 4 day period, that the failure to make a change in recommendation would still be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under applicable law.

        Nothing in the merger agreement, however, will prohibit AAM or MPG from issuing a "stop, look and listen" communication pursuant
to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act or complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act with respect to an
acquisition proposal, or from making any disclosure to its stockholders if its board of directors determines (after consultation with its

outside legal counsel) that its failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law. This exception does not
apply, however, with respect to any change in recommendation by the board of directors, which may only be made as described above.
Furthermore, a factually accurate public statement that describes a party's receipt of an acquisition proposal and the operation of the merger
agreement with respect thereto (without including a reaffirmation) will not be deemed a change in recommendation.

        For purposes of the merger agreement, if any representative of AAM or MPG takes any action which, if taken by AAM or MPG,
would constitute a breach of the non-solicitation provisions of the merger agreement, then such action will be deemed to be a breach of the
non-solicitation provisions of the merger agreement by AAM or MPG, as applicable.

Termination of the Merger Agreement 

Termination

        The merger agreement may be terminated and the merger and other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement may be
abandoned at any time prior to the effective time of the merger:

• by the mutual written consent of AAM and MPG (if authorized by their respective boards of directors); 

• by either of AAM or MPG if: 

• the effective time of the merger has not occurred on or before August 3, 2017 (which we refer to in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus as the outside date), except that: 

• if on the outside date all of the conditions to the completion of the merger have been satisfied (or, for
conditions that by their terms must be satisfied at the closing, would have been satisfied if the closing would
have occurred) other than the condition regarding the absence of any restraint (to the extent the restraint
arises under the HSR Act or other applicable foreign, federal or state antitrust, competition or fair trade laws
in certain jurisdictions agreed by the parties) or the condition regarding the receipt of certain governmental
approvals in the United States and certain other jurisdictions agreed by the parties (as described above under
"—Conditions to the Completion of the Merger—Conditions to Each Party's Obligations to Complete the
Merger" beginning on page 126), then the outside date shall be automatically extended for an additional
90 days; and 

• this termination right will not be available to any party whose failure to fulfill any obligation under the
merger agreement is the principal cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the effective time of the merger to
occur on or before the outside date (other than, in the case of AAM, a failure to consummate the closing
solely as a result of a financing failure, as defined below under "—Governing Law; Specific Performance;
Third-Party Beneficiaries" beginning on page 153, provided that AAM pays the termination fee in
connection with a termination of the merger agreement by MPG or AAM, as described below under
"Payment of Termination Fees" beginning on page 138); 

• any restraint has become final and nonappealable, except that the party seeking to terminate the merger agreement
must not have failed to comply with its obligations under the provisions of the merger agreement relating to efforts to
obtain regulatory approvals (as described below under "—Additional Terms—Reasonable Best Efforts" beginning on
page 147), which failure was the principal cause of, or resulted in, the restraint becoming final and nonappealable;

Effect of Termination

        If the merger agreement is terminated as described above, the merger agreement will become void and none of AAM, MPG, Merger
Sub or certain of their respective related parties (including, in part, former, current or future officers, directors, general or limited partners,
members, managers, stockholders, other equityholders, controlling persons, employees, agents, successors, assigns, affiliates, or
representatives) will have any liability under the merger agreement, except that:

• the provisions relating to the effect of termination of the merger agreement, the confidentiality obligations, the provisions
relating to the payment of termination fees and reimbursement of certain expenses, as well as certain specified general
provisions, will each remain in full force and effect; and 

• nothing will relieve AAM, MPG or Merger Sub from liability or damages for fraud committed prior to such termination or,
subject to the provisions described below, for any intentional breach (as defined below) prior to such termination of any of
its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements in the merger agreement, in which case the aggrieved party shall be
entitled to all rights and remedies available at law or in equity.

        For purposes of the merger agreement, "intentional breach" means (i) with respect to any breach of a representation or warranty
contained in the merger agreement, a material breach of such representation or warranty that has been made with the knowledge of the
breaching party, and (ii) with respect to any breaches or failures to perform any of the covenants or other agreements contained in the
merger agreement, a material breach, or failure to perform, that is a consequence of an act or omission undertaken by the breaching party
with the knowledge that the taking of, or failure to take, such act would, or would be reasonably expected to, cause a material breach of the
merger agreement.

certain other jurisdictions agreed by the parties (as described above under "—Conditions to the Completion of the
Merger—Conditions to Each Party's Obligations to Complete the Merger"); or

        Except in the case of fraud or intentional breach, but subject to the succeeding paragraph, the sole and exclusive remedies of a party or
any of its related parties against the other party or any of its related parties (including, in the case of AAM, the AAM financing sources), or
any of their respective related parties for any losses, damages, liabilities, costs, expenses, claims, obligations or actions based upon, arising
out of or relating to the merger agreement (or, in the case of AAM, the commitment letter), including the negotiation, execution and
performance thereof, or the transactions contemplated thereby, will be (i) payment of the applicable termination fee and reimbursement of
expenses (to the extent reimbursable) by the other party (each as described above), and (ii) subject to all of the other provisions described in
this section, the right of such party to seek specific performance of the merger agreement (as described below under "—Governing Law;
Specific Performance; Third-Party Beneficiaries—Specific Performance" beginning on page 154).

        In addition, except in the case of fraud or intentional breach by AAM of its obligations in respect of the financing (as described below
under "—Financing" beginning on page 150), upon payment of a termination fee equal to $101,794,000 to MPG as a result of a termination
of the merger agreement by MPG pursuant to the failure to close termination right, neither MPG nor any of MPG's related parties will have
any rights or claims against AAM, Merger Sub, the AAM financing sources, or any of their respective related parties under or in connection
with the merger agreement, the commitment letter, or any of the transactions contemplated thereby, including for any damages of any kind
or nature or for any other monetary amounts.

Payment of Certain Expenses

        MPG must reimburse AAM and Merger Sub for an aggregate amount of up to $15 million of their documented and reasonable out-of-
pocket fees and expenses incurred in connection with the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement if
(a) either AAM or MPG terminates the merger agreement as a result of the failure of MPG stockholders to adopt the merger agreement and
approve the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement at the MPG special meeting, or (b) AAM terminates the merger agreement
pursuant to the AAM breach termination right.

        AAM must reimburse MPG for an aggregate amount of up to $15 million of its documented and reasonable out-of-pocket fees and
expenses incurred in connection with the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement if (a) either AAM
or MPG terminates the merger agreement as a result of the failure of AAM stockholders to approve the AAM share issuance at the AAM
special meeting, or (b) MPG terminates the merger agreement pursuant to the MPG breach termination right.

        Payment of the expense reimbursements by either party does not affect the other party's right to receive any applicable termination
fees, but does reduce on a dollar-for-dollar basis any termination fee that becomes due and payable to such other party under the terms of
the merger agreement.

Conduct of Business Pending the Merger 

        AAM and MPG have agreed in the merger agreement that, until the effective time of the merger, except for certain agreed upon
exceptions, or as consented to in writing by the other party (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), each
party and each of its subsidiaries will:

• conduct their respective businesses in the ordinary course of business and in a manner consistent with past practice; and

AAM, Merger Sub and MPG relating to, among other things:

• corporate power and authority to execute and deliver the merger agreement, to perform its obligations under the merger
agreement and to consummate the merger and the other transactions contemplated in the merger agreement;

• absence of certain litigation; 

• employee benefit matters, including with respect to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended; 

• employee and labor relations; 

• condition of, and title to, owned and leased real property; 

• intellectual property matters; 

• tax matters; 

• environmental matters; 

• specified material contracts; 

• insurance matters; 

• material customers and relationships therewith; 

• matters relating to the quality and safety of products; 

• compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 and other anticorruption and economic sanctions laws; 

• receipt of a fairness opinion from BofA Merrill Lynch, in the case of MPG, and Greenhill, in the case of AAM; and 

• broker's fees.

        In addition, MPG also makes representations and warranties relating to the inapplicability of certain takeover laws and the absence of
anti-takeover provisions in its organizational documents. AAM also makes representations and warranties relating to the operations of
Merger Sub and the financing, including the due execution and delivery, validity and enforceability of the commitment letter among AAM,
American Axle & Manufacturing, Inc. and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., described in "—Financing" beginning on page 150. The receipt of
financing by AAM, however, is not a condition to the completion of the merger. AAM also made representations and warranties that, as of
the date of the merger agreement, neither AAM nor any of its subsidiaries or representatives were engaged in any discussions,
communications or negotiations with respect to an acquisition proposal nor had AAM received any indication from any person that it was
considering making an acquisition proposal or entered into discussions or negotiations to enter into a confidentiality or similar agreement in
connection with an acquisition proposal.

        The representations and warranties in the merger agreement were made as of specific dates and expire as of the effective time of the
merger. The assertions embodied in those representations and warranties were made solely for purposes of the contract among AAM, MPG
and Merger Sub and may be subject to important qualifications and limitations agreed by the parties in connection with negotiating the
terms of the merger agreement. Additionally, subject to certain exceptions, the representations and warranties contained in the merger
agreement are qualified by the information disclosed by AAM or MPG, as applicable, in their public filings with the SEC prior to the date
of the merger agreement and since January 1, 2014, excluding (i) any documents filed as exhibits, annexes and schedules to such filings or
incorporated by reference in such filing (other than in any other public filings with the SEC by such party), (ii) any risk factor disclosures
contained under the heading "Risk Factors" (other than any factual information contained therein), and (iii) any disclosure of risks included
in any "forward-looking statements" disclaimer or any other statements that are similarly non-specific or precise or forward-looking in
nature. Moreover, certain representations and warranties may not be accurate or complete as of any specified date because they are subject
to a contractual

standard of materiality that is different than what may be material to stockholders and in some cases may be qualified by disclosures made
by one party to the other in the confidential disclosure schedule delivered by each party to the other, which are not necessarily reflected in
the merger agreement or which were used for the purpose of allocating risk between AAM and MPG rather than establishing matters as
facts. Certain of the representations and warranties in the merger agreement are subject to materiality and "material adverse effect"
qualifications. This means that those representations and warranties would not be deemed untrue, inaccurate or incorrect as a consequence
of matters that are not material or as a result of matters that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
"material adverse effect" on the party making the representations and warranties. In addition, certain of the representations and warranties in
the merger agreement are subject to knowledge qualifications, which means that those representations and warranties would not be deemed
untrue, inaccurate or incorrect as a result of matters of which certain identified employees of the party making the representation did not
have actual knowledge, after reasonable inquiry. Finally, information concerning the subject matter of the representations and warranties in
the merger agreement may have changed since the date of the merger agreement (or since the specific date as of which the applicable
representations and warranties were made), which may or may not be fully reflected in AAM's and MPG's public disclosures.

        AAM and MPG will provide additional disclosure in their public reports to the extent that they are aware of the existence of any
material facts that are required to be disclosed under federal securities laws and will update such disclosure as required by federal securities
laws.

Additional Terms 

Reasonable Best Efforts

        AAM, Merger Sub and MPG have agreed to use reasonable best efforts to consummate and make effective the merger and the other
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including:

• using reasonable best efforts to obtain all permits, consents, approvals, authorizations, qualifications and orders of all
governmental authorities and officials that may be or become necessary for the performance of the obligations of such party
pursuant to the merger agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement; 

• cooperating fully with the other parties in promptly seeking to obtain all such permits, consents, approvals, authorizations,
qualifications and orders; 

• providing information to any governmental authority as the governmental authority may lawfully request; and 

• using reasonable best efforts to obtain other consents, approvals or waivers from third parties that are (a) necessary to
consummate the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, or (b) as otherwise reasonably determined by AAM
and MPG after the date of the merger agreement, except that neither MPG nor any of its subsidiaries will pay any
consideration or make any agreements or commitments in connection with any such necessary consents, approvals or
waivers without the prior written consent of AAM.

        Other than the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act and the receipt of any consents, approvals,
non-disapprovals, orders and/or authorizations required by governmental authorities in certain jurisdictions agreed to by AAM and MPG,
the completion of the merger is not conditioned on the receipt of any consents, approvals, non-disapprovals, orders or authorizations from
any person.

        The merger agreement provides that in no event will AAM or Merger Sub be obligated to take any action in connection with obtaining
any required regulatory approval that would require the

divestiture of any assets or businesses of AAM or MPG or any of their subsidiaries, would limit AAM's freedom of action with respect to,
or its ability to retain, MPG and its subsidiaries or any portion thereof or any of AAM's or its affiliates' other assets or businesses, or would
in AAM's reasonable judgment be expected to have a material adverse impact on any of AAM's businesses or the MPG businesses to be
acquired under the merger agreement, except that, if necessary to obtain the regulatory clearances or approvals discussed above under "The
Merger—Regulatory Matters—Consents and Approvals" beginning on page 114, AAM will agree to the divestiture of the assets or
businesses or products or product lines of MPG and its subsidiaries that, individually or in the aggregate, generated total worldwide
revenues of up to $150,000,000 in the twelve month period ended September 30, 2016.

        Subject to the preceding paragraph, AAM, Merger Sub and MPG further agreed to cooperate and use reasonable best efforts to contest
and resist any action, including any administrative or judicial action, and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any order (whether
temporary, preliminary or permanent) that is in effect and that restricts, prevents or prohibits consummation of the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement, including by pursuing all available avenues of administrative and judicial appeal. AAM will be
entitled to direct, in consultation with MPG, the defense in any antitrust investigation or litigation by, or negotiations with, any
governmental authority or other person relating to the merger or regulatory filings under applicable law.

        Furthermore, AAM, after prior consultation with MPG, will have the principal responsibility for devising and implementing the
strategy for obtaining any necessary antitrust, competition or investment review clearances, and will take the lead in all meetings and
communications with any governmental authority in connection with obtaining any necessary antitrust, competition or investment review
clearances.

        AAM will use its reasonable best efforts to cause the shares of AAM common stock to be issued in the merger to be approved for
listing on the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance.

Stockholder Meetings

        The merger agreement provides that AAM and MPG will use their reasonable best efforts to hold the AAM stockholder meeting and
the MPG stockholder meeting on the same date. Each of AAM and MPG will convene its stockholder meeting as promptly as practicable
following the effectiveness of the registration statement on Form S-4, of which this joint proxy statement/prospectus forms a part. However,
either MPG or AAM may postpone or adjourn its stockholder meeting for no more than 15 days from the date for which such meeting was
originally scheduled (x) to solicit additional proxies for the purpose of obtaining stockholder approval, (y) for the absence of a quorum, and
(z) to allow reasonable additional time for the filing or mailing of any supplemental or amended disclosure that it has determined after
consultation with outside legal counsel is reasonably likely to be required under applicable law and for such supplemental or amended
disclosure to be disseminated and reviewed by its stockholders prior to the stockholder meeting. Each of AAM and MPG will be required to
convene and hold its stockholders' meeting unless the merger agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms, including in the
event such party's board of directors has made a change in recommendation.

Employee Benefits and Related Matters

        Following the effective time of the merger, AAM will cause the surviving corporation and its subsidiaries to honor all obligations
under all contracts, agreements and plans of MPG and its subsidiaries as in effect immediately prior to the effective time of the merger that
are applicable to any current or former employees or directors of MPG or any MPG subsidiary in accordance with their terms. For one year
following the effective time of the merger, AAM will cause the surviving corporation and its subsidiaries to provide each officer, employee,
director and independent contractor

of MPG or any of its subsidiaries that continues to provide services to AAM, the surviving corporation or their respective subsidiaries
immediately following the effective time of the merger with base salary or wages, incentive compensation opportunities and severance
benefits at least equal to the base salary or wages, incentive compensation opportunities and severance benefits provided to such person
immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, and with employee benefits that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to the
employee benefits provided to such person immediately prior to the effective time of the merger.

        Employees of MPG and its subsidiaries will receive credit for purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting (but not for benefit
accruals) under any employee benefit plan, program or arrangement established or maintained by the surviving corporation or any of its
subsidiaries for service accrued prior to the effective time of the merger with MPG or any of its subsidiaries (without duplicating any benefit
or the funding of any such benefit). In addition, AAM will waive any limitations on benefits relating to any pre-existing conditions to the
extent such conditions are covered immediately prior to the effective time of the merger under the applicable MPG plans and to the same
extent such limitations are waived under any comparable plan of AAM or its subsidiaries, and will use reasonable best efforts to recognize,
for purposes of annual deductible and out-of-pocket limits under its medical and dental plans, deductible and out-of-pocket expenses paid
by employees of MPG and its subsidiaries in the calendar year in which the effective time of the merger occurs.

Indemnification and Insurance

        AAM has agreed that all rights to indemnification, advancement or reimbursement of expenses and exculpation from liabilities for acts
or omissions occurring at or prior to the effective time of the merger that were existing as of the date of the merger agreement in favor of the
current or former directors, officers or employees of MPG and its subsidiaries under their respective organizational documents and any
indemnification or other similar agreements of MPG or any of its subsidiaries, in each case as in effect on the date of the merger agreement
and as provided to AAM on or prior to the date of the merger agreement, will continue in full force and effect in accordance with their
terms.

        The organizational documents of MPG, as the surviving corporation, and its subsidiaries will contain provisions no less favorable with
respect to indemnification, advancement and reimbursement of expenses and exculpation from liabilities with respect to facts or
circumstances occurring at or prior to the effective time of the merger than are set forth in the organizational documents of MPG and its
subsidiaries provided to AAM and as in effect on the date of the merger agreement. These provisions will not be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified for a period of 6 years from the effective time of the merger in any manner that would affect adversely the rights
thereunder of individuals who, at or prior to the effective time of the merger, were directors, officers, employees, fiduciaries or agents of
MPG, unless such modification is required by law. From and after the effective time of the merger, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law, the surviving corporation will indemnify and hold harmless each individual who is, as of the date of the merger agreement,
or who becomes prior to the effective time of the merger, a director or officer of MPG or who is as of the date of the merger agreement, or
who thereafter commences prior to the effective time of the merger, serving at the request of MPG as a director or officer of another entity,
against all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, judgments, inquiries, fines, amounts paid in settlement and fees, costs and expenses,
including attorneys' fees and disbursements incurred in connection with any actual or threatened action, whether civil, criminal,
administrative, regulatory or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to the fact that such individual is or was an officer or director of MPG
or is or was serving at the request of MPG as a director or officer of another entity, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
effective time of the merger.

        Additionally, MPG will, in consultation with AAM, purchase a "tail" policy, which (i) has an effective term of 6 years from the
effective time of the merger (and provides coverage until such later

MPG's directors' and officers' insurance and/or fiduciary liability insurance policy in effect on the date of the merger agreement or at the
effective time of the merger for actions and omissions occurring prior to the effective time of the merger, and (iii) provides coverage in an
amount not less than MPG's existing coverage and contains other terms and conditions that are no less favorable to the persons covered by
such policies maintained by MPG than those of MPG's directors' and officers' insurance and/or fiduciary liability insurance policy in effect
on the date of the merger agreement with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the effective time of the
merger. The amount paid by MPG, however, in respect of any one policy year may not be in excess of 300% of the annual premiums
currently paid by MPG for such insurance. The surviving corporation will maintain such policies in full force and effect, for their full
respective terms, and continue to honor its respective obligations thereunder.

        The indemnification and insurance rights provided to the indemnified persons under the merger agreement are in addition to any other
rights to indemnification or contribution that such indemnified person may have by contract or otherwise.

Financing

        AAM must use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the financing prior to the closing date on the terms and conditions described in the
commitment letter. AAM may not amend, modify, waive the terms of, or replace, the commitment letter or reduce the aggregate amount of
the financing available under the commitment letter (other than through the issuance of securities in lieu of the bridge facility contemplated
by the commitment letter) without the prior written consent of MPG, unless such amendment, modification, waiver or replacement or
reduction would not:

• reduce the aggregate amount of the financing below the amount required to consummate the transactions contemplated by
the merger agreement (including by changing the amount of fees to be paid or original issue discount of the financing),
except to the extent: 

• replacement commitments for indebtedness to be incurred by AAM after the date of the merger agreement are then
made available in order to consummate the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement; or 

• the representations in the merger agreement regarding the financing would be true after giving effect to such
reduction;

so long as the terms and conditions of the replacement commitments (including with respect to conditionality) are no less
favorable, in the aggregate, to AAM than those contained in the commitment letter; or

• impose new, additional or more expansive conditions precedent, or otherwise amend, modify or expand any conditions
precedent, to the receipt of the financing, in each case, in a manner that would reasonably be expected to: 

• materially delay or prevent the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement; or 

• adversely impact in any material respect the ability of AAM to consummate the transactions contemplated by the
merger agreement or enforce its rights under the commitment letter.

        AAM may amend the commitment letter, however, without the prior written consent of MPG to add additional financing sources,
lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities.

        AAM will use reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in effect the commitment letter until the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement, other than any reduction in the amount of the financing available under the commitment letter
through the issuance of securities in lieu of the bridge facility contemplated by the commitment letter; (ii) satisfy all conditions within the
control of AAM to obtaining the financing, and (iii) negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with respect to the financing on the terms
and conditions contained in the commitment letter (including any "market flex" provisions related thereto).

        AAM must keep MPG reasonably informed with respect to all material activity concerning the status of the financing and promptly
notify MPG of any material change with respect to the financing, including any material breach of the commitment letter to the extent it
would reasonably be expected to impair or materially delay the closing or result in insufficient financing to consummate the merger and any
termination of the commitment letter (or the definitive financing agreements).

        If all conditions in the commitment letter have been satisfied or, upon funding will be satisfied, and AAM is otherwise required to
consummate the merger, AAM will use reasonable best efforts to (a) consummate the financing and (b) enforce its rights under the
commitment letter (or the definitive financing agreements). However, AAM will have no obligation to threaten or initiate any action against
any of the financing sources or any other party to the commitment letter or to the definitive financing agreements.

        If any portion of the financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated in the commitment letter, AAM will use
reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain alternative debt financing from alternative sources in an amount sufficient to consummate the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, except that the terms and conditions of such alternative financing (including with
respect to conditionality, structure, covenants and pricing) will be no less favorable, in the aggregate, to AAM than those contained in the
commitment letter.

        Prior to the closing, MPG will, and will use reasonable best efforts to cause its subsidiaries and its and their respective representatives
to, provide AAM with all cooperation reasonably requested in connection with the arrangement, marketing and consummation of the
financing or alternative financing (if applicable) that does not unreasonably interfere with ongoing operations of MPG, including using
reasonable best efforts to:

• deliver to AAM financial and other pertinent information regarding MPG and its subsidiaries as may be reasonably
requested by AAM and that is customarily required for the financing, including (a) certain financial statements, business and
other financial data, and (b) information as to enable AAM to prepare pro forma financial statements; 

• to the extent customarily required, make appropriate officers available to participate upon reasonable notice in a reasonable
number of meetings, presentations, road shows, due diligence sessions and sessions with rating agencies at times and
locations to be mutually agreed; 

• provide reasonable assistance to AAM in the preparation of customary offering documents, including confidential
information memoranda, prospectuses, private placement memoranda, offering memoranda and bank confidential
information memoranda and road show materials, rating agency materials and other similar documents necessary in
connection with the financing and provide reasonable and customary authorization letters related thereto; 

• if requested in writing by a financing source, furnish all information regarding MPG and its subsidiaries that is required in
connection with the financing by regulatory authorities under applicable "know your customer" and anti-money laundering
rules and regulations, including the Patriot Act, to the extent reasonably requested at least 10 business days prior to the
closing date;

• assist AAM in obtaining (a) customary releases and consents, including consents with respect to inclusion of MPG's
financial statements and any audit opinions in respect thereof required to be included in any prospectus or offering
memorandum or similar documents for any portion of the financing, and (b) customary comfort letters of MPG's current and
former independent accountants, including "negative assurance" comfort;

requested by AAM as necessary in connection with the financing, except that (a) any such certificates will not be executed
except in connection with the pricing or closing of any financing, and (b) no personal liability will be imposed on the
officers or employees involved with such certificates.

        Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither MPG nor any of its subsidiaries or any of their respective representatives will be required to:

• take any action that would reasonably be expected to conflict with or violate the organizational documents of MPG or any
MPG subsidiary or any law or result in the breach of any contract if the consequences of the breach of such law or contract
would be material to the business or operations of MPG and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole; 

• pay any commitment or similar fee or reimburse any expenses incurred by AAM in connection with the financing; 

• execute and deliver any definitive agreements with respect to the financing prior to the closing date (other than any
definitive agreements that are executed and delivered in escrow pending the occurrence of the closing or effective as of the
closing) or incur any liability that is not contingent on the occurrence of the closing date; or 

• take any action in its capacity as a stockholder, member, partner or member of the board of directors of any of MPG or its
subsidiaries to authorize or approve the financing.

The third and fourth bullets of this paragraph and clause (a) of the final bullet of the immediately preceding paragraph, however, will not
apply to customary resolutions, representation letters, officer's certificates, supplemental indentures (which do not result in the creation or
assumption of any additional obligations by MPG or any of its subsidiaries prior to the effective time of the merger) and similar documents
required to be executed in connection with the closing of a debt financing into escrow on customary terms so long as such documents are
not released from escrow or become effective prior to the closing date.

        AAM will, promptly upon request by MPG, reimburse MPG for all documented and reasonable out-of-pocket costs (including
reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred by MPG or any of its subsidiaries (other than with respect to any costs associated with preparing regular
quarterly and annual financial statements) in performing their obligations under the financing covenants of the merger agreement, and will
also indemnify MPG for any and all liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments and penalties suffered
or incurred by MPG or any of its subsidiaries arising therefrom, other than to the extent any of the foregoing (a) arises from the bad faith,
gross negligence or intentional misconduct of, or material breach of the merger agreement by, MPG or any of its subsidiaries, or (b) arises
from or relates to information provided by or on behalf of MPG or any of its subsidiaries for use in connection with the financing.

        The availability of the financing is not a condition to the closing of the merger.

Appointment of Additional AAM Directors 

        Prior to the effective time of the merger, AAM will take all actions as may be necessary (a) to cause the number of directors
comprising the AAM board of directors as of the effective time of the merger to be increased to 11, (b) subject to AAM's standard
qualification requirements for directors, to cause each of the AS designees to be appointed to a different class of the AAM board of
directors as of the effective time of the merger, to serve until the end of the term for the class of directors to which the AS designee is
appointed, and (c) subject to the independence and other requirements of the NYSE and applicable law, if applicable, to cause one AS
designee to be appointed to each of AAM's Executive Committee, Audit Committee, Compensation Committee, and Nominating/Corporate
Governance Committee as of the effective time of the merger.

Amendment; Extension and Waiver 

Amendment

        The merger agreement may be amended only in a signed writing executed by the parties to be bound and authorized by AAM, Merger
Sub and MPG by action taken by or on behalf of their respective boards of directors at any time prior to the effective time of the merger,
except that, after either AAM's or MPG's stockholder approval has been obtained, no amendment may be made that would reduce the
amount or change the type of consideration into which each share of MPG common stock will be converted upon consummation of the
merger or that would otherwise require the approval of the stockholders of AAM or MPG, as applicable, under applicable law or in
accordance with the rules of any relevant stock exchange, without such approval having been obtained. Certain provisions, however, may
not be amended, supplemented, waived or otherwise modified in a manner adverse to the financing sources without the prior written
consent of the adversely affected financing sources.

Extension and Waiver

        At any time prior to the effective time of the merger, AAM, MPG and Merger Sub may:

• extend the time for the performance of any obligation or other act of the other parties; 

• waive any breach or inaccuracy in the representations and warranties of the other parties contained in the merger agreement
or any document delivered pursuant to the merger agreement; and 

• subject to the exception described in the first sentence under "—Amendment; Extension and Waiver—Amendment" and to the
extent permitted by applicable law, waive compliance with any agreement of any of the other parties or any condition to its
own obligations contained in the merger agreement.

        Any such extension or waiver will be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by the parties.

Governing Law; Specific Performance; Third-Party Beneficiaries 

Governing Law

        The merger agreement is governed by Delaware law, without giving effect to any conflicts of laws principles or other principles that
would cause the law of any other jurisdiction to apply.

Table of Contents

Specific Performance

        Each of AAM, Merger Sub and MPG is entitled to specific performance to enforce the observance and performance of any covenant or
obligation contained in the merger agreement and an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of the merger
agreement, without any requirement to obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar instrument, in addition to any other remedy to which they
are entitled at law or in equity.

        MPG will be entitled to specific performance to cause AAM or Merger Sub to cause the financing to be funded and to take all other
required actions to effect the closing only if:

• all of the conditions to the closing, other than the conditions to MPG's obligation to consummate the closing, have been
satisfied (other than those conditions that by their terms must be satisfied at the closing); 

• MPG has confirmed in an irrevocable written notice to AAM that all of the conditions to the closing, other than the
conditions to AAM's obligation to consummate the closing, have been satisfied or, to the extent allowed by applicable law,
waived by MPG, and that MPG is ready, willing and able to perform its obligations to effect the closing; 

• there has not been a financing failure (as defined below); and 

• AAM and Merger Sub fail to fulfill their obligation to effect the closing within 3 business days of the written notice of MPG
pursuant to the second bullet above.

        For purposes of the merger agreement, a "financing failure" means (a) the financing is not available, or (b) AAM or Merger Sub has
not received aggregate proceeds from the financing sources in an amount equal to or greater than the amount of the financing.

        In no event, however, will MPG or any of its affiliates be entitled to seek specific performance of the merger agreement against the
financing sources.

Third-Party Beneficiaries

        The merger agreement is binding upon, inures solely to the benefit of, and is enforceable by, only AAM, Merger Sub, MPG and their
respective successors and permitted assigns, and nothing in the merger agreement, express or implied, is intended to or will confer upon any
other person any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of the merger agreement, with the exception of:

• rights of financing sources as express third-party beneficiaries in respect of certain specified provisions of the merger
agreement, including provisions relating to: 

• the effect of termination of the merger agreement, as described in "—Termination of the Merger Agreement—Effect
of Termination" beginning on page 137; 

• certain amendments to the merger agreement, as described in "—Amendment; Extension and Waiver—Amendment"
beginning on page 153; 

• specific performance of the merger agreement, as described in "—Governing Law; Specific Performance; Third-
Party Beneficiaries—Specific Performance" beginning on page 154; and

THE VOTING AGREEMENT 

        This is a summary of the material provisions of the voting agreement. The following summary of the voting agreement does not purport
to be complete and may not contain all of the information about the voting agreement that is important to you. The summary of the material
terms of the voting agreement below and elsewhere in this joint proxy statement/prospectus is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by
reference to the full text of, the voting agreement, which is attached as Annex D to this joint proxy statement/prospectus and is incorporated
herein by reference. You should read the entire voting agreement carefully and in its entirety because it, and not the description below or
elsewhere in this joint proxy statement/prospectus, is the legal document that governs with respect to the matters described below.

        Contemporaneously with entering into the merger agreement, AAM entered into the voting agreement with the AS stockholder with
respect to all MPG common stock owned by the AS stockholder, which constituted approximately 77% of the issued and outstanding MPG
common stock as of the date of the voting agreement.

        Under the terms of the voting agreement, the AS stockholder has agreed to vote (or caused to be voted):

• 25,344,548 shares of MPG common stock (which shares constitute approximately 37% of the issued and outstanding shares
of MPG common stock on the record date) in favor of the merger, the adoption of the merger agreement and the approval of
the terms thereof and each of the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement; and 

• all other shares of MPG common stock owned by the AS stockholder in a manner that is proportionate to the manner in
which all shares of MPG common stock not owned by the AS stockholder are voted.

        The foregoing voting obligations, however, do not apply to the AS stockholder in the event that the MPG board of directors makes a
change in recommendation (see "The Merger Agreement—No Solicitation—Board Recommendation Change" beginning on page 132). In
the event the MPG board of directors makes a change in recommendation, the AS stockholder may vote (or cause to be voted) all of its
shares of MPG common stock in any manner.

        The AS stockholder has also agreed not to, directly or indirectly:

• sell, transfer, pledge, assign or otherwise encumber or dispose of any of its MPG common stock to, or enter into any
agreement, option or other arrangement (including any profit sharing arrangement) or understanding with respect to any of
its MPG common stock with, any person other than AAM or AAM's designee; 

• deposit any of its MPG common stock into a voting trust or enter into any voting arrangement, whether by proxy, voting
agreement, voting trust, power-of-attorney, attorney-in-fact, agent or otherwise, with respect to its MPG common stock,
except as contemplated by the voting agreement and except for that certain Stockholders' Agreement, dated as of August 4,
2014, by and among MPG, the AS stockholder, ASP HHI Investco LP, ASP Grede Investco LP and the minority investors
made a party from time to time; or 

• take any other action that would in any way make any representation or warranty of the AS stockholder in the voting
agreement untrue or incorrect in any material respect or otherwise restrict, limit or interfere in any material respect with the
performance of the AS stockholder's obligations under the voting agreement or the transactions contemplated in the voting
agreement.

        In addition, the AS stockholder (solely in its capacity as a stockholder of MPG) has agreed not and to cause each of its subsidiaries not
to, and to use its reasonable best efforts to cause its officers, directors, agents and other representatives not to, directly or indirectly:

• solicit, initiate, facilitate or encourage any inquiries or the implementation or submission of any acquisition proposal (which
term has the same meaning in the voting agreement as in the merger agreement (see "The Merger Agreement—No
Solicitation" beginning on page 129)) with respect to MPG or any proposals or offers that would be reasonably expected to
lead to an acquisition proposal with respect to MPG; or 

• engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions, communications or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any
person any non-public information in connection with, or for the purpose of facilitating or encouraging, any inquiries,
proposals or offers that constitute, or would be reasonably expected to lead to, an acquisition proposal with respect to MPG,
except to notify such person of the existence of the non-solicitation obligations under the voting agreement.

        The AS stockholder may, however, engage in any discussions, communications or negotiations described above to the same extent that
MPG or the MPG board of directors is permitted to engage in any such discussions, communications or negotiations under the terms of the
merger agreement (see "The Merger Agreement—No Solicitation" beginning on page 129).

        The AS stockholder has also agreed:

• to irrevocably and unconditionally waive any rights of appraisal with respect to its shares of MPG common stock in the
merger and not to exercise any rights to dissent from the merger or any similar right (including under Section 262 of the
DGCL) that the AS stockholder may have; 

• not to commence, institute, maintain or prosecute any claim, derivative or otherwise, prior to the effective time of the
merger, (i) against MPG, any of its representatives or any of its successors, including claims relating to the negotiation,
execution or delivery of the merger agreement or the consummation of the merger, including any claim alleging a breach of
any fiduciary duty of the MPG board of directors in connection with the merger and the other transactions contemplated by
the merger agreement, or (ii) challenging the validity of or seeking to enjoin the operation of any provision of the voting
agreement (other than with respect to the AS stockholder enforcing its rights under the terms of the voting agreement); and 

• to attend, if applicable, the MPG special meeting or any adjournment thereof (or execute valid and effective proxies to any
other attending participant of an MPG special meeting in lieu of attending such MPG special meeting or any adjournment
thereof).

        The voting agreement terminates upon the first to occur of:

• the effective time of the merger; 

• the termination of the merger agreement in accordance with its terms; 

• the mutual written agreement of AAM and the AS stockholder to terminate the voting agreement; or 

• at the sole election of the AS stockholder following any amendment of or modification to the merger agreement with
respect to any terms of the merger consideration, the allocation of the merger consideration between cash and stock,
the closing conditions, the provisions of the merger agreement relating to the appointment of the AS designees to the
AAM board of directors or any change to the merger agreement that would have a materially adverse impact on the
AS stockholder.

Table of Contents

        Each of AAM and the AS stockholder also made certain customary representations and warranties in connection with the voting
agreement.

        The AS stockholder entered into the voting agreement solely in it capacity as a record and/or beneficial owner of MPG common stock
and not in any capacity as a director, officer, employee, or other fiduciary of MPG or in its capacity as a trustee or fiduciary of any benefits
plans. The voting agreement does not in any way restrict or affect any action or inaction of the AS stockholder or any of its representatives,
as applicable, to the extent the AS stockholder or any such representative is serving on the MPG board of directors or the board of directors
of any subsidiary of MPG or as an officer or fiduciary of MPG or any subsidiary of MPG, or acting in such person's capacity as a director,
officer, employee or fiduciary of MPG or any subsidiary of MPG.

STOCKHOLDERS' AGREEMENT 

        This is a summary of the material provisions of the stockholders' agreement. The following summary of the stockholders' agreement
does not purport to be complete and may not contain all of the information about the stockholders' agreement that is important to you. The
summary of the material terms of the stockholders' agreement below and elsewhere in this joint proxy statement/prospectus is subject to,
and qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of, the stockholders' agreement, which is attached as an exhibit to the merger
agreement which is attached as Annex A to this joint proxy statement/prospectus and is incorporated herein by reference. You should read
the entire stockholders' agreement carefully and in its entirety because it, and not the description below or elsewhere in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus, is the legal document that governs with respect to the matters described below.

        In connection with and as a condition to the consummation of the merger, AAM, the AS stockholder and, for certain limited purposes,
American Securities will enter into the stockholders' agreement effective as of the effective time of the merger.

Transfer Restrictions 

        Under the stockholders' agreement, the AS stockholder is generally restricted from transferring its shares of AAM common stock,
other than to controlled affiliates of American Securities (other than any of its portfolio companies) that agree to be bound by the
stockholders' agreement, without the consent of AAM until the expiration of a lock-up period of six months after the consummation of the
merger. After the expiration of the lock-up period, and until the date the AS stockholder, together with any controlled affiliates of American
Securities (other than any of its portfolio companies), ceases to beneficially own at least 7.5% of the outstanding shares of AAM common
stock (which date we refer to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the expiration date), the AS stockholder or any controlled affiliate
of American Securities (other than any of its portfolio companies) may transfer its shares of AAM common stock only:

• pursuant to its registration rights granted under the stockholders' agreement (see below); 

• pursuant to a transfer made in accordance with Rule 144 of the Securities Act (or any similar provisions then in force); 

• pursuant to a transfer to any person or group so long as such transferee, after giving effect to the transfer, would not
beneficially own, alone or together with its affiliates, in excess of 7.5% of the outstanding shares of AAM common stock
and would be eligible to file a Schedule 13G pursuant to Rule 13d-1(b)(1)(ii) of the Exchange Act; 

• pursuant to a distribution to all of the limited partners (on a pro rata basis in accordance with their respective ownership
percentages) and the general partner (and its representative members) of the AS stockholder or any controlled affiliate of
American Securities (other than any of its portfolio companies) that beneficially owns shares of AAM common stock in
accordance with the terms of their respective organizational documents, so long as no such partner who is transferred more
than 2% of the outstanding shares of AAM common stock would, to the AS stockholder's knowledge, beneficially own,
alone or together with its affiliates (other than the AS stockholder and the controlled affiliates of American Securities), more
than 7.5% of the outstanding shares of AAM common stock after giving effect to the transfer; 

• pursuant to a transfer to certain exempt entities agreed to by the parties of not more than 7.5% of the outstanding shares of
AAM common stock; or 

• with the prior written consent of AAM.

Table of Contents

Registration Rights 

        Following the expiration of a lock-up period of six months after the consummation of the merger, the AS stockholder will have certain
customary registration rights under the stockholders' agreement, as described in this section. These registration rights may be transferred to
any permitted transferee of the shares owned by the AS stockholder, provided that only the AS stockholder will have the power to exercise
such registration rights on behalf of any such transferee. These registration rights will terminate when all shares of AAM common stock
owned by the AS stockholder, any other controlled affiliates of American Securities (other than its portfolio companies) and any permitted
transferee of the AS stockholder are sold pursuant to a registration statement or are sold pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act (or
any similar provisions then in force). In addition, with respect to shares of AAM common stock owned by the AS stockholder and any other
controlled affiliates of American Securities (other than its portfolio companies), these registration rights will terminate when the AS
stockholder beneficially owns less than 7.5% of the shares of AAM common stock then outstanding and there are no AS directors on the
AAM board of directors. In the case of shares of AAM common stock transferred to other permitted transferees of the AS stockholder, the
registration rights will also terminate when such shares may be sold without volume, manner of sale or other limitations under Rule 144 of
the Securities Act (or any similar provisions then in force).

Transaction Shelf Registration

        Under the stockholders' agreement, AAM is required to file a shelf registration statement with respect to the AAM common stock
received by the AS stockholder in connection with the closing of the merger. The stockholders' agreement requires AAM to use
commercially reasonable efforts to have this shelf registration statement effective 180 days from the completion of the merger and provides
that the registration statement shall be on a form that is automatically effective upon filing if AAM is then eligible for automatic
effectiveness. Under the stockholders' agreement, AAM must use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain such registration statement
effective until the sale of all such shares, subject to customary suspension rights. For a period of two years following the consummation of
the merger, any common stock that has been registered in such shelf registration statement may be included in any underwritten offering of
AAM upon proper exercise of demand registration rights or piggyback registration rights by the AS stockholder.

Demand Registration Rights

        Under the stockholders' agreement, the AS stockholder will have registration rights that allow it at any time after 6 months following
the consummation of the merger to request that AAM register the resale under the Securities Act of all or any portion of the shares of AAM
common stock owned by the AS stockholder, any controlled affiliate of American Securities (other than its portfolio companies) or any
permitted transferee of the AS stockholder, so long as the aggregate market value of such shares to be sold is not less than $100 million as
measured by the market price of AAM common stock on the date of the demand. The AS stockholder will be entitled to a total of two
demand registrations in any 12-month period. AAM will not be required to maintain the effectiveness of any resale registration statement
for more than 180 days for any firm commitment public offering and 90 days for any other offering.

Piggyback Registration Rights

        The AS stockholder will also be entitled to "piggyback" registration rights exercisable at any time following the consummation of the
merger that allow it to include the shares of AAM common stock that it, any other controlled affiliate of American Securities (other than its
portfolio companies) or any permitted transferee of the AS stockholder owns in any public offering of equity securities initiated by AAM
(other than those public offerings pursuant to registration statements on forms that do not

permit registration for resale by them). These "piggyback" registration rights are subject to customary underwriter cutbacks based on the
manner of such offering and the identity of the party initiating such offering.

General Provisions

        AAM will be entitled to suspend these registration rights, as further described in the stockholders' agreement and subject to the
limitations specified therein if, in its good faith judgment, it is not feasible for AAM to proceed with the registration because of the
existence of any acquisition, disposition or other material transaction or financing activity involving AAM, or because of the unavailability
of audited or pro forma financial statements, or because of AAM's possession of material information that it would not be in AAM's best
interests to disclose in a registration statement. Under the stockholders' agreement, each of AAM and the AS stockholder will agree to
customary lock-up obligations in connection with any exercise of registration rights by the other, for itself and for its affiliates and permitted
transferees.

        AAM will indemnify the AS stockholder, its controlling persons and their respective officers, directors, employees, stockholders,
general and limited partners, members, representatives and affiliates against any liabilities, losses or damages arising out of or based upon
any untrue statement or omission of material fact in any registration statement or prospectus pursuant to which it sells shares of AAM
common stock, unless such liability arose from the AS stockholder's misstatement or omission, and the AS stockholder will indemnify
AAM, its directors, employees, stockholders, controlling persons and the affiliates of the foregoing against all liabilities, losses or damages
caused by its misstatements or omissions in any such registration statement or prospectus. AAM will pay all registration and offering-
related expenses incidental to AAM's performance under the stockholders' agreement, and the AS stockholder will pay all underwriting
fees, discounts, commissions and transfer taxes, if any, relating to the sale of its shares of AAM common stock under the stockholders'
agreement. The stockholders' agreement also includes customary contribution obligations in the event indemnification is not available.

Preemptive Rights 

        From the date the merger is consummated until the expiration date, if AAM issues new shares of AAM common stock or any
instruments convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for shares of AAM common stock, the AS stockholder will have the right to
purchase such new securities that are proposed to be issued in order to maintain its equity ownership percentage in AAM. Preemptive rights
do not apply to any issuance (i) to directors, officers, employees, advisors or consultants of AAM or any of its subsidiaries in connection
with their compensation or employment, (ii) in a public offering, (iii) in connection with a pro rata dividend made to all holders of shares of
AAM common stock, or (iv) in connection with the consummation of the merger.

AAM Board of Directors 

Increase in the AAM Board Size

        Effective as of the effective time of the merger, AAM will increase the number of members of the AAM board of directors from 8 to
11 and will elect the AS designees to serve as new directors on the AAM board of directors.

Table of Contents

Right of the AS Stockholder to Nominate Directors

        Until the expiration date, the AS stockholder will have the right to nominate to the AAM board of directors:

• if the total number of directors on the AAM board of directors is less than 14, 3 directors; 

• if the total number of directors on the AAM board of directors is 14, 4 directors; and 

• if the total number of directors on the AAM board of directors is greater than 14, a number of directors equal to such total
number of directors multiplied by 27%, rounding down in the case of any fractional number.

        If the number of AS directors is three, each AS director will serve in a different class of directors on the AAM board of directors. If the
number of AS directors is greater than three, no more than two AS directors will serve in any class of directors on the AAM board of
directors. AS directors will have the same notice, insurance and indemnification rights as the other members of the AAM board of directors.
AS directors do not have any obligation to communicate or offer to AAM any new business opportunities similar to the business in which
AAM is engaged unless the AS directors first become aware of such business opportunities in their capacity as a member of the AAM board
of directors.

        If any AS director is serving on the AAM board of directors on the expiration date, the AS stockholder must use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause such AS director to promptly tender his or her resignation, which resignation the Nominating/Corporate
Governance Committee of AAM (which we refer to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the Governance Committee) may determine
to accept or reject in its sole discretion.

Election of AS Directors to the AAM Board of Directors

        Following the closing date, to the extent that an AS designee must stand for election or an AS director must stand for reelection, as the
case may be, to the AAM board of directors in connection with any annual or special meeting of stockholders of AAM at which directors
are to be elected (which we refer to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as an election meeting), AAM will (a) nominate and
recommend that the holders of AAM common stock who are entitled to vote at such election meeting vote in favor of the election of such
AS designee or the reelection of such AS director, as the case may be, (b) support such AS designee for election or such AS director for
reelection, as the case may be, in a manner no less rigorous and favorable than the manner in which AAM supports its other nominees and
(c) otherwise use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the election of such AS designee or the reelection of such AS director, as the
case may be, to the AAM board of directors at such election meeting.

Replacement of AS Directors

        If an (a) an AS director is unable or unwilling to serve as a director for any reason, (b) an AS director is removed (upon death,
resignation or otherwise), or (c) an AS director or an AS designee fails to be reelected or elected, as the case may be, at an election meeting
solely as a result of failing to receive the required vote of the holders of AAM common stock as required by AAM's organizational
documents, the AS stockholder will have the exclusive right to submit the name of a replacement candidate for such AS director or AS
designee, as the case may be (which we refer to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as a replacement director), to the Governance
Committee for its approval. If approved by the Governance Committee, the replacement director will serve as the AS designee for election
or reelection in the same class of directors on the AAM board of directors as the AS director or AS designee for which such person serves
as a replacement. For each proposed replacement director that is not approved by AAM, the AS stockholder will have the right to continue
submitting the name

of a new proposed replacement director to the Governance Committee for its approval until the Governance Committee approves a
proposed replacement director.

Board Committee Representation

        So long as the AS stockholder has the right to nominate directors to the AAM board of directors in accordance with the terms of the
stockholders' agreement, the AS stockholder will have the right to require that one AS director be appointed to each of the committees of
the AAM board of directors, subject to applicable requirements or qualifications under applicable law or applicable stock exchange rules
(including with respect to director independence). However, the AS stockholder will not have any right to require that any AS director be
appointed as the chair of any committee of the AAM board of directors, and the identity of the particular AS director appointed to each
particular committee will be subject to the reasonable mutual agreement of the AS stockholder and the AAM board of directors.

Voting Rights and Restrictions 

        Until the expiration date or for so long as at least one director designated by the AS stockholder is serving on the AAM board of
directors, the AS stockholder has agreed to vote in accordance with the recommendation of the AAM board of directors with respect to the
following matters:

• the election or removal of directors to or from the AAM board of directors; 

• the compensation of directors, officers or other employees of AAM (including say-on-pay matters and option grants); and 

• the engagement of accountants.

        With respect to any other matter (other than any extraordinary transaction, as defined below), the AS stockholder may vote its shares,
at its discretion, either (i) as recommended by the AAM board of directors or (ii) in the same proportion in which all shares of AAM
common stock (other than shares owned by the AS Stockholder and other controlled affiliates of American Securities (other than its
portfolio companies)) that voted or submitted a written consent on such matter are actually voted or consented.

        Neither the AS stockholder nor any other controlled affiliate of American Securities will have an obligation to vote its shares in any
prescribed manner in the case of any vote of the AAM stockholders that is held to consider (i) amendments to AAM's certificate of
incorporation or bylaws, (ii) any recapitalization, restructuring or similar transaction or series of transactions involving AAM, (iii) any
dissolution or complete or partial liquidation, or similar arrangement, of AAM, (iv) any merger, consolidation or other business combination
of AAM, (v) any issuance of any AAM common stock, preferred stock or other form of equity or instruments convertible into or exercisable
or exchangeable for AAM common stock, preferred stock or other form of equity (vi) any transaction with an "interested stockholder" (as
such term is defined in Section 203 of the DGCL), (vii) any ratification of a "defective corporate action" (as such term is defined in
Section 205 of the DGCL) or (viii) any sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition (other than by way of merger or consolidation),
in one or a series of related transactions, of all or substantially all of the assets of AAM to any third party (we refer to each of the foregoing
transactions in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as an extraordinary transaction).

Standstill 

        American Securities has agreed that, from the closing of the merger until the date that is 3 months following the expiration date,
American Securities and its controlled affiliates, including the AS stockholder and any other controlled Affiliate of American Securities
(other than its portfolio companies), will be subject to standstill provisions that prohibit American Securities and its controlled

or any controlled affiliate of American Securities; provided that American Securities or any such controlled affiliate of
American Securities which submits such offer is required to immediately withdraw such offer if it is rejected by the AAM
board of directors;

UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

        The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements (which we refer to in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus as the pro forma financial statements) have been prepared to illustrate the effect of the merger. Under the terms of the
merger agreement, at the effective time of the merger, each share of MPG common stock (other than MPG excluded shares) will be
converted into the right to receive (a) $13.50 in cash, without interest, and (b) 0.5 of a share of AAM common stock.

        The historical consolidated financial statements have been adjusted in the pro forma financial statements to give effect to pro forma
events that are (1) directly attributable to the merger, (2) factually supportable, and (3) with respect to the unaudited pro forma condensed
combined statements of income (which we refer to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the pro forma statement of income), expected
to have a continuing impact on the combined results of AAM and MPG. Although AAM and MPG have entered into the merger agreement,
there is no guarantee that the merger will be completed. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as of December 31,
2016 (which we refer to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the pro forma balance sheet) is based on the individual historical audited
consolidated balance sheets of AAM and MPG as of December 31, 2016, and has been prepared to reflect the merger as if it occurred on
December 31, 2016. The pro forma statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2016 combines the historical results of income of
AAM and MPG, giving effect to the merger as if it occurred on January 1, 2016. The pro forma balance sheet as of December 31, 2016, as
well as the pro forma statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2016, also give effect to AAM's anticipated incurrence of new
indebtedness to be used, in part, to fund the cash consideration payable in connection with the merger, related fees and expenses, and
refinance certain existing indebtedness of MPG.

        The pro forma statement of income does not reflect future events that may occur after the closing of the merger, including, but not
limited to, the anticipated realization of ongoing savings from operating synergies, and certain one-time charges AAM expects to incur in
connection with the transaction, including, but not limited to, costs in connection with integrating the operations of AAM and MPG.

        The pro forma financial statements are for informational purposes only. They do not purport to indicate the results that would actually
have been obtained had the merger been completed on the assumed date or for the periods presented, or which may be realized in the future.
To produce the pro forma financial statements, AAM adjusted MPG's assets and liabilities to their estimated fair values. As of the date of
this joint proxy statement/prospectus, AAM has not completed the detailed valuation work necessary to arrive at the required estimates of
the fair value of the MPG assets to be acquired and the liabilities to be assumed and the related allocation of purchase price, nor has it
identified all adjustments necessary to conform MPG's accounting policies to AAM's accounting policies. A final determination of the fair
value of MPG's assets and liabilities will be based on the actual net tangible and intangible assets and liabilities of MPG that exist as of the
date of completion of the merger. Additionally, the value of the stock consideration will be determined based on the trading price of shares
of AAM common stock at the time of the completion of the merger. Accordingly, the accompanying unaudited pro forma purchase price
allocation is preliminary and is subject to further adjustments as additional information becomes available and as additional analyses are
performed. The preliminary unaudited pro forma purchase price allocation has been made solely for the purpose of preparing the
accompanying pro forma financial statements. The preliminary purchase price allocation was based on reviews of publicly disclosed
allocations for other acquisitions in the automotive supplier industry, AAM's historical experience, data that was available through the
public domain and AAM's due diligence review of MPG's business. Until the merger is completed, both companies are limited in their
ability to share information with each other. Upon the completion of the merger, valuation work

will be performed and any increases or decreases in the fair value of relevant balance sheet amounts will result in adjustments to the balance
sheet and/or statement of income until the purchase price allocation is finalized. There can be no assurance that such finalization will not
result in material changes from the preliminary purchase price allocation included in the accompanying pro forma financial statements.

        The pro forma financial statements should be read in conjunction with:

• the accompanying notes beginning on page 169 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus; 

• AAM's audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes for the year ended December 31, 2016, which are
incorporated by reference in this joint proxy statement/prospectus; and

incorporated by reference in this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

Notes to Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements 

1.     Basis of Pro Forma Presentation

        The accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements are based on the historical consolidated financial
statements of AAM and MPG and reflect pro forma adjustments for (i) reclassifications resulting from differences in AAM accounting
policies and MPG accounting policies, or changes to financial statement presentation to conform the financial statements of AAM and MPG
(Note 4); (ii) acquisition-related adjustments resulting from the merger; and (iii) adjustments resulting from AAM's anticipated incurrence
of new indebtedness to be used, in part, to refinance certain existing indebtedness of MPG (Note 5).

        The merger is accounted for in the pro forma financial statements under Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 805, Business
Combinations (which we refer to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as ASC 805), using the acquisition method of accounting with
AAM as the acquiror. The acquisition method requires the acquiror to allocate the purchase price to the identifiable assets and liabilities of
the acquired entity based on the acquisition-date fair values of the assets and liabilities.

        For purposes of preparing these pro forma financial statements, AAM has calculated the estimated purchase price (Note 2) and has
allocated the estimated purchase price to the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on
preliminary estimates of their respective fair values. These estimates are based on certain assumptions related to the merger. Due to the fact
that the pro forma financial statements have been prepared based on preliminary estimates, the final amounts recorded for the merger may
be materially different from the information included herein. These estimates are subject to change as additional information becomes
available, and the final amounts will be based on the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets and liabilities of MPG as of
the effective date of acquisition. Under ASC 805, transaction costs associated with the acquisition are not included as a component of the
consideration transferred but are accounted for as expenses in the period incurred.

Pro Forma Condensed Combined Balance Sheet

        The pro forma balance sheet has been prepared as if the merger occurred on December 31, 2016, which is AAM's most recent balance
sheet date prior to the filing of this joint proxy statement/prospectus. The pro forma balance sheet is based on the historical balance sheets
of AAM and MPG, as of December 31, 2016, which have been adjusted for certain reclassification and merger-related adjustments. The
adjustments to the pro forma balance sheet give effect to events that are directly attributable to the merger and are factually supportable, and
include adjustments that will have a continuing impact after the transaction, as well as those that are non-recurring or specific to the merger.

Pro Forma Condensed Combined Statement of Income

        The pro forma statement of income has been prepared as if the merger occurred on January 1, 2016. The pro forma statement of
income is based on the historical statements of income of AAM and MPG for the full year ended December 31, 2016. The pro forma
statement of income has been adjusted for certain reclassification and merger-related adjustments. These adjustments give effect to events
that are directly attributable to the merger, are factually supportable, and are expected to have a continuing impact on the results of
operations of the combined entity after the closing of the merger.

2.     Preliminary Purchase Consideration

        The merger is accounted for using the acquisition method under ASC 805, which requires that the AAM common stock issued to effect
the merger be measured at the market price of AAM common

stock on the date that the merger is completed. AAM calculated the stock portion of the preliminary purchase consideration included herein
using (i) $20.05 per share of AAM common stock, which represents the closing price of shares of AAM common stock on February 27,
2017, the last practicable date prior to filing this joint proxy statement/prospectus; and (ii) the number of shares of MPG common stock
outstanding as of December 31, 2016. The price per share of AAM common stock, as well as the number of shares of MPG common stock
outstanding, could change prior to the date that the merger is completed, which may result in material differences in the consideration to be
transferred, the purchase price, and the associated purchase price allocation. For example, a 10% increase or decrease in AAM's stock price
on the closing date of the merger, as compared to the closing price on February 27, 2017, as used in the calculation below, would change the
value of the consideration by approximately $72 million, which would result in a corresponding increase or decrease to Goodwill as
calculated in Note 3 to these pro forma financial statements.

        At the date that the merger is completed, each outstanding share of MPG common stock will be cancelled and converted into the right
to receive (i) $13.50 in cash consideration; and (ii) 0.5 of a share of AAM common stock. Further, each unvested MPG stock option
outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger will be accelerated in full and become fully vested immediately prior to
the effective time of the merger and, at the effective time of the merger, all MPG stock options will be cancelled and the holders thereof will
receive an amount in cash (without interest and subject to applicable withholding of taxes) equal to the product obtained by multiplying
(x) the aggregate number of shares of MPG common stock that would have been issuable upon exercise of the MPG stock options
immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, and (y) the cash value of the merger consideration, less the per share exercise price of
the MPG stock options. For purposes of the cash payment with respect to the MPG stock options, the share component of the merger
consideration is valued based on the closing price of a share of AAM common stock as of the trading day immediately preceding the
closing date of the merger. If the exercise price payable upon exercise of an MPG stock option equals or exceeds the value of the merger
consideration, the MPG stock option will be cancelled for no consideration.

        At the effective time of the merger, pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, all restricted MPG common stock outstanding under
an MPG equity plan will be cancelled and terminated, and each holder thereof will receive the merger consideration for each share of
restricted MPG common stock. Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, each MPG restricted stock unit award outstanding under an
MPG equity plan will become fully vested immediately prior to the effective time and, at the effective time of the merger, will be cancelled
and terminated in return for an amount equal to the merger consideration multiplied by the number of shares of MPG common stock subject
to the MPG restricted stock unit award.

        The preliminary purchase consideration attributable to stock-based compensation, as shown below, reflects (i) cash consideration for
MPG's stock options and restricted shares that had either vested prior to the merger or had an existing change of control provision in the
award agreement to allow for automatic vesting upon a change of control and (ii) the share portion of the merger consideration for MPG's
restricted shares that had vested prior to the merger. The fair value of MPG's unvested stock options and restricted shares, less amounts
previously recognized as compensation cost for these awards has been reflected as post-merger compensation cost and has been adjusted
through retained earnings in the pro forma balance sheet (see adjustment 11 in Note 5).

4.     Effect of Reclassification Adjustments

        AAM performed certain procedures to identify pro forma accounting adjustments to be made as a result of material differences in the
significant accounting policies or financial statement presentation of AAM and MPG. These procedures included a review of MPG's
significant accounting policies, including those disclosed in MPG's Current Report on Form 8-K which was filed with the SEC on March 2,
2017 and is incorporated herein by reference, as well as discussions between AAM management and MPG management regarding their
significant accounting policies.

        Based on these procedures, AAM identified the following pro forma adjustments that are reflected in the "Effect of Reclassification"
column of the pro forma financial statements:

5.     Pro Forma Acquisition Adjustments

        Pro forma adjustments related to the acquisition are reflected in the "Acquisition Adjustments" column in the pro forma financial
statements and are as follows:

Acquisition Adjustments—Unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as of:

A1 The following represents the calculation of the preliminary acquisition adjustment to cash and cash equivalents:

A2 This adjustment is to eliminate the intercompany accounts receivable and accounts payable balances between AAM and MPG as of
December 31, 2016. 

A3 This represents the preliminary estimate of the step-up in inventory to fair value. Raw materials inventory was not adjusted as the
carrying value of raw materials is assumed to represent fair value. The portion of the preliminary adjustment that relates to finished
goods is based on the estimated selling price of the inventory less costs to sell the inventory and a reasonable profit margin on the
sale. The portion of the preliminary adjustment associated with work-in-progress inventory includes estimated costs to complete the
inventory and also includes a reasonable profit margin. AAM has not adjusted cost of goods sold within the pro forma statement of
income to reflect this preliminary estimated step-up in inventory value as this is not expected to have a continuing impact on AAM's
financial statements subsequent to the acquisition. 

A4 The following represents the preliminary estimated fair value of property, plant and equipment (which we refer to in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus as PP&E), as well as the estimated remaining useful lives of the various categories of PP&E. The table also

remaining useful lives.

Depreciation expense has been calculated using the straight-line method of depreciation. With other assumptions held constant, a
10% increase in the fair value adjustment to PP&E upon consummation of the merger would increase annual pro forma depreciation
expense by approximately $1.1 million.

Amortization expense has been calculated using the straight-line method of amortization. With other assumptions held constant, a
10% increase in the amount attributable to amortizable intangible assets upon consummation of the merger would increase annual
pro forma amortization expense by approximately $11.0 million.

A7 As outlined in the "Financing Related to the Merger" section beginning on page 121 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, AAM
expects to enter into a senior secured credit facility agreement, which will provide up to $1.65 billion in term loans, and further
intends to issue up to $1.2 billion in new senior unsecured notes to fund the cash consideration payable in connection with the
merger, related fees and expenses, and refinance certain existing indebtedness of MPG. The merger adjustment to long-term debt,

share of MPG common stock, as well as eliminating MPG's historical value for common stock. The adjustment was calculated as
follows:

A10 The acquisition adjustment to paid-in capital represents the impact of converting the shares of MPG common stock outstanding to
shares of AAM common stock using the exchange ratio, as outlined in adjustment A9, and multiplying the converted number of
shares by AAM's closing stock price on February 27, 2017, the last practicable date prior to filing this joint proxy
statement/prospectus, less the $0.01 par value of the shares. The adjustment also includes the impact of accelerating the vesting of
all MPG restricted shares and the elimination of MPG's historical value for paid-in capital. The following represents the calculation:

A11 Retained earnings (deficit) has been adjusted to reflect the impact of certain one-time or non-recurring items that are specific to the
merger and cannot be reflected in the pro forma statement of income because they will not have a continuing impact on the
combined entity after the acquisition is consummated. Further, retained earnings (deficit) has been adjusted to eliminate MPG's
historical accumulated deficit. The calculation of the adjustment to retained earnings (deficit) is as follows:

The tax benefit of $18.5 million associated with the transaction costs is reflected in the pro forma balance sheet as a reduction of
income tax payable in accrued expenses and other. These costs are not reflected in the pro forma statement of income as they are
non-recurring in nature and will not have a continuing impact on the combined entity subsequent to the closing of the merger.

A12 These adjustments represent the elimination of MPG's historical values for treasury stock, at cost and accumulated other
comprehensive loss.

Acquisition Adjustments—Unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of income for the period ended:

A17 As noted in adjustment A7, AAM expects to incur new debt as a result of the merger that will be used, in part, to fund the cash
consideration payable in connection with the merger, related fees and expenses, and refinance certain existing indebtedness of MPG.
AAM is expected to incur $2.85 billion of additional debt, with maturities ranging from five to 10 years and an expected weighted
average interest rate of 5.8%, including the amortization of financing fees. The following calculation represents the preliminary
estimate of the impact on interest expense as a result of the new borrowings and refinancing of certain existing long-term
indebtedness of MPG:

AAM expects to incur approximately $90.0 million in debt issuance costs associated with the new borrowings, which has been
recorded as a reduction of long-term debt, net on the pro forma balance sheet and will be amortized into interest expense over the
life of the borrowings. The impact of a 1/8% (12.5 basis points) change in the interest rate would result in a change of approximately
$3.6 million in interest expense on an annual basis.

ACCOUNTING TREATMENT 

        AAM prepares its financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
The merger will be accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting with AAM as the acquiror. The acquisition method requires
the acquiror to allocate the purchase price to the identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquired entity, with any excess purchase price
recorded as goodwill. Under the acquisition method of accounting, goodwill is not amortized but is instead tested for impairment at least

        MPG has historically paid quarterly cash dividends to its stockholders. Under the merger agreement, MPG may continue to make its
regular quarterly cash dividends consistent with past practice (including as to the record date, timing of payment and amount thereof) in an
aggregate amount per quarter not in excess of $0.0925 per share of MPG common stock. On February 24, 2017, the MPG board of directors
declared a dividend of $0.0925 per share of MPG common stock. The dividend is payable on March 24, 2017 to holders of record of MPG
common stock as of March 10, 2017. MPG expects to make additional public announcements from time to time prior to the completion of
the merger with respect to the declaration and timing of the payment of dividends to its stockholders.

        The following table presents the closing price per share of AAM common stock and per share of MPG common stock, as reported on
the NYSE on:

• November 2, 2016, the last full trading day prior to the public announcement of the merger agreement; and 

• March 3, 2017, the latest practicable date prior to mailing this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

director candidate at an annual meeting, a written notice
must be received by the secretary of MPG at its
principal executive offices not less than 90 days nor
more than 120 days before the first anniversary of the
preceding year's annual meeting. If the date of the

been no public announcement naming all of the
nominees for director or indicating the increase in the
size of the MPG board of directors made by MPG at
least 10 days before the last day an MPG stockholder

offices of MPG not later than the close of business on
the 10th day following the day on which such public
announcement is first made by MPG.

public announcement naming all of the nominees for
director or specifying the size of the increased AAM
board of directors made by AAM at least 80 days prior
to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual
meeting, an AAM stockholder's notice will be

  MPG Stockholder Rights  AAM Stockholder Rights
Directors  MPG's amended and restated certificate of

incorporation provides that the MPG board of directors
is divided into three classes of directors, with the
classes to be as nearly equal in number as possible. The
members of each class serve for a three-year term. As a
result, approximately one-third of the MPG board of
directors will be elected each year. In the event of any
increase or decrease in the size of the MPG board of
directors, the directors shall be appointed among the
classes as determined by the MPG board of directors so
as to maintain the number of directors in each class as
nearly equal as possible. MPG's amended and restated
certificate of incorporation also provides that the board
shall consist of eight directors and that the number of
directors may be fixed from time to time exclusively by
resolutions adopted by affirmative vote of a majority of
the board of directors. The MPG board of directors
currently consists of eight directors.

The MPG organizational documents provide that
directors may be removed only for cause and only upon
the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the voting
power of all the then outstanding shares of stock
entitled to vote generally in the election of directors,
voting together as a single class. In addition, the MPG
organizational documents provide that, subject to the
terms of any MPG preferred stock and of that certain
Stockholders' Agreement, effective as of August 4,
2014, by and among the AS stockholder, ASP HHI
Investco LP, ASP Grede Investco LP and the other
signatories thereto, any vacancies on the MPG board of
directors, including from new positions, will be filled
only by the affirmative vote of a majority of the
remaining directors, even if less than a quorum.

 AAM's certificate of incorporation provides that the
AAM board of directors is divided into three classes of
directors, with the classes to be as nearly equal in
number as possible. The members of each class serve
for a three-year term. As a result, approximately one-
third of the AAM board of directors will be elected each
year. AAM's certificate of incorporation also provides
that the board shall consist of not less than three
directors and that the exact number of directors shall be
determined by resolution adopted by affirmative vote of
a majority of the AAM board of directors. The AAM
board of directors currently consists of eight directors,
but will be increased to 11 members as a condition to,
and effective upon, the completion of the merger.

The AAM organizational documents provide that
directors may be removed only for cause and only upon
the affirmative vote of at least 75% of the voting power
of all the then outstanding shares of stock entitled to
vote generally in the election of directors, voting
together as a single class. In addition, the AAM
organizational documents provide that any vacancies on
AAM's board of directors will be filled only by the
affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining
directors, although less than a quorum. To the extent
applicable Delaware law provides stockholders with the
power to fill such vacancies, the AAM certificate of
incorporation requires the affirmative vote of at least
75% in voting power of the outstanding shares of AAM
entitled to vote in the election of directors.

Exculpation
 

The DGCL provides that a corporation may limit or eliminate a director's personal liability for monetary damages to
the corporation or its stockholders for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except for liability for: (1) any breach of
the director's duty of loyalty to such corporation or its stockholders; (2) acts or omissions not in good faith or which
involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law; (3) willful or negligent violation of provisions of the
DGCL governing payment of dividends and stock purchases or redemptions; (4) any transaction from which the
director derived an improper personal benefit; or (5) any act or omission before the adoption of such a provision in the
certificate of incorporation.

 
MPG's amended and restated certificate of
incorporation contains a provision so eliminating a
director's personal liability to the fullest extent
permitted under the DGCL as currently in effect or as
may be amended to further eliminate or limit the
liability of directors.

 
AAM's certificate of incorporation contains a provision
so eliminating a director's personal liability to the fullest
extent permitted under the DGCL.

indemnitees"). This indemnification obligation
expressly includes the indemnification of any MPG
indemnitee who is, or is threatened to be made, a party
to or participant in any threatened, pending or
completed action, suit, arbitration, mediation, alternate
dispute resolution mechanism, investigation, inquiry,
administrative hearing or any other actual, threatened or
completed proceeding or otherwise, including any
appeal therefrom, other than any such proceeding
brought in the right of MPG, by reason of the fact that
such person is or was a director, officer, trustee, general
partner, managing member, fiduciary, employee or
agent of MPG or is or was serving in such a capacity at
MPG's request at any other corporation, constituent
corporation (including any constituent of a constituent)
absorbed in a consolidation or merger to which MPG

limited liability company, partnership, joint venture,
trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise of which
such person is or was serving at the request of MPG as
a director, officer, trustee, general partner, managing
member, fiduciary, employee or agent, against all
expenses of any type or nature whatsoever and all
judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement
actually and reasonably incurred by or on behalf of such
MPG indemnitee. A person may be indemnified only if
such person acted in good faith and in a manner he or
she reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the
best interests of MPG and, with respect to any criminal
action, such person had no reasonable cause to believe
his or her conduct was unlawful.

In the case of an action or suit by or in the right or
MPG, indemnification is available only for expenses
actually and reasonably incurred by such person or on
their behalf in connection with such proceeding,
provided that no such indemnification shall be made in
respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such
person shall have been finally adjudged to be liable to
MPG unless, and only to the extent, such
indemnification is deemed proper by the Court of
Chancery of Delaware or such other court in which the
action or suit was brought.

 Under AAM's certificate of incorporation, AAM must
indemnify, to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL,
any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be
made a party to any threatened, pending or completed
action, suit or proceeding (brought in the right of AAM
or otherwise), whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, and whether formal or informal, including
appeals, by reason of the fact that such person is or was
a director or officer of AAM or, while a director or
officer of AAM, is or was serving at the request of
AAM as a director, officer, partner, trustee, employee or
agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture,
trust, limited liability company or other enterprise, for
and against all expenses (including attorneys' fees),
judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement
actually and reasonably incurred by such person or such
heirs, executors or administrators in connection with
such action, suit or proceeding, including appeals.

AAM must indemnify a person described above in
connection with any action, suit or proceeding (or part
thereof) commenced by such person only if the
commencement of such action, suit or proceeding (or
part thereof) by such person was authorized by the
AAM board of directors.

  MPG Stockholder Rights  AAM Stockholder Rights
 Under MPG's amended and restated certificate of

incorporation, MPG is the indemnitor of first resort with
respect to any rights directors of MPG who are also
partners or employees of American Securities may have
to indemnification and advancement of expenses.

MPG must also advance or promptly reimburse the
expenses incurred by any such person described above,
if such person provides an undertaking to repay all
amounts so advanced or reimbursed in the event that it
is ultimately determined that such person is not entitled
to be indemnified by MPG.

  

Antitakeover Provisions
 

Subject to specific exceptions, Section 203 of the DGCL prohibits a publicly held Delaware corporation from engaging
in a "business combination" with an "interested stockholder" for a period of three years after the time of the transaction
in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless:

 • the "business combination," or the transaction in which the stockholder became an "interested stockholder" is
approved by the board of directors prior to the time the "interested stockholder" attained that status;

 • upon consummation of the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an "interested stockholder," the
"interested stockholder" owned at least 85% of the voting stock of the corporation outstanding at the time the
transaction commenced, excluding for purposes of determining the voting stock outstanding (but not the outstanding
voting stock owned by the interested stockholder), those shares owned by persons who are directors and also
officers, and employee stock plans in which employee participants do not have the right to determine confidentially
whether shares held subject to the plan will be tendered in a tender or exchange offer); or

 • at or subsequent to the time such person became an "interested stockholder," the "business combination" is approved
by the board of directors and authorized at an annual or special meeting of stockholders by the affirmative vote of at
least two-thirds of the outstanding voting stock that is not owned by the "interested stockholder."

 
"Business combinations" include mergers, asset sales and other transactions resulting in a financial benefit to the
"interested stockholder."

 
Subject to various exceptions, an "interested stockholder" is a person who, together with his or her affiliates and
associates, owns, or within the prior three years did own, 15% or more of the corporation's outstanding voting stock.

 
MPG has opted out of Section 203 of the DGCL and
accordingly is not subject to its provisions.

 
AAM has not opted out of Section 203 of the DGCL (as
described in MPG Stockholder Rights, Antitakeover
Provisions), and accordingly is subject to its provisions.

Amendment to the Incorporation Document and the
Bylaws

 
Delaware law provides generally that the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote is
required to amend a corporation's certificate of incorporation, unless the certificate of incorporation requires a greater
percentage.

 MPG's amended and restated certificate of

incorporation provides that the amended and restated
bylaws may be amended, altered, added to or repealed

in the case of amendment by the stockholders, only by a
vote of at least a majority of the voting power of all of
the outstanding shares of MPG stock entitled to vote
generally in the election of directors, voting together as
a single class.

In addition to the default provisions of Delaware law, a
vote of at least 662/3% of the voting power of the
outstanding shares of MPG common stock entitled to
vote in the election of directors is required to amend

amendment of the above provisions in the certificate of
incorporation.

MPG's amended and restated certificate of
incorporation also provides that the provisions relating
to the waiver of Delaware's antitakeover statute and of
the corporate opportunities doctrine may not be
amended, altered or revised, including by merger or
otherwise, without American Securities' written consent
for so long as American Securities owns at least 10% of
the then outstanding MPG stock entitled to vote
generally in the election of directors.

 AAM's certificate of incorporation provides that the
second amended and restated bylaws may be amended
by the AAM board of directors or the stockholders.
However, in the case of amendment by the
stockholders, the affirmative vote of at least 75% of the
voting power of all of the outstanding shares of AAM
entitled to vote in the election of directors, voting
together as a single class, is required to amend, alter or
repeal any provision of AAM's second amended and
restated by-laws which is to the same effect as the
provisions in AAM's certificate of incorporation
relating to the amendment of by-laws, board
composition, director removal, filling of board
vacancies, stockholder action by written consent and the
ability to call special meetings of stockholders.
Furthermore, AAM's second amended and restated by-
laws provide that the affirmative vote of at least 75% of
the voting power of all of the outstanding shares of
AAM entitled to vote in the election of directors, voting
together as a single class, is required to amend, alter or
repeal certain provisions of AAM's second amended
and restated by-laws relating to the ability to call special
meetings of stockholders, advanced notice for
stockholder proposals and nominations, board
composition and director elections, filling vacancies on
the board of directors, and the supermajority voting
requirement for amendment of the above provisions in
the by-laws.

In addition, a vote of at least 75% of the voting power
of all of the outstanding shares of AAM entitled to vote
in the election of directors, voting as a single class, is
required to amend alter, amend, add to or repeal or to
adopt certain provisions of AAM's certificate of
incorporation relating to the amendment of by-laws,
board composition, director removal, filling vacancies
on the board of directors, the prohibition of stockholder
action by written consent, the ability to call special
meetings of stockholders and the supermajority voting
requirement for amendment of the above provisions in
the certificate of incorporation.

  MPG Stockholder Rights  AAM Stockholder Rights
Forum Selection  MPG's amended and restated certificate of

incorporation provides that unless MPG consents in
writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the
Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware shall be the
sole and exclusive forum for any derivative action
brought on behalf of MPG, any action asserting breach
of fiduciary duties owed by or wrongdoing by any
director, officer or employee of MPG to MPG
stockholders, any action arising pursuant to the DGCL
or MPG's organizational documents, or to interpret such
organizational documents, or any action asserting a
claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine.

 AAM's organizational documents do not include a
forum selection clause.

Waiver of Corporate Opportunities
 

MPG's amended and restated certificate of
incorporation includes a provision whereby MPG and
its subsidiaries waive and renounce any interest or
expectancy they may have with respect to any business
opportunities that may be presented to American
Securities or any of its managers, officers, directors,
agents, stockholders, members, partners, affiliates and
subsidiaries, even if such opportunity is one that MPG
or its subsidiaries may reasonably be deemed to have
pursued or have had the desire to pursue. None of the
foregoing persons will be liable to MPG or any of its
subsidiaries for breach of any fiduciary or other duty, as
a director, officer or otherwise, by reason of the fact that
such business opportunity is not presented to MPG.

 
No equivalent provision.

FUTURE AAM STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS 

        Under applicable regulations of the SEC, any stockholder desiring to make a proposal to be acted upon at the 2017 annual meeting of
AAM stockholders must have presented such proposal to the Secretary of AAM at One Dauch Drive, Detroit, Michigan 48211-1198, not
later than November 24, 2016 (120 calendar days prior to the anniversary of the mailing date of AAM's proxy statement for the 2016 annual
meeting of stockholders), in order for the proposal to be considered for inclusion in AAM's 2017 proxy statement. Any such proposal must
also comply with SEC regulations under Rule 14a-8 with respect to the inclusion of stockholder proposals. AAM anticipates holding the
2017 Annual Meeting on May 4, 2017.

        AAM's second amended and restated by-laws provide that for a director nomination or other business to be properly brought before an
annual meeting by a stockholder, the stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to AAM's Secretary and any such
proposed business other than the nominations of persons for election to the AAM board of directors must constitute a proper matter for
stockholder action.

        To be timely, a stockholder's notice must be delivered to AAM's Secretary at AAM's principal executive offices no later than the close
of business on the 70th day or earlier than the close of business on the 90th day prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual
meeting, which dates are February 24, 2017 and February 6, 2017, respectively; provided, however, that in the event that the date of the
annual meeting is more than 20 days before or more than 70 days after such anniversary date, notice by such stockholder must be so
delivered not earlier than the close of business on the 90th day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the
later of the 70th day prior to such annual meeting or the 10th day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such
meeting is first made by AAM. The public announcement of an adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting does not commence a
new time period, or extend any time period, for the giving of a stockholder's notice as described above.

        To be in proper form, a stockholder's notice to AAM's Secretary must set forth, as to the stockholder giving the notice, the information
required pursuant to AAM's second amended and restated by-laws. AAM may also require stockholders to furnish additional information.
The requirements found in AAM's second amended and restated by-laws are separate from, and in addition to, the requirements of the SEC
that a stockholder must meet to have a proposal included in the proxy statement.

FUTURE MPG STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS 

        In light of the expected timing of the completion of the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, MPG
expects to hold its 2017 annual meeting of MPG stockholders only if the merger is not completed.

        In the event MPG holds a 2017 annual stockholders meeting, MPG's amended and restated bylaws require all stockholders who intend
to nominate persons for election to the MPG board of directors or to bring other business before an annual meeting of stockholders to give
timely notice thereof in writing to MPG's Secretary, Thomas M. Dono, Jr., at Metaldyne Performance Group Inc., One Towne Square,
Suite 550, Southfield, Michigan 48076. Such notice must include the information required by MPG's amended and restated bylaws. MPG's
amended and restated bylaws require that any such proposal or nomination be received by its Secretary at the above address not less than
the close of business 90 days or more than the close of business 120 days prior to the first anniversary of the date on which MPG held the
previous year's annual meeting of stockholders. Therefore, to be presented at the 2017 annual meeting of stockholders, such a proposal must
be received by MPG's Secretary on or after January 25, 2017 but no later than February 24, 2017 and must be submitted in accordance with
MPG's amended and restated bylaws. In the event that the date of the 2017 annual meeting of stockholders is to be held more than 30 days
before or more than 60 days after the anniversary date of the previous year's meeting, an MPG stockholder's notice must be delivered not
earlier than the close of business 120 days prior to the 2017 annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the
90th day prior to the date of the 2017 annual meeting or, if the first public announcement of the date of such annual meeting is less than
100 days prior to the date of such meeting, the 10th day following the day on which public announcement of the date of the 2017 annual
meeting is first made by MPG. However, notwithstanding the foregoing, if the number of directors to be elected to the MPG board of
directors is increased and there is no public announcement by MPG naming all of the nominees for director or indicating the increase in the
size of the board of directors at least 10 days prior to the deadline for a stockholder to timely nominate a person for election to the MPG
board of directors or bring other business before the 2017 annual meeting of stockholders, then a stockholder notice will be considered
timely, only with respect to nominees for any new positions created by such increase in the size of the MPG board of directors, if it is
received by the MPG Secretary at the foregoing address not later than the close of business on the 10th day following the date MPG first
makes such a public announcement.

        If any stockholder wishes to propose a matter for consideration at MPG's 2017 annual meeting of stockholders and have such proposal
included in MPG's proxy statement for the 2017 annual meeting of stockholders, the stockholder must have given written notice of such
stockholder's intent to MPG's Secretary on or before December 12, 2016 (120 calendar days prior to the anniversary of MPG mailing its
proxy statement for the 2016 annual meeting of stockholders). Any such proposal must also comply with SEC regulations under Rule 14a-8
with respect to the inclusion of stockholder proposals.

agent (the "Exchange Agent") for the benefit of the holders of Shares who exchange their Shares in accordance with this Article III. Parent
shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders of Shares, for exchange in accordance

shares for shares of Parent Common Stock, together with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto pursuant to Section 3.01(c), the
"Exchange Fund"). The Exchange Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions, promptly deliver the Merger Consideration out of the
Exchange Fund. The cash portion of the Exchange Fund shall be invested by the Exchange Agent as set forth in the Exchange Agreement.
Any interest or other income from such investments shall be paid to and become income of Parent. Except as contemplated by

        (b)    Exchange Procedures.     (i)    As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail

to such instructions, the holder of such Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (x) a check in the amount
equal to the cash portion of the Merger Consideration that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.04(a)
and this Article III, including any cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock such holder is entitled to
receive pursuant to Section 3.01(e) and any dividends or other distributions with respect to the Parent Common Stock such
holder is entitled to receive pursuant to Section 3.01(c), and (y) book-entry shares representing the aggregate Share
Consideration which such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.04(a)(ii) in respect of the Shares formerly
represented by such holder's Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, and the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares so surrendered
shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest shall be paid or accrued on any Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of any
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock or any dividends or other distributions, in each case, payable to holders of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares which is not registered in the transfer
records of the Company, the applicable Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to Section 3.01(e) and any dividends or other distributions with respect to the
Parent Common Stock such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to Section 3.01(c) may be issued to a transferee if the
Certificate or Book-Entry Shares representing such Shares are presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all
documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been
paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by Section 2.04(a) and this Section 3.01, each Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall
be deemed at all times after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender, without interest,
the Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock the holder of such Certificate or
Book-Entry Share is entitled to receive pursuant to Section 3.01(e) and any dividends or other distributions with respect to
the Parent Common Stock such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to Section 3.01(c).

        (c)    Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares of Parent Common Stock.    No dividends or other distributions
declared or made with a record date after the Effective Time with respect to the Parent Common Stock shall be paid to the holder of
any unsurrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Share until the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall surrender such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share in accordance with Section 3.01(b). Subject to the effect of escheat, Tax or other applicable Laws,
following surrender of any such Certificate or Book-Entry Share in accordance with Section 3.01(b), there shall be paid to the record
holder of shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, at the appropriate payment date (or, if
previously paid, promptly), the amount of any dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior
to surrender payable with respect to such shares of Parent Common Stock.

        (d)    No Further Rights in Company Common Stock.    The Merger Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this
Article III (including any cash paid pursuant to Section 3.01(c) or Section 3.01(e)) upon conversion of any Shares shall be deemed to
have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Shares.

        (e)    No Fractional Shares.    No fractional shares of Parent Common Stock or book-entry credit of the same shall be issued
upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, and such fractional share interests will not entitle the owner
thereof to vote or to any other rights of a stockholder of Parent. Each holder of a fractional share interest (after taking into account
all fractional share interests held by such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, an amount in cash (without interest, rounded down to
the nearest whole cent and subject to the amount of any withholding Taxes as contemplated in Section 3.01(i)) equal to the product
obtained by

multiplying (i) such fractional share interest to which such holder (after taking into account all fractional share interests then held by
such holder) would otherwise be entitled by (ii) the Parent Stock Price.

        (f)    Adjustments to Exchange Ratio.    The Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted to reflect appropriately the effect of any stock
split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities of a Subsidiary of Parent or the
Company or of securities convertible into Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock), extraordinary cash dividends,
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other like change with respect to Parent
Common Stock or Company Common Stock with a record date occurring on or after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time.

        (g)    Termination of Exchange Fund.    Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including proceeds of any investment thereof) that
remains undistributed to the holders of Shares on the date that is one (1) year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent or
its designee, upon demand, and any holders of Shares who have not theretofore complied with this Article III shall thereafter look
only to Parent as a general creditor for the Merger Consideration to which they are entitled pursuant to Section 2.04(a), any cash in
lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which they are entitled pursuant to Section 3.01(e) and any dividends or other
distributions with respect to the Parent Common Stock to which they are entitled pursuant to Section 3.01(c).

        (h)    No Liability.    None of the Exchange Agent, Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any holder of Shares
for any Merger Consideration from the Exchange Fund (or dividends or distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock) or other
cash delivered to a public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
remaining unclaimed by holders of Shares as of a date which is immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise
escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property
of Parent free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

        (i)    Withholding Rights.    Each of the Surviving Corporation, the Exchange Agent, Parent and Merger Sub shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from any amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement in respect of Shares such amount as it is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, the rules or regulations promulgated
thereunder, any provision of applicable state, local or foreign Tax Law or any other Law; provided, however, that if Parent
determines that any amount is required by Law to be deducted or withheld with respect to the making of such payment, or that any
Tax forms are necessary to establish that no such deduction or withholding is required, Parent shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to notify the holder of any Shares subject to deduction or withholding at least three (3) Business Days prior to any such
deduction or withholding (or as soon as practicable thereafter if Parent makes such determination within the 5-day period prior to
the Closing Date). To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the applicable Governmental Authority, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Shares in respect of which
such deduction and withholding was made.

        (j)    Lost Certificates.    If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a
bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to
such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration
with respect to the Shares formerly represented by such Certificate to which the holder thereof is entitled pursuant to
Section 2.04(a), any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which the holder thereof is entitled pursuant to
Section 3.01(e) and any dividends or other distributions with respect to the Parent Common Stock to which the holder thereof is
entitled pursuant to Section 3.01(c).

be no further registration of transfers of Shares thereafter on the records of the Company. On or after the Effective Time, any Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares presented to the Exchange Agent or Parent for any reason shall be cancelled and exchanged solely for the Merger
Consideration with respect to the Shares formerly represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares to which the holders thereof are
entitled pursuant to Section 2.04(a), any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which the holders of such Certificates

if any, subject to applicable withholding of Taxes, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the aggregate number of shares of
Company Common Stock that were issuable upon exercise of such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, by

Stock as of the trading day immediately preceding the Closing Date) less the per share exercise price of such Company Stock Option (it
being understood and agreed that such exercise price shall not actually be paid to the Company by the holder of a Company Stock Option).
For the avoidance of doubt, if the exercise price payable upon exercise of a Company Stock Option equals or exceeds the value of the

day immediately preceding the Closing Date), such Company Stock Option shall be cancelled for no consideration.

        Section 3.04    Company Restricted Stock.     Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and without any
action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any holder of Shares that are unvested or are subject to a repurchase option, risk
of forfeiture or other condition under the Company Stock Plans (a "Company Restricted Stock"), each share of Company Restricted Stock
that remains outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and terminated as of the Effective Time, and for each
share of Company Restricted Stock, a holder thereof shall be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with
Section 2.04(a) of this Agreement, subject to applicable withholding of Taxes (which shall be deducted ratably from the Cash Consideration
and the Share Consideration).

        Section 3.05    Company Restricted Stock Unit Awards.     Any restricted stock unit awards under the Company Stock Plans

Time and (ii) shall be cancelled and terminated as of the Effective Time and each holder of a Company RSU shall be paid at or promptly

cancelled Company RSU, subject to applicable withholding of Taxes (which shall be deducted ratably from the Cash Consideration and the

Section 409A of the Code and that is not permitted to be paid at or promptly after the Effective Time without triggering a Tax or penalty

        Section 3.06    Dissenting Shares.     Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary and to the extent available under the
DGCL, any Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that are held by a holder (a "Dissenting Stockholder") who has

appraisal for such Shares and otherwise properly perfected and not withdrawn or lost his, her or its rights (the "Dissenting Shares") in
accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL shall not be converted into, or represent the right to receive, the Merger Consideration. Such
Dissenting Stockholders shall be entitled to receive payment of the appraised value of Dissenting Shares held by them in accordance with
the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL, except that all Dissenting Shares held by stockholders who have failed to perfect or who
effectively have withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal of such Dissenting Shares pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL shall thereupon
be deemed to have been converted into, and represent only the right to receive, the Merger Consideration in the manner provided in
Section 2.04 and this Article III and shall no longer be Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Section 3.06, if the Merger is rescinded or abandoned, then the right of any stockholder to be paid the fair value of such stockholder's
Dissenting Shares pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL shall cease. The Company shall give Parent and Merger Sub prompt notice of any
written demands for appraisal, attempted withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to applicable Law

        (b)   Each of the consolidated financial statements (including, in each case, any notes thereto) contained (or incorporated by

by the SEC) and each fairly presents, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash
flows of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries as at the respective dates thereof and for the respective periods indicated
therein, except as otherwise noted therein (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to normal and recurring year-end

Subsidiaries in all material respects and (ii) in all material respects in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis
throughout the periods indicated (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto or, in the case of unaudited statements, as permitted
by the SEC) and each fairly presents, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash
flows of Parent and its consolidated Subsidiaries as at the respective dates thereof and for the respective periods indicated therein,
except as otherwise noted therein (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to normal and recurring year-end adjustments).

unconsolidated affiliate, on the other hand), including any structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or Person, or

purpose or effect of such contract, agreement or arrangement is to avoid disclosure of any material transaction involving, or material
liabilities of, Parent or any of its Subsidiaries in the Parent SEC Reports (including any audited financial statements and unaudited
interim financial statements of Parent included therein).

shall require a new notice to Parent as provided above, but with respect to any such subsequent notices references herein to a
"four (4) calendar day period" shall be deemed to be references to a "two (2) calendar day period"); and

        (B)  prior to effecting such Change in the Company Recommendation with respect to a Company Intervening Event,
(x) the Company has notified Parent in writing that it intends to effect such Change in the Company Recommendation,
describing in reasonable detail the reasons for such Change in the Company Recommendation, (y) if requested to do so by
Parent, for a period of four (4) calendar days following delivery of such notice, the Company shall have discussed and

listen" communication pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act or complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 under the
Exchange Act with respect to a Company Acquisition Proposal or from making any disclosure to the Company's stockholders if the
Company Board determines (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that its failure to do so would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law; provided that any Change in the Company Recommendation may only be made in
accordance with Section 7.03(e). For the avoidance of doubt, a factually accurate public statement that describes the Company's
receipt of a Company Acquisition Proposal and the operation of this Agreement with respect thereto (without including a
reaffirmation) shall not be deemed a Change in the Company Recommendation.

          (i)  "Company Acquisition Proposal" means any proposal or offer from any Person or group (other than Parent or
Merger Sub) relating to, in a single transaction or series of related transactions, (A) any direct or indirect acquisition of
(x) more than 20% of the consolidated assets (whether based on the fair market value, revenue generation or net income) of
the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, including in any such case through the acquisition of one or more
Subsidiaries of the Company owning such assets, or (y) more than 20% of any class of equity securities, or securities
convertible into or exchangeable for equity securities, of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; (B) any tender offer or
exchange offer, as defined pursuant to the Exchange Act, that if consummated would result, directly or indirectly, in any

(C) any merger, consolidation, business combination, share exchange, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or other

set forth in Rule 13d-3 of the Exchange Act.

         (ii)  "Company Superior Proposal" means any bona fide written Company Acquisition Proposal (with all references to
20% in the definition of Company Acquisition Proposal being treated as references to 50% for purposes of this definition)
made by any Person or group (other than Parent or any of its Subsidiaries) after the date of this Agreement, which Company
Acquisition Proposal did not result from a breach (or deemed breach pursuant to Section 7.03(h)) of this Section 7.03, that
(A) is on terms that the Company Board determines in good faith (after receiving the advice of its financial advisor and
outside legal counsel and after taking into account all the terms and conditions of the Company Acquisition Proposal) are
more favorable to the Company's stockholders from a financial point of view than the Merger and the transactions
contemplated thereby (taking into account any proposed amendment or modification proposed by Parent pursuant to
Section 7.03(e)(A)) and (B) the Company Board determines (after receiving the advice of its financial advisor and outside
legal counsel) is reasonably capable of being consummated in accordance with its terms, taking into account all financial,
regulatory, legal, timing and other aspects (including certainty of closing, certainty of financing and the identity of the
Person making the Company Acquisition Proposal) of such proposal.

        (h)   It is understood that for all purposes of this Agreement, in the event that any Representative of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries takes any action which, if taken by the Company, would constitute a breach of this Section 7.03, such action shall be
deemed to be a breach of this Section 7.03 by the Company.

        Section 7.04    No Solicitation of Transactions by Parent.     (a)    Parent shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and shall instruct (and
use its reasonable best efforts to cause) the Representatives of Parent to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any solicitation,
discussions, communications or negotiations with any Person that may be ongoing with respect to a Parent Acquisition Proposal, or any
inquiry, proposal or offer that would reasonably be expected to lead to a Parent Acquisition Proposal, and shall request within two
(2) Business Days of the date of this Agreement (and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause) the prompt return or destruction of all
confidential information previously furnished to any Person in connection therewith and immediately terminate all physical and electronic
dataroom access previously granted to any such Person, its Affiliates or Representatives. Parent shall not, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries not to, terminate, waive, amend or modify any provision of any existing standstill or confidentiality agreement to which it or
any of its Subsidiaries is a party, and Parent shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, enforce the provisions of any such agreement;
provided, however, that Parent may grant a waiver of, and shall not be obligated to enforce, any such provision (i) to the extent required to
permit a party to submit a Parent Acquisition Proposal and (ii) if the Parent Board (or any committee thereof) has determined in good faith,
after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to grant such waiver would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law. Parent represents and warrants that as of the date of this Agreement: (x) neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries or
Representatives are currently engaged in any discussions, communications or negotiations with respect to any Parent Acquisition Proposal,
(y) no Person has indicated to Parent that it is considering making a proposal that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to constitute,
a Parent Acquisition Proposal and (z) no Person has entered into, or is in discussions or negotiations with respect to, a confidentiality or
similar agreement in connection with any Parent Acquisition Proposal.

(ii) engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions, communications or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any

existence of this Section 7.04(b), or (iii) execute or enter into any Acquisition Agreement; provided that, notwithstanding the
foregoing, Parent may grant a waiver, amendment or release under any confidentiality or standstill agreement, solely to the extent
necessary to allow a confidential Parent Acquisition Proposal to be made to Parent or the Parent Board (or any committee thereof)
so long as (x) the Parent Board has determined in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that the failure to grant
such waiver would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law and (y) Parent promptly (and, in any event, within
24 hours) notifies the Company of any such waiver, amendment or release; provided, however, that, prior to the receipt of the Parent
Stockholder Approval, nothing contained in this Section 7.04 shall prevent Parent or the Parent Board (or any committee thereof)
from furnishing information to, or engaging in discussions, communications or negotiations with, any Person that made a bona fide
Parent Acquisition Proposal, which Parent Acquisition Proposal did not result from a breach (or deemed breach in accordance with
Section 7.04(h)) of this Section 7.04, if, and only if, prior to taking such action referred to in clause (ii) above, (A) the Parent Board
(1) determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside advisors) that such Parent Acquisition Proposal is, or would
reasonably be expected to result in, a Parent Superior Proposal, and (2) determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside
legal counsel) that its failure to take such actions would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, (B) Parent
provides written notice to the Company of the determination referenced in clause (A) promptly (and, in any event, within 24 hours
of such determination), and (C) Parent receives from such Person an executed Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement. Parent shall
deliver to the Company a copy of any executed Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement promptly (and, in any event, within 24 hours)
following its execution. Parent shall provide to the Company any non-public information concerning Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries provided by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to any Person entering into an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement
pursuant to this Section 7.04(b) that has not been previously provided to Parent prior to or substantially concurrently with the time it
is provided to such Person.

Parent Acquisition Proposal or (B) subject to sub-clause (ii) below, any inquiries, proposals or offers received by Parent, any of its
Subsidiaries or any Representatives of Parent concerning a Parent Acquisition Proposal and (ii) disclose to the Company the identity

reasonably believes that such oral Parent Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, offer, proposal or request is likely to result in such Person
making a Parent Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, offer, proposal or request in writing, a reasonably detailed description of such Parent
Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, offer, proposal or request). Parent shall, promptly upon receipt or delivery thereof (and, in any event,

        (b)   Except as otherwise prohibited by applicable Law or the terms of any contract or agreement to which Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries is subject (provided that Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to promptly obtain any consent required
under such contract or agreement in order that it may comply with the terms of this Section 7.05(b)), from the date of this
Agreement until the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, (i) provide to the Company and the Company's
Representatives access at reasonable times during normal business hours upon prior notice to the officers, employees, agents,
properties, offices and other facilities of Parent and its Subsidiaries and to the books and records thereof (so long as such access
does not unreasonably interfere with the operations of Parent); and (ii) furnish promptly to the Company such information
concerning the business, properties, contracts, assets, liabilities, personnel and other aspects of Parent and its Subsidiaries as the
Company or its Representatives may reasonably request; provided, however, that Parent shall not be required to provide access to or
disclose any information if such access or disclosure would jeopardize any attorney-client privilege of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries or violate any contract, Law or Order (provided that Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause such
information to be provided in a manner that would not result in such jeopardy or violation).

        (c)   All information obtained by the parties pursuant to this Section 7.05 shall be kept confidential in accordance with the

Subsidiaries to honor in accordance with their terms, all contracts, agreements and plans of the Company and its Subsidiaries as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time that are applicable to any current or former employees or directors of the Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company. For one (1) year following the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries
to provide each Service Provider of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that continues to provide services to the Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or their respective Subsidiaries immediately following the Effective Time ("Continuing Service Providers") with base salary
or wages, incentive compensation opportunities and severance benefits at least equal to the base salary or wages, incentive compensation
opportunities and severance benefits provided to such Continuing Service Provider immediately prior to the Effective Time and with
employee benefits that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to the employee benefits provided to such Continuing Service Provider
immediately prior to the Effective Time. Employees of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company shall receive credit for purposes of
eligibility to participate and vesting (but not for benefit accruals) under any employee benefit plan, program or arrangement established or
maintained by the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries for service accrued or deemed accrued prior to the Effective Time with
the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company; provided, however, that such crediting of service shall not operate to duplicate any benefit
or the funding of any such benefit. In addition, Parent shall waive, or cause to be waived, any limitations on benefits relating to any pre-
existing conditions to the extent such conditions are covered immediately prior to the Effective Time under the applicable Company Plans
and to the same extent such limitations are waived under any comparable plan of Parent or its Subsidiaries and use reasonable best efforts to
recognize, for purposes of annual deductible and out-of-pocket limits under its medical and dental plans, deductible and out-of-pocket
expenses paid by employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries in the calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs. Nothing
contained in this Section 7.06 shall be construed as limiting the ability of Parent or the Surviving Corporation to amend or terminate any
Company Plan so long as such amendment or termination is effected in accordance with the terms of such Company Plan.

        Section 7.07    Directors' and Officers' Indemnification and Insurance.     (a)     Parent agrees that all rights to indemnification,
advancement or reimbursement of expenses and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time
now existing in favor of the current or former directors, officers or employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries as provided in their
respective certificates of incorporation or bylaws (or equivalent organizational documents) and any indemnification or other similar
agreements of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, in each case as in effect on the date of this Agreement and which the Company has
furnished to Parent prior to the date of this Agreement, shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms. The certificate
of incorporation and bylaws or other equivalent organizational documents of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries (to the extent
the Company has furnished such organizational documents to Parent prior to the date of this Agreement) shall contain provisions no less
favorable with respect to indemnification, advancement and reimbursement of expenses and exculpation from liabilities with respect to facts
or circumstances occurring at or prior to the Effective Time than are set forth in the certificate of incorporation and bylaws or equivalent
organizational documents of the Company and its Subsidiaries (to the extent the Company has furnished such organizational documents to
Parent prior to the date of this Agreement) as in effect on the date of this Agreement, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time in any manner that would affect adversely the rights thereunder of
individuals who, at or prior to the Effective Time, were directors, officers, employees, fiduciaries or agents of the Company, unless such
modification shall be required by Law. From and after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law (including to the
fullest extent authorized or permitted by any amendments to or replacements of the DGCL adopted after the date of this Agreement that
increase the extent to which a corporation may indemnify its officers and directors), the Surviving Corporation agrees that it will indemnify
and hold harmless each individual who is, as of the date of this Agreement, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director or officer
of the Company or who is as of the date of this Agreement, or who thereafter commences prior to the Effective Time, serving at the request
of the Company as a director or officer of another Person, against all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, judgments, inquiries, fines,
amounts paid in settlement and fees, costs and expenses, including attorneys' fees and disbursements incurred in connection with any actual
or threatened Action, whether civil, criminal, administrative, regulatory or investigative (including with respect to matters existing or
occurring or alleged to occur at or prior to the Effective Time (including this Agreement and the transactions and actions contemplated
hereby)), arising out of or pertaining to the fact that such individual is or was an officer or director of the Company or is or was serving at
the request of the Company as a director or officer of another Person, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time. In
the event of any such Action, (x) each such individual will be entitled to advancement of expenses incurred in the defense of any such
Action in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation and (y) the Surviving Corporation shall
reasonably cooperate in the defense of any such matter.

        (b)   The Company shall, in consultation with Parent, purchase a "tail" policy, which (i) has an effective term of six (6) years
from the Effective Time (and provides coverage until such later date as of which any Action commenced during such six (6) year
period shall have been finally disposed of), (ii) covers each Person covered by the Company's directors' and officers' insurance
and/or fiduciary liability insurance policy in effect on the date of this Agreement or at the Effective Time for actions and omissions
occurring prior to the Effective Time, and (iii) provides coverage in an amount not less than the Company's existing coverage and
contains other terms and conditions that are no less favorable to the Persons covered by such policies maintained by the Company
than those of the Company's directors' and officers' insurance and/or fiduciary liability insurance policy in effect on the date of this
Agreement with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the Effective Time; provided, however, that
the amount paid by the Company in respect of any one policy year shall not be in excess of 300% of the annual premiums currently

paid by the Company for such insurance. The Surviving Corporation shall maintain such policies in full force and effect, for their
full respective terms, and continue to honor its respective obligations thereunder.

        (c)   In the event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with
or merges into any other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or
(ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, in each case, proper provision shall be made so
that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in
this Section 7.07.

        (d)   The provisions of this Section 7.07 (i) shall survive consummation of the Merger, (ii) are intended to be for the benefit of,
and will be enforceable by, each indemnified or insured party, his or her heirs and his or her Representatives, and (iii) are in addition
to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have by contract or
otherwise.

        Section 7.08    Notification of Certain Matters.     (a)    The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt
notice to the Company, of (i) the occurrence, or non-occurrence, of any event which would reasonably be expected to cause, in the case of
the Company, any condition set forth in Section 8.02 not to be satisfied, or in the case of Parent, any condition set forth in Section 8.03 not
to be satisfied, at any time from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time and (ii) any failure of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub,
as the case may be, to materially comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under
this Agreement; provided, however, that the delivery of any notice or the failure to provide such notice pursuant to this Section 7.08 shall
not (A) limit or otherwise affect the respective rights, obligations, representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties or the
conditions to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement, or (B) be deemed to amend or supplement the Company Disclosure
Schedule or the Parent Disclosure Schedule or constitute an exception to any representation or warranty.

        (b)   The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, of (i) any notice or
other communication from any Governmental Authority or the NYSE (or any other securities market) in connection with the
Transactions or from any Person alleging in writing that the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
Transactions and (ii) any Action commenced or, to its knowledge, threatened in writing, relating to or involving or otherwise
affecting it or any of its Subsidiaries, in each case, which relates to the consummation of the Transactions.

        Section 7.09    Reasonable Best Efforts; Further Action.     (a)    Each party hereto shall use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to
be taken, all appropriate action, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law or otherwise
to consummate and make effective the Transactions, including (i) using reasonable best efforts to obtain, or cause to be obtained, all
permits, consents, approvals, authorizations, qualifications and Orders of all Governmental Authorities and officials that may be or become
necessary for the performance of the obligations of such party hereto pursuant to this Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions,
(ii) cooperating fully with the other parties in promptly seeking to obtain all such permits, consents, approvals, authorizations, qualifications
and Orders, (iii) providing such other information to any Governmental Authority as such Governmental Authority may lawfully request in
connection herewith, and (iv) using reasonable best efforts to obtain such other consents, approvals or waivers from third parties that are
(A) necessary to consummate the Transactions or (B) as otherwise reasonably determined by Parent and the Company after the date of this
Agreement; provided that neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall pay any consideration or make any agreements or

provided further that Parent and the Company acknowledge that, other than those consents, approvals, non-disapprovals, orders and other
authorizations of any Governmental Authority set forth on Section 8.01(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule and/or Section 8.01(d) of
the Parent Disclosure Schedule, or that are otherwise expressly contemplated by Article VIII, no consents, approvals or waivers from any
Person shall be a condition to the obligations of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger. Upon the terms and
subject to the conditions of this Agreement each party hereto agrees to make an appropriate filing, if necessary, pursuant to the HSR Act as
promptly as reasonably practicable, but in any event no later than ten Business Days following the date of this Agreement, and to supply as
promptly as reasonably practicable to the appropriate Governmental Authorities any additional information and documentary material that
may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act. Each party hereto agrees to make as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date of this
Agreement its respective filings and notifications, if any, under any other applicable foreign, federal or state antitrust, competition or fair
trade Laws, and to supply as promptly as reasonably practicable to the appropriate Governmental Authorities any additional information
and documentary material that may be requested pursuant to such Laws. Each party will promptly notify the other of any notice from any
Person or Governmental Authority alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the Transactions.

        (b)   Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in no event will Parent or Merger Sub be obligated to take
any action, including entering into any consent decree, hold separate orders or other arrangements, that (i) requires the divestiture of
any assets of any of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries, (ii) limits Parent's freedom of action
with respect to, or its ability to retain, the Company and its Subsidiaries or any portion thereof or any of Parent's or its Affiliates'
other assets or businesses, or (iii) in Parent's reasonable judgment, would be expected to have a material adverse impact on any of its
businesses, or the businesses to be acquired by it pursuant to this Agreement, either individually or in the aggregate; provided,
however, that, if necessary to obtain any consent, approval, non-disapproval, order and other authorization of any Governmental
Authority set forth on Section 8.01(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule or Section 8.01(d) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule,
Parent shall agree to propose, negotiate, offer to commit and effect (and if such offer is accepted, commit to and effect), by consent
decree, hold separate order, or otherwise, the sale, divestiture, disposition of, or any limitation on, the assets or businesses or
products or product lines of the Company and its Subsidiaries that, individually or in the aggregate, generated total worldwide
revenues of up to $150,000,000 for the twelve (12) month period ended September 30, 2016. If requested by Parent, the Company
will agree to and take any action contemplated by this Section 7.09(b), provided that the effectiveness of such action is conditioned
upon the Closing.

        (c)   Subject to Section 7.09(b), each of the parties hereto agrees to cooperate and use reasonable best efforts to contest and
resist any Action, including any administrative or judicial Action, and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any Order
(whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that is in effect and that restricts, prevents or prohibits consummation of the
Transactions, including by pursuing all available avenues of administrative and judicial appeal. Parent shall be entitled to direct, in
consultation with the Company, the defense of the Transactions in any antitrust investigation or litigation by, or negotiations with,
any Governmental Authority or other Person relating to the Merger or regulatory filings under applicable Law.

        (d)   Each party shall promptly notify the others of any material communication it receives from any Governmental Authority
relating to any filings, or submissions under the HSR Act or other applicable foreign, federal or state antitrust, competition or fair
trade Laws. The Company agrees to provide promptly to Parent and Merger Sub all necessary information and assistance as any
Governmental Authority may from time to time require in connection with the obtaining of

reasonable assistance and cooperation to allow Parent and Merger Sub to prepare and submit any filings, or submissions under the
HSR Act or other applicable foreign, federal or state antitrust, competition or fair trade Laws, including providing to Parent and
Merger Sub any information that Parent and Merger Sub may from time to time require for the purpose of any filing, notification,
application or request for further information made in respect of any such filing. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, Parent, after prior consultation with the Company, shall have the principal responsibility for devising and
implementing the strategy for obtaining any necessary antitrust, competition or investment review clearances, and shall take the lead
in all meetings and communications with any Governmental Authority in connection with obtaining any necessary antitrust,
competition or investment review clearances. Neither Parent nor Company shall agree to participate in any substantive meeting,
telephone call or discussion with any Governmental Authority in respect of any filings, investigation (including any settlement of an
investigation), or other inquiry related to the Transactions unless it consults with the other party in advance and, unless prohibited by
such Governmental Authority, gives the other party the opportunity to attend and participate at such meeting, telephone call or
discussion.

shall cooperate with Parent with respect to such listing.

        Section 7.12    Takeover Laws.     If any "fair price," "moratorium," "control share acquisition," "interested stockholder" or other anti-
takeover Law (including Section 203 of the DGCL) becomes or is deemed to be applicable to this Agreement or the Transactions, then each
of the parties hereto and their respective Board of Directors shall grant such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that the
transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to
render such Law or Laws inapplicable to the foregoing.

        Section 7.13    Stockholder Litigation.     The Company shall give Parent reasonable opportunity to participate in the defense (at
Parent's sole cost and subject to a joint defense agreement) of any Action brought by the Company's stockholders against the Company or
any of its directors, officers, Affiliates or Representatives arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Transactions or by any other
Person seeking to enjoin or otherwise prohibit or make illegal the consummation of the Transactions, in each case, whether commenced
prior to or after the date of this Agreement. Without limiting the preceding sentence, the Company shall give Parent the right to review and
comment on all material filings or responses to be made by the Company in connection with any such Action, and the right to consult on the
settlement with respect to such Action, and the Company will in good faith take such comments into account, and, no such settlement shall
be agreed to without Parent's prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). The Company shall promptly
notify Parent of any such Action and shall keep Parent reasonably and promptly informed with respect to the status thereof.

extent (A) replacement commitments for indebtedness to be incurred by Parent after the date hereof are then made available in order to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (B) the representations set forth in Section 5.24(a) would be true after
giving effect to such reduction; provided that the terms and conditions of such replacement commitments (including with respect to
conditionality) shall be no less favorable, in the aggregate, to Parent than those contained in the Commitment Letter; or (ii) impose new,
additional or more expansive conditions precedent, or otherwise amend, modify or expand any conditions precedent, to the receipt of the
Financing, in each case, in a manner that would reasonably be expected to (x) materially delay or prevent the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; or (y) adversely impact in any material respect the ability of Parent to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or enforce its rights under the Commitment Letter; provided, however, that Parent may amend
the Commitment Letter without the prior written consent of the Company to add additional financing sources, lenders, lead arrangers,
bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities. References in this Agreement to the Financing shall include the financing contemplated
by the Commitment Letter as amended or modified in compliance with this Section 7.19 and references to the Commitment Letter shall

        (b)   Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in effect the Commitment Letter until the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, other than any reduction in the amount of the Financing available under the
Commitment Letter through the issuance of securities in lieu of the bridge facility contemplated by the Commitment Letter;
(ii) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions within the control of Parent to obtaining the Financing, including delivery of all
information required by items 4 and 10 of Exhibit C of the Commitment Letter, and (iii) negotiate and enter into definitive
agreements with respect to the Financing ("Financing Agreements") on the terms and conditions contained in the Commitment
Letter (including any "market flex" provisions related thereto). Parent shall keep the Company reasonably informed with respect to
all material activity concerning the status of the Financing and shall give the Company notice of any material change with respect to
such Financing as promptly as practicable. Parent shall give the Company reasonably prompt notice of (A) any material breach by
any party to the Commitment Letter of which Parent becomes aware to the extent such breach would reasonably be expected to
impair or materially delay the Closing or result in insufficient financing to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; and (B) any termination of the Commitment Letter (or the Financing Documents) or the receipt of any notice of
termination, breach or default under the Commitment Letter (or the Financing Documents). In the event that all conditions in the
Commitment Letter have been satisfied or, upon funding will be satisfied, and Parent is otherwise required under the terms of this
Agreement to consummate the Merger, Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to (1) consummate the Financing and (2) enforce its
rights under the Commitment Letter (or the Financing Documents); provided that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
Parent shall have no obligation hereunder to threaten or initiate any Action against any of the Financing Sources or any other party
to the Commitment Letter or to the Financing Agreements. If any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and
conditions contemplated in the Commitment Letter, Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain alternative debt
financing from alternative sources in an amount sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the
"Alternative Financing"); provided that the terms and conditions of such Alternative Financing (including with respect to
conditionality, structure, covenants and pricing) shall be no less favorable, in the aggregate, to Parent than those contained in the
Commitment Letter. For the purposes of this Agreement, (x) the term "Commitment Letter" shall be deemed to include any
commitment letter or similar agreement with respect to any Alternative Financing arranged in compliance with this Section 7.19

Section 9.02(c), prior to the Closing, except in the case of fraud or intentional breach, the sole and exclusive remedies of the Parent
Related Parties against the Company Related Parties for any losses, damages, liabilities, costs, expenses, claims, obligations or

        (d)   Parent agrees that if Parent or the Company shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.01(b)(iii)(B) or
Section 9.01(d)(i), Parent shall reimburse the Company for all of its Expenses, up to a maximum of $15,000,000, in the aggregate
(not later than two Business Days after submission by the Company of statements therefor). In the event the Company becomes
entitled to receive a Termination Fee, Parent Termination Fee or Enhanced Termination Fee, as applicable, pursuant to
Section 9.03(c) after the payment to the Company of any Expenses under this Section 9.03(d), the amount of the Termination Fee,
Parent Termination Fee or Enhanced Termination Fee payable shall be reduced by any Expenses previously reimbursed pursuant to
the preceding sentence.

        (e)   Except as set forth in this Section 9.03 and Section 7.19, all Expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
Transactions shall be paid by the party incurring such Expenses, whether or not the Merger or any other Transaction is
consummated, except that the Company and Parent shall each pay one-half of all Expenses relating to printing, filing and mailing
the Registration Statement and the Joint Proxy Statement and all SEC and other regulatory filing fees incurred in connection with
the Registration Statement and the Joint Proxy Statement. Parent shall be responsible for paying the filing fee for the Notification

competition or fair trade Laws.

        (f)    The Company and Parent acknowledge that the agreements contained in this Section 9.03 are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In the event that the Company or Parent shall fail to pay the Termination Fee, Parent
Termination Fee or Enhanced Termination Fee, as applicable, or the Company or Parent shall fail to pay any Expenses when due,
the term "Expenses" shall be deemed to include the costs and expenses actually incurred or accrued by Parent and Merger Sub or the
Company, as the case may be (including fees and expenses of counsel) in connection with the collection under and enforcement of
this Section 9.03, together with interest on such unpaid Termination Fee, Parent Termination Fee or Enhanced Termination Fee, as
applicable, and Expenses, commencing on the date that the Termination Fee, Parent Termination Fee or Enhanced Termination Fee,
as applicable, or such Expenses became due, at a rate of interest equal to the prime lending rate as published in the Wall Street
Journal in effect on the date such payment was required to be made. Payment of the fees and expenses described in this Section 9.03
shall not be in lieu of any damages incurred in the event of fraud or intentional breach of this Agreement. For the avoidance of
doubt, in the event this Agreement is terminated by a party for any reason at a time when the other party would have had the right to
terminate this Agreement, such other party shall be entitled to receipt of any Expenses and/or Termination Fee, Parent Termination
Fee or Enhanced Termination Fee (or portion thereof), as applicable, that would have been (or would have subsequently become)
payable had such other party terminated this Agreement at such time. In no event shall the Company or Parent be required to pay the
Termination Fee, Parent Termination Fee or Enhanced Termination Fee, as applicable, or any Expenses in connection with the
termination of this Agreement more than once.

        (g)   The payment by the Company to Parent or its designees of the Termination Fee and any Expenses pursuant to this

Termination Fee and Expenses are owed to Parent, be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent for any loss suffered by Parent or
Merger Sub as a result of the failure of the Transactions to be consummated to the extent paid and upon such payment in accordance

Company, be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Company for any loss suffered by the Company as a result of the failure of the

        (h)   In the event (i) (A) Parent is unable to obtain the Financing, after having complied in all material respects with its
obligations under Section 7.19, (B) the Registration Statement is not declared effective by the SEC, after Parent shall have complied
in all material respects with its obligations under Section 7.01 and applicable Law or (C) the Joint Proxy Statement is not declared
effective by the SEC, after Parent shall have complied in all material respects with its obligations under Section 7.01 and applicable
Law, (ii) in each case, the cause of the foregoing is the failure by an auditor of the Company to provide, with respect to any
historical financial statements of the Company required in connection with the Financing as contemplated by Section 7.19 or
required to be included in the Registration Statement or Joint Proxy Statement as required by Section 7.01 and applicable Law, any
consents to the inclusion of any such historical financial statements of the Company or any audit opinions in respect thereof by such
auditor in the Registration Statement, the Joint Proxy Statement or any prospectus or offering memorandum or similar documents

Financing as required by Section 7.19, in all cases of this clause (ii), as a result of the matters contemplated in Section 7.16 of the
Company Disclosure Schedule and (iii) this Agreement is terminated (other than a termination pursuant to (1) Section 9.01(b)(i) in
circumstances where the conditions set forth in Section 8.01(c) (to the extent such Restraint arises under the HSR Act or other
applicable foreign, federal or state antitrust, competition or fair trade Laws as specified on Section 8.01(d) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule or Section 8.01(d) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule) or Section 8.01(d) have not been satisfied or

Termination Fee or the Enhanced Termination Fee pursuant to this Section 9.03, then, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, including other subsections of this Section 9.03, in each case, Parent shall have no obligation to pay such
Termination Fee or Enhanced Termination Fee and the parties shall have no further rights or obligations under this Agreement,
except as set forth in Section 9.02.

        Section 9.04    Amendment.     This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto by action taken by or on behalf of their respective
Boards of Directors at any time prior to the Effective Time; provided, however, that, after either the Company Stockholder Approval or the
Parent Stockholder Approval has been obtained, no amendment may be made that would reduce the amount or change the type of
consideration into which each Share shall be converted upon consummation of the Merger or that would otherwise require the approval of
the stockholders of the Company or the stockholders of Parent, as applicable, under applicable Law or in accordance with the rules of any
relevant stock exchange, without such approval having been obtained. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in
writing signed by each of the parties hereto. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Section 9.02, this Section 9.04,
Section 10.07, Section 10.08, Section 10.10 and Section 10.11 may not be amended, supplemented, waived or otherwise modified in a

the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns, and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or
shall confer upon any other Person any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement; provided
that the Financing Sources shall be express third party beneficiaries with respect to Section 9.02, Section 9.04, this Section 10.07,

this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. Each party agrees that, in
the event of any breach or threatened breach by any other party of any covenant or obligation contained in this Agreement, the non-
breaching party shall be entitled (in addition to any other remedy that may be available to it whether in law or equity, including
monetary damages, except as limited by Section 9.03) to (a) an Order of specific performance to enforce the observance and
performance of such covenant or obligation, and (b) an injunction restraining such breach or threatened breach. Each party further
agrees that no other party or any other Person shall be required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar instrument in
connection with or as a condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in this Section 10.08, and each party irrevocably waives any
right it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar instrument.

and agree that the Company shall be entitled to specific performance to cause Parent or Merger Sub to cause the Financing to be
funded and to take all other required actions to effect the Closing only if (i) all of the conditions to the Closing set forth in
Section 8.01 and Section 8.02 have been satisfied (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing),
(ii) the Company has confirmed in an irrevocable written notice to Parent that the conditions set forth in Section 8.01 and
Section 8.03 have been satisfied or, to the extent allowed by applicable Law, waived by the Company, and that it is ready, willing
and able to perform its obligations to effect the Closing, (iii) there has not been a Financing Failure and (iv) Parent and Merger Sub
fail to fulfill their obligation to effect the Closing within three (3) Business Days of the written notice of the Company pursuant to
the preceding clause (ii), it being understood that in no event shall the Company or any of its Affiliates be entitled to seek the
remedy of specific performance of this Agreement against the Financing Sources.

        Section 10.09    Governing Law.     This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of
Delaware, without giving effect to any applicable principles of conflict of laws that would cause the Laws of another State to otherwise
govern this Agreement. The parties hereto agree that any Action seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any matter arising out of
or in connection with, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (whether brought by any party or any of its Affiliates or
against any party or any of its Affiliates) shall be heard and determined exclusively in the Delaware Court of Chancery; provided, however,

ARTICLE II
REGISTRATION RIGHTS 

        Section 2.1    Demand Registration.     

        (a)   At any time following the Restricted Period, the Shareholder may, by providing written notice (a "Demand Registration
Request") to the Company, request to sell all or a portion of the Registrable Securities Beneficially Owned by the Shareholder
pursuant to a Registration Statement in the manner specified in such notice, provided that the aggregate market value of such
Registrable Securities so requested to be sold, as measured by the market price of such Registrable Securities on the date of the
Demand Registration Request, shall not be less than $100 million (a "Demand Registration"). Each Demand Registration Request
shall specify the number of Registrable Securities intended to be offered and sold pursuant to the Demand Registration and the
intended method of disposition thereof, including whether the registration requested is for an underwritten offering. A Demand
Registration shall be effected by way of a Registration Statement on Form S-3 or any similar short-form registration to the extent the
Company is permitted to use such form at such time (or to the extent the Company is not permitted to use such form, on Form S-1 or
a similar long-form registration). The Company may, after consultation with the Shareholder, comply with a Demand Registration
Request by, at the Company's option, (x) filing a Registration Statement (including a Shelf Registration Statement) which will be
used to offer the Registrable Securities and/or (y) providing a prospectus supplement for an already effective Registration Statement.
If the Company is then ASR Eligible, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Registration Statement
to be an ASRS containing a Prospectus naming the Shareholder as the selling shareholder and registering the offering and sale of the
Registrable Securities by the Shareholder on a delayed or continuous basis pursuant to Rule 415 (an "ASRS Resale Shelf
Registration Statement"). The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause any Registration Statement (or
prospectus supplement, as applicable) relating to a Demand Registration (xx) to be filed with the SEC as promptly as reasonably
practicable following the receipt of the Demand Registration Request, and in no event more than twenty (20) Business Days after
receipt of a Demand Registration Request (or such longer period agreed to by the Shareholder), (yy) to be declared effective by the
SEC or otherwise become effective under the Securities Act as promptly as reasonably practicable after the filing thereof and (zz) to
remain continuously effective during the Effectiveness Period.

        (b)   The Shareholder shall have the right to request up to a total of two (2) Demand Registrations in any twelve (12)-month
period pursuant to this Section 2.1; provided, that such obligation shall be deemed satisfied (and such request shall count as one
Demand Registration Request for the Shareholder) only when a Registration Statement shall have become effective and (x) if the
method of disposition thereof is a firm commitment Public Offering, at least 50% of such Registrable Securities requested to be
sold, after giving effect to any Underwriter Cutback (described in Section 2.1(e)), shall have been sold pursuant thereto, and (y) in
any other case, such Registration Statement shall have remained effective for the Effectiveness Period. The Shareholder may revoke
a request for a Demand Registration by notifying the Company prior to the effective date of the applicable Registration Statement or
the filing of any prospectus supplement with respect to any particular underwritten offering; provided that such request shall count
as one of the Shareholder's requests for a Demand Registration unless the Shareholder (i) provides such notice of revocation
(A) except with respect to Underwritten Block Trades, within three (3) Business Days after requesting such Demand Registration, or
(B) pursuant to Section 2.4(c) as a result of a

Notice of Suspension, or (ii) reimburses the Company for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses (including
Registration Expenses) actually incurred by the Company relating to such Demand Registration.

        (c)   The Company shall (i) prepare, (ii) file with the SEC and (iii) use commercially reasonable efforts to have effective
starting one hundred eighty (180) days from the date of this Agreement, a Shelf Registration Statement on Form S-3 or such other
form as the Company is then eligible to use (such Shelf Registration Statement shall be an ASRS to the extent that the Company is
then ASR Eligible) (or, at its option, after consultation with the Shareholder, provide a prospectus supplement for an already
effective Shelf Registration Statement) with respect to the registration under the Securities Act of the resale of up to [            ]1
Shares (the "Transaction Shelf Registration Statement") (such Transaction Shelf Registration Statement shall include a prospectus
sufficient to permit the resale of all such Shares by the Shareholder). The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
keep the Transaction Shelf Registration Statement continuously effective for the Effectiveness Period, including by filing
subsequent registration statements, if necessary, subject to the Securities Act and the provisions of Section 2.4. For a period of two
(2) years following the Closing Date, any Shares which have been registered on the Transaction Shelf Registration Statement may
be included in any underwritten offering conducted by the Company upon the proper exercise of a demand or piggyback right
hereunder pursuant to and in accordance with Section 2.1 or Section 2.2, as applicable, subject to compliance with the notice and
cutback procedures contained herein.

        (d)   If a Demand Registration is a Public Offering, the Shareholder shall have the right to select the investment banking firm(s)
to act as the managing underwriter(s) (subject to the consent of the Company, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed)
and counsel for the Shareholder in connection with such offering (including in any underwritten offering under a Shelf Registration
Statement or any Underwritten Block Trade).

        (e)   For the first two (2) years following the date of this Agreement, in no event shall any Person (other than the Company with
respect to a primary offering of its equity securities) be entitled to include any equity securities of the Company in any offering
requested pursuant to this Section 2.1 without the prior written consent of the Shareholder, such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld after consultation with its advisors. In the event the managing underwriter shall be of the opinion that the number of such
securities, when taken together with the Registrable Securities requested to be included in a Public Offering pursuant to a Demand
Registration Request, alone or taken together with the equity securities of the Company to be included therein, would adversely
affect the marketing of such offering (including the price at which the securities of the Company may be sold), then the number of
securities of the Company to be included in such underwritten offering will be reduced (an "Underwriter Cutback"), with the
securities of the Company to be included in such offering based on the following priority: (x) first, the number of Shares requested
to be included on behalf of the Shareholder up to the number that, in the opinion of the managing underwriter, would not adversely
affect the marketing of the offering (including the price at which the Shares may be sold); and (y) second, in addition to the Shares
included pursuant to the preceding clause (x), the number of the equity securities of the Company elected to be included by the
Company (whether for the Company's own account or for the account of any other holder of equity security of the Company
consented by the Shareholder to participate in the offering) up to the number that, in the opinion of the managing underwriter, would
not adversely affect the marketing of the offering (including the price at which the securities of the Company (including the Shares)
may be sold).

   

1 Note to Draft: The Transaction Shelf Registration Statement will include the Shares issued at Closing.

        (f)    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article II, but subject to Section 2.4, if the Shareholder wishes to effect a
Demand Registration through an underwritten block trade or similar transaction or other transaction with a one-day or less
marketing period, including overnight bought deals (collectively, an "Underwritten Block Trade"), pursuant to a Shelf Registration
Statement (either through filing an ASRS or through a take-down from an already effective Shelf Registration Statement), then
notwithstanding any other time periods in this Article II, the Shareholder shall notify the Company of the Underwritten Block Trade
five (5) Business Days prior to the date such Underwritten Block Trade is to commence. As expeditiously as possible, the Company
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to facilitate such Underwritten Block Trade (which may price as early as five
(5) Business Days after the date it commences). The Shareholder shall use commercially reasonable efforts to work with the
Company and the underwriters prior to making such request (including by disclosing the maximum number of Shares proposed to
be the subject of such Underwritten Block Trade) in order to facilitate preparation of the Registration Statement (including filing of
an ASRS), Prospectus and other offering documentation related to the Underwritten Block Trade and any related due diligence and
comfort procedures.

        (g)   Notwithstanding anything else in this agreement, the Company shall have no obligation to facilitate a Public Offering of
Registrable Securities initiated by the Shareholder except pursuant to, and subject to the limitations contained in, this Section 2.1,
Section 2.2, and in accordance with Section 2.6.

        (h)   The Company hereby represents that, as of the date hereof, it is a "well-known seasoned issuer" (having the meaning given
thereto pursuant to Rule 405 promulgated under the Securities Act) and eligible to use Form S-3.

        Section 2.2    Piggyback Registration.     

        (a)   If the Company at any time following the Closing Date proposes to file a registration statement or conduct a securities
offering, including an Underwritten Block Trade, off an already filed Shelf Registration Statement using a prospectus supplement
(such registration statement or prospectus supplement, a "Primary Registration Statement") for the primary sale of any equity
securities of the Company (except with respect to registration statements on Form S-4, Form S-8 or another form not available for

intention to do so (such notice to be given not less than five (5) Business Days (or, in the case of Underwritten Block Trades, three

holds any Registrable Securities, shall within five (5) Business Days (or, in the case of Underwritten Block Trades, three
(3) Business Days) of receipt of such notice indicate to the Company if it wishes to participate in the offering contemplated by the
Primary Registration Statement and, if so, the number of Registrable Securities it wishes to offer and sell. The Company will use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Registrable Securities as to which inclusion shall have been so requested to be included
in the Primary Registration Statement. The Shareholder shall be entitled to sell the Registrable Securities included in a Primary
Registration Statement in accordance with the method of distribution requested by it; provided that, if the Primary Registration
Statement relates to an underwritten offering, then (i) the Company shall be entitled to select the underwriters in its sole discretion
and (ii) the Shareholder must sell all Registrable Securities included on the Primary Registration Statement in such underwritten
offering pursuant to an underwriting agreement containing terms and conditions that are customary for secondary offerings. In the
event that an Underwriter Cutback is required in the view of the managing underwriter, then the securities of the Company to be

securities of the Company requested to be included by the Shareholder and any other Person(s) who has (have) elected to include
securities pursuant to written agreements with the Company, in each case, up to the number that, in the opinion of the managing
underwriter, would not adversely affect the marketing of the offering (including the price at which the securities (including the
Registrable Securities) may be sold), and (z) third, in addition to securities of the Company included pursuant to the preceding

described in the immediately preceding clause (y)(B) shall be allocated pro rata among the participating Persons, including the
Shareholder, on the basis of the number of securities, including Registrable Securities, requested to be included in such registration
by such Persons. The Company may withdraw a Primary Registration Statement prior to its being declared effective without
incurring any liability to the Shareholder and shall not be required to keep a Primary Registration Statement effective for longer than
the period contemplated by the intended manner of distribution for the securities of the Company to be sold by the Company as
described in the Prospectus included in the Primary Registration Statement. The Shareholder may, at least two (2) Business Days
prior to the effective date of a Primary Registration Statement or the filing of any prospectus supplement with respect to any
particular underwritten offering, as applicable, withdraw any Registrable Securities that it had sought to have included therein,
without any liability to the Company or requirement to reimburse for any out-of-pocket expenses of the Company. No registration of
Registrable Securities pursuant to this Section 2.2 shall relieve the Company of its obligations to effect registrations pursuant to
Section 2.1.

        (b)   If the Company at any time following the Closing Date proposes to file a registration statement or conduct an offering of
any of its securities off an already filed Shelf Registration Statement using a prospectus supplement (such registration statement or
prospectus supplement, a "Secondary Registration Statement") for the secondary sale of its equity securities under the Securities Act

Shareholders"), the Company will give prompt written notice to the Shareholder of its intention to do so (such notice to be given not
less than five (5) Business Days (or, in the case of Underwritten Block Trades, three (3) Business Days) prior to the anticipated
filing date of the Secondary Registration Statement). The Shareholder, to the extent it still holds Registrable Securities, shall within

the Company if it wants to participate in the offering contemplated by the Secondary Registration Statement and, if so, the number

Registrable Securities as to which inclusion shall have been so requested to be included in the Secondary Registration Statement.
The Shareholder shall be entitled to sell the Registrable Securities included in a Secondary Registration Statement in accordance
with the method of distribution requested by it; provided that, if the Secondary Registration Statement relates to a Public Offering,

Requesting Third Party Shareholders. In the event that an Underwriter Cutback is required in the view of the managing underwriter,
then the securities to be included in such Public Offering will be based on the following priority: (x) first, the number of the
securities of the Company that the Requesting Third Party Shareholders seek to include, up to the number that, in the opinion of the
managing underwriter, would not adversely affect the marketing of the offering (including the price at which such securities may be

(z) third, in addition to the securities included pursuant to the preceding clauses (x) and (y), the number of securities sought to be
included by other Persons permitted to participate in such underwritten offering, up to the number that, in the opinion of the
managing underwriter, would not adversely affect the marketing of the offering (including the price at which the securities may be
sold). The Underwriter Cutbacks described in the immediately preceding clause (y)(B) shall be allocated pro rata among the
participating Persons, including the Shareholder, on the basis of the number of securities (including Registrable Securities)
requested to be included in such registration by such Persons. Requesting Third Party Shareholders or the Company may withdraw a
Secondary Registration Statement prior to its being declared effective without incurring any liability to the Shareholder, and the
Company shall not be required to keep a Secondary Registration Statement effective for longer than the period contemplated by the
intended manner of distribution for the sale of the securities by the Requesting Third Party Shareholders as described in the
Prospectus included in the Secondary Registration Statement. The Shareholder may, at least two (2) Business Days prior to the
effective date of a Secondary Registration Statement or the filing of any prospectus supplement with respect to any particular
underwritten offering, as applicable, withdraw any Registrable Securities that it had sought to have included therein, without any
liability to the Company or any other Person or requirement to reimburse for any out-of-pocket expenses of the Company.

or offering and sale of the Registrable Securities shall be borne by the Company and all Selling Expenses shall be borne by the Shareholder.

        Section 2.4    Suspensions.     

        (a)   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Company shall be entitled, by providing written
notice (a "Notice of Suspension") to the Shareholder, to delay the filing or effectiveness of a Registration Statement or require the
Shareholder to suspend the use of the Prospectus for sales of Registrable Securities under an effective Registration Statement for a
reasonable period of time not to exceed sixty (60) consecutive days or ninety (90) days in the aggregate in any twelve (12)-month
period (a "Suspension Period") if the Company Board (or the executive committee thereof) determines in good faith that such filing,
effectiveness or use would (i) require the public disclosure of material non-public information concerning any material transaction
or negotiations involving the Company that would interfere with such material transaction or negotiations or (ii) otherwise
materially interfere with material financing plans, acquisition activities or business activities of the Company; provided, that if at the
time of receipt of such notice by the Shareholder, the Shareholder shall have sold all or a portion of the

Registrable Securities (or have signed a firm commitment underwriting agreement with respect to the sale of such Registrable
Securities) pursuant to an effective Registration Statement and the reason for the Suspension Period is not of a nature that would
require a post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement, then, provided that the Shareholder has given the Company at
least two (2) Business Days' notice prior to entering into such sale, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
take such action as to eliminate any restriction imposed by federal securities Laws by the time such Registrable Securities are
scheduled to be delivered. Immediately upon receipt of a Suspension Notice, the Shareholder shall discontinue the disposition of
Registrable Securities under an effective Registration Statement and Prospectus relating thereto until the Suspension Period is
terminated.

        (b)   The Company agrees to promptly notify in writing the Shareholder, to the extent it still holds Registrable Securities, of the
termination of a Suspension Period. After the expiration of any Suspension Period in the case of an effective Registration Statement,
and without the need for any further request from the Shareholder, the Company shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable,
prepare a post-effective amendment or supplement to such Registration Statement, the relevant Prospectus, or any document
incorporated therein by reference, or file any other required document so that, as thereafter delivered to purchasers of the
Registrable Securities included therein, the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, as applicable, will not include an untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

        (c)   If a Suspension Period occurs during the Effectiveness Period for a Registration Statement, such Effectiveness Period shall
be extended for a number of days equal to the total number of days during which the distribution of Registrable Securities is
suspended under this Section 2.4. If the Company notifies the Shareholder of a Suspension Period with respect to a Registration
Statement requested pursuant to Section 2.1 (including a Demand Registration Request) that has not yet been filed or declared
effective, (x) the Shareholder may by notice to the Company withdraw such request without such request counting as a Demand
Registration Request and (y) the Shareholder will not be obligated to reimburse the Company for any of its out-of-pocket expenses,
including Registration Expenses.

        (d)   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Company may delay the filing or effectiveness
of a Registration Statement or require the Shareholder to suspend the use of the Prospectus for sale of Registrable Securities under
an effective Registration Statement: (i) during any of the Company's recurring quarterly earnings blackout periods, determined in
accordance with such policy as the Company shall generally maintain and communicate to the Shareholder from time to time, and
any such blackout period shall be deemed to constitute a Suspension Period hereunder but shall not be subject to, and shall not count
against, the time periods in Section 2.4(a) or be subject to Section 2.4(c); and (ii) if, in the good faith determination of the Company,
it is not feasible for the Company to proceed with the registration or offering because (x) audited financial statements of the
Company, or (y) audited financial statements of any acquired company or pro forma financial statements that are required by the
Securities Act to be included in any related registration statement or prospectus are then unavailable, until such time as such
financial statements are prepared or obtained by the Company, and any delay or suspension shall be treated as a Suspension Period
hereunder, except that it shall not be subject to, and shall not count against, the time periods in Section 2.4(a) or be subject to
Section 2.4(c); provided that, with respect to clause (y), the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to prepare or obtain the
relevant acquired company or pro forma financial statements as quickly as reasonably practicable; and provided, further, that in no
event will more than forty (40) days of the period from which such financial statements are required to be filed pursuant to

in the case of the Company, the grant of equity awards with respect to, or the issuance of shares of Capital Stock under, any of the
Company's bona fide equity incentive plans in existence at the start of the lock-up period specified in this Section 2.5), (B) enter into any
swap or other derivatives transaction that transfers to another Person, in whole or in part, any of the economic benefits or risks of ownership
of Restricted Stock, whether any such transaction described in clause (A) above or this clause (B) is to be settled by delivery of Restricted

registration and the offer and sale of such Registrable Securities in accordance with the intended method of disposition thereof as soon as

practicable) before filing a Registration Statement or Prospectus or any amendments or supplements thereto (but, for the avoidance
of doubt, not any documents incorporated by reference therein), or any related free writing prospectus, furnish to the Shareholder

to the Company by or on behalf of the Shareholder expressly for use therein. This indemnity agreement shall be in addition
to any liability which the Company may otherwise have. Such indemnity and reimbursement of expenses shall remain in full
force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Shareholder Registration Rights Indemnitee and
shall survive the transfer of securities by the Shareholder.

         (ii)  The Shareholder shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company and each of its officers who execute any of the
Company's filings with the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act or the Securities Act, its directors, employees, stockholders,
and each Person, if any, that controls the Company and each Affiliate of any of the foregoing Persons (each, a "Company
Registration Rights Indemnitee"), to the fullest extent lawful, from and against any and all Damages arising out of or based
upon (A) any untrue statement of material fact (or alleged untrue statement of a material fact) contained in any Disclosure
Package, any Registration Statement, any Prospectus (including any preliminary Prospectus), any Free Writing Prospectus or
in any amendment or supplement thereto or (B) any omission (or alleged omission) to state therein any material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, in each case, to the extent that such untrue statement or omission was made in reliance upon and in
conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of the Shareholder expressly for use therein;
provided, however, that in no event shall the obligations of the Shareholder hereunder exceed the net proceeds received by it
from the sale of its Registrable Securities related to the matter in which Damages are sought. Such indemnity and
reimbursement of expenses shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of a
Company Registration Rights Indemnitee and shall survive the Transfer of such securities by the Shareholder.

        (iii)  If the indemnification provided for in Section 2.8(a)(i) or Section 2.8(a)(ii) is unavailable to a Shareholder
Registration Rights Indemnitee or a Company Registration Rights Indemnitee, as applicable, with respect to any Damages
referred to therein or is unenforceable or insufficient to hold a Shareholder Registration Rights Indemnitee or Company
Registration Rights Indemnitee, as applicable, harmless as contemplated therein, then the Company or the Shareholder, as
applicable, in lieu of indemnifying such Shareholder Registration Rights Indemnitee or Company Registration Rights
Indemnitee, as applicable, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Shareholder Registration Rights
Indemnitee or Company Registration Rights Indemnitee, as applicable, as a result of such Damages in such proportion as is
appropriate to reflect the relative fault of such Shareholder Registration Rights Indemnitee or Company Registration Rights
Indemnitee, as applicable, on the one hand, and the Company or the Shareholder, as applicable, on the other hand, in
connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such Damages as well as any other relevant equitable
considerations. The relative fault of the Company or the Shareholder, as applicable, on the one hand, and of a Shareholder
Registration Rights Indemnitee or Company Registration Rights Indemnitee, as applicable, on the other hand, shall be
determined by reference to, among other factors, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or
omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by or on behalf of the Company or the
Shareholder, as applicable, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or
prevent such statement or omission; the Company and the Shareholder agree that it would not be just and equitable if
contribution pursuant to this Section 2.8(a)(iii) were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation
that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in this Section 2.8(a)(iii). No Shareholder Registration
Rights Indemnitee or Company Registration Rights Indemnitee guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning
of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled

to contribution from the Company or the Shareholder, as applicable, if the Company or the Shareholder, as applicable, was
not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in no event shall the
liability of the Shareholder pursuant to this Section 2.8(a)(iii) be greater in amount than the amount of net proceeds received
by it from the sale of such Registrable Securities related to the matter in which indemnification or contribution for Damages
are sought.

        (b)    Notice of Reg Rights Claim.    

          (i)  As used in this Agreement, the term "Reg Rights Claim" means a claim for indemnification or contribution by or
on behalf of any Company Registration Rights Indemnitee or Shareholder Registration Rights Indemnitee, as the case may
be, for Damages under Section 2.8(a) (such Person making a Reg Rights Claim, a "Reg Rights Indemnified Person"). The
Company (for its own Damages or for the Damages incurred by any other Company Registration Rights Indemnitee) or the
Shareholder (for its own Damages or for the Damages incurred by any other Shareholder Registration Rights Indemnitee), as
applicable, shall give notice of a Reg Rights Claim under this Agreement pursuant to a written notice of such Reg Rights
Claim executed by the Company or the Shareholder, as applicable (a "Notice of Reg Rights Claim"), and delivered to the
Company or the Shareholder, as applicable (such receiving party, the "Reg Rights Indemnifying Person"), promptly after
such Reg Rights Indemnified Person becomes aware of the existence of any potential claim by such Reg Rights Indemnified
Person for indemnification arising out of or resulting from any item indemnified pursuant to the terms of Section 2.8(a)(i) or
Section 2.8(a)(ii); provided that the failure to timely give such notice shall not limit or reduce the Reg Rights Indemnified
Person's right to indemnification hereunder unless (and then only to the extent that) the Reg Rights Indemnifying Person's
defense of such Reg Rights Claim is materially and adversely prejudiced thereby.

         (ii)  Each Notice of Reg Rights Claim shall: (A) state the aggregate amount (where practicable) that the Reg Rights
Indemnified Person has incurred or paid in Damages arising from such Reg Rights Claim (which amount may include the
amount of Damages claimed by a third party in an action (a "Third-Party Reg Rights Claim") brought against such Reg
Rights Indemnified Person based on alleged facts, which if true, would give rise to liability for Damages to such Reg Rights
Indemnified Person); and (B) contain a brief description, in reasonable detail (to the extent reasonably available to the Reg
Rights Indemnified Person) of the facts, circumstances or events giving rise to the alleged Damages based on the Reg Rights
Indemnified Person's good faith belief and knowledge thereof, including the identity and address of any third party claimant
(to the extent reasonably available to the Reg Rights Indemnified Person).

        (c)    Defense of Third-Party Reg Rights Claims.    

          (i)  Subject to the provisions hereof, the applicable Reg Rights Indemnifying Person shall have the right (at its own
expense) to elect to defend and assume control of the defense of any Third-Party Reg Rights Claim on behalf of a Reg
Rights Indemnified Person, utilizing legal counsel reasonably acceptable to such Reg Rights Indemnified Person. In the
event such election is made, the Reg Rights Indemnified Person (unless itself controlling the Third-Party Reg Rights Claim
in accordance with this Section 2.8(c)) may participate, through counsel of its own choice and, except as provided herein, at
its own expense, in the defense of any Third-Party Reg Rights Claim. The reasonable and documented costs and expenses
incurred by the Reg Rights Indemnifying Person in connection with such defense (including reasonable attorneys' fees, other
professionals' and experts' fees and court or arbitration costs) shall be paid by the Reg Rights Indemnifying Person.

         (ii)  A Reg Rights Indemnifying Person shall not be entitled to assume control of such defense, and the applicable Reg
Rights Indemnified Person may assume the control and defense thereof, at the sole expense of the applicable Reg Rights
Indemnifying Person, if (A) the Reg Rights Claim relates to, or arises in connection with, any criminal or governmental
proceeding, action, indictment, allegation or investigation, (B) the Reg Rights Claim seeks an injunction against the Reg
Rights Indemnified Person, to the extent that such defense relates to the claim for such injunction, (C) a conflict of interest
between the Reg Rights Indemnifying Person and the Reg Rights Indemnified Person exists with respect to the Reg Rights
Claim or the Reg Rights Indemnifying Person and the Reg Rights Indemnified Person have one or more conflicting
defenses, in the reasonable view of their respective counsel, or (D) the Reg Rights Indemnifying Person has elected to have
the Reg Rights Indemnified Person defend, or assume the control and defense of, a Third-Party Reg Rights Claim in
accordance with this Section 2.8(c); provided that in no event shall the Reg Rights Indemnifying Person be liable for the fees
and expenses of more than one separate counsel for all Reg Rights Indemnified Persons, which counsel shall be selected by
the Shareholder (in the case of the Shareholder Registration Rights Indemnitees) or by the Company (in the case of the
Company Registration Rights Indemnitees).

        (iii)  Any party controlling the defense of any Third-Party Reg Rights Claim pursuant hereto shall: (A) conduct the
defense of such Third-Party Reg Rights Claim with reasonable diligence and keep the other parties reasonably informed of
material developments in the Third-Party Reg Rights Claim at all stages thereof (including by promptly providing the other
parties with copies of material legal documents filed or received in connection therewith) and (B) permit the other parties
and their counsel to confer on the conduct of the defense thereof. The parties not controlling the defense will render to the
party controlling the defense such assistance as may be reasonably required in order to insure the proper and adequate
defense thereof and shall furnish such records, information and testimony and attend such conferences, discovery
proceedings, hearings, trials and appeals as may be reasonably requested by the party controlling the defense in connection
therewith. The Reg Rights Indemnifying Person shall reimburse the parties not controlling the defense for any reasonable
and documented costs and expenses incurred in connection with providing such assistance. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, no Party shall be required to disclose any information to the other Party or its Representatives, if
doing so would be reasonably expected to violate any Law to which such Party is subject or could jeopardize (in the
reasonable discretion of the disclosing Party) any attorney-client privilege available with respect to such information.

        (iv)  If the Reg Rights Indemnifying Person controls the defense of and defends any Third-Party Reg Rights Claim
under this Section 2.8(c), the Reg Rights Indemnifying Person shall have the right to effect a settlement of such Third-Party
Reg Rights Claim on the Reg Rights Indemnified Person's behalf and without the consent of the Reg Rights Indemnified
Person; provided that (A) such settlement shall not involve any injunctive relief binding upon the Reg Rights Indemnified
Person or any of its Affiliates, and (B) such settlement expressly and unconditionally releases the Reg Rights Indemnified
Person and the other applicable Reg Rights Indemnified Persons (that is, each of the Company Registration Rights
Indemnitees, if the Reg Rights Indemnified Person is a Company Registration Rights Indemnitee, and each of the
Shareholder Registration Rights Indemnitees, if the Reg Rights Indemnified Person is a Shareholder Registration Rights
Indemnitee) from any and all liabilities with respect to such Third-Party Reg Rights Claim, with prejudice. If the Reg Rights
Indemnified Person controls the defense of and defends any Third-Party Reg Rights Claim under this Section 2.8(c), the Reg
Rights Indemnified Person shall have the right to effect a settlement of such Third-Party Reg Rights Claim only with the
consent of the Reg Rights Indemnifying Person (which

consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). No settlement by the Reg Rights Indemnified Person of
such Third-Party Reg Rights Claim effected in accordance with this Section 2.8(c) shall limit or reduce the right of any Reg
Rights Indemnified Person to indemnity hereunder for all Damages they may incur arising out of or resulting from the Third-
Party Reg Rights Claim, to the extent such Damages are indemnifiable hereunder. As used in this Section 2.8(c)(iv), the term
"settlement" refers to any consensual resolution of the claim in question, including by consent decree or by permitting any
judgment or other resolution of a claim to occur without disputing the same, and the term "settle" has a corresponding
meaning.

        Section 2.9    Free Writing Prospectuses.     Except for a Prospectus relating to Registrable Securities included in a Registration
Statement, an "issuer free writing prospectus" (as defined in Rule 433 under the Securities Act) prepared by the Company or other materials
prepared by Company, the Shareholder represents and agrees that it (a) will not make any offer relating to the Registrable Securities that
would constitute an issuer free writing prospectus or that would otherwise constitute a Free Writing Prospectus, and (b) will not distribute
any written materials in connection with the offer or sale pursuant to a Registration Statement of Registrable Securities, in each case,
without the prior written consent of the Company and, in connection with any Public Offering, the underwriters.

        Section 2.10    Information from and Obligations of the Shareholder.     The Company's obligation to include the Shareholder's
Registrable Securities in any Registration Statement or Prospectus is contingent upon the Shareholder promptly:

        (a)   furnishing to the Company in writing information with respect to its ownership of Registrable Securities and the intended
method of disposition of its Registrable Securities as the Company may reasonably request or as may be required by Law for use in
connection with a Registration Statement or Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) and all information required to
be disclosed in order to make the information the Shareholder previously furnished to the Company not contain a material
misstatement of fact or necessary to cause such Registration Statement or Prospectus (or amendment or supplement thereto) not to
omit a material fact with respect to the Shareholder necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading;

        (b)   complying with (i) the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, (ii) all applicable state securities Laws, (iii) the rules of any
securities exchange or trading market on which the Shares are listed or traded and (iv) all other applicable regulations, in each case,
in connection with the registration and the disposition of Registrable Securities;

        (c)   notifying the Company of the occurrence of any event that makes any statement made in a Registration Statement,
Prospectus, issuer free writing prospectus or other Free Writing Prospectus regarding the Shareholder untrue in any material respect
or that requires the making of any changes in a Registration Statement, Prospectus, issuer free writing prospectus or other Free
Writing Prospectus so that, in such regard, it will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements not misleading;

        (d)   providing the Company with such information as may be required to enable the Company to prepare a supplement or post-
effective amendment to any such Registration Statement or a supplement to such Prospectus or Free Writing Prospectus;

        (e)   using commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Company in preparing the applicable Registration Statement
and any related Prospectus; and

        (f)    furnishing the Company with all information required to be included in such Registration Statement or Prospectus by
applicable securities Laws in connection with the disposition of such Registrable Securities as the Company reasonably requests.

        Section 2.11    Rule 144 Reporting.     With a view to making available to the Shareholder the benefits of certain rules and regulations
of the SEC which may permit the sale of the Registrable Securities to the public without registration, the Company agrees to use its
commercially reasonable efforts to make and keep available adequate current public information, as defined in Rule 144(c), including all
periodic and annual reports and other documents (other than Form 8-K reports) required of the Company under Sections 13 or 15(d) of the
Exchange Act, and so long as the Shareholder Beneficially Owns any Registrable Securities or securities convertible into or exercisable for
Registrable Securities, furnish to the Shareholder forthwith upon request (and all of the following shall be deemed furnished if available on
the SEC's EDGAR system): a written statement by the Company as to its compliance with the reporting requirements of Rule 144, and of
the Exchange Act; a copy of the most recent annual or quarterly report of the Company; and such other reports and documents as the
Shareholder may reasonably request in availing itself of any rule or regulation of the SEC allowing it to sell any Registrable Securities
without registration.

        Section 2.12    Termination of Registration Rights.     Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the registration rights
granted under this Article II terminate and are of no further force and effect (other than Section 2.3 and Section 2.8), on the date on which
there cease to be any Registrable Securities.

        Section 2.13    Transfer of Registration Rights.     Subject to Section 1.2, the Shareholder shall have the right to Transfer to any Person
(such Person, a "Transferee Shareholder"), directly or indirectly, by written agreement, any or all of its rights and obligations granted under
this Article II (and no other rights or obligations under this Agreement) in connection with a Transfer of all or a portion of its Registrable
Securities to such Person; provided that (a) the Shareholder shall have the sole power to exercise the rights granted to the Shareholder under
this Article II on behalf of any such Transferee Shareholder, and the Company shall not be obligated to take any action with respect to any
Registrable Securities of any such Transferee Shareholder except upon notice and instructions by the Shareholder, (b) any notice or other
communication by the Company to the Shareholder with respect to the matters governed by this Article II shall be deemed notice to a
Transferee Shareholder with respect to any Registrable Securities held by such Transferee Shareholder, (c) no such Transfer shall increase
the aggregate number of Demand Registrations that may be made under Section 2.1 by the Shareholder on behalf of itself or any such
Transferee Shareholder to more than two (2) Demand Registrations in any twelve (12)-month period, (d) for purposes of this Article II,
including, without limitation, any priority of inclusion or Underwriter Cutback, but not for purposes of determining whether the securities
held by any Transferee Shareholder are Registrable Securities, all Registrable Securities held by such Transferee Shareholder shall be
deemed held by the Shareholder, and (e) such Transferee Shareholder executes a joinder to this Agreement (a "Joinder"), in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to the Company, pursuant to which (x) such Transferee Shareholder shall, following the applicable
Transfer, become responsible for all obligations applicable to the Shareholder under this Article II with respect to the Registrable Securities
Transferred to such Transferee Shareholder and (y) the Company shall acknowledge the rights of the Shareholder Transferee under this
Article II. If the Shareholder Transfers only a portion of its Registrable Securities, the Shareholder shall retain all rights and obligations
under this Agreement with respect to the portion of the Registrable Securities that it continues to hold following such Transfer.

ARTICLE III
PREEMPTIVE RIGHTS 

        Section 3.1    General.     From the Closing Date until the Expiration Date, the Company shall not issue any New Securities to any
Person, except in compliance with the provisions of this Article III.

        Section 3.2    Timing and Procedure.     Prior to the consummation of the issuance of New Securities, the Company shall send a written
notice thereof (a "Participation Notice") to the Shareholder. The Participation Notice shall include:

        (a)   the principal terms of the proposed issuance, including (i) the number and kind of New Securities to be included in the
issuance, (ii) the price per security of the New Securities, (iii) the percentage equal to the number of Shares immediately prior to the
issuance of the New Securities divided by the aggregate number of the shares of common stock of the Company then issued and
outstanding (the "Participation Percentage"), and (iv) the name of each Person to whom the New Securities are proposed to be
issued (each a "Prospective Subscriber"); provided that, if the consideration to be paid by the Prospective Subscriber for the New
Securities contains non-cash consideration, then the Participation Notice shall also specify the fair market value (as reasonably
determined by the Company Board) of such non-cash consideration; and

        (b)   an offer by the Company to issue to the Shareholder such portion (not in any event to exceed the Shareholder's
Participation Percentage) of the New Securities to be included in the issuance as may be requested by the Shareholder (the
"Preemptive Rights Shares"), at the same price and otherwise on the same terms and conditions as the issuance to each of the
Prospective Subscribers; provided that, if consideration to be paid by the Prospective Subscriber for the New Securities contains
non-cash consideration, then such offer shall give the Shareholder the option to pay, in lieu of delivery of such non-cash
consideration, cash in the amount of the fair market value (as reasonably determined by the Company Board) of such non-cash
consideration; and provided, further, that, if the issuance of the Preemptive Rights Shares to the Shareholder would require approval
of the stockholders of the Company pursuant to the NYSE Rule, such offer and any issuance of the Preemptive Rights Shares shall
be conditioned on such stockholder approval being obtained (it being agreed that the Company shall not issue New Securities to any
Person if such stockholder approval is not obtained).

        Section 3.3    Exercise of Rights.     If the Shareholder desires to accept the offer contained in the Participation Notice, it shall send an
irrevocable commitment (each a "Participation Commitment") to the Company within ten (10) Business Days after the date of delivery of
the Participation Notice specifying the amount or proportion of the Preemptive Rights Shares (not in any event to exceed the Shareholder's
Participation Percentage) which it desires to be issued. If the Shareholder has not so accepted such offer pursuant to the foregoing sentence,
it shall be deemed to have irrevocably waived its right under this Article III and the Company shall thereafter be free to issue the New
Securities to the Prospective Subscribers within one hundred and twenty (120) days following the date of the Participation Notice on terms
not materially more favorable to the Prospective Subscribers than those set forth in the Participation Notice, without any further obligation
to the Shareholder. If the Company has not completed the sale of the New Securities in accordance with the foregoing sentence, the
Company shall provide a new Participation Notice to the Shareholder on the terms and provisions set forth in Section 3.2.

        Section 3.4    Closing of Preemptive Issuance.     The closing of an issuance pursuant to this Article III shall take place at such time and
place as the Company shall specify by notice to the Shareholder given not less than three (3) Business Days prior to the closing of the
issuance. At the closing of any issuance under this Article III, the Company shall deliver to the Shareholder the originals of notes,
certificates or other instruments evidencing the New Securities issued to the Shareholder, in each case, free and clear

of any liens or encumbrances, with any transfer tax stamps affixed (if applicable), against delivery by the Shareholder of the applicable
consideration.

        Section 3.5    Reduction of Preemptive Issuance.     Notwithstanding anything in this Article III to the contrary, if the amount of New
Securities to be issued is for any reason less than the amount that was initially proposed to be issued as indicated in the Participation Notice,
the Company may (whether before or after the Shareholder has delivered a Participation Commitment to the Company) decrease the number
of Preemptive Rights Shares that the Shareholder is entitled to subscribe for or purchase pursuant to this Article III to an amount not less
than the amount necessary to allow the Shareholder to maintain (but not exceed) its Participation Percentage after giving effect to the
issuance of the applicable New Securities.

        Section 3.6    Exclusions.     The preceding provisions of this Article III shall not apply to:

        (a)   any issuance of New Securities to officers, employees, directors, advisors or consultants of the Company or any subsidiary
of the Company, in each case, in connection with their compensation or employment as such;

        (b)   any issuance of New Securities in a Public Offering (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall be governed by the
provisions of Article II);

        (c)   any pro rata dividend of New Securities made to all holders of the common stock of the Company; or

        (d)   for the avoidance of doubt, any issuance of New Securities in connection with the transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement.

ARTICLE IV
BOARD OF DIRECTORS 

        Section 4.1    Increase in the Company Board Size.     Effective on the date of this Agreement, the Company has increased the number
of Directors constituting the Company Board from eight (8) to eleven (11) and has elected the following Persons to serve as new Directors
in the class of Directors and the committee of the Company Board, in each case, as identified below:2

        Section 4.2    Right of Shareholder to Nominate Directors.     From the Closing Date until the Expiration Date, the Shareholder shall

(14), three (3) Directors; (b) if the total number of Directors constituting the Company Board is fourteen (14), four (4) Directors; and (c) if
the total number of Directors constituting the Company Board is greater than fourteen (14), a number of Directors equal to such total
number of Directors multiplied by 27%, rounding down in the case of any fractional number (each, an "AS Nominee" and, after being
elected to the Company Board, an "AS Director"). For example, if the size of the Company Board is increased to nineteen (19), then the
Shareholder shall be entitled to nominate five (5) Directors to the Company Board. If the number of AS Directors is three (3), each AS
Director shall serve in a different class of Directors. If the number of AS Directors is greater than three (3), no more than two (2) AS
Directors

        Section 4.3    Election of AS Directors to the Board.     Following the Closing Date, to the extent that an AS Nominee must stand for
election or an AS Director must stand for reelection, as the case may be, to the Company Board in connection with any annual or special
meeting of stockholders of the Company at which Directors are to be elected (each such annual or special meeting, an "Election Meeting"),
subject to the first sentence of Section 4.5(a), the Company agrees to (a) nominate and recommend that the holders of Capital Stock of the
Company who are entitled to vote at such Election Meeting vote in favor of the election of such AS Nominees or the reelection of such AS
Directors, as the case may be, (b) support the AS Nominees for election or the AS Directors for reelection, as the case may be, in a manner
no less rigorous and favorable than the manner in which the Company supports its other nominees and (c) otherwise use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the election of the AS Nominees or the reelection of the AS Directors, as the case may be, to the Company Board
at each Election Meeting.

        Section 4.4    Proxy or Information Statement.     Within a reasonable time prior to the filing with the SEC of the Company's proxy
statement or information statement with respect to any Election Meeting, the Company shall, to the extent the Shareholder is then entitled to
representation on the Company Board in accordance with this Agreement, provide the Shareholder with the opportunity to review and
comment on the information contained in such proxy or information statement applicable to AS Nominees or AS Directors and shall take
into account all reasonable comments from the Shareholder.

        Section 4.5    Qualification and Replacements of AS Directors.     

        (a)   Each AS Director shall at all times until cessation of service on the Company Board meet any (x) applicable requirements
or qualifications under applicable Law or applicable stock exchange rules and (y) the Company's standard qualifications for
Directors. Notwithstanding anything set forth to the contrary in the Charter or the Bylaws, if an AS Director (i) is unable or
unwilling to serve as a Director for any reason, (ii) is removed (upon death, resignation or otherwise), (iii) in the event that an AS
Director or an AS Nominee, as the case may be, fails to be reelected or elected, as the case may be, at an Election Meeting solely as
a result of failing to receive the required vote of the holders of voting Capital Stock as required by the Charter and the Bylaws, the
Shareholder shall have the exclusive right to submit the name of a replacement candidate for such AS Director or AS Nominee, as
the case may be (a "Replacement"), to the Governance Committee of the Company for its approval. If so approved, such
Replacement shall serve as the AS Nominee for election in the same class of Directors on the Company Board as the AS Director or
AS Nominee for which such Person serves as a Replacement. For each proposed Replacement that is not approved by the Company,
the Shareholder shall have the right to submit another proposed Replacement to the Governance Committee for its approval on the
same basis as set forth in the immediately preceding sentence and, for the avoidance of doubt, the Company shall not fill the
vacancy on the Company Board during any period in which the appointment of an AS Director is pending without the prior written
consent of the Shareholder. The Shareholder shall have the right to continue submitting the name of a proposed Replacement to the
Governance Committee for its approval until the Governance Committee approves that a Replacement may serve as a nominee for
election or appointment as a Director or to serve as a Director, whereupon such Person shall be appointed as the Replacement. To
the extent a Replacement is nominated pursuant to this Section 4.5(a), the Company's obligations under Section 4.3 shall be fulfilled
with respect to such Replacement.

        (b)   If any AS Director is serving on the Company Board on the Expiration Date, the Shareholder shall use its commercially
reasonably efforts to cause such AS Director to promptly tender his or her resignation to the Company Board, which resignation the
Governance Committee shall determine to accept or reject in its sole discretion.

        Section 4.6    Board Committee Representation.     So long as the Shareholder has the right to nominate Directors to the Company
Board in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the Shareholder shall have the right to require that one AS Director be appointed to
each of the committees of the Company Board, subject to applicable requirements or qualifications under applicable Law or applicable
stock exchange rules (including with respect to director independence); provided that the Shareholder shall not have any right to require that
any AS Director be appointed as the chair of any committee of the Company Board; and provided, further, that the identity of the particular
AS Director appointed to each particular committee shall be subject to the reasonable mutual agreement of the Shareholder and the
Company Board.

        Section 4.7    Rights of the AS Directors.     

        (a)   The Company shall notify each AS Director, at the same time and in the same manner as such notification is delivered to
the other members of the Company Board, of all regular meetings and special meetings of the Company Board and of all regular and
special meetings of any committee of the Company Board of which such AS Director is a member. The Company and the Company
Board shall provide each AS Director with copies of all notices, minutes, consents and other material that it provides to all other
members of the Company Board concurrently as such materials are provided to the other members.

        (b)   Each AS Director shall be entitled to the same directors' and officers' insurance coverage as the other Directors and the
same indemnification from the Company as such other Directors, in each case, effective no later than the date on which such AS
Director joins the Company Board. If the Company enters into indemnification agreements with its Directors generally, the
Company will enter into an indemnification agreement with each AS Director in the same form and substance as the other Directors.

        Section 4.8    No duty for Corporate Opportunities.     Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or in any policy or
code of the Company, the Company, on behalf of itself and its subsidiaries, (a) acknowledges and affirms that the Shareholder and its
Affiliates, employees, directors, partners and members, including any AS Director (the "AS Group"), (i) have participated (directly or
indirectly) and will continue to participate (directly or indirectly) in private equity, venture capital and other direct investments in
corporations, joint ventures, limited liability companies and other entities ("Other Investments"), including Other Investments engaged in
various aspects of businesses similar to those engaged in by the Company and its subsidiaries that may, are or will be competitive with the
Company's or any of its subsidiaries' businesses or that could be suitable for the Company's or any of its subsidiaries' interests, (ii) have
interests in, participate with, aid and maintain seats on the board of directors or similar governing bodies of, Other Investments, (iii) may
develop or become aware of business opportunities for Other Investments; and (iv) may or will, as a result of matters referred to in this
Agreement, the nature of the AS Group's businesses and other factors, have conflicts of interest or potential conflicts of interest, (b) hereby
renounces and disclaims any interest or expectancy in any business opportunity (including any Other Investments) or any other
opportunities, in each case, that may arise in connection with the circumstances described in the foregoing clauses (i) - (iv) (collectively, the
"Renounced Business Opportunities"), (c) acknowledges and affirms that no member of the AS Group shall have any obligation to
communicate or offer any Renounced Business Opportunity to the Company or any of its subsidiaries, and any member of the AS Group
may pursue a Renounced Business Opportunity, and (d) acknowledges and affirms that any of the activities set forth in this Section 4.8 shall
not be considered a violation of any policies and codes of the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company does not renounce its
interest in, and an AS Director shall have an obligation to communicate to the Company Board, any business opportunity of which such AS
Director first became aware in his or her capacity as a Director.

shown to have been (i) previously known by the Shareholder or such Affiliate Shareholder on a non-confidential basis, (ii) in the public
domain through no breach of the Shareholder or any Affiliate Shareholder of any of the confidentiality obligations to the Company,

the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The Company shall report the Merger as a taxable transaction and not take
any position inconsistent with such treatment on any Tax Return, in connection with any audit or other legal proceeding or otherwise, unless
required by a determination of the applicable Governmental Authority that is final.

terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Merger Agreement.

RECITALS

        WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Company, Parent and Alpha SPV I, Inc., a Delaware
corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"), are entering into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (as the same may
be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified, the "Merger Agreement"), which provides, among other things, for the acquisition of the
Company by Parent by means of a merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company (the "Merger"), all on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement;

        WHEREAS, Stockholder beneficially owns (as such term is defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock set forth across from Stockholder's name on Part I of Exhibit A hereto (such securities, as they may be adjusted
by stock dividend, stock split, recapitalization, combination or exchange of shares, merger, consolidation, reorganization or other change or
transaction of or by the Company, together with securities of the Company that may be acquired after the date hereof by Stockholder are
collectively referred to herein as the "Securities"); and

        WHEREAS, as an inducement and a condition to the willingness of Parent and Merger Sub to enter into the Merger Agreement, and in
consideration of the substantial expenses incurred and to be incurred by them in connection therewith, Stockholder has agreed to enter into,
be legally bound by and perform this Agreement.

otherwise govern this Agreement. The parties hereto agree that any Action seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any
matter arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (whether brought by any party
or any of its Affiliates or against any party or any of its Affiliates) shall be heard and determined exclusively in the Delaware Court
of Chancery; provided, however, that if the Delaware Court of Chancery does not have jurisdiction over such Action, such Action
shall be heard and determined exclusively in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware. Consistent with the
preceding sentence, each of the parties hereto hereby (i) submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts for the purpose of any
Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement brought by either party hereto; (ii) agrees that service of process will be validly

that its property is exempt or immune from attachment or execution, that the Action is brought in an inconvenient forum, that the
venue of the Action is improper, or that this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may not be enforced in

named courts.

THIS AGREEMENT AND THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT, AS APPLICABLE, BY,
AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 8(G).

rule of Law, or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect
so long as the economic or legal substance of the Transactions is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon
such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties hereto as closely as possible in a

        We understand that American Axle & Manufacturing Holdings, Inc. ("American Axle") proposes to enter into an Agreement and Plan

(the "Company"), which provides, among other things, for the merger (the "Merger") of Merger Sub, a wholly owned subsidiary of
American Axle, with and into the Company, with the Company continuing as the surviving corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of
American Axle. In the Merger, each issued and outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company (the
"Company Common Stock") (other than shares of Company Common Stock held in treasury by the Company, shares of Company Common
Stock owned by American Axle or any direct or indirect subsidiary of American Axle, including Merger Sub and any Dissenting Shares (as
defined in the Merger Agreement)) shall be converted automatically into the right to receive (a) $13.50 in cash without interest thereon
("Cash Consideration") and (b) 0.5 fully-paid and non-assessable shares (the "Share Consideration" and, together with the Cash
Consideration, the "Merger Consideration") of common stock, par value $0.01 per share of American Axle ("American Axle Common
Stock"). The terms and conditions of the Merger are more fully set forth in the Merger Agreement.

        You have asked for our opinion as to whether, as of the date hereof, the Merger Consideration to be paid by American Axle to the
holders of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement is fair, from a financial point of view, to American Axle. We have
not been requested to opine as to, and our opinion does not in any manner address the underlying business decision to proceed with or effect
the Merger.

        For purposes of the opinion set forth herein, we have:

2. reviewed certain publicly available financial statements of each of American Axle and the Company that we deemed

the Merger will be consummated in accordance with the terms set forth in the final, executed Merger Agreement, which we have further
assumed will be substantially similar in all material respects to the latest draft thereof we have reviewed, and without waiver of any material
terms or conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement. We have further assumed that all material governmental, regulatory and other
consents and approvals necessary for the consummation of the Merger will be obtained without any material effect on American Axle, the
Company, the Merger or the contemplated benefits of the Merger meaningful to our analysis. We are not legal, regulatory, accounting or tax
experts and have relied on the assessments made by American Axle and the Company and their respective advisors with respect to such
issues. Our opinion is necessarily based on financial, economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made
available to us as of, the date hereof. It should be understood that subsequent developments may affect this opinion, and we do not have any
obligation to update, revise, or reaffirm this opinion.

        We have acted as financial advisor to American Axle in connection with the Merger and will receive a fee for rendering this opinion
and for other services rendered in connection with the Merger, a portion of which is contingent on the consummation of the Merger. In
addition, American Axle has agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities arising out of our engagement. During the two years preceding the
date of this opinion we have not been engaged by, performed any services for or received any compensation from American Axle or any
other parties to the Merger (other than (x) any amounts that were paid to us under the letter agreement pursuant to which we were retained
as a financial advisor to American Axle in connection with the Merger and (y) pursuant to and in accordance with the terms and conditions
of that certain engagement letter dated as of January 31, 2014 that we entered into with you).

        It is understood that this letter is solely for the information of the Board of Directors (the "Board") of American Axle and is rendered to
the Board in connection with its consideration of the Merger and may not be used for any other purpose or relied upon by any other person
without our prior written consent, except that this opinion may, if required by law, be included in its entirety in any proxy or other
information statement or registration statement to be mailed to the stockholders of American Axle and the Company in connection with the
Merger. We are not expressing an opinion as to any aspect of the Merger, other than the fairness to American Axle of the Merger
Consideration to be paid by American Axle to the holders of Company Common Stock from a financial point of view. In particular, we
express no opinion as to the prices at which the American Axle Common Stock will trade at any future time. We express no opinion with

who will become holders of American Axle Common Stock upon consummation of the Merger. We also express no opinion regarding

that, in the course of obtaining the necessary governmental, regulatory and other approvals, consents, releases and waivers for the Merger,
no delay, limitation, restriction or condition, including any divestiture requirements or amendments or modifications, will be imposed that

extent expressly specified herein), including, without limitation, the form or structure of the Merger, any related transactions, the Voting

holders of Metaldyne Common Stock and no opinion or view is expressed with respect to any consideration received in connection with the
Merger by the holders of any class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of any party. In addition, no opinion or view is expressed
with respect to the fairness (financial or otherwise) of the amount, nature or any other aspect of any compensation to any of the officers,

opinion or view is expressed as to the relative merits of the Merger in comparison to other strategies or transactions that might be available
to Metaldyne or in which Metaldyne might engage or as to the underlying business decision of Metaldyne to proceed with or effect the
Merger. We also are not expressing any view or opinion with respect to, and we have relied, at the direction of Metaldyne, upon, the
assessments of representatives of Metaldyne regarding legal, regulatory, accounting, tax and similar matters relating to Metaldyne or the
Merger, as to which matters we understand that Metaldyne obtained such advice as it deemed necessary from qualified professionals. We
are not expressing any opinion as to what the value of American Axle Common Stock actually will be when issued or the prices at which
Metaldyne Common Stock or American Axle Common Stock will trade at any time, including following announcement or consummation
of the Merger. In addition, we express no opinion or recommendation as to how any stockholder should vote or act in connection with the
Merger or any other matter.

        We have acted as financial advisor to Metaldyne in connection with the Merger and will receive a fee for our services, a portion of

consolidation, who has otherwise complied with subsection (d) of this section and who has neither voted in favor of the merger or
consolidation nor consented thereto in writing pursuant to § 228 of this title shall be entitled to an appraisal by the Court of Chancery of the
fair value of the stockholder's shares of stock under the circumstances described in subsections (b) and (c) of this section. As used in this
section, the word "stockholder" means a holder of record of stock in a corporation; the words "stock" and "share" mean and include what is
ordinarily meant by those words; and the words "depository receipt" mean a receipt or other instrument issued by a depository representing
an interest in 1 or more shares, or fractions thereof, solely of stock of a corporation, which stock is deposited with the depository.

        (b)   Appraisal rights shall be available for the shares of any class or series of stock of a constituent corporation in a merger or
consolidation to be effected pursuant to § 251 (other than a merger effected pursuant to § 251(g) of this title and, subject to paragraph (b)(3)
of this section, § 251(h) of this title), § 252, § 254, § 255, § 256, § 257, § 258, § 263 or § 264 of this title:

        (1)   Provided, however, that, except as expressly provided in § 363(b) of this title, no appraisal rights under this section shall
be available for the shares of any class or series of stock, which stock, or depository receipts in respect thereof, at the record date
fixed to determine the stockholders entitled to receive notice of the meeting of stockholders to act upon the agreement of merger or
consolidation, were either: (i) listed on a national securities exchange or (ii) held of record by more than 2,000 holders; and further
provided that no appraisal rights shall be available for any shares of stock of the constituent corporation surviving a merger if the
merger did not require for its approval the vote of the stockholders of the surviving corporation as provided in § 251(f) of this title.

        (2)   Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1) of this section, appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the shares of any
class or series of stock of a constituent corporation if the holders thereof are required by the terms of an agreement of merger or
consolidation pursuant to §§ 251, 252, 254, 255, 256, 257, 258, 263 and 264 of this title to accept for such stock anything except:

        a.     Shares of stock of the corporation surviving or resulting from such merger or consolidation, or depository receipts
in respect thereof;

        b.     Shares of stock of any other corporation, or depository receipts in respect thereof, which shares of stock (or
depository receipts in respect thereof) or depository receipts at the effective date of the merger or consolidation will be either
listed on a national securities exchange or held of record by more than 2,000 holders;

        c.     Cash in lieu of fractional shares or fractional depository receipts described in the foregoing paragraphs (b)(2)a. and
b. of this section; or

        d.     Any combination of the shares of stock, depository receipts and cash in lieu of fractional shares or fractional
depository receipts described in the foregoing paragraphs (b)(2)a., b. and c. of this section.

        (3)   In the event all of the stock of a subsidiary Delaware corporation party to a merger effected under § 251(h), § 253 or § 267
of this title is not owned by the parent immediately prior to the merger, appraisal rights shall be available for the shares of the
subsidiary Delaware corporation.

        (4)   In the event of an amendment to a corporation's certificate of incorporation contemplated by § 363(a) of this title, appraisal
rights shall be available as contemplated by § 363(b) of this title, and the procedures of this section, including those set forth in
subsections (d) and (e) of this section, shall apply as nearly as practicable, with the word "amendment" substituted for the words
"merger or consolidation," and the word "corporation" substituted for the words "constituent corporation" and/or "surviving or
resulting corporation."

        (c)   Any corporation may provide in its certificate of incorporation that appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the
shares of any class or series of its stock as a result of an amendment to its certificate of incorporation, any merger or consolidation in which
the corporation is a constituent corporation or the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the corporation. If the certificate of
incorporation contains such a provision, the provisions of this section, including those set forth in subsections (d), (e), and (g) of this
section, shall apply as nearly as is practicable.

        (d)   Appraisal rights shall be perfected as follows:

        (1)   If a proposed merger or consolidation for which appraisal rights are provided under this section is to be submitted for
approval at a meeting of stockholders, the corporation, not less than 20 days prior to the meeting, shall notify each of its
stockholders who was such on the record date for notice of such meeting (or such members who received notice in accordance with
§ 255(c) of this title) with respect to shares for which appraisal rights are available pursuant to subsection (b) or (c) of this section
that appraisal rights are available for any or all of the shares of the constituent corporations, and shall include in such notice a copy
of this section and, if 1 of the constituent corporations is a nonstock corporation, a copy of § 114 of this title. Each stockholder
electing to demand the appraisal of such stockholder's shares shall deliver to the corporation, before the taking of the vote on the
merger or consolidation, a written demand for appraisal of such stockholder's shares. Such demand will be sufficient if it reasonably
informs the corporation of the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to demand the appraisal of such
stockholder's shares. A proxy or vote against the merger or consolidation shall not constitute such a demand. A stockholder electing
to take such action must do so by a separate written demand as herein provided. Within 10 days after the effective date of such
merger or consolidation, the surviving or resulting corporation shall notify each stockholder of each constituent corporation who has
complied with this subsection and has not voted in favor of or consented to the merger or consolidation of the date that the merger or
consolidation has become effective; or

        (2)   If the merger or consolidation was approved pursuant to § 228, § 251(h), § 253, or § 267 of this title, then either a
constituent corporation before the effective date of the merger or consolidation or the surviving or resulting corporation within
10 days thereafter shall notify each of the holders of any class or series of stock of such constituent corporation who are entitled to
appraisal rights of the approval of the merger or consolidation and that appraisal rights are available for any or all shares of such
class or series of stock of such constituent corporation, and shall include in such notice a copy of this section and, if 1 of the
constituent corporations is a nonstock corporation, a copy of § 114 of this title. Such notice may, and, if given on or after the
effective date of the merger or consolidation, shall, also notify such stockholders of the effective date of the merger or consolidation.
Any stockholder entitled to appraisal rights may, within 20 days after the date of mailing of such notice or, in the case of a merger
approved pursuant to § 251(h) of this title, within the later of the consummation of the offer contemplated by § 251(h) of this title
and 20 days after the date of mailing of such notice, demand in writing from the surviving or resulting corporation the appraisal of
such holder's shares. Such demand will be sufficient if it reasonably informs the corporation of the identity of the stockholder and
that the stockholder intends thereby to demand the appraisal of such holder's shares. If such notice did not notify stockholders of the
effective date of the merger or consolidation, either (i) each such

constituent corporation shall send a second notice before the effective date of the merger or consolidation notifying each of the
holders of any class or series of stock of such constituent corporation that are entitled to appraisal rights of the effective date of the
merger or consolidation or (ii) the surviving or resulting corporation shall send such a second notice to all such holders on or within
10 days after such effective date; provided, however, that if such second notice is sent more than 20 days following the sending of
the first notice or, in the case of a merger approved pursuant to § 251(h) of this title, later than the later of the consummation of the
offer contemplated by § 251(h) of this title and 20 days following the sending of the first notice, such second notice need only be
sent to each stockholder who is entitled to appraisal rights and who has demanded appraisal of such holder's shares in accordance
with this subsection. An affidavit of the Secretary or assistant Secretary or of the transfer agent of the corporation that is required to
give either notice that such notice has been given shall, in the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein.
For purposes of determining the stockholders entitled to receive either notice, each constituent corporation may fix, in advance, a
record date that shall be not more than 10 days prior to the date the notice is given, provided, that if the notice is given on or after
the effective date of the merger or consolidation, the record date shall be such effective date. If no record date is fixed and the notice
is given prior to the effective date, the record date shall be the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the
notice is given.

        (e)   Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, the surviving or resulting corporation or any stockholder
who has complied with subsections (a) and (d) of this section hereof and who is otherwise entitled to appraisal rights, may commence an
appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Court of Chancery demanding a determination of the value of the stock of all such
stockholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, any
stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party shall have the right to withdraw
such stockholder's demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the merger or consolidation. Within 120 days after the
effective date of the merger or consolidation, any stockholder who has complied with the requirements of subsections (a) and (d) of this
section hereof, upon written request, shall be entitled to receive from the corporation surviving the merger or resulting from the
consolidation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the merger or consolidation and with respect to
which demands for appraisal have been received and the aggregate number of holders of such shares. Such written statement shall be mailed
to the stockholder within 10 days after such stockholder's written request for such a statement is received by the surviving or resulting
corporation or within 10 days after expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal under subsection (d) of this section hereof,
whichever is later. Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, a person who is the beneficial owner of shares of such stock held either in
a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person may, in such person's own name, file a petition or request from the corporation the
statement described in this subsection.

        (f)    Upon the filing of any such petition by a stockholder, service of a copy thereof shall be made upon the surviving or resulting
corporation, which shall within 20 days after such service file in the office of the Register in Chancery in which the petition was filed a duly
verified list containing the names and addresses of all stockholders who have demanded payment for their shares and with whom
agreements as to the value of their shares have not been reached by the surviving or resulting corporation. If the petition shall be filed by the
surviving or resulting corporation, the petition shall be accompanied by such a duly verified list. The Register in Chancery, if so ordered by
the Court, shall give notice of the time and place fixed for the hearing of such petition by registered or certified mail to the surviving or
resulting corporation and to the stockholders shown on the list at the addresses therein stated. Such notice shall also be given by 1 or more
publications at least 1 week before the day of the hearing, in a newspaper of general circulation published in the City of Wilmington,
Delaware or such

publication as the Court deems advisable. The forms of the notices by mail and by publication shall be approved by the Court, and the costs
thereof shall be borne by the surviving or resulting corporation.

        (g)   At the hearing on such petition, the Court shall determine the stockholders who have complied with this section and who have
become entitled to appraisal rights. The Court may require the stockholders who have demanded an appraisal for their shares and who hold
stock represented by certificates to submit their certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the
appraisal proceedings; and if any stockholder fails to comply with such direction, the Court may dismiss the proceedings as to such
stockholder. If immediately before the merger or consolidation the shares of the class or series of stock of the constituent corporation as to
which appraisal rights are available were listed on a national securities exchange, the Court shall dismiss the proceedings as to all holders of
such shares who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless (1) the total number of shares entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the
outstanding shares of the class or series eligible for appraisal, (2) the value of the consideration provided in the merger or consolidation for
such total number of shares exceeds $1 million, or (3) the merger was approved pursuant to § 253 or § 267 of this title.

        (h)   After the Court determines the stockholders entitled to an appraisal, the appraisal proceeding shall be conducted in accordance
with the rules of the Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings. Through such proceeding the
Court shall determine the fair value of the shares exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the
merger or consolidation, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. In determining such fair
value, the Court shall take into account all relevant factors. Unless the Court in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown,
and except as provided in this subsection, interest from the effective date of the merger through the date of payment of the judgment shall be
compounded quarterly and shall accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to
time during the period between the effective date of the merger and the date of payment of the judgment. At any time before the entry of
judgment in the proceedings, the surviving corporation may pay to each stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which case
interest shall accrue thereafter as provided herein only upon the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair
value of the shares as determined by the Court, and (2) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time. Upon application by the
surviving or resulting corporation or by any stockholder entitled to participate in the appraisal proceeding, the Court may, in its discretion,
proceed to trial upon the appraisal prior to the final determination of the stockholders entitled to an appraisal. Any stockholder whose name
appears on the list filed by the surviving or resulting corporation pursuant to subsection (f) of this section and who has submitted such
stockholder's certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery, if such is required, may participate fully in all proceedings until it is finally
determined that such stockholder is not entitled to appraisal rights under this section.

        (i)    The Court shall direct the payment of the fair value of the shares, together with interest, if any, by the surviving or resulting
corporation to the stockholders entitled thereto. Payment shall be so made to each such stockholder, in the case of holders of uncertificated
stock forthwith, and the case of holders of shares represented by certificates upon the surrender to the corporation of the certificates
representing such stock. The Court's decree may be enforced as other decrees in the Court of Chancery may be enforced, whether such
surviving or resulting corporation be a corporation of this State or of any state.

        (j)    The costs of the proceeding may be determined by the Court and taxed upon the parties as the Court deems equitable in the
circumstances. Upon application of a stockholder, the Court may order all or a portion of the expenses incurred by any stockholder in
connection with the appraisal proceeding, including, without limitation, reasonable attorney's fees and the fees and expenses of experts, to
be charged pro rata against the value of all the shares entitled to an appraisal.

        (k)   From and after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, no stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights as provided in
subsection (d) of this section shall be entitled to vote such stock for any purpose or to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on
the stock (except dividends or other distributions payable to stockholders of record at a date which is prior to the effective date of the
merger or consolidation); provided, however, that if no petition for an appraisal shall be filed within the time provided in subsection (e) of
this section, or if such stockholder shall deliver to the surviving or resulting corporation a written withdrawal of such stockholder's demand
for an appraisal and an acceptance of the merger or consolidation, either within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or
consolidation as provided in subsection (e) of this section or thereafter with the written approval of the corporation, then the right of such
stockholder to an appraisal shall cease. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no appraisal proceeding in the Court of Chancery shall be dismissed
as to any stockholder without the approval of the Court, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Court deems just;
provided, however that this provision shall not affect the right of any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined
that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such stockholder's demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the merger or
consolidation within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, as set forth in subsection (e) of this section.

        (l)    The shares of the surviving or resulting corporation to which the shares of such objecting stockholders would have been converted
had they assented to the merger or consolidation shall have the status of authorized and unissued shares of the surviving or resulting
corporation.
