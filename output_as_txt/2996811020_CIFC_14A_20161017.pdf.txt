October 17, 2016

Dear CIFC LLC Shareholder:

        On behalf of the board of directors of CIFC LLC (the "Board"), you are cordially invited to attend the annual meeting of shareholders (the "Annual Meeting") of
CIFC LLC ("CIFC"), which will be held at the offices of CIFC, 250 Park Avenue, 4th Floor, New York, NY 10177 on November 16, 2016 at 10:00 a.m., local time.
Enclosed you will find the notice of meeting, proxy statement and proxy card.

        As CIFC previously announced, on August 19, 2016, CIFC entered into a definitive Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement") with F.A.B. Holdings
I LP, a limited partnership organized and existing under the laws of Delaware ("Parent") and CIFC Acquisition, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a direct
wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"). If the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement are completed, you will be entitled to receive $11.36 in cash,
without interest and subject to any withholding of taxes required by applicable law, for each common share, par value $0.001 (the "Common Shares"), of CIFC you own
(unless you have properly exercised your appraisal rights with respect to such shares). Under the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into CIFC (the
"Merger") with CIFC surviving as a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Parent.

        After careful consideration of, and based upon, the recommendation of a committee of the Board formed to consider strategic alternatives (the "Strategic
Committee"), the Board (i) determined the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement are advisable and fair to, and in the
best interests of, CIFC and its shareholders, (ii) approved the execution, delivery and performance by CIFC of the Merger Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger and (iii) resolved that the Merger Agreement and the related certificate of merger be submitted to the
holders of Common Shares for authorization, adoption and approval and recommended that the holders of Common Shares authorize, approve and adopt the
Merger Agreement, the related certificate of merger and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger.

        At the Annual Meeting, you will be asked to adopt the Merger Agreement, to vote on the election of Company directors and to vote on other merger-related and Annual
Meeting matters. The Board recommends that CIFC LLC shareholders vote "FOR" the adoption of the Merger Agreement and "FOR" each of the other proposals
described in the accompanying proxy statement.

        The enclosed proxy statement describes the Merger, the Merger Agreement and related agreements and the other business to be conducted at the Annual Meeting. In
addition, you may obtain information about us from documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We urge you to, and you should, read the entire proxy
statement carefully, including the annexes and the documents incorporated by reference therein, as it sets forth the details of the Merger Agreement and other important
information related to the Merger.

        Your vote is very important. The Merger cannot be completed unless holders of a majority of the outstanding Common Shares vote in favor of the proposal to
authorize, approve and adopt the Merger Agreement. If you fail to vote in favor of the authorization, approval and adoption of the Merger Agreement, the effect
will be the same as a vote "AGAINST" the authorization, approval and adoption of the Merger Agreement.

        On August 19, 2016, concurrent with and as a condition to Parent entering into the Merger Agreement, DFR Holdings, LLC entered into a Voting Agreement with
Parent and CIFC in its capacity as a holder of 18,822,175 Common Shares, representing approximately 80% of the Common Shares outstanding as of the date hereof,
pursuant to which DFR Holdings, LLC agrees, inter alia, to vote in favor of the Merger and the approval of the Merger Agreement, subject to certain exceptions. As such,
CIFC LLC expects to obtain the required vote of shareholders necessary to approve the Merger.

        It is important that your shares be represented and voted at the Annual Meeting, regardless of the size of your holdings or whether or not you plan to attend the Annual
Meeting. Accordingly, please complete, sign and date the enclosed proxy card and return it promptly in the enclosed postage-prepaid envelope to ensure your shares will be
represented or vote over the internet or via the toll-free telephone number, as described in the attached proxy statement and proxy card. If you do attend the Annual Meeting,
you may, of course, withdraw your proxy should you wish to vote in person. Your vote is very important. We urge you to vote your proxy as soon as possible.

        If you have any questions or need assistance in voting your shares, or if you need to obtain copies of the accompanying proxy statement, proxy cards, election forms or
other documents incorporated by reference in the proxy statement, please contact American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC.

        Thank you for your continued support.

        Neither the Securities and Exchange Commission nor any state securities regulatory agency has approved or disapproved the Merger, passed upon the merits
or fairness of the Merger or passed upon the adequacy or accuracy of the disclosure in this document. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense.

        The attached proxy statement is dated October 17, 2016, and is first being mailed to shareholders of CIFC on or about October 17, 2016.

     
  Sincerely,

CIFC LLC

NOTICE OF ANNUAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS

November 16, 2016
10:00 a.m., Eastern Time

To the Shareholders of CIFC LLC:

        NOTICE IS HEREBY GIVEN that the annual meeting of the Shareholders (the "Annual Meeting") of CIFC LLC (the "CIFC," "we," "our" or "us") will be held at the
offices of CIFC LLC, 250 Park Avenue, 4th Floor, New York, New York 10177 on November 16, 2016, beginning at 10:00 a.m., Eastern time, unless postponed or adjourned
to a later date. This Annual Meeting will be held to consider and vote on the following matters:

1. to authorize, approve and adopt the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of August 19, 2016 (as it may be amended from time to time, the "Merger
Agreement"), by and among CIFC LLC, F.A.B. Holdings I LP and CIFC Acquisition, LLC; 

2. to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, compensation that will or may become payable to our named executive officers in connection with the merger
contemplated by the Merger Agreement (the "Merger"); 

3. to approve the proposal to adjourn the Annual Meeting from time to time, if necessary or appropriate to, among other things, solicit additional proxies if there
are insufficient votes at the time of the Annual Meeting, or any adjournment thereof, to approve the proposal to authorize, approve and adopt the Merger
Agreement; 

4. to elect ten (10) members of the CIFC LLC board of directors (the "Board") named in, and for the term described in, this proxy statement; 

5. to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the compensation of our named executive officers; 

6. to approve the CIFC LLC Amended and Restated Share Option and Incentive Plan; and 

7. to transact any other business that may properly come before the Annual Meeting and any adjournment or postponement thereof.

        The holders of record of our common shares, $0.001 par value per share (the "Common Shares"), at the close of business on October 12, 2016, the record date for the
Annual Meeting (the "Record Date"), are entitled to notice of and to vote at the Annual Meeting or at any adjournment or postponement thereof. All such shareholders are
cordially invited to attend the Annual Meeting in person.

        After careful consideration of, and based upon, the recommendation of the Strategic Committee, the Board (i) determined that the Merger Agreement with F.A.B.
Holdings I LP and CIFC Acquisition, LLC and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement are advisable and fair to, and in the best interests of, CIFC and its
shareholders, (ii) approved the execution, delivery and performance by CIFC of the Merger Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby,
including the Merger and (iii) resolved that the Merger Agreement and the related certificate of merger be submitted to the holders of Common Shares for authorization,
adoption and approval and recommended that the holders of Common Shares authorize, approve and adopt the Merger Agreement, the related certificate of merger and the
transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger.

        The Board recommends that shareholders vote "FOR" the proposal to authorize, approve and adopt the Merger Agreement, "FOR" the election of each of
the director nominees named in Proposal 4 and "FOR" each of the other proposals listed above and described in more detail in the accompanying proxy statement.

        Under Delaware law applicable to CIFC, holders of record of Common Shares who do not vote in favor of adoption of the Merger Agreement have the right to seek
appraisal of the fair value of their Common Shares if the Merger is completed, but only if they follow the procedures and satisfy the conditions prescribed by applicable
Delaware law. To exercise appraisal rights, holders of record of Common Shares must strictly follow the procedures and satisfy the conditions prescribed by applicable
Delaware law, including, among other things, submitting a written demand for appraisal to CIFC before the vote is taken on the adoption of the Merger Agreement and not
voting in favor of adoption of the Merger Agreement. These procedures are summarized in this proxy statement in the section entitled "Appraisal Rights" beginning on page
133, and the text of the applicable provisions of Delaware law is included as Annex C to this proxy statement.

        Your vote is important, regardless of the number of Common Shares you own. The authorization, approval and adoption of the Merger Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger, requires the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the outstanding Common Shares and is a condition to
the consummation of the Merger. The election of the director nominees requires the affirmative vote of a plurality of the votes cast on such proposal at the Annual Meeting.
In addition, (i) the advisory (non-binding) proposal to approve compensation that will or may become payable to our named executive officers in connection with the Merger,
(ii) the proposal to adjourn the Annual Meeting from time to time, if necessary or appropriate to, among other things, solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes
at the time of the Annual Meeting, or any adjournment thereof, to approve the proposal to authorize, approve and adopt the Merger Agreement and thereby approve the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger, (iii) the approval, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, of the compensation of our named
executive officers as well as (iv) the approval of the CIFC LLC Amended and Restated Share Option and Incentive Plan, each require the affirmative vote of holders of a
majority of the Common Shares present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on such proposal at the Annual Meeting. Even if you plan to attend the
Annual Meeting in person, we request that you complete, sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card or vote your Common Shares by telephone or over the
internet to ensure that your Common Shares will be represented at the Annual Meeting if you are unable to attend. A failure to vote your Common Shares or an
abstention from voting will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the proposal to authorize, approve and adopt the Merger Agreement.

        If you sign, date and return your proxy card without indicating how you wish to vote, your proxy will be voted in favor of (i) the proposal to authorize, approve and
adopt the Merger Agreement and thereby approve the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger, (ii) the advisory (non-binding) proposal to
approve compensation that will or may become payable to our named executive officers in connection with the Merger, (iii) the proposal to adjourn the Annual Meeting from
time to time, if necessary or appropriate to, among other things, solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of the Annual Meeting, or any adjournment
thereof, to approve the proposal to authorize, approve and adopt the Merger Agreement, (iv) the election of ten (10) members of the Board, (v) the advisory (non-binding)
proposal to approve the compensation of our named executive officers and (vi) the proposal to approve the CIFC LLC Amended and Restated Share Option and Incentive
Plan.

        If however you fail to attend and vote by ballot at the Annual Meeting in person or submit your proxy, your shares will not be counted for purposes of determining
whether a quorum is present at the Annual Meeting and will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the proposal to authorize, approve and adopt of the Merger
Agreement but will not have any effect on (i) the advisory (non-binding) vote to approve compensation that will or may become payable to our named executive officers in
connection with the Merger, (ii) the vote regarding the adjournment of the Annual Meeting, if necessary or appropriate to, among other things, solicit additional proxies in
favor of the authorization, approval and adoption of the Merger Agreement, (iii) the election of the ten (10) members of the Board, (iv) the advisory (non-binding) vote to
approve the compensation of our

The Merger Agreement (Page 69 and Annex A)

        The Merger Agreement provides that at the effective time of the Merger (the "Effective Time"), Merger Sub will be merged with and into CIFC, with CIFC
surviving as a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. At the Effective Time, each outstanding common share, $0.001 par value ("Common Shares"), other than
(1) Common Shares held by Parent, Merger Sub or CIFC or any of their respective direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiaries, (2) Common Shares held by a holder
who has properly exercised dissenters' rights with respect to such Common Shares in accordance with Section 262 of the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware and (3) the Rollover Shares (as defined below), will be converted into the right to receive $11.36 in cash (the "Merger Consideration"), without interest
and subject to any withholding of taxes required by applicable law, and each common share of Merger Sub will be converted into one common share of the Surviving
Company. As a result, following the Merger we will be a privately-held company, wholly owned by Parent, and our Common Shares will be delisted from NASDAQ
and deregistered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). The terms and conditions of the Merger are contained in the Merger
Agreement, and any discussion of the Merger and the Merger Agreement are qualified in their entirety by reference to the Merger Agreement, a copy of which is
attached to this proxy statement as Annex A and incorporated herein by reference. The Merger Agreement should be read in its entirety as it is the legal document that
governs the Merger.

Record Date and Quorum (Page 25)

        You are entitled to receive notice of, and to vote at, the Annual Meeting if you owned Common Shares as of the close of business on October 12, 2016 (the
"Record Date" for determining those shareholders entitled to notice of and to vote at the Annual Meeting). You will have one vote for each Common Share that you
owned on the Record Date. As of the Record Date, there were 23,641,036 Common Shares outstanding.

        The presence at the Annual Meeting, in person or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the Common Shares outstanding and entitled to vote generally in the
election of directors to the Board as of the close of business on the Record Date will constitute a quorum.

Table of Contents

Required Vote (Page 22)

        In accordance with our Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement (the "LLC Agreement"), in order for the Merger Agreement to be
approved, shareholders holding at least a majority of the voting power of the Common Shares outstanding as of the close of business on the Record Date must vote
"FOR" the proposal to authorize, approve and adopt the Merger Agreement. In addition, under the Merger Agreement, the receipt of this vote is a condition to the
consummation of the Merger. A failure to vote your Common Shares or an abstention from voting your Common Shares will have the same effect as a vote
"AGAINST" the proposal to authorize, approve and adopt the Merger Agreement.

        The (1) proposal to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, compensation that will or may become payable to our named executive officers in connection
with the Merger, (2) proposal to adjourn the Annual Meeting from time to time, if necessary or appropriate to, among other things, solicit additional proxies if there are
insufficient votes at the time of the Annual Meeting, or any adjournment thereof, to approve the proposal to authorize, approve and adopt the Merger Agreement,
(3) advisory (non-binding) vote to approve the compensation of our named executive officers and (4) proposal to approve the Amended and Restated Plan, each
requires the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the Common Shares present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on such proposal at the
Annual Meeting.

        The proposal to elect ten (10) members of the Board requires the affirmative vote of a plurality of the votes cast at the Annual Meeting. The individuals who
receive the largest number of "FOR" votes cast are elected as directors, up to the maximum number of directors to be chosen at the Annual Meeting. Accordingly, the
ten (10) director nominees who receive the most "FOR" votes will be elected as directors.

Conditions to the Completion of the Merger (Page 85)

        The obligations of Parent, Merger Sub and CIFC to consummate the Merger are subject to the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted by applicable law) of
each of the following conditions:

• the Merger Agreement shall have been duly authorized, adopted and approved by the affirmative vote or consent of holders of the majority of the
outstanding Common Shares entitled to vote thereon in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware; 

• any applicable waiting period (and any extension thereof) under the Hart Scott Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the "HSR
Act") relating to the Merger will have expired or been terminated, which was satisfied as there is no filing required under the HSR Act in connection
with the Merger; and 

• no governmental entity having jurisdiction over any party to the Merger Agreement shall have enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced or entered any
laws or orders, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that make illegal, enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation of the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

        Our obligation to consummate the Merger is also subject to the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted by applicable law) at or prior to the Effective Time
of each of the following conditions:

• all of Parent's and Merger Sub's representations and warranties in the Merger Agreement are true and correct both when made and as of the closing

satisfied.

        Neither we nor Parent may rely on the failure of any condition set forth above to be satisfied to excuse such party's obligation to effect the Merger if such failure
was caused primarily by such party's failure to comply with its obligations set forth in the Merger Agreement to consummate and make effective the transactions
provided for therein.

Closing and Effective Time of the Merger (Page 70)

        We anticipate completing the Merger in the fourth quarter of 2016, subject to the authorization, approval and adoption of the Merger Agreement by our
shareholders as specified herein and the satisfaction or waiver of the other closing conditions.

Voting Agreement (Page 59 and Annex E)

        Concurrent with and as a condition to Parent entering into the Merger Agreement and incurring the obligations set forth therein, DFR Holdings, LLC ("DFR
Holdings") entered into the Voting Agreement with Parent and CIFC (the "Voting Agreement") with respect to all Common Shares beneficially owned by DFR
Holdings, together with any other Common Shares or voting securities of CIFC and any securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for Common Shares
or other voting securities of CIFC in each case that are acquired prior to termination of the Voting Agreement, pursuant to which DFR Holdings has agreed to vote in
favor of the Merger and the approval of the Merger Agreement and against any takeover proposals with a party other than Parent, and against other actions or
proposals that would reasonably be expected to result in a breach of the Merger Agreement or impede the timely consummation of the Merger. DFR Holdings
beneficially owns approximately 80% of the outstanding Common Shares as of the date hereof.

        The Voting Agreement will terminate on the earliest to occur of (i) the closing and (ii) the date of termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its
terms. In the event that there is any amendment to the Merger Agreement which (i) reduces the Merger Consideration or (ii) materially adversely effects the holders of
the Common Shares, DFR Holdings shall have no obligation to vote any of its Common Shares in favor of the Merger or with respect to the Merger Agreement as so
amended. See "Approval of the Merger and the Merger Agreement (Proposal 1)—Voting Agreement."

Recommendation of CIFC's Strategic Committee and Board (Pages 46 and 47)

        After careful consideration of, and based upon, the recommendation of a committee of the Board consisting of directors formed to consider strategic alternatives
for CIFC (the "Strategic Committee"), the Board (i) determined the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement are advisable and
fair to, and in the best interests of, CIFC and its shareholders, (ii) approved the execution, delivery and performance by CIFC of the Merger Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger and (iii) resolved, that the Merger Agreement and the related certificate of merger be
submitted to the holders of Common Shares for authorization, adoption and approval and recommended that the holders of Common Shares authorize, approve and
adopt the Merger Agreement, the related certificate of merger and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger. The Board recommends that
shareholders vote "FOR" the authorization, approval and adoption of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including
the Merger, "FOR" the proposal to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, compensation that will or may become payable to our named executive officers in
connection with the Merger and "FOR" the proposal to approve the proposal to adjourn the Annual Meeting from time to time, if necessary or appropriate to, among
other things, solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of the Annual Meeting, or any adjournment thereof, to approve the proposal to
authorize, approve and adopt the Merger Agreement.

        For a description of the reasons considered by our directors in deciding to recommend authorization, approval and adoption of the Merger Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger, by our shareholders, see "Approval of the Merger and the Merger Agreement (Proposal 1)
—Reasons for the Merger."

Opinion of the Board's Financial Advisor (Page 47 and Annex B)

        In connection with the Merger, on August 19, 2016, at a meeting of the Board, the Board's financial advisor, J.P. Morgan Securities LLC ("JPMorgan"), rendered
an oral opinion, confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated August 19, 2016, to the Board to the effect that, as of that date and based on and subject to the
various assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and limitations and qualifications on the review undertaken as described in its opinion, the Merger

Consideration to be received by holders of Common Shares pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.

        The full text of JPMorgan's opinion, which is attached as Annex B to this proxy statement and is incorporated herein by reference, describes the various
assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and limitations and qualifications on the review undertaken by JPMorgan. JPMorgan's opinion was
provided for the use and benefit of the Board (in its capacity as such) in their evaluation of the Merger Consideration from a financial point of view and did
not address any other aspect of the Merger or any other matter. The opinion did not address the relative merits of the Merger or other transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement as compared to any alternative transaction or opportunity that might be available to CIFC, nor did it address the
underlying business decision by CIFC to engage in the Merger. JPMorgan's opinion does not constitute a recommendation as to how any shareholder should
vote or act in connection with the Merger or any other matter. The summary of JPMorgan's opinion set forth below is qualified in its entirety by reference to the
full text of JPMorgan's opinion.

Treatment of Our Equity-Based Awards (Page 72)

        Share Options.    Each share option to purchase Common Shares that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, that has not been forfeited (or if
previously forfeited, is required to be reinstated if a change in control event or sale event occurs within a specified period following such forfeiture), will become fully
vested to the extent then unvested and be canceled in exchange for the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of (i) the total number
of Common Shares subject to the share option as of the Effective Time and (ii) the amount by which the Merger Consideration exceeds the exercise price per share of
Common Shares underlying the share option (but if the foregoing equals or is less than zero, such share option will be canceled and forfeited without payment).

        Time-Based Vesting Restricted Share Units.    Each time-based vesting restricted share unit award ("Company RSU") that is outstanding prior to the Effective
Time (other than certain specified Company RSUs and any Company RSU subject to a Rollover Agreement), that has not been forfeited (or if previously forfeited, is
required to be reinstated if a change in control event or sale event occurs within a specified period following such forfeiture), will be fully vested and be canceled in
exchange for the right to receive an amount in cash determined by multiplying (i) the Merger Consideration by (ii) the total number of Common Shares subject to such
Company RSU as of the Effective Time. In addition, certain Company RSUs that are entitled to receive dividend equivalents will be paid any accrued dividend
equivalents at the Effective Time.

        Performance-Based Vesting Restricted Share Units.    Each performance-based vesting restricted share unit award ("Company PSU") that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any Company PSU subject to a Rollover Agreement), that has not been forfeited (or if previously forfeited, is
required to be reinstated if a change in control event or sale event occurs within a specified period following such forfeiture), will be fully vested and be canceled and
the holder will be entitled to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the amount determined by multiplying (i) the Merger Consideration and (ii) the total
number of Common Shares subject to any such Company PSU (assuming such aggregate number of Common Shares shall be determined assuming the maximum
level of performance for such Company PSU except for those Company PSUs that become earned based on the Merger Consideration, in which case the total number
of Common Shares subject to any such Company PSU shall be based on the amount of the Merger Consideration). In addition, certain Company PSUs that are entitled
to receive dividend equivalents will be paid any accrued dividend equivalents at the Effective Time.

        Warrant.    CIFC currently has one warrant to acquire Common Shares ("Company Warrant") outstanding. At the Effective Time, CIFC Warrant will be
canceled in exchange for the right to receive pursuant to the terms of the Company Warrant (i) an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of (x) the
aggregate number of Common Shares for which such Company Warrant is exercisable into as of the Effective Time and (y) the amount by which the Merger
Consideration exceeds the exercise price per share of the Common Shares underlying the Company Warrant and (ii) the product of the aggregate number of Common
Shares for which such Company Warrant is exercisable, and the sum of the amount of dividends declared since the date of issuance of the Company Warrant prior to
the date of the Merger Agreement (which shall be an amount equal to $1.59) plus any dividends paid after the date of the Merger Agreement and prior to the closing.

Interests of our Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger (Page 60)

        In considering the recommendation of the Board with respect to the proposal to authorize, approve and adopt the Merger Agreement, you should be aware that
some of our directors and executive officers have interests in the Merger that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of our shareholders generally. Interests
of our executive officers and directors that may be different from or in addition to the interests of our shareholders include, among others:

• The entry into the Rollover Agreements by certain of the executive officers whereby they will each forego cash that would have been payable to them
in the future upon vesting dates following the Merger in respect of certain of their Company RSUs and Company PSUs in exchange for interests in
Parent, subject to vesting; 

• Accelerated vesting and cancellation of all other equity-based awards in exchange for a payment in cash calculated based on the Merger Consideration; 

• Certain of the executive officers and one director are party to employment or severance agreements pursuant to which payments and other benefits may
become payable in the event of terminations of employment under certain conditions (whether such terminations occur on, before or following the
consummation of the Merger). If each such executive officer and director experiences a termination of employment under certain specified
circumstances, whether before, on or following the Effective Time, the aggregate value of cash severance and other benefits to be received by the
executive officers and director is estimated to be approximately $5.9 million; 

• The Merger Agreement provides that Parent shall provide our employees, including our executive officers, certain levels of compensation and benefits
during the 12-month period commencing at the Effective Time; 

• Certain of the Company RSUs and Company PSUs held by CIFC's named executive officers are not entitled to dividend/distribution equivalent rights
in accordance with their terms, and the share options held by a director of CIFC and CIFC's named executive officers are not entitled to
dividend/distribution equivalent rights or adjustments to the exercise price as a result of dividends/distributions in accordance with their terms (such
Company RSUs, Company PSUs and share options, collectively, the "Non-Participating Equity Equivalents"). Contemporaneously with the signing
of the Merger Agreement, the Company announced that, as permitted by the Merger Agreement, the Board declared a cash distribution of $0.10 per
Common Share (the "Distribution"), which was the highest distribution allowable under the Merger Agreement. The Distribution was paid on
September 12, 2016 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on August 31, 2016. However, the Non-Participating Equity Equivalents held
by CIFC's named executive officers and the director did not receive the benefit of the Distribution;

Table of Contents

• Parent has agreed that certain of the executive officers will each be entitled to a 2016 bonus that is no less favorable than his respective bonus for 2015,
with the percentage of the 2016 bonus payable in cash to be no less than such percentage for 2015; 

• Executive officers and directors are entitled to continued indemnification and insurance coverage following consummation of the Merger under our
organizational documents and the Merger Agreement; and 

• Jeffrey S. Serota received a fee in the amount of $255,000 for serving as the chairperson of the Strategic Committee.

        If the proposal to authorize, approve and adopt the Merger Agreement is approved and adopted by our shareholders, the Common Shares held by our directors
and executive officers will be treated in the same manner as outstanding Common Shares held by all other shareholders of CIFC entitled to receive the Merger
Consideration.

        These interests are discussed in more detail in the section entitled "Approval of the Merger and the Merger Agreement (Proposal 1)—Interests of Our Directors
and Executive Officers in the Merger." The Board and Strategic Committee were aware of the different or additional interests set forth herein and considered such
interests along with other matters in approving the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger.

Financing (Page 58)

        Parent estimates that the total amount of funds required to consummate the Merger and related transactions and pay related fees and expenses will be
approximately $355 million. Parent expects this amount to be funded through a combination of the following:

• a cash equity investment of up to $340 million by Supreme Universal Holdings Limited (the "Sponsor") pursuant to an equity commitment letter (the
"Commitment Letter") by the Sponsor in favor of Parent; 

• the rollover of 100,000 Common Shares and 1,126,000 Common Shares underlying restricted share unit awards of held by Messrs. Vaccaro, Wriedt and
Sokolowski (collectively, the "Rollover Holders") that have agreed to contribute such Common Shares to Parent and/or have Parent assume certain
time-based vesting restricted share unit awards or performance-based vesting restricted share unit awards (such Common Shares, time-based vesting
restricted share unit awards and performance-based vesting restricted share unit awards, collectively, the "Rollover Shares") immediately prior to the
Merger, the equivalent of an investment of approximately $13,927,360 based upon the Merger Consideration; 

• Parent's available cash on hand at closing; and 

• Company's available cash on hand at closing.

        The consummation of the Merger is not subject to a financing condition. We believe the amount committed under the Commitment Letter will be sufficient to
complete the Merger, but we cannot assure you of that.

Limited Guarantee (Page 59)

        Concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, Supreme Universal Holdings Limited (in addition to its capacity as the Sponsor under the
Commitment Letter, the "Guarantor") executed

and delivered a limited guarantee in favor of CIFC (the "Guarantee"), pursuant to which the Guarantor has absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed
(each, an "Obligation"):

• any and all payment obligations of Parent and Merger Sub pursuant to and in accordance with the Merger Agreement (other than any payment
obligations arising from the enforcement of specific performance) and any and all liabilities and damages payable by Parent or Merger Sub arising
under or in connection with the Merger Agreement up to an amount not exceeding $340 million; or 

• the obligation of Parent to fund an amount equal to $340 million or such lesser amount which, when aggregated with any other cash that may be
available to Parent to satisfy its obligations under the Merger Agreement, in the aggregate is sufficient to fund the aggregate Merger Consideration, the
other amounts payable by Parent pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement and related fees and expenses described therein.

        The Guarantee will terminate upon the earliest to occur of:

• the closing; 

• the date that is ninety (90) days following the date upon which the Merger Agreement is terminated, except in the event a claim for payment is asserted
in writing against the Guarantor prior to such date; 

• the time at which either Obligation is performed or satisfied pursuant to the terms of the Guarantee; and 

• any time when CIFC or any Company Party asserts in writing in any litigation or other proceeding that the provisions of the Guarantee limiting the
Guarantor's aggregate liability, the continuing guarantee or the no recourse clause are illegal, invalid or unenforceable in whole or in part, or asserts that
the Guarantor is liable in excess of the cap, or asserts any theory of liability whatsoever against the Guarantor or any other non-party under or in
connection with the Guarantee, the Merger Agreement, the Commitment Letter or any of the transactions contemplated thereby other than a claim
(x) against the Guarantor for payment under the Guarantee or (y) against Parent or Merger Sub pursuant to the Merger Agreement.

Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger (Page 66)

        For U.S. federal income tax purposes, the receipt of cash by a U.S. Holder (as defined under "Approval of the Merger and the Merger Agreement (Proposal 1)—
Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger" beginning on page 66) in exchange for such U.S. Holder's Common Shares in the Merger generally
will result in the recognition of gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between (i) the sum of the cash such U.S. Holder receives in the Merger and
such U.S. Holder's pro rata share of the indebtedness, if any, of CIFC LLC and (ii) such U.S. Holder's adjusted tax basis in the Common Shares surrendered in the
Merger (including such U.S. Holder's pro rata share of the indebtedness, if any, of CIFC LLC). Shareholders (including Non-U.S. Holders (as defined under
"Approval of the Merger and the Merger Agreement (Proposal 1)—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger" beginning on page 66)
should consult their own tax advisors concerning the U.S. federal income tax consequences relating to the Merger in light of their particular circumstances
and any consequences arising under the laws of any U.S. state or local or non-U.S. taxing jurisdiction. A more complete description of the material U.S. federal
income tax consequences of the Merger is provided under "Approval of the Merger and the Merger Agreement (Proposal 1)—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax
Consequences of the Merger" beginning on page 66.

Regulatory Approvals (Page 69)

        There is no filing required under the HSR Act in connection with the Merger, and therefore, the condition related to the HSR Act has been satisfied.

Acquisition Proposals (Page 78)

        We have agreed to, and to cause each of our subsidiaries to, direct their and our respective affiliates, directors, officers, employees, representatives or other
intermediaries to:

• cease any and all existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any parties conducted prior to signing the Merger Agreement with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal (as defined in "The Merger Agreement—Acquisition Proposals") and terminate online data room access to all such parties and
their representatives; and 

• not, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate, or knowingly facilitate any inquiry, proposal or offer with respect to any Acquisition Proposal; (ii) enter
into any agreement (x) to consummate any Acquisition Proposal, (y) to approve any Acquisition Proposal or (z) requiring us to abandon, terminate or
fail to consummate the Merger; (iii) enter into or participate in any discussions or negotiations in connection with any Acquisition Proposal or inquiry
with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, or furnish any non-public information with respect to our business, properties or assets in connection with any
Acquisition Proposal; (iv) waive, terminate, modify or release any person (other than Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Affiliates) from any
provision, of or grant any permission, waiver or request under any "standstill" or similar agreement or obligation, unless the Board has determined in
good faith after consultation with outside legal counsel that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with our fiduciary duties under applicable
law; and (v) agree to resolve to take, or take, any of the actions prohibited by clause (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) of this sentence.

        Notwithstanding these restrictions, we, directly or indirectly through our affiliates, directors, officers, employees, representatives or other intermediaries, may,
prior to the adoption of the Merger Agreement by the affirmative vote or consent of the holders of a majority of our outstanding Common Shares:

• engage in negotiations or discussions with any person (and its representatives and intermediaries) that has made an unsolicited bona fide written
Acquisition Proposal not resulting from or arising out of a breach of our non-solicitation obligations under the Merger Agreement; and/or 

• furnish to such person information relating to us or any of our subsidiaries pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement (as defined in "The
Merger Agreement—Acquisition Proposals") and to the extent nonpublic information that has not been made available to Parent is made available to
such person, make available or furnish such nonpublic information to Parent promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) following the time it is
provided to such person.

        In the case of each scenario listed above, we may only take such action, if, and only if, prior to taking such particular action, the Board has determined in good
faith after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to, a
Superior Proposal (as defined in "The Merger Agreement—Acquisition Proposals"), and that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under applicable law.

Change of Recommendation

        Subject to our compliance with our obligations under the Merger Agreement, including providing Parent with advance notice and giving Parent an opportunity to
make revisions to the Merger Agreement, at any time prior to the authorization, approval and adoption of the Merger Agreement by our shareholders, the Board may
under certain circumstances, including that the Board has determined in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that the
failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law:

• withdraw, modify or amend in any manner adverse to Parent its approval or recommendation of the Merger Agreement or the Merger or recommend an
Acquisition Proposal, or enter into a Company Acquisition Agreement (as defined below) or resolve or agree to take any of the foregoing actions (we
refer to any of the foregoing actions as a "Company Adverse Recommendation Change"); or 

• in the case of an Acquisition Proposal that is a Superior Proposal, terminate the Merger Agreement to enter into a definitive acquisition agreement with
respect to such Acquisition Proposal if we pay the applicable termination fee to Parent substantially concurrently with such termination, as further
described in "The Merger Agreement—Termination of the Merger Agreement" and "The Merger Agreement—Termination Fee."

Termination of the Merger Agreement (Page 87)

        The Merger Agreement may be terminated by mutual written consent of CIFC and Parent at any time before the Effective Time. In addition, at any time prior to
the Effective Time (regardless of whether our shareholders have previously approved and adopted the Merger Agreement) either CIFC or Parent may terminate the
Merger Agreement under certain circumstances, including, if:

• the Merger shall not have been consummated on or before January 31, 2017; provided that this right will not be available to any party whose material
breach (including in the case of Parent a material breach by Merger Sub) of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set forth in the Merger
Agreement has been a principal cause of, or principally resulted in, the failure of the Merger to be consummated on or before January 31, 2017; 

• any statute, rule, regulation or other applicable law shall have been adopted or promulgated after the date of the Merger Agreement, or any restraining
order, injunction or other order has been issued after the date hereof by a court or other governmental entity of competent jurisdiction, having the effect
of making the Merger illegal or permanently enjoining or otherwise permanently prohibiting the consummation of the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement, and such statute, rule, regulation, other law, restraining order, injunction or other order shall have become final
and nonappealable; provided that this right will not be available to any party whose material breach (including in the case of Parent a material breach
by Merger Sub) of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set forth in the Merger Agreement has been a principal cause of, or principally
resulted in, the adoption, promulgation or issuance of any such statute, rule, regulation, other law, restraining order, injunction or other order; 

• the meeting of shareholders to authorize, approve and adopt the Merger Agreement has been held and completed, and the holders of the outstanding
Common Shares failed to authorize, adopt and approve the Merger Agreement; or 

• the other party has breached any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements in the Merger Agreement such that the conditions to close
the Merger (as set forth in "The Merger Agreement—Conditions to the Completion of the Merger") would not be satisfied and such breach

has not been cured to the extent permitted and by the date provided for in the Merger Agreement.

        In addition, we may terminate the Merger Agreement if:

• prior to the authorization, approval and adoption of the Merger Agreement by our shareholders, the Board authorizes CIFC, in compliance with the
applicable terms of the Merger Agreement to enter into a Company Acquisition Agreement (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement) in
respect of a Superior Proposal and concurrently with, and as a condition to, such termination, CIFC shall have paid to Parent the termination fee
required to be paid as described in "The Merger Agreement—Termination Fee."

        And Parent may terminate the Merger Agreement if:

• prior to the authorization, approval and adoption of the Merger Agreement by our shareholders, the Board makes a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change; or 

• there is a tender offer or exchange offer relating to the Common Shares commenced by a third party unaffiliated with Parent and we have not sent to
our shareholders, pursuant to Rule 14e-2 under the Securities Act, a statement reaffirming the Board's recommendation of the Merger and
recommending that our shareholders reject such tender or exchange offer.

        The Merger Agreement provides that the amount of the termination fee payable by us is $13,332,000 (the "Termination Fee") in the event: we terminate the
Merger Agreement to accept an Acquisition Proposal that is a Superior Proposal or, Parent terminates the Merger Agreement following a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change or we fail to send to our shareholders a statement reaffirming the Board's recommendation of the Merger and recommending that our
shareholders reject such tender or exchange offer following a tender or exchange offer commenced by a third party unaffiliated with Parent, or in certain other
circumstances all as described more fully under "The Merger Agreement—Termination Fee."

Appraisal Rights (Page 133)

        CIFC LLC shareholders who do not vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement, who continuously hold their Common Shares through the Effective
Time and who otherwise comply precisely with the applicable provisions of Section 262 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the "DGCL") will
be entitled to seek appraisal of the fair value of their Common Shares, as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, if the Merger is completed. The "fair value"
of your Common Shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery could be greater than, the same as, or less than the value of the Merger Consideration that
you would otherwise be entitled to receive under the terms of the Merger Agreement.

        CIFC LLC shareholders who wish to exercise the right to seek an appraisal of their Common Shares must so advise us by submitting a written demand for
appraisal in the form described in this proxy statement prior to the vote to adopt the Merger Agreement and must otherwise follow the procedures prescribed by
Section 262 of the DGCL. A person having a beneficial interest in Common Shares held of record in the name of another person, such as a nominee or intermediary,
must act promptly to cause the record holder to follow the steps summarized in this proxy statement and in a timely manner to perfect appraisal rights.

        The text of Section 262 of the DGCL is included as Annex C to this proxy statement. You are encouraged to read these provisions carefully and in their entirety.
Due to the complexity of the procedures for exercising appraisal rights, CIFC LLC shareholders who are considering exercising such rights are encouraged to seek the
advice of legal counsel and their financial advisors. Failure to strictly comply with these provisions may result in the loss of appraisal rights.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE ANNUAL MEETING AND THE MERGER 

        The following questions and answers address briefly some commonly asked questions regarding the Annual Meeting, the Merger Agreement and the Merger. These
questions and answers may not address all questions that may be important to you as a shareholder. Please refer to the more detailed information contained elsewhere in this
proxy statement, the annexes to this proxy statement and the documents incorporated by reference herein.

Q: Why am I receiving this proxy statement? 

A: We are sending you this proxy statement and the accompanying materials in connection with the solicitation of proxies by the Board and to help you decide how to
vote your Common Shares with respect to the proposed Merger and the other matters to be considered at the Annual Meeting.

On August 19, 2016, CIFC entered into the Merger Agreement providing for the Merger of Merger Sub, a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, with and into CIFC,
with CIFC surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. The Merger cannot be completed unless holders of a majority of the outstanding Common
Shares vote in favor of the proposal to authorize, approve and adopt the Merger Agreement.

Q: What will I receive in the Merger? 

A: If the Merger is completed you will be entitled to receive $11.36 in cash, without interest and subject to any withholding of taxes required by applicable law, for each
Common Share that you own. You will not be entitled to receive shares in the Surviving Company or in Parent, unless you are a Rollover Holder. 

Q: What was the market price of our shares at the time we entered into the Merger Agreement as compared to the Merger Consideration agreed upon by the
parties in the Merger Agreement? 

A: On August 19, 2016, the date on which we entered into the Merger Agreement, the closing price for our common shares was $6.95 per share, as compared to the
merger consideration of $11.36 per share agreed to by the parties in the Merger Agreement. 

Q: How will our directors and executive officers vote on the proposal to authorize, approve and adopt the Merger Agreement? 

A: Our directors and executive officers have informed us that, as of the date of this proxy statement, they intend to vote in favor of the proposal to authorize, approve
and adopt the Merger Agreement.

As of the Record Date, our directors and executive officers owned, in the aggregate, 4.52% of our outstanding Common Shares.

In addition, on August 19, 2016, DFR Holdings entered into the Voting Agreement in its capacity as a holder of 18,822,175 Common Shares representing
approximately 80% of the Common Shares outstanding as of the date hereof, pursuant to which DFR Holdings agreed, inter alia, to vote in favor of the Merger and
the approval of the Merger Agreement. As such, CIFC expects to obtain the required vote of shareholders necessary to approve the Merger.

Q: Do any of our directors or executive officers have interests in the Merger that may differ from, or be in addition to, my interests as a shareholder? 

A: Yes. In considering the recommendation of the Board with respect to the proposal to authorize, approve and adopt the Merger Agreement, you should be aware that
our directors and executive

Table of Contents

officers have interests in the Merger that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of our shareholders generally. The Board and the Strategic Committee were
aware of, and considered, these differing interests, among other matters, in evaluating and negotiating the Merger Agreement, and the Board recommended that the
Merger Agreement be approved and adopted by our shareholders. See "Approval of the Merger and the Merger Agreement (Proposal 1)—Interests of Our Directors
and Executive Officers in the Merger."

Q: What is a quorum? 

A: A quorum of shareholders is necessary to hold a valid meeting. A quorum will be present if holders of a majority of the Common Shares outstanding as of the close
of business on the Record Date are present in person or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting. In the absence of a quorum at the Annual Meeting, the Annual
Meeting will be adjourned to the next business day at the same time and place or to such other day, time and place as the Board may determine.

Your shares will be counted towards the quorum only if you submit a valid proxy (or one is submitted on your behalf by your broker, bank or other nominee) or if you
vote in person at the Annual Meeting.

If your shares are held in "street name" by your broker, bank or other nominee and you do not tell the nominee how to vote your shares, these shares will not be
counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present for the transaction of business at the Annual Meeting.

Q: What happens if the Merger is not consummated? 

A: If the Merger Agreement is not authorized, approved and adopted by our shareholders, or if the Merger is not consummated for any other reason, our shareholders
will not receive any payment for their Common Shares. Instead, we will remain a public company and our Common Shares will continue to be listed and traded on
NASDAQ, and we will continue to file periodic reports with the SEC.

Under specified circumstances, we may be required to pay Parent a Termination Fee upon or following the termination of the Merger Agreement. See "The Merger
Agreement—Termination Fee."

Q: What will happen if shareholders do not approve the advisory (non-binding) proposal on executive compensation that will or may become payable to our
named executive officers in connection with the Merger? 

A: The approval of this proposal is not a condition to the completion of the Merger. SEC rules require us to seek approval on an advisory (non-binding) basis of certain
payments that will or may become payable to our named executive officers in connection with the Merger. The vote on this proposal is an advisory vote and will not
be binding on us or on Parent. If the Merger Agreement is authorized, approved and adopted by our shareholders and the Merger is completed, the Merger-related
compensation may be paid to our named executive officers even if shareholders fail to approve this proposal. 

Q: What am I being asked to vote on at the Annual Meeting? 

A. You are being asked to (1) approve the Merger and the Merger Agreement, (2) approve on an advisory (non-binding) basis the compensation that will or may become
payable to our named executive officers in connection with the consummation of the Merger, (3) approve any adjournments of the Annual Meeting for the purpose of
soliciting additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes at the Annual Meeting to approve the Merger and the Merger Agreement,

(4) elect ten (10) members of our Board, (5) approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the compensation of our named executive officers, (6) approve the
Amended and Restated Plan, and (7) transact any other business that may properly come before the Annual Meeting and any adjournment or postponement thereof.

Q: Are there any other matters to be addressed at the Annual Meeting? 

A At this time, we do not know of any other matters to be brought before the Annual Meeting, but if other matters are properly brought before such meeting or at any
adjournment or postponement of such meeting, the persons named as proxies on the enclosed proxy card will have discretionary authority to vote all proxies with
respect to such matters in accordance with their discretion. 

Q: When and where is the Annual Meeting? 

A: The Annual Meeting will be held on November 16, 2016 at 10:00 a.m., Eastern time, at the offices of CIFC LLC, 250 Park Avenue, 4th Floor, New York, New York
10177. 

Q: Who can vote and attend the Annual Meeting? 

A: All holders of record of Common Shares as of the Record Date are entitled to receive notice of, attend and vote at the Annual Meeting or any postponements or
adjournments of the Annual Meeting. Our official Common Share ownership records will conclusively determine whether a shareholder is a "holder of record" as of
the Record Date. If you hold your Common Shares through a broker, bank or other nominee and wish to vote in person at the Annual Meeting, you must obtain a
"legal proxy," executed in your favor, from the broker, bank or other nominee (which may take several days). 

Q: How many votes do I have? 

A: Each shareholder is entitled to one vote on each matter properly brought before the Annual Meeting for each Common Share held of record as of the Record Date. As
of the Record Date, there were 23,641,036 Common Shares outstanding, held by 477 holders of record. 

Q How does the Board recommend that I vote at the Annual Meeting? 

A: The Board recommends that shareholders vote "FOR" the adoption of the Merger and the Merger Agreement, "FOR" each of the director nominees and "FOR" each
of the other proposals described in this proxy statement. 

Q: What do I need to do now? 

A: We urge you to read this proxy statement carefully, including its annexes and the documents incorporated by reference herein, and to consider how the Merger affects
you. Then complete, sign, date and return, as promptly as possible, the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying postage-paid envelope or submit your proxy
electronically over the internet or by telephone, so that your shares can be voted at the Annual Meeting. If you hold your shares in "street name," please refer to the
voting instruction forms provided by your bank, broker or other nominee to vote your shares. Please do not send your share certificates with your proxy card. Your
vote is important. A failure to vote your Common Shares will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the proposal to authorize, approve and adopt the Merger
Agreement.

Table of Contents

Q: How do I vote my Common Shares? 

A: If you are a shareholder of record (that is, if your Common Shares are registered in your name with American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, our transfer
agent), there are four ways to vote: 

• by completing, dating, signing and returning the enclosed proxy card by mail using the accompanying postage-paid envelope; 

• by calling the toll-free number (within U.S. or Canada) listed on your proxy card; 

• by submitting a proxy over the internet, at the address provided on your proxy card; or 

• by attending the Annual Meeting and voting in person.

If you hold your shares in "street name" through a broker, bank or other nominee, you should follow the directions provided by your broker, bank or other nominee
regarding how to instruct your broker, bank or other nominee to vote your shares. Without those instructions, your shares will not be voted, which will have the same
effect as voting "AGAINST" the proposal to authorize, approve and adopt the Merger Agreement.

Q: What should I do if I want to attend the Annual Meeting and vote in person? 

A: All holders of Common Shares as of the close of business on the Record Date for the Annual Meeting, including shareholders of record and beneficial owners of
Common Shares registered in the "street name" of a bank, broker or other nominee, are invited to attend the Annual Meeting. If you are a shareholder of record,
please be prepared to provide proper identification, such as a driver's license. If you hold your shares in "street name," you will need to provide proof of ownership,
such as a recent account statement or voting instruction form provided by your bank, broker or other nominee or other similar evidence of ownership, along with
proper identification.

Even if you plan to attend the Annual Meeting in person, we encourage you to complete, sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card or vote electronically over the
internet or via telephone to ensure that your shares will be represented at the Annual Meeting. If you attend the Annual Meeting and vote in person, your vote by
ballot will revoke any proxy previously submitted. If you hold your shares in "street name," because you are not the shareholder of record, you may not vote your
shares in person at the Annual Meeting unless you request and obtain a valid "legal" proxy from your bank, broker or other nominee.

Q: Can I revoke my proxy? 

A: Yes. You can revoke your proxy at any time before the vote is taken at the Annual Meeting. If you are a shareholder of record, you may revoke your proxy by
notifying our Secretary in writing to Julian Weldon, Secretary, c/o CIFC LLC, 250 Park Avenue, 4th Floor, New York, New York 10177, or by submitting a new
proxy by telephone, the internet or mail, in each case, dated after the date of the proxy being revoked. In addition, you may revoke your proxy by attending the
Annual Meeting and voting in person (simply attending the Annual Meeting will not cause your proxy to be revoked). Please note that if you hold your shares in
"street name" and you have instructed a broker, bank or other nominee to vote your shares, the above-described options for revoking your voting instructions do not
apply, and instead you must follow the instructions received from your broker, bank or other nominee to revoke your voting instructions. 

Q: What happens if I do not vote? 

A: The vote required to authorize, approve and adopt the Merger Agreement is based on the total number of Common Shares outstanding as of the close of business on
the Record Date, not just

the shares that are voted. If you do not vote, it will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the proposal to authorize, approve and adopt the Merger Agreement.

If the Merger is completed, whether or not you voted at the Annual Meeting, you will be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration for your Common Shares upon
completion of the Merger (unless you have properly exercised your appraisal rights with respect to such shares).

Q: If my shares are held in "street name" by my broker, bank or other nominee, will my broker, banker or other nominee vote my shares for me? 

A: Your broker will not vote your shares on your behalf unless you provide instructions to your broker on how to vote. You should follow the directions provided by
your broker regarding how to instruct it to vote your shares. Without those instructions, your shares will not be voted, which will have the same effect as voting
"AGAINST" the authorization, approval and adoption of the Merger Agreement, but will not have any effect on (1) the advisory (non-binding) vote to approve
compensation that will or may become payable to our named executive officers in connection with the Merger, (2) the vote regarding the adjournment of the Annual
Meeting, if necessary or appropriate to, among other things, solicit additional proxies in favor of the authorization, approval and adoption of the Merger Agreement,
(3) the election of the ten (10) members of the Board, (4) the advisory (non-binding) vote to approve the compensation of our named executive officers or (5) the
proposal to approve the Amended and Restated Plan. 

Q: Will my shares held in "street name" or another form of record ownership be combined for voting purposes with shares I hold of record? 

A: No. Because any shares you may hold in "street name" will be deemed to be held by a different shareholder than any shares you hold of record, any shares so held
will not be combined for voting purposes with shares you hold of record. Similarly, if you own shares in various registered forms, such as jointly with your spouse, as
trustee of a trust or as custodian for a minor, you will receive, and will need to sign and return, a separate proxy card for those shares because they are held in a
different form of record ownership. Common Shares held by a corporation or business entity must be voted by an authorized officer of the entity. Common Shares
held in an individual retirement account must be voted under the rules governing the account. 

Q: What happens if I sell my Common Shares before completion of the Merger? 

A: If you transfer your Common Shares before completion of the Merger, you will have transferred your right to receive the Merger Consideration in connection with the
Merger. In order to receive the Merger Consideration, you must hold your Common Shares through completion of the Merger.

The Record Date for shareholders entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting is earlier than the date on which the Merger will be consummated. Consequently, if you
transfer your Common Shares after the Record Date but before the Annual Meeting, you will have transferred your right to receive the Merger Consideration in the
Merger, but retained the right to vote at the Annual Meeting.

Q: Should I send in my share certificates or other evidence of ownership now? How will I receive Merger Consideration for my shares? 

A: No, do not send in your certificates now. After the Merger is completed, if you hold shares represented by certificates, you will receive a letter of transmittal from
the paying agent for the Merger with detailed written instructions for exchanging your Common Shares for the Merger Consideration and if you hold book-entry
shares you will receive a check or wire transfer for the Merger Consideration with respect to such shares. If your Common Shares are held in "street

name" by your broker, bank or other nominee, you may receive instructions from your broker, bank or other nominee as to what action, if any, you need to take to
effect the surrender of your "street name" shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration.

Q: I do not know where my share certificate is—how will I get the Merger Consideration for my shares? 

A: If the Merger is completed, the transmittal materials you will receive after the completion of the Merger will include the procedures that you must follow if you
cannot locate your share certificate. This will include an affidavit that you will need to sign attesting to the loss of your share certificate. You may also be required to
provide a customary indemnity agreement in order to cover any potential loss. 

Q: Am I entitled to exercise appraisal rights instead of receiving the Merger Consideration for my Common Shares? 

A: Yes. Shareholders are entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL, provided they follow the procedures and satisfy the conditions set forth in
Section 262 of the DGCL. For more information regarding appraisal rights, see the section entitled "Appraisal Rights" beginning on page 133. In addition, a copy of
Section 262 of the DGCL is attached as Annex C to this proxy statement. Failure to strictly comply with Section 262 of the DGCL may result in your waiver of, or
inability to, exercise appraisal rights.

Dissenters' rights will not apply if the proposed Merger is not consummated for any reason.

The foregoing disclosure does not constitute legal advice to any shareholder and is not to be construed or relied upon as such. In particular, CIFC and its directors and
officers assume no responsibility to any shareholder for the accuracy or completeness of the foregoing summary. Shareholders should, at their own expense, seek
independent legal advice as to their rights.

Q: What are the U.S. federal income tax consequences of exchanging my Common Shares of CIFC LLC pursuant to the Merger? 

A: If you are a U.S. Holder (as defined under "Approval of the Merger and the Merger Agreement (Proposal 1)—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the
Merger" beginning on page 66), the exchange of Common Shares for cash in the Merger generally will result in the recognition of gain or loss for U.S. federal
income tax purposes in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between (i) the amount of cash received in the Merger and such U.S. Holder's pro rata share of the
indebtedness, if any, of CIFC LLC and (ii) such U.S. Holder's adjusted tax basis in the Common Shares surrendered in the Merger (including such U.S. Holder's pro
rata share of the indebtedness, if any, of CIFC LLC). Shareholders (including Non-U.S. Holders (as defined under "Approval of the Merger and the Merger
Agreement (Proposal 1)—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger" beginning on page 66)) should consult their own tax advisors concerning
the U.S. federal income tax consequences relating to the Merger in light of their particular circumstances and any consequences arising under the laws of any U.S.
state or local or non-U.S. taxing jurisdiction. A more complete description of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger is provided under
"Approval of the Merger and the Merger Agreement (Proposal 1)—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger" beginning on page 66. 

Q: What does it mean if I get more than one proxy card or voting instruction card? 

A: If your shares are registered differently or are held in more than one account, you will receive more than one proxy card or voting instruction card. Please complete
and return all of the proxy

cards or voting instruction cards you receive (or submit each of your proxies by telephone or the internet, if available to you) to ensure that all of your shares are
voted.

Q: What is householding and how does it affect me? 

A: The SEC permits companies to send a single set of proxy materials to any household at which two (2) or more shareholders reside, unless contrary instructions have
been received, but only if the applicable company provides advance notice and follows certain procedures. In such cases, each shareholder continues to receive a
separate notice of the meeting and proxy card. Certain brokerage firms may have instituted householding for beneficial owners of Common Shares held through
brokerage firms. If your family has multiple accounts holding Common Shares, you may have already received a householding notification from your broker. Please
contact your broker directly if you have any questions or require additional copies of this proxy statement. The broker will arrange for delivery of a separate copy of
this proxy statement promptly upon your written or oral request. You may decide at any time to revoke your decision to household, and thereby receive multiple
copies. 

Q: Who can help answer my other questions? 

A: If you have any questions about the Annual Meeting or the Merger, would like additional copies of the proxy statement or need assistance with voting your shares,
please call CIFC at (646) 367-6633 or contact our investor relations department by email at Investor@cifc.com.

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

        This proxy statement, and the documents incorporated by reference herein, include "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation
Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are subject to numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties which change over time and which could cause the actual
results to differ materially from such forward-looking statements. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by words such as "believe," "expect," "may,"
"could," "should," "plan," "project," "anticipate," "intend," "estimate," "will," "contemplate," "would" and the negative of these terms and other similar expressions that
contemplate future events. Such forward-looking statements include statements about the expected completion and timing of the Merger and other information relating to the
Merger. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in forward-looking statements contained in or incorporated by reference into this proxy statement are reasonable,
we cannot assure you that the actual results or developments we anticipate will be realized, or even if realized, that they will have the expected effects on our business or
operations. The forward-looking statements contained in or incorporated by reference into this proxy statement speak only as of the date on which such statements were
made, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements made in this proxy statement or elsewhere as a result of new information, future
events or otherwise. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by any forward-looking statements contained in or incorporated
by reference in this proxy statement include:

• the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could give rise to the termination of the Merger Agreement; 

• the inability to consummate the proposed Merger due to the failure to obtain shareholder approval for the proposed Merger or the failure to satisfy other
conditions to completion of the proposed Merger; 

• the failure to obtain the necessary financing arrangements as set forth in the Commitment Letter delivered pursuant to the Merger Agreement, or the failure of
the proposed Merger to close for any other reason; 

• risks related to disruption of management's attention from CIFC's ongoing business operations due to the proposed transaction; 

• the outcome of any legal proceedings, regulatory proceedings or enforcement matters that may be instituted against CIFC and others relating to the Merger
Agreement; 

• the risk that the pendency of the proposed Merger disrupts current plans and operations and the potential difficulties in employee retention as a result of the
pendency of the proposed Merger; 

• the effect of the announcement of the proposed Merger on CIFC's relationships with its clients, operating results and business generally; 

• the amount of the costs, fees, expenses and charges related to the proposed Merger; 

• changes in general economic conditions or the economic conditions of the industries and markets within which we operate; 

• declines in our share price which may occur if the Merger is not completed within the expected time frame or at all; 

• the potential adverse effect on our business, properties and operations because of certain covenants we agreed to in the Merger Agreement;

• certain of our executive officers and directors have interests in the Merger that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of our shareholders generally,
which could have influenced their decision to support or approve the Merger; 

• the Merger Agreement contains provisions that could discourage a potential acquiror of CIFC from seeking to acquire CIFC or could result in a competing
proposal being offered at a lower price than it might otherwise be; 

• the Merger Agreement contains provisions that grant the Board the ability to terminate the Merger Agreement in certain circumstances based on the exercise
of the directors' duties; 

• the fact that receipt of the all-cash Merger Consideration would be taxable to our shareholders that are treated as U.S. persons for U.S. federal income tax
purposes; and 

• other risks detailed in our filings with the SEC, including those discussed in the sections titled "Risk Factors" and "Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-
Looking Statements" in our most recent filings on Forms 10-K and 10-Q.

        Many of the factors that will determine our future results are beyond our ability to control or predict. In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in the forward-
looking statements contained herein, you should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which reflect management's views only as of the date hereof. We
cannot guarantee any future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements.

        Forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as predictions of actual results. Subject to any continuing obligations under applicable law, we expressly disclaim
any obligation to disseminate, after the date of this proxy statement, any updates or revisions to any such forward-looking statements to reflect any change in expectations or
events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statements are based.

THE ANNUAL MEETING 

Date, Time and Place of the Annual Meeting

        This proxy statement is being furnished to our shareholders as part of the solicitation of proxies by the Board for use at the Annual Meeting to be held at the offices of
CIFC LLC, 250 Park Avenue, 4th Floor, New York, New York 10177 on November 16, 2016, beginning at 10:00 a.m., Eastern time, or at any adjournment or postponement
thereof.

Purpose of the Annual Meeting

        The purpose of the Annual Meeting is for you to consider and vote on the following matters:

1. to authorize, approve and adopt the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of August 19, 2016 (as it may be amended from time to time, the "Merger
Agreement"), by and among CIFC LLC, F.A.B. Holdings I LP and CIFC Acquisition, LLC; 

2. to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, compensation that will or may become payable to our named executive officers in connection with the merger
contemplated by the Merger Agreement (the "Merger"); 

3. to approve the proposal to adjourn the Annual Meeting from time to time, if necessary or appropriate to, among other things, solicit additional proxies if there
are insufficient votes at the time of the Annual Meeting, or any adjournment thereof, to approve the proposal to authorize, approve and adopt the Merger
Agreement; 

4. to elect ten (10) members of the CIFC LLC board of directors (the "Board") named in, and for the term described in, this proxy statement; 

5. to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the compensation of our named executive officers; 

6. to approve the Amended and Restated Plan; and 

7. to transact any other business that may properly come before the Annual Meeting and any adjournment or postponement thereof.

        We are not aware of any other business to be acted upon at the Annual Meeting or any postponements or adjournments thereof. If, however, other matters are properly
brought before the Annual Meeting or any postponements or adjournments thereof, the persons named as proxies on the enclosed proxy card will vote on those matters in
their discretion.

        The affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the outstanding Common Shares entitled to vote thereon as of the close of business on the record date for the Annual
Meeting is required to approve the Merger Agreement and for the Merger to occur. A copy of the Merger Agreement is attached as Annex A to this proxy statement, which
we encourage you to read carefully in its entirety.

Required Vote

        It is very important that ALL of our shareholders vote their Common Shares, so please promptly authorize your proxy by either completing and returning the enclosed
proxy card in the postage-paid envelope as promptly as possible or submitting your proxy or voting instructions by telephone or over the internet. As of the record date, there
were approximately 23,641,036 Common Shares outstanding. The votes required to approve each proposal are as follows:

• Proposal 1 (Approval of the Merger and the Merger Agreement).  The approval of the Merger and the Merger Agreement requires the affirmative vote, in
person or by proxy, of holders of a majority of the outstanding Common Shares entitled to vote thereon as of the close of business

on the Record Date. Each holder of Common Shares entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting is entitled to cast one vote on each matter presented at the Annual
Meeting for each Common Share owned by such shareholder on the Record Date. Because the required vote for this proposal is based on the number of votes
our shareholders are entitled to cast rather than on the number of votes cast, failure to vote your Common Shares (including failure to give voting
instructions to your broker, bank or other nominee) and abstentions will have the same effect as voting "AGAINST" the proposal to approve the
Merger and the Merger Agreement. Approval of this proposal is a condition to the completion of the Merger. In the event this proposal is not approved,
the Merger cannot be completed.

• Proposal 2 (Merger-Related Compensation Proposal).  The approval, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, of the Merger-Related Compensation Proposal
requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the votes cast on the proposal at the Annual Meeting. If a shareholder fails to cast a vote on this
proposal, in person or by authorizing a proxy, such failure will not have any effect on the outcome of this proposal. In addition, abstentions are not considered
votes cast and therefore will have no effect on the outcome of this proposal. As a non-binding advisory vote, the result of this proposal will not be binding on
us, our Board or our compensation committee. 

• Proposal 3 (Adjournment Proposal).  The approval of the Adjournment Proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the votes cast on
the proposal at the Annual Meeting. If a shareholder fails to cast a vote on this proposal, in person or by authorizing a proxy, such failure will not have any
effect on the outcome of this proposal. In addition, abstentions are not considered votes cast and therefore will have no effect on the outcome of this proposal. 

• Proposal 4 (Election of Directors).  The election of a nominee to the Board requires the affirmative vote of a plurality of the votes cast by shareholders
present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting. If a shareholder fails to cast a vote on this proposal, in person or by
authorizing a proxy, such failure will not have any effect on the outcome of this proposal. In addition, abstentions are not considered votes cast and therefore
will have no effect on the outcome of this proposal. 

• Proposal 5 (Advisory (Non-Binding) Vote on Named Executive Officer Compensation).  The approval, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, of the
compensation paid to our named executive officers requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the votes cast on the proposal. If a shareholder
fails to cast a vote on this proposal, in person or by authorizing a proxy, such failure will not have any effect on the outcome of this proposal. In addition,
abstentions are not considered votes cast and therefore will have no effect on the outcome of this proposal. As a non-binding advisory vote, the result of this
proposal will not be binding on us, our Board or our compensation committee. 

• Proposal 6 (Approval of the Amended and Restated Plan).  The approval of the Amended and Restated Plan requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a
majority of the votes cast on the proposal. If a shareholder fails to cast a vote on this proposal, in person or by authorizing a proxy, such failure will not have
any effect on the outcome of this proposal. In addition, abstentions are not considered votes cast and therefore will have no effect on the outcome of this
proposal. 

• Other Business.  Approval of any other business that may properly come before the Annual Meeting and any adjournment or postponement thereof requires
the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the votes cast on the proposal.

        Brokers normally have discretion to vote on routine matters, but not on non-routine matters, such as approval of the Merger and the Merger Agreement, the merger-
related compensation proposal, the adjournment proposal, election of directors and executive compensation proposals. A "broker non-vote" occurs when a broker does not
have discretionary voting authority on a non-routine matter because the broker has not received instructions from its client as to how to vote on a particular proposal. Your
broker does not have discretionary authority to vote on the approval of the proposals to be considered at the Annual Meeting, in which case a broker non-vote will occur and
your shares will not be voted on these matters. Accordingly, it is particularly important that beneficial owners instruct their brokers how they wish to vote their shares. The
failure by the holders of Common Shares to attend the Annual Meeting and vote or authorize a proxy to vote their Common Shares at the Annual Meeting will
have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the proposal to approve the Merger and the Merger Agreement, as will abstentions. If you properly sign, date and return
a proxy card but do not indicate how your shares should be voted on a matter, the shares represented by your proxy will be voted as the Board recommended (i.e., "FOR"
the proposal to approve the Merger and the Merger Agreement and the other proposals recommended by the Board).

        Votes cast by proxy or in person at the Annual Meeting will be counted by the person appointed by us to act as inspector of election for the Annual Meeting. The
inspector of election will also determine whether a quorum is present at the Annual Meeting.

Determinations and Recommendation of the Board

        After careful consideration of, and based upon, the recommendation of the Strategic Committee, the Board:

          (i)  determined the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement are advisable and fair to, and in the best interests of, CIFC
and its shareholders;

         (ii)  approved the execution, delivery and performance of the Merger Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, including the
Merger, by CIFC; and

        (iii)  resolved, that the Merger Agreement and the related certificate of merger be submitted to the holders of Common Shares for authorization, adoption and
approval and recommended that the holders of Common Shares authorize, approve and adopt the Merger Agreement, the related certificate of merger and the
transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger.

        Certain factors considered by the Board in reaching its decision to approve the Merger and to authorize, approve and adopt the Merger Agreement can be found in the
section entitled "Approval of the Merger and the Merger Agreement (Proposal 1)—Reasons for the Merger."

        The Board recommends that shareholders vote "FOR" authorization, approval and adoption the Merger Agreement and thereby approve the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger, "FOR" the proposal to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, compensation that will or may
become payable to our named executive officers in connection with the Merger, "FOR" the proposal to approve the proposal to adjourn the Annual Meeting from time
to time, if necessary or appropriate to, among other things, solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of the Annual Meeting, or any adjournment
thereof, to approve the proposal to authorize, approve and adopt the Merger Agreement, "FOR" the proposal to elect ten (10) members of the CIFC LLC board of
directors, "FOR" the approval, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, of the compensation of our named executive officers and "FOR" the approval of the Amended and
Restated Plan.

Record Date and Quorum

        The holders of record of our Common Shares as of the Record Date for the Annual Meeting, are entitled to receive notice of and to vote at the Annual Meeting and any
adjournment or postponement thereof. As of the Record Date, 23,641,036 Common Shares were outstanding.

        The presence at the Annual Meeting, in person or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of Common Shares outstanding as of the close of business on the Record Date
will constitute a quorum, permitting us to conduct business at the Annual Meeting.

        Once a share is present, either in person or by proxy, at the Annual Meeting, it will be counted for the purpose of determining a quorum at the Annual Meeting and any
adjournment or postponement of the Annual Meeting. However, if a new Record Date for the Annual Meeting is set by the Board, then a new quorum will have to be
established. Proxies received, but marked as abstentions, will be included in the calculation of the number of shares considered to be present at the Annual Meeting.

Voting by CIFC's Directors and Executive Officers

        As of the Record Date, our directors and executive officers were entitled to vote 1,069,392 Common Shares, or approximately 4.52% of the Common Shares
outstanding on the Record Date. We currently expect our directors and executive officers will vote their shares in favor of each of the proposals to be considered at the
Annual Meeting, although none of them are obligated to do so.

        In addition, on August 19, 2016, DFR Holdings entered into the Voting Agreement in its capacity as a holder of 18,822,175 Common Shares representing approximately
80% of the Common Shares outstanding as of the date hereof to adopt the Merger Agreement. As such, CIFC expects to obtain the required vote of shareholders necessary to
approve the Merger.

Voting; Proxies; Revocation

Attendance

        All holders of Common Shares as of the close of business on the Record Date, including shareholders of record and beneficial owners of Common Shares registered in
the "street name" of a bank, broker or other nominee, are invited to attend the Annual Meeting. If you are a shareholder of record, please be prepared to provide proper
identification, such as a driver's license. If you hold your shares in "street name," you will need to provide proof of ownership, such as a recent account statement or voting
instruction form provided by your bank, broker or other nominee or other similar evidence of ownership, along with proper identification.

Voting in Person

        Shareholders of record will be able to vote in person at the Annual Meeting. If you are not a shareholder of record, but instead hold your shares in "street name" through
a bank, broker or other nominee, you must provide a "legal" proxy executed in your favor from your bank, broker or other nominee in order to be able to vote in person at the
Annual Meeting.

Submitting a Proxy or Providing Voting Instructions

        To ensure that your shares are voted at the Annual Meeting, we recommend that you provide voting instructions promptly by proxy, even if you plan to attend the
Annual Meeting in person.

        Shares Held by Record Holder.    If you are a shareholder of record, you may provide voting instructions by proxy using one of the methods described below.

• Submit a Proxy by Telephone or via the Internet.  This proxy statement is accompanied by a proxy card with instructions for submitting voting instructions.
You may vote by telephone by calling the toll-free number or via the internet by accessing the internet address as specified on the enclosed proxy card. Your
shares will be voted as you direct in the same manner as if you had completed, signed, dated and returned your proxy card, as described below. 

• Submit a Proxy Card.  If you complete, sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card by mail so that it is received in time for the Annual Meeting, your shares
will be voted in the manner directed by you on your proxy card.

        If you sign, date and return your proxy card without indicating how you wish to vote, your proxy will be voted in favor of each of (i) the proposal to authorize, approve
and adopt the Merger Agreement, (ii) the proposal to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, compensation that will or may become payable to our named executive
officers in connection with the Merger, (iii) the proposal to approve the proposal to adjourn of the Annual Meeting from time to time, if necessary or appropriate to, among
other things, solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of the Annual Meeting, or any adjournment thereof, to approve the proposal to authorize,
approve and adopt the Merger Agreement, (iv) the proposal to elect ten (10) directors, (v) the proposal to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the compensation of
our named executive officers and (vi) the proposal to approve the Amended and Restated Plan.

        If you fail to return your proxy card, unless you attend the Annual Meeting and vote in person, the effect will be that your shares will not be counted for purposes of
determining whether a quorum is present at the Annual Meeting and will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the proposal to authorize, approve and adopt the
Merger Agreement but will not have any effect on (1) the advisory (non-binding) vote to approve compensation that will or may become payable to our named executive
officers in connection with the Merger, (2) the vote regarding the adjournment of the Annual Meeting, if necessary or appropriate to, among other things, solicit additional
proxies in favor of the authorization, approval and adoption of the Merger Agreement, (3) the election of the ten (10) members of the Board, (4) the advisory (non-binding)
vote to approve the compensation of our named executive officers or (5) the proposal to approve the Amended and Restated Plan.

        Shares Held in Street Name.    If your shares are held by a bank, broker or other nominee on your behalf in "street name," your bank, broker or other nominee will send
you instructions as to how to provide voting instructions for your shares by proxy. Many banks and brokerage firms have a process for their customers to provide voting
instructions by telephone or via the internet, in addition to providing voting instructions by proxy card.

        In accordance with the applicable rules, banks, brokers and other nominees who hold Common Shares in "street name" for their customers do not have discretionary
authority to vote the shares with respect to any of the proposals to be acted on at the Annual Meeting. If you hold your shares in "street name," the failure to instruct your
broker, bank or other nominee on how to vote your shares will result in a broker non-vote, and each broker non-vote will count as a vote "AGAINST" the proposal to
authorize, approve and adopt the Merger Agreement, but will not affect the vote on the proposal to approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation that will or may become
payable to our named executive officers in connection with the Merger or the proposal to adjourn the Annual Meeting, if necessary or appropriate to, among other things,
solicit additional proxies in favor of the authorization, approval and adoption of the Merger Agreement.

Revocation of Proxies

        Any person giving a proxy pursuant to this solicitation has the power to revoke and change it at any time before it is voted. If you are a shareholder of record, you may
revoke your proxy at any time before the vote is taken at the Annual Meeting by:

• submitting a new proxy with a later date, by using the telephone or internet proxy submission procedures described above, or by completing, signing, dating
and returning a new proxy card by mail; 

• attending the Annual Meeting and voting in person; or 

• delivering a written notice of revocation to Julian Weldon, Secretary, c/o CIFC LLC, 250 Park Avenue, 4th Floor, New York, NY 10177.

        Please note, however, that only your last-dated proxy will count unless validly revoked. Attending the Annual Meeting without taking one of the actions described
above will not in itself revoke your proxy. Please note that if you want to revoke your proxy by mailing a new proxy card to CIFC or by sending a written notice of
revocation, you should insure that you send your new proxy card or written notice of revocation in sufficient time for it to be received by us before the Annual Meeting.

        If you hold your shares in "street name" through a bank, broker or other nominee, you will need to follow the instructions provided to you by your bank, broker or other
nominee in order to revoke your proxy or submit new voting instructions.

Abstentions

        An abstention occurs when a shareholder attends a meeting, either in person or by proxy, but abstains from voting. Abstentions will be included in the calculation of the
number of Common Shares represented at the Annual Meeting for purposes of determining whether a quorum has been achieved. Abstaining from voting will have the same
effect as a vote "AGAINST" the proposal to authorize, approve and adopt the Merger Agreement, but it will not affect (1) the advisory (non-binding) vote to approve
compensation that will or may become payable to our named executive officers in connection with the Merger, (2) the vote regarding the adjournment of the Annual
Meeting, if necessary or appropriate to, among other things, solicit additional proxies in favor of the authorization, approval and adoption of the Merger Agreement, (3) the
election of the ten (10) members of the Board, (4) the advisory (non-binding) vote to approve the compensation of our named executive officers or (5) the proposal to
approve the Amended and Restated Plan.

Adjournments and Postponements

        Our shareholders are being asked to approve a proposal to adjourn the Annual Meeting, if necessary or appropriate to, among other things, solicit additional proxies if
there are insufficient votes at the time of the Annual Meeting, or any adjournment thereof, to approve the proposal to authorize, approve and adopt the Merger Agreement. If
this proposal is authorized, approved and adopted by our shareholders, the Annual Meeting could be adjourned to any date for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies if
there are not sufficient votes at the time of the Annual Meeting, or any adjournment thereof, to adopt the Merger Agreement.

        Any adjournment or postponement of the Annual Meeting for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies will allow our shareholders who have already sent in their
proxies to revoke them at any time prior to their use at the Annual Meeting as adjourned or postponed.

Proxy Solicitation and Tabulation of Votes

        CIFC will pay all costs it incurs in connection with the solicitation of proxies from its shareholders on behalf of the Board. Our directors, officers and employees and
our subsidiaries may solicit proxies from our shareholders in person or by telephone, facsimile or other electronic methods without compensation other than reimbursement
by us for their actual expenses. Arrangements also will be made with brokerage firms and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries for the forwarding of solicitation
material to the beneficial owners of Common Shares held of record by such persons, and we will reimburse such firms, custodians, nominees and fiduciaries for their
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses in connection therewith.

Other Information

        You should not return your share certificate or send documents representing Common Shares with the proxy card. If the Merger is completed, the paying agent for the
Merger will send you a letter of transmittal and instructions for exchanging your Common Shares for the Merger Consideration.

APPROVAL OF THE MERGER AND THE MERGER AGREEMENT
(PROPOSAL 1) 

        The discussion in this proxy statement of the Merger and the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement are subject to, and are qualified in their entirety by
reference to, the Merger Agreement, a copy of which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex A and incorporated herein by reference. We encourage you to read the
Merger Agreement carefully and in its entirety as it is the legal document that governs the Merger.

Certain Effects of the Merger

        If the Merger Agreement is authorized, approved and adopted by our shareholders and the other conditions to the closing of the Merger specified in the Merger
Agreement are either satisfied or waived (to the extent permitted by applicable law), Merger Sub will be merged with and into CIFC with CIFC continuing as the Surviving
Company in the Merger.

        Upon the consummation of the Merger, each Common Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than (1) Common Shares held by
Parent, Merger Sub or CIFC or any of their respective direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiaries, (2) Common Shares held by a holder who has properly exercised
dissenters' rights with respect to such Common Shares in accordance with Section 262 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware and (3) the Rollover Shares,
will be converted into the right to receive $11.36 in cash, without interest, and subject to any withholding of taxes required by applicable law.

        Our Common Shares are currently registered under the Exchange Act and are quoted on NASDAQ under the symbol "CIFC." As a result of the Merger, we will cease to
be a publicly traded company and will be wholly owned by Parent. Following the consummation of the Merger, the registration of our Common Shares and our reporting
obligations under the Exchange Act will be terminated. In addition, upon the consummation of the Merger, our Common Shares will no longer be listed on any stock
exchange or quotation system, including NASDAQ.

Background of the Merger

        Our Board, working closely with management, regularly reviews CIFC's performance and prospects in light of its business and developments in the investment
management industry. These reviews have included consideration, from time to time, of potential strategic transactions to enhance shareholder value, including review of
potential opportunities involving the sale of CIFC.

        In November 2015, Stephen J. Vaccaro and Oliver Wriedt, the Co-Presidents of CIFC, discussed with four members of our Board (Jason Epstein, Marco Musetti,
Andrew Intrater and Paolo Amato) each of whom is affiliated with our largest shareholder, DFR Holdings, CIFC's strategy and business plan in light of the current economic
cycle. In particular Messrs. Vaccaro and Wriedt shared their view that CIFC would need additional capital to further diversify its business if CIFC was to be strongly
positioned to attract investment capital during any future economic downturn. In that light, Messrs. Vaccaro and Wriedt and such members of our Board also discussed a
recently announced merger and acquisition transaction in the investment management industry and whether it might be an opportune time for CIFC to explore its strategic
alternatives.

        After discussion with all the other members of the Board, a consensus emerged, and Messrs. Vaccaro and Wriedt were asked to arrange meetings with suitable
investment banks to discuss potential strategic alternatives for CIFC. Each potential financial advisor was provided background materials about CIFC and had a call with
senior management to get a preliminary understanding of CIFC. Each investment bank then met with members of the Board and senior management and made a proposal.
These meetings took place during November and early December 2015, and in each case included Messrs. Vaccaro and Wriedt along with Messrs. Epstein, Musetti, Intrater
and Amato from the Board and at one such meeting, Jeffrey S. Serota, the Chairman of CIFC's Board.

        At a Board meeting held on December 16, 2015, the Board discussed the relative merits of the potential financial advisors that had made proposals to CIFC to assist
CIFC in its exploration of strategic alternatives and authorized Messrs. Epstein, Musetti and Serota to work with senior management to select a financial advisor from among
those that had made a proposal, negotiate and execute an engagement letter with such advisor and work with such financial advisor to initiate a process to explore CIFC's
strategic alternatives. At the end of December 2015, after further discussions, Messrs. Epstein, Musetti and Serota, with the consultation and agreement of Messrs. Intrater
and Amato, determined that JPMorgan was best suited to act as financial advisor to CIFC in its evaluation of strategic alternatives due to JPMorgan's reputation and stature in
the investment banking business, its familiarity with the investment management industry and its expertise in facilitating strategic transactions in the industry.

        On January 25, 2016, Messrs. Epstein, Musetti and Serota, together with members of senior management met with representatives of JPMorgan to discuss the process to
explore CIFC's strategic alternatives, including preliminary strategic and financial information for distribution to potential counterparties and a preliminary list of
approximately 82 potential strategic and financial counterparties to approach. JPMorgan also discussed with such members of the Board and management the current market
for investment management mergers and acquisitions and the timing of a potential process. Finally, Messrs. Epstein, Musetti and Serota, after discussing with members of
senior management, authorized management to publicly disclose CIFC's engagement of JPMorgan to assist CIFC in exploring strategic alternatives and authorized JPMorgan
to begin contacting the identified potentially interested counterparties once the public announcement had been made.

        On January 28, 2016, CIFC announced publicly that it had engaged JPMorgan to assist the Board and management in exploring a range of strategic alternatives to
enhance shareholder value and to capitalize on its industry-leading platform. CIFC announced that those alternatives may include a sale of CIFC or the sale of a stake in
CIFC to a strategic investor with the objective of accelerating CIFC's existing growth and diversification initiatives.

        Following such announcement and through the remainder of January and February 2016, JPMorgan contacted more than 140 parties (including the 82 on the
preliminary list shared with Messrs. Epstein, Musetti and Serota, and members of senior management) about exploring a strategic transaction with CIFC. Ultimately CIFC
executed confidentiality agreements with 63 parties and, in connection with soliciting indications of interest, provided each of them with a confidential information

memorandum regarding CIFC which contained 5-year financial projections (as updated on or around March 15, 2016. See "—Projected Financial Information." The
financial projections reflected CIFC's potential financial performance under new ownership, including new capital to support growth, expansion of existing product set and
support to achieve CIFC's fundraising targets, among other factors. It was determined that presenting CIFC on the basis of what it could achieve under new ownership would
be more likely to maximize shareholder value in the sale process. Parties were instructed to submit their proposals by March 11, 2016. The confidentiality agreements signed
by such parties contained a customary standstill provision that prohibited such parties from making any proposal regarding a strategic transaction with, or acquisition of,
CIFC other than by means of a proposal to the Board on a confidential basis.

        On February 9, 2016, our Board held a meeting with members of senior management and representatives of JPMorgan. The representatives of JPMorgan reviewed with
the Board, as previously discussed with Messrs. Epstein, Musetti and Serota, its process to assist CIFC in exploring its strategic alternatives, including the list of parties being
approached. After the representatives from JPMorgan left the meeting, the Board discussed extending and formalizing the delegation of authority to Messrs. Epstein, Musetti
and Serota with respect to the strategic alternatives process by establishing them as a committee of the Board to direct the strategic alternatives process on behalf of the
Board to ensure that the process was run efficiently and effectively with Board oversight. The Board then approved the formation of the Strategic Committee, consisting of
Messrs. Epstein, Musetti and Serota, and empowered the Strategic Committee to exercise all power and authority of the Board in evaluating the merits of any strategic
alternatives relating to CIFC. In particular, the Board delegated to the Strategic Committee the power and authority of the Board, among other things, to (i) establish, modify,
monitor and direct the process and activities relating to the review, evaluation and negotiation of any strategic transaction, (ii) respond to inquiries and proposals relating to
any strategic transaction, (iii) recommend to the Board what action, if any, should be taken in connection with any strategic transaction, and (iv) review and consider on
behalf of CIFC the forms of all requisite documentation or agreements in connection with any strategic transaction.

        On or around March 11, 2016 CIFC received initial indications of interest from 15 of the parties (5 financial buyers and 10 strategic buyers) that had executed
confidentiality agreements with CIFC. Fourteen of the proposals were all cash bids for 100% of CIFC at a valuation range of $5.79 to $9.47 per share (pro forma valuation
range based on the updated capitalization table upon which the March 31, 2016 bids were based) on a fully diluted basis and one bid proposed a merger with CIFC with
holders of Common Shares to receive a combination of cash and shares of the counterparty based on the tangible book value of the two companies.

        On March 15, 2016, the Strategic Committee met telephonically with members of senior management and representatives of JPMorgan to review and discuss the terms
of the initial indications of interest. After discussion the Strategic Committee instructed JPMorgan to invite all 15 of the parties that had submitted a proposal to refresh their
initial indications of interest after having access to additional due diligence information. Shortly thereafter, at the direction of the Strategic Committee, JPMorgan contacted
each of the 15 parties that had previously bid and asked them to refresh their bid. In connection with such "refresh" bid CIFC made available to the remaining bidders
additional diligence, including balance sheet investments details, business segment profitability, expense detail and updated financial projections (updated to reflect that a
legacy collateralized loan obligation ("CLO") had been called, and improved projected net investment income reflecting the improved market conditions since the initial
projections). JPMorgan also contacted a select handful of additional strategic parties that had previously declined to participate in the process. All such additional strategic
parties again declined to participate. Shortly thereafter a principal of a financial buyer (that had not previously participated in the process) contacted Mr. Wriedt, with whom
the principal had a previous working relationship, to inquire about the strategic process. Mr. Wriedt directed the principal to

JPMorgan, who subsequently invited the financial buyer to submit a bid by March 31, 2016. The new potential financial buyer executed a confidentiality agreement
substantially similar to those executed by the earlier bidders.

        On March 31, 2016, six of the 15 bidders invited to refresh their bid submitted revised bids, seven confirmed their initial bids and two had previously withdrawn from
the process (stating that they were unable to move on price and declined to receive the additional information). In addition, the one new financial buyer referenced above also
submitted a bid. The 13 "refreshed" bids and one new bid reflected a valuation range of $5.79 to $9.92 per share on a fully diluted basis.

        On April 5, 2016 the Strategic Committee met with members of senior management and representatives of JPMorgan to review the 14 bids, and then directed JPMorgan
to communicate to such parties that a minimum bid of $10.00 per diluted share would be required in the second round of the bidding process and that CIFC would provide
access to additional diligence materials to assist bidders in the second round. Five bidders (two financial and three strategic) confirmed that they were prepared to engage in
more extensive legal and financial due diligence to enable them to meet the value expectations of the Strategic Committee, and the other 9 bidders dropped out of the process
indicating they did not believe they would be able to meet the $10.00 per share requirement. The five remaining parties were given access to an online data room containing
due diligence information and attended management presentations in late April and early May 2016.

        On or around May 6, 2016, drafts of the Merger Agreement and the Voting Agreement (prepared by Dechert LLP ("Dechert"), counsel to CIFC, and Latham &
Watkins LLP ("Latham"), counsel to CIFC and DFR Holdings, and reflecting review and comments from the Strategic Committee) and a customary process letter for the
second round were posted to the online data room. The draft Merger Agreement proposed a termination fee equal to 2% of the equity value of CIFC in the transaction and
permitted CIFC to continue to pay its customary quarterly dividend of $0.10 per share, plus a special dividend to reimburse shareholders for incremental tax liability related
to pass through income of CIFC—so called 'Permitted Dividends' under the terminology of the draft Merger Agreement. Finally, to ensure that standstill provisions contained
in confidentiality agreements of participants in the sale process did not preclude or interfere with the ability of such parties to submit competing Acquisition Proposals for
CIFC after execution of the Merger Agreement, the draft Merger Agreement contained a provision permitting CIFC to waive the provisions of a standstill (which was agreed
in the final Merger Agreement) if the failure to do so would be inconsistent with the Board's fiduciary duties. See "The Merger Agreement—Acquisition Proposals." The draft
Voting Agreement provided that DFR Holdings would vote in favor of the adoption of the merger described in the Merger Agreement and that the Voting Agreement would
terminate when the Merger Agreement terminated in accordance with its terms, including if the Board terminated the Merger Agreement to accept a Superior Proposal. The
process letter requested all second round bids by May 24, 2016.

        On May 19, 2016, on his way to a meeting at JPMorgan to discuss opportunities in the asset management sector for F.A.B. Partners, L.P. ("FAB"), Nizar Al-Bassam,
one of FAB's co-founders, met Mr. Wriedt, who he had met some years prior, on the street. During a brief conversation, Mr. Wriedt described his current position at CIFC and
that, as previously publicly disclosed, a strategic process was underway. After proceeding to his scheduled meeting at JPMorgan, Mr. Al-Bassam mentioned his chance
meeting with Mr. Wriedt on the street to representatives at JPMorgan. The representatives at JPMorgan acknowledged that they were involved in CIFC's strategic process,
but informed Mr. Al-Bassam that given the state of the strategic process, FAB would not have time to make a bid on the anticipated timeline of the process.

        On May 24 and 25, 2016, updated bids were received from two of the remaining five bidders that had participated in the April and May due diligence processes. The
other three bidders indicated that they would not be able to reach the valuation expectations set by the Board and accordingly did not

submit updated bids. The updated bids indicated a valuation range of $6.26 to $8.48 per fully diluted share.

        On May 31, 2016, one strategic buyer (Party A) that had submitted a bid in the first round of the process (but that had subsequently dropped out because it had indicated
it felt it could not be competitive with the Strategic Committee's valuation expectation of $10.00 per share in the second round) submitted an indication of interest of $10.50
per fully diluted share and following a management presentation and access to the online data room submitted a revised indication of interest on June 6, 2016, maintaining its
bid of $10.50 per fully diluted share.

        On June 2, 2016, a representative from a potential strategic buyer (Party B) reached out to Mr. Wriedt regarding participation in the strategic process, and Mr. Wriedt
directed the representative to contact JPMorgan. Shortly thereafter, Party B executed a confidentiality agreement substantially similar to those executed by the earlier bidders.

        On June 9, on a call with representatives of JPMorgan, representatives of FAB again enquired about CIFC (as well as other potential targets). Representatives of
JPMorgan repeated that the process for CIFC was advanced and entering the process at the current time would be challenging. However, JPMorgan agreed to raise FAB's
interest in participating in the process with CIFC. On June 13, 2016, FAB entered the process for the first time and executed a confidentiality agreement substantially similar
to those executed by the earlier bidders.

        In early to mid-June 2016 each of Party B and FAB attended management presentations, were provided access to the online data room and, along with Party A, were
instructed to submit proposals by June 21, 2016, including a mark-up of the draft Merger Agreement and Voting Agreement. From this time until August 18, 2016, FAB and
its representatives conducted due diligence on CIFC.

        On June 17, 2016, Party A submitted a revised bid, confirming its previous cash purchase price of $10.50 per fully diluted share and providing additional details of its
equity and debt financing sources, which included requiring CIFC to undertake an asset sale to finance a redemption of the senior notes and pay a portion of the purchase
price via a special dividend to stockholders. Party A requested 30 days of exclusivity to proceed.

        On June 19, 2016, representatives of FAB contacted representatives of Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP ("Weil") regarding an engagement in connection with a potential
acquisition by FAB of CIFC. On June 20, 2016, representatives of Weil and FAB received a bid process letter and a draft merger agreement from CIFC.

        On June 21, 2016, Party B submitted an all cash bid of $8.60 per fully diluted share that did not require any third party financing. Party B's proposal assumed that other
than dividends already reflected in Company projections for the second and third fiscal quarter of 2016 (CIFC's projections showed 2016 annual dividends of $0.72, implying
dividends of $0.18 for each of Q2 and Q3), no dividends would be paid, retention agreements would be executed with key management, the reserve for the pending
shareholder appraisal actions was reasonable and Party B would be granted 45 days of exclusivity in order to proceed. Party B's proposal also provided several additional
conditions to closing, including the approval of certain regulatory bodies that govern the business of Party B.

        On June 22, 2016, FAB submitted an all cash bid range of $9.75 to $10.25 per fully diluted share, fully financed by its "founding investors" and did not contemplate any
debt financing. FAB's proposal assumed that CIFC's second quarter dividend would not exceed $0.45 (no mention was made regarding a third quarter dividend) and that key
management would be retained pursuant to extended employment agreements. To that end FAB indicated that it anticipated discussing compensation with key management
prior to signing a definitive agreement. Finally FAB's proposal assumed it would be granted exclusivity during diligence expected to last 4-5 weeks.

        On June 22, 2016, the Strategic Committee met, together with members of senior management and representatives of JPMorgan, to review the bids and then instructed
JPMorgan to communicate to each of Party B and FAB that a mark-up of the Merger Agreement was required if it was to continue in the process and to communicate to FAB
that more details regarding FAB's proposed financing, including a letter from its equity sponsor, were needed before its bid could be fully evaluated. At this meeting the
Strategic Committee determined not to actively solicit further proposals at that time from the two bidders who had submitted updated bids on May 24 and May 25, 2016
because they were not competitive with the valuations represented by the proposals of Party A, Party B and FAB.

        On June 22, 2016, representatives of JPMorgan spoke with representatives of Party B and then with representatives of FAB, in each case as instructed by the Strategic
Committee.

        On June 23, 2016, representatives of Party A provided a summary financial model on their transaction structure to representatives of JPMorgan.

        On June 28, 2016, representatives of CIFC and Dechert spoke with representatives of Party B to better understand the risks related to Party B's condition to closing that
approval be received from certain regulatory bodies that govern the business of Party B.

        On June 30, 2016, FAB submitted a revised bid for CIFC of $10.00 per fully diluted share, together with an equity commitment letter from FAB's equity sponsor, Al
Mirqab Capital ("Al Mirqab"). FAB's proposal further assumed that any dividends paid by CIFC after the first quarter would be consistent in amount and frequency with the
term Permitted Dividends in the draft merger agreement. FAB also submitted a memorandum from its counsel, Weil, detailing FAB's principal comments to the draft of the
Merger Agreement. Notably, Weil's memorandum included the addition of the following closing conditions (1) a requirement that CIFC's 8.5% senior notes due 2025 remain
outstanding following closing, (2) a requirement to obtain consents under CIFC's asset management agreements of (x) at least 90% of the net present value of all
management fee revenue based on assets under management ("AUM") and (y) at least 80% of the net present value of management fee revenue based on non-CLO/CDO and
legacy AUM, (3) a requirement that CIFC comply in all but de minimis respects with its operating covenants between signing and closing and (4) that there be no pending
action brought by a governmental authority against CIFC or any member of senior management, which, if adversely determined, could reasonably be expected to have a
material adverse impact on CIFC. Weil's memorandum indicated that the termination or "break-up" fee would be 5% of the equity value of the transaction.

        On July 1, 2016, Party B submitted a full mark-up of the Merger Agreement to accompany its June 21sr bid. Party B's mark-up of the Merger Agreement provided
additional color to the assumptions set forth in its bid letter, which included the following closing conditions: (1) that the holder of the senior notes waive the change of
control put contained in the indenture governing the senior notes; (2) that 100% of counterparties under investment advisory agreements consent to the transaction prior to
Closing; (3) approval of certain regulatory bodies that govern the business of Party B; and (4) a specified net tangible asset value at Closing. Party B's mark-up also indicated
a break-up fee of 3% of the purchase price, plus included a provision requiring the reimbursement of Party B's expenses in the event of termination of the definitive Merger
Agreement under certain circumstances.

        On July 3, 2016, the Strategic Committee held a telephonic meeting to discuss the bids submitted by Party A, Party B and FAB. Members of senior management as well
as representatives of JPMorgan, Latham and Dechert were also present on this call. After discussing the relative merits of the proposals, the Strategic Committee concluded
that, although Party A's stated price was higher, it believed Party A's proposal was less attractive because it was contingent on financing, including debt financing, equity
financing from third parties and the proceeds from a sale of certain CIFC assets prior to Closing, while the proposals of Party B and FAB each had no financing contingency.
The Strategic Committee then discussed the proposals made by Party B and FAB in detail. After such discussions, the

Strategic Committee directed JPMorgan to contact Party B to communicate that while Party B's price was competitive, it was not the highest bid and, in addition to seeing if
they had room to improve their bid, seek clarification of certain key deal terms, including the net tangible asset value closing condition and the percentage threshold consent
required under investment advisory agreements, and other terms that impacted closing certainty. The Strategic Committee also instructed JPMorgan to contact FAB once it
had spoken to Party B to see, based upon whether or not Party B improved its price and terms, whether there was any room for FAB to improve its proposal, both on price
and key deal terms, including, the amount of the break-up fee, the length of any exclusivity period, the percentage threshold consent required under investment advisory
agreements, and other terms that impacted closing certainty.

        On July 3, representatives of JPMorgan spoke with representatives of Party B, and informed them that while their price was competitive it was not the highest and
sought clarification of, and gave guidance with respect to, certain of the deal terms that were creating concern and/or were not competitive, including the net tangible asset
test and the consent threshold under investment advisory agreements.

        On July 5, 2016, Party B, through its financial advisor, raised its bid to $10.00 per fully diluted share, less any dividends paid prior to signing. The representatives of
Party B's financial advisor also indicated that Party B expected the definitive documentation for the transaction to have a closing condition related to the maintenance of a
certain minimum net tangible asset value of CIFC and a closing condition that there be no ratings downgrade between signing and closing. JPMorgan informed Party B that
its revised proposal still was not the highest bid and that the highest bid was in double digits (i.e., at least $10.00), exclusive of dividends. Party B did not indicate it would,
or could, further improve its bid.

        Also on July 5, 2016, representatives of Party A reached out to representatives of JPMorgan to inquire as to the status of its proposal. Representatives of JPMorgan said
that they would need to get back to them.

        On July 6, 2016, representatives of one of the financial bidders that had submitted an updated bid on May 24, 2016 (Party C) called to check-in. Representatives of
JPMorgan informed them that Party C's price was not competitive and that Party C's proposal package was incomplete in that it had submitted an issues list, but not a full
mark-up of the draft Merger Agreement.

        On July 6, 2016, representatives of JPMorgan spoke to representatives of FAB and its financial advisor Moelis & Company ("Moelis"), informed them of the
competitive situation and gave them guidance on certain of the deal terms that were either creating concern or were not competitive, including, their proposed condition to
closing that the senior notes not be redeemed, the relatively high consent threshold for the investment advisory agreements and the relatively high termination fee.
Representatives of JPMorgan also asked them to clarify that a dividend could be paid in the third quarter, and that the equity sponsor would be providing a 100% guarantee.
Finally representatives of JPMorgan explained that CIFC needed comfort that the assets underlying the guarantee and enforcement thereof would be in the US, or another
acceptable jurisdiction for CIFC.

        Later in the day on July 6, representatives of FAB informed representatives of JPMorgan that FAB was increasing its bid to $10.25 per share with a cap on dividends
that CIFC would be allowed to pay in the second quarter and third quarter of 2016 of $0.45 per share per quarter. Representatives of FAB also confirmed that its equity
sponsor would provide a guarantee of 100% of the purchase price, and that recourse under the guaranty and to the underlying assets would be in a jurisdiction that would be
acceptable to CIFC. FAB also reduced its consent threshold for the investment advisory agreements from 80% to 70% of the net present value of management fee revenue
based on non-CLO/CDO and legacy AUM and reduced the termination fee to 3% from its prior proposal of 5%. Representatives of FAB noted that this bid was conditioned
on obtaining 45 days of exclusivity, although they offered that

if FAB failed to reconfirm its bid after 30 days, the exclusivity would drop away. Finally, they asked for expense reimbursement if FAB proceeded in good faith and was
ready to execute definitive documentation on the agreed terms and CIFC did not enter into the definitive documentation. FAB also it reiterated its need to, prior to signing,
agree to key terms with the senior management for extended employment agreements. No details of such terms were discussed at this time.

        On July 7, 2016, representatives of Party C contacted JPMorgan to inform JPMorgan that Party C would not be improving its proposal at the current time.

        Later in the day on July 7, 2016, the Strategic Committee held a telephonic meeting to discuss the revised proposals from FAB and Party B. Members of senior
management as well as representatives of JPMorgan, Latham and Dechert were also present on this call. Representatives of JPMorgan summarized the history and terms of
the revised proposals of FAB and Party B for the Strategic Committee. The Strategic Committee noted its belief that FAB's proposal in its revised form had materially less
conditionality and provided greater value to shareholders. The Strategic Committee also discussed FAB's requirement for exclusivity and request to be reimbursed for
expenses in the event that FAB proceeded in good faith and was ready to execute definitive documentation on the agreed terms and CIFC did not enter into the definitive
documentation. After taking into consideration the sale process to date, the premium being proposed by FAB, and the risk that FAB would cease discussions if not provided
with exclusivity and the expense reimbursement, the Strategic Committee concluded that it was in the best interests of CIFC's shareholders for CIFC to enter into an
exclusivity agreement with FAB and authorized management to negotiate and enter into exclusivity and, if necessary, reimbursement agreement with FAB and to proceed to
provide due diligence materials and negotiate definitive documentation to effect the terms of the FAB proposal.

        Promptly following conclusion of the Strategic Committee meeting representatives of JPMorgan called representatives of Moelis to inform them that the Board had
authorized CIFC to enter into an exclusivity arrangement with FAB and work towards reaching definitive documentation on the terms proposed by FAB.

        Early on July 8, 2016, representatives of Party B's financial advisor called representatives of JPMorgan to ask for an update on the status. After being informed that
CIFC was moving forward with another party, the representative of Party B informed JPMorgan that if it was a matter of an additional $0.25 per share, maybe there was
something Party B could do. Representatives of JPMorgan informed Party B that they were not optimistic that an additional $0.25 per share would be sufficient.

        Early afternoon on July 8, 2016, representatives of Party B's financial advisor called representatives of JPMorgan again and asked what price Party B would need to
propose to get exclusivity. The representative of JPMorgan told the representative of Party B's financial advisor that CIFC was already moving forward with another party, so
there could be no guarantees and any response would have to be fast, but to get the Board's attention he thought it would need to exceed $11.00 per share, inclusive of
dividends.

        Later on July 8, 2016, representatives of Party B's financial advisor called representatives of JPMorgan and raised its bid to $11.50 per fully diluted share, less any
dividends paid prior to signing the Merger Agreement. Party B reiterated that it would require several additional closing conditions, including a minimum net tangible asset
condition, no exercise of the senior notes change of control put, and approval by the regulatory body that governs its business. In addition, Party B said that it would need
confirmation prior to signing that the transaction would not result in a downgrade of Party B's credit rating and requested exclusivity through August 8, 2016.

        Later on July 8, 2016, after representatives of JPMorgan updated the Strategic Committee on the revised bid from Party B, at the direction of the Strategic Committee,
representatives of JPMorgan spoke with representatives of Party B to try to clarify and improve the terms of Party B's proposal.

Representatives of Party B confirmed that Party B would be willing to (1) drop its condition that there has been no exercise of the senior notes change of control put,
(2) reduce the required consent threshold for the investment advisory agreements to 90% of assets under management, and (3) agree to a reverse break fee (size to be
determined) in the event that the regulatory body governing Party B's business did not approve the transaction. However, Party B indicated its proposal remained subject to a
net tangible asset closing condition and confirmation prior to signing that the transaction would not result in a downgrade of Party B's credit rating.

        On the evening of July 8, the Strategic Committee met telephonically with representatives of JPMorgan and senior management to discuss the revised proposal from
Party B and the proposal from FAB. The Strategic Committee noted that while Party B now had the more favorable price, the Strategic Committee believed that the terms of
the FAB proposal remained more favorable from the standpoint of certainty of closing. The Strategic Committee discussed whether to go back to Party B and FAB to give
them both an opportunity for another last and final bid. After discussion, including in particular the risk that CIFC would lose any remaining credibility with FAB (who had
already been told it was the winning bidder for exclusivity purposes) and would decline to participate or cease discussions if presented with another request for a "last and
final bid", the Strategic Committee instructed representatives of JPMorgan to contact FAB to tell them that an unsolicited revised bid was received which was higher than
FAB's, and that given FAB's good faith, constructive negotiations to date, FAB would have a "last look" opportunity to improve its proposal.

        Late in the evening of July 8, representatives of JPMorgan informed representatives of Moelis that another party had increased its bid on an unsolicited basis.
Representatives of Moelis requested a call the following day, after they had a chance to speak with FAB.

        Early on July 9, 2016, representatives of JPMorgan spoke with representatives of FAB and Moelis and informed them that another party had increased its bid on an
unsolicited basis to more than $11.00 per share, inclusive of dividends, and that given FAB's good faith, constructive negotiations to date, FAB would have a "last look"
opportunity to improve its proposal. Representatives of FAB requested a couple of hours to go back to its equity sponsors as they believed, provided this was indeed a last
look opportunity, FAB would be able to make a compelling counter offer. They also requested that CIFC deliver to them the draft exclusivity agreement so that FAB could
respond with both a counter and an exclusivity agreement ready to be executed.

        Shortly thereafter on July 9, 2016, representatives of JPMorgan delivered a draft of the exclusivity agreement to representatives of FAB.

        In the evening of July 9, 2016, representatives of FAB provided a "best and final proposal" of $11.65 per fully diluted share, less any dividends paid with respect to
CIFC's second or third fiscal quarter. In connection with the raised price the FAB proposal also increased the termination fee from 3% to 4%. The proposal also included a
mark-up of the exclusivity letter that contained an expense reimbursement (up to $1 million) provision if FAB was ready to proceed with a transaction on the agreed terms
and CIFC did not execute such an agreement with FAB and the proposal contained a deadline of 5 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time on July 10 to sign the exclusivity letter.

        On the morning of July 10, 2016, the Strategic Committee held a telephonic meeting. Members of senior management and representatives of JPMorgan, Latham and
Dechert were present. Representatives of JPMorgan and Dechert summarized the terms of the final proposals of FAB and Party B, including the price, conditions, timing and
requirement of exclusivity, as well as the history that led to such proposals. The Strategic Committee after discussion determined that the FAB proposal was more favorable
from both a financial point of view and a certainty of closing point of view, and that it was in the best interests of CIFC's stockholders for CIFC to enter into an exclusivity
agreement with FAB and authorize management to negotiate definitive documentation to effect the terms of the revised FAB proposal. Members of the Strategic Committee
instructed management and its

representatives that the requested expense reimbursement should only be payable if at the end of the exclusivity period CIFC was not willing to execute definitive
documentation reflecting the proposed terms. The Strategic Committee also asked that any extension of FAB's exclusivity period beyond July 25, 2016 to August 11, 2016,
be predicated upon FAB and its advisors having proceeded in good faith with confirmatory due diligence and negotiation of definitive documentation and upon the receipt of
a letter that FAB remained prepared to continue to finalize documentation on the proposed terms. The Strategic Committee then discussed the FAB requirement that it have
discussed compensation with key management to obtain comfort on their retention post-closing and authorized those discussions to proceed but only with a representative of
JPMorgan present who would report back to the Strategic Committee. In addition, the Strategic Committee required that the extension of the exclusivity beyond July 25,
2016 would be subject to FAB engaging in such discussions prior to July 25, 2016, and confirmation that such discussions were progressing productively. The members of
the Strategic Committee noted that this would provide the Strategic Committee a higher degree of confidence that discussions between management and FAB would not
delay execution of the Merger Agreement. Finally, the Strategic Committee instructed its representatives to seek a reduction of the termination fee to 3% of the equity value
of the transaction. A meeting of the full Board was then held telephonically. Members of senior management and representatives of JPMorgan, Latham and Dechert were
present. At the Board meeting the Strategic Committee updated the Board on the status of negotiations and the final bids and its determinations and the Board concurred and
authorized the execution of the exclusivity agreement subject to the satisfactory resolution of the previously discussed matters. Representatives of JPMorgan were then
instructed to communicate CIFC's positions to FAB.

        During the afternoon of July 10, 2016, representatives of JPMorgan had a call with representatives of Party B to understand the no ratings downgrade condition to
signing.

        Also during the afternoon of July 10, 2016, representatives of CIFC's and FAB's legal advisors negotiated the exclusivity agreement including the language surrounding
the expense reimbursement trigger. Representatives of FAB's advisors also made clear that, given FAB's increased proposal price, FAB would not proceed with a termination
fee lower than 4% of the equity value.

        On the evening of July 10, 2016, CIFC, following input and confirmation from the members of the Strategic Committee, executed the exclusivity agreement with FAB
which: (1) provided that the exclusivity would terminate on July 25, 2016 unless FAB confirmed on such date that it remained prepared to proceed on the agreed terms and
had previously provided an updated equity commitment letter from FAB's equity sponsor, Al Mirqab, in which case the exclusivity would be extended to August 11, 2016;
(2) provided that FAB would be entitled to expense reimbursement of up to $1 million in the event that at the termination of the extended exclusivity period FAB remained
ready to execute definitive documentation on the agreed terms and no such documentation was executed; and (3) set forth the "agreed terms", including: $11.65 per share (on
the basis of a specified fully diluted share number) less dividends paid in Q2 and Q3 of 2016; a guaranty from Al Mirqab supporting the full purchase price and all other
monetary obligations of the acquiring entity; no debt financing; conditions to closing to be limited to those in the draft of the merger agreement as adjusted by a subset of
comments set forth in the Weil memo; and a termination fee of 4%.

        On July 11, 2016, in response to an inbound call from representatives of Party B, representatives of JPMorgan informed Party B that CIFC was proceeding with another
bidder. Party B made no further proposals to CIFC.

        Also on July 11, 2016, representatives of Party A emailed representatives of JPMorgan, noting the passage of time and that they therefore assumed their bid was not
competitive and were withdrawing from the process.

        On July 13, 2016, CIFC received the updated letter from FAB's equity sponsor, Al Mirqab, addressed to FAB in which Al Mirqab confirmed that it had readily available
funds of not less than

$340 million to commit to financing the acquisition of CIFC by FAB, which amount was higher than the previous letter from Al Mirqab and sufficient based on the proposed
price of $11.65 per share, less any dividends paid.

        During the weeks of July 11, 2016 and July 18, 2016, representatives of FAB and its advisors conducted further due diligence on the business, operations and financial
prospects of CIFC, which included diligence calls with members of senior management of CIFC and representatives of its advisors.

        On July 14, 2016, the three co-founders of FAB, Mr. Al-Bassam, Dalinc Ariburnu and Michele Faissola, together with a representative from Moelis met telephonically
with Messrs. Vaccaro, Wriedt and Julian Weldon, CIFC's General Counsel, Chief Compliance Officer and Secretary, and a representative of JPMorgan (who was present on
behalf of, and to provide updates to the Strategic Committee) to hold initial discussions regarding the post-closing management compensation structure for CIFC. During this
call representatives of FAB indicated they would require certain members of senior management to make a meaningful investment or equity rollover to demonstrate their
commitment to CIFC and its business plan going forward.

        On July 18, 2016, there was a business due diligence session attended by Mr. Ariburnu of FAB and Messrs. Wriedt and Weldon of CIFC, with representatives of
JPMorgan also present.

        On July 19, 2016, Messrs. Wriedt and Weldon met with Mr. Ariburnu and the chief investment officer of FAB's equity sponsor, Al Mirqab, to discuss CIFC's business
and financial performance and prospects. Representatives of JPMorgan also attended this meeting.

        On July 21, 2016, Weil provided to Latham and Dechert a revised draft of the Merger Agreement and Voting Agreement. Among other things, Weil's revised draft of the
Merger Agreement included (i) a closing condition that CIFC have a specified minimum amount of cash on its balance sheet at closing, (ii) a closing condition that there
could be no pending actions by any person seeking to enjoin the consummation of the transaction, (iii) a modification increasing the length of the tail period (six months to
twelve months) during which a termination fee is payable if the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances and then CIFC consummates a strategic
transaction with a third party during such post-termination tail period, (iv) a provision that the termination fee would not be the sole recourse of FAB in the event of a willful
and material breach and (v) a revised definition of Material Adverse Effect that removed the carve-out to what constitutes a Material Adverse Effect for effects related to the
announcement and pendency of the Merger Agreement. Weil also requested an updated capitalization information.

        On July 25, 2016, FAB delivered the required confirmation letter to extend exclusivity until August 11, 2016.

        On July 26, 2016, the Strategic Committee held a telephonic meeting at which time representatives from Latham and Dechert outlined the principal issues raised by
Weil's draft of the Merger Agreement and Voting Agreement. Based on input from this call and subsequent discussions with Weil on July 26, Dechert sent a revised draft
Merger Agreement to Weil on July 30, 2016, which, among other things, (i) removed the specified minimum amount of balance sheet cash closing condition, (ii) removed the
condition that there be no pending actions seeking to enjoin consummation of the transaction, (iii) provided that payment of the termination fee would be the sole recourse of
FAB in the event of a willful and material breach and (v) revised the definition of Material Adverse Effect to include a carve-out for effects related to the announcement or
pendency of the Merger Agreement.

        On July 27, 2016, Mr. Faissola of FAB held discussions with Messrs. Vaccaro, Wriedt and Weldon regarding an update on CIFC's business and financial prospects,
FAB's proposals for post-closing management compensation and the parties' plans for communication strategy following the announcement of the execution of definitive
documentation for a transaction. Representatives of Moelis and JPMorgan (who was present on behalf of, and to provide updates to the Strategic Committee) attended this
meeting.

        On August 3, 2016, representatives of Moelis sent to representatives of JPMorgan a draft term sheet outlining FAB's proposal for post-closing compensation and equity
rollover participation for certain members of senior management, including notably that: senior management would receive the same base salaries and substantially similar
benefits and bonus compensation as currently being received; senior management would be eligible to participate in an incentive equity plan of Parent subject to performance
vesting; and Messrs. Vaccaro and Wriedt and Mr. Stan Sokolowski would each be required to rollover into shares of Parent the lesser of (1) all of the Common Shares, RSUs
and options in CIFC held by such individual that can be rolled on a tax free basis, and (2) 50% of the gross proceeds that such individual would have otherwise received in
connection with the consummation of the transaction.

        On August 3, 2016, Mr. Ariburnu and other representatives of FAB held a call with Messrs. Wriedt, Vaccaro and Weldon to further discuss the communications strategy
for the announcement of the transaction.

        On August 4, 2016, representatives of Weil sent a revised draft Merger Agreement to Latham and Dechert, which, among other things: (i) reinserted a closing condition
that CIFC have a specified minimum amount of cash on its balance sheet at closing; (ii) inserted a closing condition that there could be no pending actions brought by any
governmental authority which if adversely determined could have a Material Adverse Effect on CIFC; and (iii) revised the definition of Material Adverse Effect to remove
the carve-out to what constitutes a Material Adverse Effect for effects related to the announcement and pendency of the Merger Agreement.

        On August 5, 2016, representatives of Latham sent to Weil a revised draft of the Voting Agreement.

        On August 6, 2016, Mr. Weldon, representatives of Dechert and representatives of Latham had a call with representatives of Weil to discuss the outstanding issues in the
Merger Agreement.

        On August 8, 2016, representatives of Weil provided an initial draft of the Commitment Letter and Guarantee to Latham and Dechert. The Guarantee provided, among
other things, a guarantee to CIFC from Supreme Universal Holdings Limited, a Cayman Islands exempted company ("Sponsor"), of any and all payment obligations of
Parent and Merger Sub under the terms of the Merger Agreement up to a cap of $340 million.

        Later on August 8, 2016, Messrs. Ariburnu and Faissola of FAB had a call with Messrs. Wriedt, Vaccaro and Weldon to discuss management's counterproposal (which
was subsequently delivered to FAB on August 9th) on post-closing compensation and the equity rollover. Representatives of JPMorgan (who was present on behalf of, and to
update the Strategic Committee) and Moelis were present during this call.

        On August 9, 2016, members of CIFC's executive management and representatives of Katzke & Morgenbesser LLP, management's independent counsel, sent to Weil a
revised draft term sheet with management's counter-proposal, as discussed on August 8, 2016, with respect to post-closing compensation and equity rollover. Management's
revised term sheet provided, notably: that only 50% of the incentive units issued pursuant to the post-closing incentive equity plan of Parent be subject to performance based
vesting with the other 50% be subject only to time based vesting, and that the

equity rollover of Messrs. Vaccaro, Wriedt and Sokolowski would consist only of their unvested RSUs, which would remain subject to their existing vesting schedule.

        On August 10, 2016, representatives of Dechert sent a revised draft Merger Agreement to Weil, which, among other things, (i) removed the specified minimum amount
of balance sheet cash closing condition, (ii) modified the closing condition that there could be no pending actions brought by a governmental authority to require not only
that the action would have to have a material adverse effect if determined adversely to CIFC, but also to require that such action would reasonably be expected to be
adversely determined, and (iii) revised the definition of Material Adverse Effect to include a carve-out for effects related to the announcement or pendency of the Merger
Agreement.

        Also on August 10, 2016, representatives of Weil sent to Latham and Dechert financial information regarding the Sponsor. After execution of appropriate confidentiality
agreements, this information was also provided to CIFC and JPMorgan, and representatives of JPMorgan had a confirmatory diligence call regarding such financials with
representatives of the Sponsor.

        On August 11, 2016, at the direction of the Strategic Committee CIFC signed a letter agreement with FAB extending the exclusivity period under the exclusivity
agreement to 5:00 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time on August 15, 2016.

        On August 12, 2016, representatives of Weil sent a revised draft Merger Agreement to Latham and Dechert, which, among other things, (i) revised the proposal of CIFC
with respect to the closing condition regarding pending actions by any governmental authority to include a presumption that any such action would be adversely determined
against CIFC unless CIFC could demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that such action would not be adversely determined against CIFC; (ii) accepted CIFC's
revised version of the definition of Material Adverse Effect, which reinserted as a carve-out to the definition of a Material Adverse Effect, effects related to the
announcement and pendency of the Merger Agreement; and (iii) introduced the concept that CIFC would be required to pay at least a $0.50 dividend for the second quarter
of 2016 and at least a $0.20 dividend for the third quarter of 2016, which would have the effect of reducing the aggregate consideration payable in connection with the
transaction because (i) at a merger consideration price of $10.95 ($11.65, less the $0.70 of dividends) certain incentive RSUs owned by management that would only vest if
the transaction price was $11.00 per share or greater would not vest, and (ii) the $0.70 of dividends would not be payable with respect to Non-Participating Equity
Equivalents and outstanding share options. For further discussion see "—Interests of Our Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger." Weil noted that they would not be
able to confirm the final purchase price until they had seen the updated capitalization information.

        On August 13 and 14, 2016, members of senior management of CIFC and their independent counsel, on the one hand, and Weil, on the other hand, exchanged drafts of
the FAB proposal for post-closing compensation and equity rollover. The principal areas of negotiation revolved around the amount of the equity rollover by
Messrs. Vaccaro, Wriedt and Sokolowski, Managing Director, Senior Portfolio Manager, Head of Corporate Credit Funds of CIFC. In addition, the parties agreed to the
vesting schedule for the rollover equity.

        On August 14 and 15, 2016, representatives from Latham, Dechert and Weil discussed and resolved the remaining open legal points in the Merger Agreement, the
Guarantee, the Commitment Letter and the Voting Agreement. On August 15 in the evening, representatives of Weil sent to Latham and Dechert revised drafts of each such
document as well as a formal term sheet outlining FAB's proposal for the equity rollover and post-closing compensation. The term sheet provided, among other things, that
Messrs. Vaccaro, Wriedt and Sokolowski would rollover 465,000, 465,000 and 196,000 RSUs, respectively, and in addition that Mr. Wriedt would rollover an additional
100,000 Common Shares. The drafts of the Merger Agreement, Guarantee and Commitment letter resolved the principal remaining legal issues, but did not resolve the open
business point of the final merger consideration to

be paid to shareholders and the amount of dividends, if any, CIFC would be required to pay in the second and third quarters of 2016, which Weil indicated required receipt by
FAB of the final capitalization information.

        On August 16, 2016, in connection with resolving the remaining business issues, CIFC provided to FAB and its advisors the final capitalization numbers, including the
amount of dividend catch-up owed with respect to CIFC's sole outstanding warrant pursuant to its terms ($3,180,000), which RSUs were entitled to participate in dividends,
and that 119,800 of the RSUs held by management had a vesting condition that the final consideration payable in a change of control transaction be at least $11.00 per share.

        On August 17, 2016, representatives of Latham, Dechert and Weil discussed, exchanged and agreed on the disclosure schedules to the Merger Agreement.

        Also on August 17, 2016, members of senior management of CIFC and their independent counsel spoke regarding FAB's proposal for post-closing compensation and
the equity rollover terms. Later that day, independent counsel to CIFC management, on the one hand, and Weil, on the other hand, had further discussions regarding various
legal issues associated with FAB's proposal for post-closing compensation and equity rollover.

        Over the course of August 18, 2016, representatives of Moelis and FAB discussed with representatives of JPMorgan and CIFC a reduction of the purchase price because
FAB's proposal had not accounted for the fact that the warrant was entitled to receive a dividend catch-up and that CIFC intended to pay less than $0.70 of dividends in the
second and third quarter combined.

        Very early on the morning of August 19, 2016, representatives of Moelis and FAB delivered to JPMorgan its final proposal of $11.46 per share—$11.36 per share in the
Merger, and a $0.10 dividend.

        Early on the morning of August 19, 2016, our Board held a special meeting, with members of senior management and representatives of JPMorgan, Latham and Dechert
participating. Representatives of JPMorgan provided an update on the status of negotiations with FAB. Representatives of JPMorgan then reviewed with the Board
JPMorgan's financial analyses of the consideration to be received by holders of Common Shares pursuant to the Merger Agreement and rendered to the Board an oral
opinion, which was confirmed by delivery of a written opinion on August 19, 2016 to the effect that, as of that date and based on and subject to various assumptions made,
procedures followed, matters considered, and qualifications and limitations described in its opinion, the proposed purchase price of $11.36 per share to be paid to holders of
Common Shares pursuant to the Merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.

        After the representatives of JPMorgan were excused, representatives of Latham and Dechert led the Board in a review of its fiduciary duties in connection with its
consideration of the proposed Merger Agreement, and the material terms of the Merger Agreement, with particular emphasis on deal protection and deal certainty.
Representatives of Latham and Dechert discussed the current draft of the Merger Agreement and Voting Agreement in detail and discussed FAB's terms for management
compensation following closing including the terms of the equity rollover by senior management. The members of the Strategic Committee then provided to the remaining
members of the Board an overview of the negotiations with FAB. The Strategic Committee then unanimously (i) determined that the Merger Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger, are advisable and fair to, and in the best interests of, CIFC and its shareholders, and (ii) recommended that the
Board adopt, approve and declare advisable the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated therein, including the Merger, and that the Board recommend that
CIFC's shareholders vote for the authorization, adoption and approval of the Merger Agreement.

        The Board then deliberated and, among other things, considered the conditions to the consummation of the Merger, the process by which the Merger would be
consummated, the restrictions

on CIFC's ability to solicit other offers combined with the "fiduciary out" to allow the Board to consider unsolicited proposals if certain requirements are satisfied. The Board
also discussed and considered the reduction in the purchase price proposed by FAB from the $11.65 (less any dividends paid prior to closing) offer set forth in the Exclusivity
Letter, that FAB had indicated that its offer in the Exclusivity letter had not taken into consideration the warrant's contractual right to a dividend catch-up (which was
$3,180,000) and was based on FAB's assumption that CIFC would pay $0.70 cents of dividend, in the aggregate, in the second and third quarter, and that accordingly FAB
was unwilling to proceed on the basis of $11.65 with no dividends. In addition, in considering the revised proposal of $11.46 per share—$11.36 per share in the Merger, and
a $0.10 dividend—the Board considered the impact of the $0.10 dividend including that management did not participate in dividends with respect to their share options and
Non-Participating Equity Equivalents. The Board also discussed and considered the opportunities and risks of continuing to operate as an independent public company,
including after considering the projected financial results previously prepared by management and reviewed by the Board. See "—Projected Financial Information."

        Our Board discussed with its advisors all of these matters, including review and consideration of the factors described under "—Reasons for Recommendation." After
further discussion, our Board determined that the Merger Agreement, the Merger, and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement were advisable and fair
to and, in the best interests of, CIFC and our shareholders. The Board resolved that the Merger Agreement, the Guarantee, the Voting Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger, are advisable and fair to, and in the best interests of, CIFC and its shareholders and recommended that the
holders of Common Shares authorize, approve and adopt the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger.

        In addition, in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, our Board declared a quarterly dividend from the surplus of CIFC, payable on September 12, 2016
to the holders of record of all the issued and outstanding Company Common Shares as of the close of business on August 31, 2016, in the amount of $0.10 per Common
Share.

Reasons for the Merger

Recommendation of the Strategic Committee

        The Strategic Committee was formed to, among other things, to (i) establish, modify, monitor and direct the process and activities relating to the review, evaluation and
negotiation of any strategic transaction, (ii) respond to inquiries and proposals relating to any strategic transaction, (iii) recommend to the Board what action, if any, should
be taken in connection with any strategic transaction, and (iv) review and consider on behalf of CIFC the forms of all requisite documentation or agreements in connection
with any strategic transaction, all as described more fully in "—Background of the Merger" beginning on page 28 of this proxy statement. The Board retained Dechert and
Latham & Watkins as its legal advisors and JPMorgan as its financial advisor.

        On August 19, 2016, the Strategic Committee evaluated the Merger and the Merger Agreement in consultation with the Board's legal and financial advisors, and
unanimously (i) determined that the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger, are advisable and fair to, and in
the best interests of, CIFC and its shareholders, and (ii) recommended that the Board adopt, approve and declare advisable the Merger Agreement and the transactions
contemplated therein, including the Merger, and that the Board recommend that CIFC's shareholders vote for the authorization, adoption and approval of the Merger
Agreement.

        In the course of making the determinations described above, the Strategic Committee considered the following factors relating to CIFC, its business, and prospects, and
the risks and challenges facing it, and the potential benefits of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby,

including the Merger, which factors the Strategic Committee believed supported its decision, but which factors are not intended to be exhaustive and are not presented in any
relative order of importance:

• its understanding, as a result of its discussions with our management, of CIFC's business, financial condition, results of operations, competitive position,
business strategy, strategic options, and projected financial results as an independent public company, as well as the risks and uncertainty involved in
achieving those prospects and projections; 

• its belief, after a review of potential strategic alternatives available to CIFC, including continuing to operate on a stand-alone basis in accordance with its
existing business plan, that in light of the considerable risks of other alternatives, the Merger represents CIFC's best reasonably available prospect for
maximizing shareholder value; 

• the recent and historical market price of the Common Shares and recent trading activity, including the fact that the Merger Consideration represents a
premium of more than 63% to the closing price of Common Shares on August 19, 2016 (the last trading day before the Merger Agreement was publicly
announced), and a premium of approximately 159% over the January 27, 2016 closing price of the Common Shares, the day prior to CIFC's announcement of
its pursuit of strategic alternatives to accelerate growth; 

• the fact that the Merger Consideration consists of all cash, which provides certainty and immediate value to CIFC's shareholders and allows CIFC's
shareholders to avoid the risks of continuing to hold Common Shares or receiving other publicly-traded securities in the Merger; 

• the financial presentation and opinion of JPMorgan delivered on August 19, 2016 to the Board to the effect that, as of such date and based on and subject to
the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and limitations and qualifications on the review undertaken as described in its opinion, the
Merger Consideration to be received by holders of Common Shares pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to such
holders, as more fully described below under the caption "—Opinion of the Strategic Committee's Financial Advisor;" 

• the terms of the Merger Agreement, including: 

• the Board's right to consider, respond to, and negotiate an unsolicited takeover proposal received from a third party prior to the time that shareholders
approve the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement if the Board determines in good faith after consultation with outside legal counsel and its
financial advisor, that such Acquisition Proposal is superior to the Merger or would reasonably be expected to lead to a proposal superior to the
Merger; 

• the right of the Board to withdraw or change its recommendation in favor of the Merger Agreement, and our right to terminate the Merger Agreement
to accept an Acquisition Proposal that is a Superior Proposal, subject to compliance with the terms of the Merger Agreement; and 

• the fact that CIFC is permitted under the terms of the Merger Agreement to continue to conduct its business in the ordinary course during the period
between the execution of the Merger Agreement and the Effective Time, subject only to limitations and restrictions on the taking of certain prescribed
actions; 

• the terms and conditions of the Voting Agreement and the fact that the Voting Agreement will terminate in connection with the termination of the Merger
Agreement in the case of a Superior Proposal;

• its belief that the termination fees and other limitations applicable to alternative acquisition proposals agreed to in the Merger Agreement were reasonable and
customary and would not preclude a serious and financially capable potential acquirer; 

• the likelihood that the Merger will be consummated, which is supported by the fact that Parent has obtained an equity financing commitment for the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the aggregate proceeds of which will be sufficient for Parent to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration
and certain related fees and expenses; 

• the absence of any financing condition; 

• the fact that conditions to closing the Merger are limited to customary conditions for a transaction of this type, that can be expected to be fulfilled; 

• the likelihood of obtaining the required regulatory approvals; 

• the fact that the payment obligations of Parent under the Merger Agreement have been guaranteed by the Guarantor, up to an amount not to exceed
$340 million; 

• CIFC's ability to seek specific performance to cause the Guarantor to fund the equity commitment to Parent and to cause Parent to consummate the Merger; 

• the ability of CIFC's shareholders to exercise appraisal rights under Delaware law (which amount could be more than, the same as or less than the amount a
shareholder would be entitled to receive under the terms of the Merger Agreement) and to receive payment based on that valuation in lieu of receiving the
Merger Consideration, as more fully described under "Appraisal Rights" beginning on page 133 of this proxy statement; and 

• the efforts of the Strategic Committee, with the assistance of the Board's legal and financial advisors acting at the direction of the Strategic Committee, to
negotiate and execute a Merger Agreement favorable to CIFC and its shareholders.

        In the course of making the determinations described above, the Strategic Committee also considered the following procedural safeguards involved in the negotiation of
the Merger Agreement (which factors the Strategic Committee believed supported its decision, but which factors are not intended to be exhaustive and are not presented in

the Merger or any other business combination or strategic transaction; and 

• the fact that the Merger Consideration and other terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement were the product of extensive negotiations between

        In the course of making the determinations described above, the Strategic Committee considered the following potentially negative factors relating to the Merger
Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger (which factors are not intended to be exhaustive and are not presented in any relative order of
importance):

• the fact that, while the Merger is expected to be completed, there can be no assurance that all conditions to the parties' obligations to complete the Merger will
be satisfied or waived, and, as a result, it is possible that the Merger might not be completed even if the Merger Agreement is approved by CIFC's
shareholders; 

• the risks during the pendency of the Merger related to: 

• the disruption of management's attention to CIFC's ongoing business operations due to the transaction; 

• the effect of the announcement of the proposed Merger on CIFC's relationships with its employees and clients; 

• adverse effects on CIFC's operating results, including as a result of costs incurred in connection with the Merger; and 

• CIFC's ability to attract and retain key personnel; 

• the fact that, subsequent to completion of the Merger, CIFC would no longer exist as an independent public company and its shareholders would no longer
participate in its future earnings and growth, if any, or benefit from increases, if any, in the value of the common shares, and will not participate in any
potential future sale of CIFC to a third party; 

• the requirement that, if the Merger Agreement is terminated under specified circumstances, CIFC must pay a Termination Fee of $13,332,000; 

• the receipt of the Merger Consideration by CIFC's shareholders who are U.S. persons will generally be subject to U.S. federal income tax; 

• the fact that if the Merger does not close, management will have expended significant time and effort in connection with the Merger, and there will have been
a significant disruption in management's attention to CIFC's ongoing business operations; 

• the restrictions on the conduct of CIFC's business prior to the completion of the Merger which prevent the taking of specified actions without the prior consent
of Parent, which actions CIFC might otherwise take in the absence of the pending Merger; 

• we have incurred and continue to incur significant legal, accounting, and other fees and expenses related to the transaction that CIFC will be required to pay
regardless of whether the Merger is consummated; and 

• certain directors and executive officers of CIFC have interests in the Merger that may be different from, or in addition to, those of CIFC's shareholders, as
described under "—Interests of Our Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger" beginning on page 60 of this proxy statement.

        The foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by the Strategic Committee is not intended to be exhaustive but includes the material factors
considered by the Strategic Committee. In view of the variety of factors considered in connection with its evaluation of the Merger, the Strategic Committee did not find it
practicable to, and did not, quantify or otherwise assign relative weights to the specific factors considered in reaching its determination and recommendation. In addition,
individual members of the Strategic Committee may have given different weights to different factors. While the Strategic Committee considered potentially positive and
potentially negative factors, the Strategic Committee concluded that, based on the totality of the information presented, overall, the potentially positive factors outweighed
the potentially negative factors. Accordingly, the Strategic Committee recommended to the Board the Merger Agreement and the Merger based upon the totality of the
information it considered.

Determinations and Recommendation of the Board

        On August 19, 2016, the Board, with the recommendation of the Strategic Committee, (i) determined the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement are advisable and fair to, and in the best interests of, CIFC and its shareholders, (ii) approved the execution, delivery and performance of the Merger
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, and (iii) resolved, that the Merger Agreement be submitted to the holders
of Common Shares for authorization, adoption and approval and recommended that the holders of Common Shares authorize, approve and adopt the Merger Agreement and
the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger.

        In the course of making such determinations, the Board considered the following factors (which factors are not intended to be exhaustive and are not presented in any
relative order of importance):

• the Strategic Committee's analyses, conclusions and unanimous determination, after its review and based upon the factors discussed above under "—
Recommendation of the Strategic Committee", which the Board adopted, that it is advisable, fair and in the best interests of CIFC and our shareholders to
enter into the Merger Agreement with Parent and Merger Sub, and the Strategic Committee's unanimous recommendation that the Board should approve the
execution, delivery, and performance of the Merger Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, and
recommend the authorization, adoption, and approval of the Merger Agreement by the shareholders of CIFC; and 

• the financial presentation and opinion of JPMorgan delivered on August 19, 2016 to the Board to the effect that, as of such date and based on and subject to
the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and limitations and qualifications on the review undertaken as described in its opinion, the
Merger Consideration to be received by holders of Common Shares pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to such
holders, as more fully described below under the caption "—Opinion of the Board's Financial Advisor."

        The foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by the Board is not intended to be exhaustive but includes the material factors considered by the
Board. In view of the variety of factors considered in connection with its evaluation of the Merger, the Board did not find it practicable to, and did not, quantify or otherwise

Opinion of the Board's Financial Advisor

        Pursuant to an engagement letter dated January 25, 2016, CIFC retained JPMorgan as its financial advisor in connection with the proposed Merger.

        At the meeting of the Board on August 19, 2016, JPMorgan rendered its oral opinion to the Board that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the factors and
assumptions set forth in its opinion, the Merger Consideration to be paid to the holders of Common Shares in the proposed Merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to
such shareholders. JPMorgan confirmed its August 19, 2016 oral opinion by delivering its written opinion to the Board, dated August 19, 2016, that, as of such date, the
Merger Consideration to be paid to the holders of Common Shares in the proposed Merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to such shareholders. No limitations were
imposed by the Board upon JPMorgan with respect to the investigations made or procedures followed by it in rendering its opinion.

        The full text of the written opinion of JPMorgan dated August 19, 2016, which sets forth the assumptions made, matters considered and limits on the review undertaken,
is attached as Annex B to this proxy statement and is incorporated herein by reference. The summary of the opinion of JPMorgan set forth in this proxy statement is qualified
in its entirety by reference to the full text of such opinion. CIFC's shareholders are urged to read the opinion in its entirety. JPMorgan's written opinion was addressed to the
Board (in its capacity as such) in connection with and for the purposes of its evaluation of the proposed Merger, was directed only to the Merger Consideration to be paid in
the Merger and did not address any other aspect of the Merger. JPMorgan expressed no opinion as to the fairness of the Merger Consideration to the holders of any other
class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of CIFC or as to the underlying decision by CIFC to engage in the proposed Merger. The issuance of JPMorgan's opinion
was approved by a fairness committee of JPMorgan. The opinion

does not constitute a recommendation to any shareholder of CIFC as to how such shareholder should vote with respect to the proposed Merger or any other matter.

        In arriving at its opinion, JPMorgan, among other things:

• reviewed a draft dated August 19, 2016 of the Merger Agreement; 

• reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information concerning CIFC and the industries in which it operates; 

• compared the financial and operating performance of CIFC with publicly available information concerning certain other companies JPMorgan deemed
relevant and reviewed the current and historical market prices of the Common Shares and certain publicly traded securities of such other companies; 

• reviewed certain internal financial analyses and forecasts prepared by the management of CIFC relating to its business; and 

• performed such other financial studies and analyses and considered such other information as JPMorgan deemed appropriate for the purposes of its opinion.

        In addition, JPMorgan held discussions with certain members of the management of CIFC with respect to certain aspects of the Merger, the past and current business
operations of CIFC, the financial condition and future prospects and operations of CIFC, and certain other matters JPMorgan believed necessary or appropriate to its inquiry.

        In giving its opinion, JPMorgan relied upon and assumed the accuracy and completeness of all information that was publicly available or was furnished to or discussed
with JPMorgan by CIFC or otherwise reviewed by or for JPMorgan, and JPMorgan did not independently verify any such information or its accuracy or completeness and,
pursuant to JPMorgan's engagement letter with CIFC, JPMorgan did not assume any obligation to undertake any such independent verification. JPMorgan did not conduct
and was not provided with any valuation or appraisal of any assets or liabilities, nor did JPMorgan evaluate the solvency of CIFC, Parent or Merger Sub under any state or
federal laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. In relying on financial analyses and forecasts provided to JPMorgan or derived therefrom, JPMorgan
assumed that they were reasonably prepared based on assumptions reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments by management as to the expected future
results of operations and financial condition of CIFC to which such analyses or forecasts relate. JPMorgan expressed no view as to such analyses or forecasts or the
assumptions on which they were based. JPMorgan also assumed that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement will have the tax
consequences described in discussions with, and materials furnished to JPMorgan by, representatives of CIFC and that the definitive Merger Agreement would not differ in
any material respects from the draft thereof furnished to JPMorgan. JPMorgan also assumed that the representations and warranties made by CIFC, Parent and Merger Sub in
the Merger Agreement and the related agreements were and will be true and correct in all respects material to its analysis. JPMorgan is not a legal, regulatory or tax expert
and relied on the assessments made by advisors to CIFC with respect to such issues. JPMorgan further assumed that all material governmental, regulatory or other consents
and approvals necessary for the consummation of the Merger will be obtained without any adverse effect on CIFC or on the contemplated benefits of the Merger.

        JPMorgan's opinion was necessarily based on economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to JPMorgan as of, the date of
such opinion. JPMorgan's opinion noted that subsequent developments may affect JPMorgan's opinion, and that JPMorgan does not have any obligation to update, revise, or
reaffirm such opinion. JPMorgan's opinion is limited to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the Merger Consideration to be paid to the holders of

Common Shares in the proposed Merger, and JPMorgan has expressed no opinion as to the fairness of any Merger Consideration to the holders of any other class of
securities, creditors or other constituencies of CIFC or the underlying decision by CIFC to engage in the Merger. Furthermore, JPMorgan expressed no opinion with respect
to the amount or nature of any compensation to any officers, directors, or employees of any party to the Merger, or any class of such persons relative to the Merger
Consideration to be paid to the holders of the Common Shares in the Merger or with respect to the fairness of any such compensation.

        The terms of the Merger Agreement were determined through arm's length negotiations between CIFC, Parent and Merger Sub, and the decision to enter into the Merger
Agreement was solely that of the Board. JPMorgan's opinion and financial analyses were only one of the many factors considered by the Board in its evaluation of the
proposed Merger and should not be viewed as determinative of the views of the Board or management with respect to the proposed Merger or the Merger Consideration.

        In accordance with customary investment banking practice, JPMorgan employed generally accepted valuation methodology in rendering its opinion to the Board on
August 19, 2016 and contained in the presentation delivered to the Board on such date in connection with the rendering of such opinion. The following is a summary of the
material financial analyses used by JPMorgan in connection with providing its opinion and does not purport to be a complete description of the analyses performed by
JPMorgan. Some of the summaries of the financial analyses include information presented in tabular format. The tables are not intended to stand alone, and in order to more
fully understand the financial analyses used by JPMorgan, the tables must be read together with the full text of each summary. Considering the data set forth below without
considering the full narrative description of the financial analyses, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying the analyses, could create a misleading or
incomplete view of JPMorgan's analyses.

Comparable Company Analyses.

        Using publicly available information, JPMorgan conducted a general public trading multiples analysis and a sum-of-the-parts public trading multiples analysis (each as
further described below) by comparing selected financial data of CIFC with similar data for selected publicly traded companies engaged in businesses which JPMorgan
judged to be analogous to CIFC, or in the case of the sum-of-the-parts trading multiple analysis, certain earnings streams of CIFC. These companies were selected, among
other reasons, because they operate businesses that are in the same or similar industry and, in certain cases, share certain operational and financial characteristics with CIFC.
However, none of the companies selected is identical or directly comparable to CIFC, and certain of the companies may have characteristics that are materially different from
those of CIFC. Accordingly, a complete analysis of the results of the following calculations cannot be limited to a quantitative review of such results and involves complex
considerations and judgments concerning the differences in the financial and operating characteristics of the selected companies compared to CIFC and other factors that
could affect the public trading value of the selected companies and CIFC.

Public Trading Multiples Analysis

        For purposes of this analysis, the companies selected by JPMorgan are grouped into two categories: (i) the general alternative asset managers composed of the
Blackstone Group L.P., KKR & Co. L.P., Apollo Global Management, LLC, Oaktree Capital Management, L.P., Carlyle Investment Management L.L.C. and Ares
Management LLC; and (ii) the specialized alternative asset managers composed of Och-Ziff Capital Management Group LLC, Fortress Investment Group LLC, Fifth Street
Asset Management Inc. and Medley Management Inc.

Table of Contents

        For each of the selected general alternative asset managers and selected specialized alternative asset managers, JPMorgan calculated the multiple of the closing stock
price of common equity on August 18, 2016 to the estimated economic net income, post-tax ("ENI") per share for calendar year 2017 (the "2017E P/ENI Multiple") . For
the purposes of this analysis, JPMorgan used the median of the 2017E P/ENI Multiple for the selected general alternative asset managers, as this group consists of larger and
more diversified managers. The following table represents the results of this analysis:

        Based on the results of this analysis, JPMorgan selected a 2017E P/ENI Multiple reference range of 5.0x to 8.5x. These multiples were then applied to the estimated ENI
per share of CIFC for calendar year 2017, on a stand-alone basis, as provided by the management, yielding (as adjusted to reflect certain liabilities associated with certain
dissenting shares of CIFC, as noted in Note 10 of Form 10-Q filed for CIFC for the period ending June 30, 2016, and the accrued and unpaid dividends on the Company
Warrant, see "The Merger Agreement—Treatment of Our Equity-Based Awards—Warrant") a range of implied trading values of approximately $6.10 to $10.10 per Common
Share (in each case rounded to the nearest $0.10), compared to (1) the Merger Consideration of $11.36 per Common Share, (2) the closing share price on January 27, 2016
(the day prior to CIFC's announcement of its intent to undertake a strategic process) (the "Unaffected Trading Price") of $4.39 per Common Share and (3) the closing share
price on August 18, 2016 of $6.92 per Common Share.

Sum-of-the-Parts Public Trading Multiples Analysis

        JPMorgan also performed a sum-of-the-parts public trading multiples analysis of CIFC. The analysis separated CIFC's estimated ENI for the calendar year 2017, on a
stand-alone basis, into two distinct earning streams composed of fee related earnings ("FRE") and performance related earnings ("PRE"), and separately ascribed a value to
the remaining net assets of CIFC ("Implied NAV"). Implied NAV was calculated by applying a multiple of 0.95x (which multiple was selected based on a review of the
multiples to net asset values of selected business development companies as implied from their respective stock prices and the valuation multiples for alternative asset
managers commonly used by wall street equity analysts) to the book value of CIFC as of June 30, 2016 (as provided by the management) of (A) the balance sheet
investments, plus (B) cash and less (C) debt and debt-like obligations.

        For purposes of valuing PRE and FRE, JPMorgan compared the selected financial data of CIFC with similar data for selected publicly traded companies engaged in
businesses which JPMorgan judged to be analogous to the respective earning streams of CIFC.

        Using publicly available information and for purposes of valuing FRE, JPMorgan calculated, for each of certain selected traditional asset managers that derive a
majority of their earnings from FRE, the multiple of the closing share price on August 18, 2016 to the estimated earnings of such company

for calendar year 2017 (the "2017E P/E Multiple"). The following table represents the results of this analysis:

        Based on the results of this analysis, JPMorgan selected a 2017E P/E Multiple reference range of 10.0x to 18.5x. These multiples were then applied to the estimated
FRE of CIFC for calendar year 2017, on a stand-alone basis, (calculated as ENI (excluding NII and net of interest expense) less PRE (as defined below), in each case, based
on projections provided by management), yielding a range of implied values of approximately $100.9 million to $186.6 million for CIFC's FRE.

        Using publicly available information and for purposes of calculating PRE, JPMorgan also calculated, for each selected general alternative asset manager which derives
their income from both FRE and PRE, the implied PRE multiple to the estimated PRE of such company for calendar year 2017 (the "2017E Implied PRE Multiple"). The
selected general alternative asset managers are composed of the Blackstone Group L.P., Apollo Global Management, LLC, Oaktree Capital Management, L.P., Carlyle
Investment Management L.L.C. and Ares Management LLC. For each such selected company, JPMorgan calculated such implied multiple by dividing (i) the amount of
(A) the implied equity value of such company based on the closing stock price of such company on August 18, 2016 less (B) the implied value of the FRE of such company,
calculated by applying a multiple of 14.0x (which multiple was selected based on the median of the 2017E P/E Multiples described in the preceding paragraph) to such
company's estimated FRE for calendar year 2017 less (C) the sum of the net cash and balance sheet investments, calculated by applying a multiple of 0.95x (which multiple
was selected based on a review of the multiples to net asset values of selected business development companies as implied from their respective stock prices and the
valuation multiples for alternative asset managers commonly used by equity analysts) to the book value of such assets and less (D) the book value of net unrealized carry,
calculated by applying a multiple of 0.95x (which multiple was selected based on common equity analyst methodology reflecting potential that asset value volatility impacts

        Based on the results of this analysis and a review of valuation multiples used by wall street equity analysts for alternative asset managers, JPMorgan selected a 2017E
Implied PRE multiple reference range of 5.0x to 7.0x. These multiples were then applied to the estimated PRE of CIFC for calendar year 2017, on a stand-alone basis, as
provided by the management, yielding a range of implied values of approximately $23.9 million to $33.5 million for CIFC's PRE. PRE was calculated as incentive fees less
incentive fee-related compensation based on projections provided by management.

        JPMorgan then calculated the range of implied equity values of CIFC by adding (i) the implied value of CIFC's estimated FRE for calendar year 2017, on a stand-alone
basis, (ii) the implied value of CIFC's estimated PRE for calendar year 2017, on a stand-alone basis, and (iii) the Implied NAV, yielding a range of implied trading values of
approximately $6.50 to $9.60 per Common Share (in each case rounded to the nearest $0.10), compared to (1) the Merger Consideration of $11.36 per Common Share,
(2) the Unaffected Trading Price of $4.39 per Common Share and (3) the closing share price on August 18, 2016 of $6.92 per Common Share.

Dividend Discount Analysis

        JPMorgan conducted a dividend discount analysis for the purpose of determining the range of implied equity values per Common Share.

        A dividend discount analysis is a method of evaluating the equity value of a company using estimates of future dividends to shareholders generated by such company.
Here the impact of risk retention was also incorporated in the dividend discount analysis to capture the capital requirements and investment returns derived from compliance
with the risk retention rules CIFC will be subjected to for future CLO issuances after December 24, 2016. In performing this analysis, JPMorgan relied on financial
projections provided by the management of CIFC for calendar years 2016 through 2025, on a stand-alone basis.

        In order to calculate the terminal value of CIFC's dividends after 2025, on a stand-alone basis, JPMorgan calculated a range of terminal values by applying a terminal
growth rate of 1.75% to 2.25% to CIFC's estimated dividend for the calendar year 2025, on a stand-alone basis. The range of terminal values and all projected future dividend
payments (which reflect the impact of risk retention cash flows) were then discounted to present values as of June 30, 2016 using a range of discount rates of 12.0% to
14.0%, which were chosen by JPMorgan based upon an analysis of the cost of equity of CIFC. JPMorgan then calculated the range of implied equity values of CIFC by
adding (i) the present value of the range of terminal values and all projected future dividend payments (which reflect the impact of risk retention cash flows) and (ii) the
Implied NAV.

        Based on the results of this analysis, JPMorgan arrived at a range of implied trading values for the Common Shares of approximately $7.50 to $9.80 per Common Share
(in each case rounded to the nearest $0.10), compared to (1) the Merger Consideration of $11.36 per Common Share, (2) the Unaffected Trading Price of $4.39 per Common
Share and (3) the closing share price on August 18, 2016 of $6.92 per Common Share.

Miscellaneous

        The foregoing summary of the material financial analyses does not purport to be a complete description of the analyses or data presented by JPMorgan. The preparation
of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. JPMorgan believes that the foregoing summary and
its analyses must be considered as a whole and that selecting portions of the foregoing summary and these analyses, without considering all of its analyses as a whole, could
create an incomplete view of the processes underlying the analyses and its opinion. As a result, the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis or combination
of analyses described above were merely utilized to create points of reference for analytical purposes and should not be taken to be the view of JPMorgan with respect to the
actual value of CIFC. The order of analyses described does not represent the relative importance or weight given to those analyses by JPMorgan. In arriving at its opinion,
JPMorgan did not attribute any particular weight to any analyses or factors considered by it and did not form an opinion as to whether any individual analysis or factor
(positive or negative), considered in isolation, supported or failed to support its opinion. Rather, JPMorgan considered the totality of the factors and analyses performed in
determining its opinion.

        Analyses based upon forecasts of future results are inherently uncertain, as they are subject to numerous factors or events beyond the control of the parties and their
advisors. Accordingly, forecasts and analyses used or made by JPMorgan are not necessarily indicative of actual future results, which may be significantly more or less
favorable than suggested by those analyses. Moreover, JPMorgan's analyses are not and do not purport to be appraisals or otherwise reflective of the prices at which
businesses actually could be acquired or sold. None of the selected companies reviewed as described in the above summary is identical to CIFC. However, the companies
selected were chosen because they are publicly traded companies with operations and businesses that, for purposes of JPMorgan's analysis, may be considered similar to
those of CIFC. The analyses necessarily involve complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and operational characteristics of the companies
involved and other factors that could affect the companies compared to CIFC.

        As a part of its investment banking business, JPMorgan and its affiliates are continually engaged in the valuation of businesses and their securities in connection with
mergers and acquisitions, investments for passive and control purposes, negotiated underwritings, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements,
and valuations for corporate and other purposes. JPMorgan was selected to advise CIFC with respect to the proposed Merger on the basis of, among other things, such
experience and its qualifications and reputation in connection with such matters and its familiarity with CIFC and the industries in which it operates.

        JPMorgan received a one-time fee of $1.50 million from CIFC, payable at the time that JPMorgan delivered the written opinion on August 19, 2016. For services
rendered in connection with the proposed Merger, CIFC has agreed to pay JPMorgan an additional one-time fee of $2.99 million upon the closing of the Merger. In addition,
CIFC has agreed to reimburse JPMorgan for its expenses incurred in connection with its services, including the fees and disbursements of counsel, and will indemnify
JPMorgan against certain liabilities arising out of JPMorgan's engagement. During the two years preceding the date of JPMorgan's opinion, JPMorgan and its affiliates have
not had any other material financial advisory or other material commercial or investment banking relationships with CIFC, Parent or Merger Sub. In the ordinary course of
their businesses, JPMorgan and its affiliates may actively trade the debt and equity securities or financial instruments (including derivatives, bank loans or other obligations)
of CIFC for their own accounts or for the accounts of customers and, accordingly, JPMorgan may at any time hold long or short positions in such securities or other financial
instruments.

Projected Financial Information

        CIFC does not as a matter of course publicly disclose detailed financial forecasts or projections, and it generally does not disclose forecasts for extended periods due to
the difficulty of predicting economic and market conditions and its results. However, financial forecasts and projections prepared by management were made available to the
Strategic Committee and the Board. One set of those financial forecasts and projections assumed CIFC remained a stand-alone entity and another assumed CIFC was
acquired. JPMorgan was provided the financial forecasts and projections that assumed CIFC remained a stand-alone entity for its use and reliance in connection with its
financial analyses and opinion, and the forecasts and projections that assumed CIFC was acquired were made available to bidders, including representatives of Parent.

        Because such financial projections and forecasts were made available to the Strategic Committee and the Board and JPMorgan, and, in certain instances, to bidders,
including representatives of Parent, they are being included in this proxy statement. However, the inclusion of this information should not be regarded as an indication that
CIFC, the Strategic Committee or the Board considered, or now considers, such financial projections or forecasts to be a reliable prediction of future results or to support or
fail to support your decision whether to vote for or against the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. No person has made or makes any representation or warranty to any
shareholder regarding the information included in these financial projections or forecasts.

        CIFC did not prepare the projections with a view to public disclosure or compliance with the published guidelines of the SEC or the guidelines established by the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants regarding projections or forecasts. Furthermore, the projections do not purport to present operations in accordance with
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or "GAAP," and our independent auditors have not examined, compiled or otherwise applied procedures to the projections
and accordingly assume no responsibility for them. Our internal financial forecasts (upon which these projections were based in part) are, in general, prepared solely for
internal use and capital budgeting and other management decisions and are subjective in many respects and thus susceptible to interpretations and periodic revisions based on
actual experience and business developments. The projections may differ from publicized analyst estimates and forecasts and do not take into account any events or
circumstances after the date they were prepared, including the announcement of the Merger.

        The projections also reflect numerous assumptions made by the management of CIFC, including assumptions with respect to industry performance, the market for our
existing and new CLOs, credit funds and other loan-based products and asset management services, our ability to successfully negotiate acquisitions, general business,
economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control. Accordingly, there can be no
assurance that the assumptions made in preparing the projections, or that any of the projections, will be realized whether or not the Merger is consummated.

        It is expected that there will be differences between actual and projected results, and actual results may be materially greater or lesser than those contained in the
projections due to numerous risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to risks and uncertainties described in reports filed by CIFC with the SEC under the Exchange
Act, including without limitation under the heading "Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.

        All projections are forward-looking statements. These and other forward-looking statements in this proxy statement or otherwise issued by CIFC are expressly qualified
in their entirety by the risks and uncertainties identified above and the cautionary statements contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2015 and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2016 and June 30, 2016. Any provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995
that may be referenced in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31,
2016 and

June 30, 2016 are not applicable to any forward-looking statements made in connection with the Merger.

        The inclusion of the projections in this proxy statement should not be regarded as an indication that any of the Sponsor, Parent, CIFC or their respective affiliates,
advisors or other representatives considered or consider the projections to be necessarily predictive of actual future events, and the projections should not be relied upon as
such. None of the Sponsor, Parent, CIFC or any of their respective affiliates, advisors or other representatives has made or makes any representation to any person regarding
the ultimate performance of CIFC compared to the information contained in the projections, and, except as required by law, neither CIFC nor its affiliates undertakes any
obligation to update or otherwise revise or reconcile the projections to reflect circumstances existing after the date such projections were generated or to reflect the
occurrence of future events even in the event that any or all of the assumptions underlying the projections are shown to be in error.

        For the foregoing reasons, shareholders are cautioned not to place reliance on the projections included in this proxy statement.

CIFC Stand-Alone Unaudited Financial Forecasts

        The following tables summarize the unaudited financial forecasts related to CIFC on a stand-alone basis without giving effect to the Merger, prepared by CIFC's
management as described above, used by the Strategic Committee and the Board for purposes of its consideration of the Merger and by JPMorgan for purposes of its
financial analysis and opinion. The following projections for the years ending December 31, 2016, December 31, 2017, December 31, 2018, December 31, 2019,
December 31, 2020, December 31, 2021, December 31, 2022, December 31, 2023, December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2025 are management's projections for such years.

        The following tables show projected information relating to our fee earning AUM, which refers to the principal balance, net asset value or value of assets managed by us
on which we earn management and/or incentive fees. Our AUM is primarily composed of CLOs. In addition, we manage credit funds and other loan-based products.

CIFC Acquisition Unaudited Projections

        In connection with the exploration of a strategic alternative, CIFC provided bidders, including representatives of Parent, with unaudited prospective financial
information of CIFC assuming CIFC was acquired. The following projections for the years ending December 31, 2016, December 31, 2017, December 31, 2018,
December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2020 are management's projections for such years, prepared as described above. In principal, these financial projections remove public
company costs, director fees, consulting fees paid to DFR Holdings, compensation paid to Peter Gleysteen and assume an increased growth rate for AUM for the first five
years that reflects the access to additional capital and client relationships of a new owner.

Financing

        Parent estimates that the total amount of funds required to consummate the Merger and related transactions and pay related fees and expenses will be approximately
$340 million. Parent expects this amount to be funded through a combination of the following:

• a cash equity investment of up to $340 million by the Sponsor; 

• the rollover of the Rollover Shares immediately prior to the Merger, the equivalent of an investment of approximately $13,927,360 based upon the Merger
Consideration; and 

• Parent's available cash on hand at closing.

        The consummation of the Merger is not subject to a financing condition (although the funding of the equity financing is subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set
forth in the Commitment Letter under which the financing will be provided).

Equity Financing

        On August 19, 2016, the Sponsor entered into the Commitment Letter with Parent pursuant to which the Sponsor has committed to purchase, directly or indirectly,
securities of Parent having an aggregate purchase price in cash of up to $340 million. The equity financing is subject to the following conditions:

• execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement by CIFC; and 

• satisfaction or waiver of all conditions precedent to the closing of the Merger Agreement other than conditions that, by their nature, are to be satisfied at
closing or are validly waived by Parent at the closing (provided that such conditions are reasonably expected to be satisfied or waived at the time when the
closing occurs).

        The Sponsor's obligation to fund the equity financing will automatically terminate upon the earliest to occur of:

• the closing (after funding by the Sponsor to Parent), at which time the obligation will be fulfilled; 

• the termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms; 

• the assertion by CIFC or any Company Party directly or indirectly, of any claim against the Sponsor, Parent or any of their affiliates, other than any claim
(i) by CIFC against the Parent or Merger Sub to the extent permitted under the Merger Agreement or (ii) CIFC exercising third-party beneficiary rights in
accordance with the Commitment Letter; and 

• the funding of the financing required to be funded by the Sponsor pursuant to the Commitment Letter.

Rollover Financing

        On August 19, 2016, Messrs. Vaccaro, Wriedt and Sokolowski (collectively, the "Rollover Holders") entered into the Rollover Agreements, pursuant to which the
Rollover Holders collectively committed to contribute, immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Rollover Shares to Parent (the equivalent of an investment of
approximately $13,927,360 based upon the Merger Consideration) in exchange for equity interests in Parent determined in accordance with such Rollover Holder's Rollover
Agreement.

Limited Guarantee

        Concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, the Guarantor executed and delivered the Guarantee pursuant to which the Guarantor has absolutely,
unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed:

• any and all payment obligations of Parent and Merger Sub pursuant to and in accordance with the Merger Agreement (other than any payment obligations
arising from the enforcement of specific performance) and any and all liabilities and damages payable by Parent or Merger Sub arising under or in connection
with the Merger Agreement up to an amount not exceeding $340 million; or 

• the obligation of Parent to fund an amount equal to $340 million or such lesser amount which, when aggregated with any other cash that may be available to
Parent to satisfy its obligations under the Merger Agreement, in the aggregate is sufficient to fund the aggregate Merger Consideration, the other amounts
payable by Parent pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement and related fees and expenses described therein.

        The Guarantee will terminate upon the earliest to occur of:

• the closing;

writing against the Guarantor prior to such date;

        A copy of the Voting Agreement is attached hereto as Annex E and is incorporated herein by reference. The foregoing description of the Voting Agreement is only a
summary, does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Voting Agreement.

Interests of Our Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger

        When considering the recommendation of the Board that you vote to approve the proposal to authorize, approve and adopt the Merger Agreement, you should be aware
that some of our directors and executive officers have interests in the Merger that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of our shareholders generally, as more
fully described below. The Board was aware of and considered these interests, among other matters, in approving the Merger Agreement and the Merger and recommending
that the Merger Agreement be authorized, approved and adopted by the shareholders of CIFC. For purposes of all of CIFC's agreements and plans described below, the
completion of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement will constitute a change in control.

Rollover Agreements

        As a condition to Parent entering into the Merger Agreement, at the time that the parties signed the Merger Agreement, the Rollover Holders entered into the Rollover
Agreements whereby, with respect to those Rollover Holders who are executive officers, Messrs. Vaccaro and Wriedt will each forego cash that would have been payable to
them in the future upon vesting following the Merger on account of Common Shares underlying certain Company RSUs and Company PSUs held by them, which awards
will instead be cancelled and substituted for a new restricted limited partnership unit award issued by Parent covering a number of interests in Parent equal to (i) the amount
that would have been paid in cancellation of such Company RSUs and Company PSUs had they been cashed out in connection with the Merger, divided by (ii) the price per
unit paid by the Sponsor or an affiliate thereof in connection with its equity investment in Parent (i.e., "rollover"). In addition, Mr. Wriedt will contribute certain Common
Shares to Parent in exchange for limited partnership interests in Parent.

        The new restricted limited partnership unit awards in Parent will be subject to a three-year vesting schedule and, whether or not vested, be entitled to certain
distributions made to limited partners of Parent. Once vested, the awards will be settled in fully vested limited partnership interests in Parent and the holder will be able to
cause Parent to pay cash for such interests. Accordingly, each of Messrs. Vaccaro and Wriedt will acquire an indirect ownership interest in CIFC upon the closing of the
Merger and, as a result, will have a continuing interest in the performance of the successor entity to

CIFC after the Merger. The Roller Shares will represent less than 5% of the outstanding interests in Parent after the Merger. The interests of Parent to be issued to
Messrs. Vaccaro and Wriedt upon the vesting of the new restricted limited partnership unit awards will be subject to the limited partnership agreement of Parent.

        Under the Rollover Agreements, Mr. Vaccaro has agreed, effective at the closing, to rollover 465,000 Company RSUs and Company PSUs, which represents a value of
$5,282,400 based upon the Merger Consideration. Mr. Wriedt has agreed, effective at the closing, to rollover 465,000 Company RSUs and Company PSUs and also
contribute 100,000 Common Shares to Parent in exchange for interests in Parent, which represents, in the aggregate, a value of $6,418,400 based upon the Merger
Consideration. The Rollover Shares being contributed by Messrs. Vaccaro and Wriedt represent 32% and 28% of their total fully diluted equity interests in CIFC,
respectively, as of October 12, 2016.

Treatment of CIFC's Equity

        As further described under "The Merger Agreement—Treatment of Our Equity-Based Awards," on page 72, under the Merger Agreement, generally for each equity
incentive award that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (not including certain specified Company RSUs and awards subject to the Rollover Agreements),
the vesting will accelerate in full and all restrictions will lapse at which point all outstanding awards will be cancelled and terminated in consideration for the right to receive
a cash payment. Such cash payment will be calculated based on the product of (i) the number of Common Shares subject to the award (assuming actual or maximum level of
performance for any Company PSUs, depending upon the award), and (ii) (x) for share options, the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price of such
option or (y) for all other awards, the Merger Consideration. In addition, certain Company RSUs and Company PSUs that are entitled to receive dividend equivalents will be
paid any accrued dividend equivalents at the Effective Time.

Summary of CIFC's Equity Awards in Connection with the Merger

        The following tables set forth the number and value (based on the Merger price of $11.36 per Common Share) of unvested share options, Company RSUs and Company
PSUs held by each executive officer and non-employee director of CIFC that would be unvested as of immediately prior to the consummation of the Merger, assuming that
no such awards are exercised, settled, or forfeited, as applicable, prior to the Effective Time (which solely for this purpose is assumed to be December 1, 2016). With respect
to Company PSUs, the amounts set forth in the table below are based on the number of Company PSUs that would be vested based on the Merger Consideration of $11.36.

Employment and Severance Agreements with Executive Officers and Directors

Named Executive Officers

        CIFC is party to severance agreements with each of Messrs. Vaccaro and Wriedt, and employment letter agreements with each of Messrs. Agarwal and Weldon. Under
the severance agreements for Messrs. Vaccaro and Wriedt, in the event of a termination of employment by CIFC without "cause" (as described in the section entitled
"Executive Compensation") or due to death or disability, each of Messrs. Vaccaro and Wriedt are entitled to (i) 12 months of continued base salary payments and (ii) an
amount equal to the average annual bonus paid to the executive for the three-year period preceding such termination, payable over 12 months. Such payments are conditioned
upon the executive signing a general release of claims and his continued compliance with certain restrictive covenants (including non-competition and non-solicitation
covenants for one year following termination of employment, as well as certain confidentiality, intellectual property and non-disparagement obligations for an indefinite
period), and CIFC's severance obligations to these executives will cease when they commence new employment. Messrs. Agarwal and Weldon are not entitled to any
severance benefits under their employment letter agreements, but they are each eligible for the following severance benefits under CIFC's general severance plan in the event
his employment is terminated by CIFC without cause, subject to his execution of a release of claims: (i) severance pay equal to two weeks of base salary, multiplied by the
number of full years of service (but in no event less than 8 weeks of base salary), generally payable in installments over the applicable number of weeks, and (ii) if COBRA
continuation coverage is elected, payment of COBRA premiums during such severance pay period. Additional information regarding these severance arrangements can be
found in the section titled "Executive Compensation," and payments that may become payable to the named executive officers under these arrangements can be found in the
table below titled "—Golden Parachute Compensation."

Directors

        CIFC is party to an employment agreement with Mr. Peter Gleysteen in his capacity as Senior Investment Adviser. Under this agreement, in the event that
Mr. Gleysteen's employment is terminated by CIFC without cause or by him for good reason (as defined in such agreement) or as a result of his death or disability, in any
event, before December 31, 2016, then he is entitled to (i) continued base

salary payments through December 31, 2016 and (ii) payment of his guaranteed annual bonus for 2016, payable on January 2, 2017. Such payments are conditioned upon his
signing a general release of claims and his continued compliance with certain restrictive covenants (including certain non-competition covenants until December 31, 2016
and non-solicitation covenants for two years following termination of employment).

        No other directors have entered into any employment, service or severance agreements with CIFC.

Distributions

        Certain of the Company RSUs and Company PSUs held by CIFC's named executive officers are not entitled to dividend/distribution equivalent rights in accordance
with their terms, and the share options held by a director of CIFC and CIFC's named executive officers are not entitled to dividend/distribution equivalent rights or
adjustments to the exercise price as a result of dividends/distributions in accordance with their terms (such Company RSUs, Company PSUs and share options, collectively,
the "Non-Participating Equity Equivalents"). The Non-Participating Equity Equivalents did not receive the benefit of the Distribution paid on September 12, 2016 to
CIFC shareholders of record as of the close of business on August 31, 2016. The named executive officers hold Non-Participating Equity Equivalents in the form of
Company RSUs and Company PSUs that represent 1,100,250 Common Shares of CIFC. The director and named executive officers hold Non-Participating Equity
Equivalents in the form of share options that represent 2,750,313 Common Shares of CIFC. The aggregate value of this Distribution that was not payable to the director and
the executive officers in respect of their Non-Participating Equity Equivalents was $385,056.

Post-Merger Employee Benefit Continuation

        Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, during the 12-month period commencing at the Effective Time, Parent has agreed to provide each employee of CIFC or our
subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time (whom we refer to collectively as "continuing employees") with (i) base compensation, commission rates and bonus
opportunities that are, in the aggregate, at least equal to those provided to continuing employees immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) all other benefits (excluding
any change of control benefits, retention bonuses and equity incentive awards) that are, in the aggregate, no less favorable than those provided to continuing employees
immediately prior to the Effective Time. Parent has also agreed to provide each continuing employee whose employment terminates during such 12-month period severance
benefits that are no less favorable than the severance benefits under the applicable severance plan or arrangement as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, and
severance benefits provided during such 12-month period will be determined without taking into account any reduction in compensation after the Effective Time.

        Parent has agreed that it would give the continuing employees credit for their service with CIFC or any of our subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time for all purposes
(but not for benefit accrual purposes under a defined benefit pension plan) under any benefit plan or arrangement maintained by Parent or one of its subsidiaries or affiliates
that provides benefits to continuing employees after the Effective Time. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent has specifically agreed to cause (i) any
waiting periods, pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements to be waived for continuing employees and their covered dependents and (ii) expenses
incurred by continuing employees and their covered dependents that count towards deductibles, co-insurance, co-payments and out-of-pocket maximums to be taken into
account under applicable plans following the Effective Time.

Arrangements with Parent

        In addition to the Rollover Agreements discussed above, Parent has agreed that Messrs. Vaccaro and Wriedt will each be entitled to a 2016 bonus that is no less
favorable than his respective bonus for

2015, with the percentage of the 2016 bonus payable in cash to be no less than such percentage for 2015.

        As of the date of this proxy statement, none of our other executive officers has entered into any agreement with Parent or any of its affiliates regarding employment
with, or the right to purchase or participate in the equity of, the Surviving Company or one or more of its affiliates. Prior to or following the closing of the Merger, however,
it is possible that some or all of our employees, including our executive officers, may discuss or enter into agreements with Parent or any of its affiliates regarding
employment with, or the right to purchase or participate in the equity of, the Surviving Company or one or more of its affiliates.

Merger-Related Compensation to Named Executive Officers of CIFC

        In accordance with Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K, the table below titled "—Golden Parachute Compensation" sets forth the compensation that is based on or otherwise
relates to the Merger that will or may become payable to each of our named executive officers.

        The amounts indicated in the table below titled "—Golden Parachute Compensation" are estimates of the amounts that would be payable given that the Merger
Consideration is $11.36 and assuming, solely for purposes of this table, that the Merger is consummated on December 1, 2016 and that the employment of each of the named
executive officers is terminated by CIFC without cause on that date. In addition to the assumptions regarding the consummation date of the Merger and termination of the
employment of the named executive officers, these estimates are based on a number of other assumptions, including those described in the footnotes accompanying the tables
below. Accordingly, the ultimate values to be received by a named executive officer in connection with the Merger may materially differ from the amounts set forth below.

        As described below, some of the amounts set forth in the table below would be payable by virtue of the consummation of the Merger ("single-trigger" payments), while
other amounts would be payable only if a qualifying termination of employment occurs in connection with the Merger ("double-trigger" payments).

executives will cease when they commence new employment. The amounts reported in this column for Messrs. Agarwal and Weldon reflect the cash
severance payments they each would receive under CIFC's general severance plan if their employment were terminated by CIFC without cause at
any time, pursuant to which each are eligible to receive, subject to their execution of a general release of claims, severance pay equal to two weeks
of the base salary, multiplied by the number of full years of service (with a minimum of eight weeks of base salary), generally payable in
installments over the applicable number of weeks ($50,000 for Mr. Agarwal and $46,154 for Mr. Weldon). All amounts reported in this column are
double-trigger payments because these amounts will not be payable unless the executives incur a qualifying termination of employment; however,
the amount, timing and form of severance pay will not be affected by whether or not the qualifying termination of employment occurs in connection
with the Merger..

(2) Equity:    With respect to Mr. Vaccaro, represents the value of (i) 8,333 unvested options that will vest and be cashed out upon the Effective Time
($21,249), (ii) 110,850 unvested Company RSUs that will be cashed out upon the Effective Time ($1,281,128) and (iii) 13,900 unvested Company
PSUs that are expected to become vested and earned and that will be cashed out upon the Effective Time ($164,159). With respect to Mr. Wriedt,

Merger Consideration, in which the value of such Company PSUs that is expected to become earned is reflected) ($53,144). With respect to
Mr. Weldon, represents the value of (i) 110,168 unvested Company RSUs that will be cashed out upon the Effective Time ($1,289,079) and
(ii) 10,000 Company PSUs that are expected to become vested and earned and that will be cashed out at the Effective Time (assuming that all
performance goals have been satisfied, except for performance goals based on the amount of the Merger Consideration, in which the value of such
Company PSUs that is expected to become earned is reflected) ($118,101). All amounts in this column are single-trigger payments. 

(3) Perquisites/Benefits:    Under CIFC's general severance plan, in the event of an involuntary termination of employment without cause,
Messrs. Agarwal and Weldon are each eligible to receive, subject to their execution of a general release of claims, payment of COBRA premiums
during the severance pay period if they elect COBRA continuation coverage ($5,120 for Mr. Agarwal and $5,120 for Mr. Weldon). All amounts
reported in this column are double-trigger payments because these benefits will not be provided unless the executives incur a qualifying termination
of employment; however, the amount, timing and form of such benefits will not be affected by whether or not the qualifying termination of
employment occurs in connection with the Merger.

of their 2016 bonuses will be equal to that of their respective 2015 bonuses and also assuming that these amounts will be payable if an executive's
employment is terminated by CIFC without cause on the consummation date of the Merger. These are single-trigger payments. 

(5) The total single-trigger payments for Messrs. Vaccaro, Wriedt, Agarwal and Weldon are $2,689,536, $2,848,912, $875,544 and $1,407,180,
respectively. The total double-trigger payments for Messrs. Vaccaro, Wriedt, Agarwal and Weldon are $2,538,374, $2,538,374, $55,120 and

Indemnification and Insurance of Directors and Executive Officers

        From and after the Effective Time, Parent and Merger Sub will, and shall cause the Surviving Company and its subsidiaries to, fulfill and honor, in all respects, the
obligations of CIFC and our subsidiaries pursuant to any indemnification agreements and any indemnification provision, expense advancement provision and any
exculpation provision set forth in the LLC Agreement, or equivalent organizational documents of CIFC and our subsidiaries.

        The Merger Agreement also provides that the Surviving Company will, and Parent will cause the Surviving Company, to, cause the indemnified parties to be covered for
a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time by the directors' and officers' liability insurance policy maintained by CIFC (provided that the Surviving Company may
substitute therefor policies, of at least the same coverage and amounts and containing terms and conditions that are not less advantageous to the directors and officers of
CIFC and its subsidiaries and other indemnified parties when compared to the insurance maintained by CIFC as of the date of the Merger Agreement) or obtain "tail"
insurance policies from CIFC's current insurance carrier or an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as CIFC's current insurance carrier with respect to
directors' and officers' liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance with a claims period of six (6) years from the Effective Time with at least the same coverage and
amounts and containing terms and conditions that are not less advantageous to the directors and officers of CIFC and its subsidiaries and other indemnified parties, in each
case with respect to claims arising out of or relating to events which occurred at or before the Effective Time (provided, that Parent or the Surviving Company, as applicable,
will not be required to pay an annual premium for such insurance in excess of 300% of the aggregate annual premiums paid by CIFC on annualized basis). The Merger
Agreement provides that in lieu of the foregoing coverage, at any time after the execution of the Merger Agreement, CIFC may (at Parent's expense), purchase a six-year
prepaid "tail policy" that provides coverage no less favorable to the indemnified parties than the coverage described above.

Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger

        The following discussion is a summary of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger that are relevant to certain holders of Common Shares whose
shares are converted into the right to receive cash pursuant to the Merger. This discussion is based upon the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, which we refer to as
the "Code," Treasury Regulations promulgated under the Code, court decisions, administrative rulings, published positions of the Internal Revenue Service, which we refer
to as the "IRS", and other applicable authorities, all as in effect on the date of this proxy statement and all of which are subject to change or differing interpretations, possibly
with retroactive effect. This discussion is limited to holders who hold their Common Shares as "capital assets" within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally,
property held for investment purposes). For purposes of this discussion, a "holder" means either a U.S. Holder or a Non-U.S. Holder (each as defined below) or both, as the
context may require.

        This discussion is for general information only and does not address all of the tax consequences that may be relevant to a holder that is subject to special tax rules, such
as: financial institutions; tax-exempt organizations; partnerships, S corporations or other entities treated as pass-through entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes;
insurance companies; retirement plans and other tax-deferred accounts; mutual funds; dealers in stocks and securities; traders in securities that elect to use the mark-to-
market method of tax accounting for their securities; regulated investment companies; real

estate investment trusts; personal holding companies; certain expatriates or former long-term residents of the United States; holders subject to the alternative minimum tax;
holders holding the shares as part of a hedging, constructive sale or conversion, straddle or other risk reducing transaction; holders that received their Common Shares in a
compensatory transaction; holders who own an equity interest, actually or constructively, in Parent and Merger Sub or the Surviving Company following the Merger; U.S.
Holders whose "functional currency" is not the U.S. dollar; or holders that are "controlled foreign corporations," "passive foreign investment companies," or corporations that
accumulate earnings to avoid U.S. federal income tax. In addition this discussion does not describe any tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or non-
United States jurisdiction and does not consider any aspects of U.S. federal tax law other than income taxation, nor does it address any aspects of the tax on "net investment
income" imposed under Section 1411 of the Code.

        If a partnership (including an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) is a beneficial owner of Common Shares, the tax
treatment of a partner in such partnership generally will depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. Such partnerships and their partners should
consult their tax advisors regarding the consequences of the Merger.

        No ruling has been or will be obtained from the IRS regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger. If the IRS contests a conclusion set forth herein,
no assurance can be given that a holder would ultimately prevail in a final determination by a court.

        THIS DISCUSSION IS PROVIDED FOR GENERAL INFORMATION ONLY AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE LEGAL ADVICE TO ANY HOLDER.
EACH HOLDER SHOULD CONSULT ITS OWN TAX ADVISORS CONCERNING THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES RELATING TO
THE MERGER IN LIGHT OF ITS PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES AND ANY CONSEQUENCES ARISING UNDER THE LAWS OF ANY U.S. STATE OR
LOCAL OR NON-U.S. TAXING JURISDICTION.

U.S. Holders

        For purposes of this discussion, a "U.S. Holder" is a beneficial owner of Common Shares of CIFC that is for U.S. federal income tax purposes:

• An individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States; 

• A corporation, or other entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, created or organized in or under the laws of the United States or
any state thereof or the District of Columbia; 

• An estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or 

• A trust (i) that is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and the control of one or more United States persons as defined in
section 7701(a)(30) of the Code or (ii) that has a valid election in effect under applicable Treasury regulations to be treated as a United States person.

        The receipt of cash by a U.S. Holder in exchange for Common Shares pursuant to the Merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. A U.S.
Holder generally will recognize gain or loss as a result of the Merger in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between (i) the amount of cash received by the U.S. Holder
in the Merger and the U.S. Holder's pro rata share of the indebtedness, if any, of CIFC LLC and (ii) the U.S. Holder's adjusted tax basis in the shares surrendered pursuant to
the Merger (including the U.S. Holder's pro rata share of the indebtedness, if any, of CIFC LLC). A U.S. Holder's adjusted tax basis will be adjusted to reflect the U.S.
Holder's

Table of Contents

allocable share of the taxable income or loss of CIFC LLC through the Effective Time. A U.S. Holder should consult his or her tax advisor with respect to the calculation of
the U.S. Holder's adjusted tax basis in the shares surrendered in the Merger. Any gain or loss recognized by a U.S. Holder generally will be capital gain or loss and will be
long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. Holder's holding period in such shares is longer than one (1) year at the time of the completion of the Merger. However, a portion of
such U.S. Holder's amount realized, whether or not representing gain, will be treated as ordinary income to the extent attributable to such U.S. Holder's allocable share of
certain "inventory" items and "unrealized receivable" of CIFC LLC as prescribed in section 751 of the Code. Long-term capital gains of non-corporate U.S. Holders
generally are subject to U.S. federal income tax at preferential rates. There are limitations on the deductibility of capital losses. If a U.S. Holder acquired different blocks of
Common Shares at different times, any capital gain or loss will be divided between long-term and short-term capital gain or loss in the same proportion as the holding period
of such interest is divided between the portion held for more than one year and the portion held for one year or less.

Non-U.S. Holders

        For purposes of this discussion, the term "Non-U.S. Holder" means a beneficial owner of Common Shares who or that is neither a U.S. Holder nor a partnership for
U.S. federal income tax purposes.

        Special rules not discussed below may apply to certain Non-U.S. Holders subject to special tax treatment such as "controlled foreign corporations" or "passive foreign
investment companies." Non-U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors to determine the U.S. federal, state, local and other tax consequences that may be relevant to
them in light of their particular circumstances.

        Any gain realized by a Non-U.S. Holder pursuant to the Merger generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax unless:

• The gain is effectively connected with a trade or business of such Non-U.S. Holder in the United States (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, is
attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by such Non-U.S. Holder in the United States), in which case such gain generally will be subject to U.S.
federal income tax at rates generally applicable to U.S. Holders, and, if the Non-U.S. Holder is a corporation, such gain may also be subject to the branch
profits tax at a rate of 30% (or a lower rate under an applicable tax treaty); or 

• Such Non-U.S. Holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of that disposition, and certain other
specified conditions are met, in which case such gain will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a rate of 30% (or a lower rate under an applicable tax
treaty); or 

• CIFC LLC was engaged in the conduct of a trade or business in the United States. While the IRS may take a different position, CIFC LLC believes that it has
structured its operations so that CIFC should not be viewed as having conducted a trade or business within the United States.

Information Reporting and Backup Withholding

        Information reporting and backup withholding may apply to the proceeds received by a holder pursuant to the Merger. Backup withholding will generally not apply to a
holder that (1) furnishes a correct taxpayer identification number and certifies that such holder is not subject to backup withholding on a properly completed IRS Form W-9
(or successor form), (2) provides a certification that such holder is not a U.S. person on an applicable and properly completed IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E (or
successor form), or (3) otherwise establishes an exemption from backup withholding. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup
withholding rules will be allowed as a credit against the holder's U.S. federal income tax liability, and may entitle such holder to a refund, provided that the required
information is timely furnished to the IRS.

Regulatory Approval

        There is no filing required under the HSR Act in connection with the Merger, and therefore, the condition related to the HSR Act has been satisfied.

        At any time before or after the Effective Time, the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice or the FTC could take action under the antitrust laws,
including seeking to enjoin the consummation of the Merger. In addition, U.S. state attorneys general could take such action under the antitrust laws as they deem necessary
or desirable in the public interest, including seeking to enjoin the consummation of the Merger or permitting completion subject to regulatory conditions. Although neither
we nor Parent believe that the Merger violates the antitrust laws, there can be no assurance that a challenge to the Merger on antitrust grounds will not be made or, if such a
challenge is made, that it would not be successful.

THE MERGER AGREEMENT 

        The following is a summary of the material terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement. This summary does not purport to be complete and may not contain all of the
information about the Merger Agreement that is important to you. This summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text of the Merger Agreement, a copy
of which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex A and is incorporated by reference into this proxy statement. We encourage you to read the Merger Agreement carefully
and in its entirety because it is the legal document that governs the Merger.

Explanatory Note Regarding the Merger Agreement

        The following summary of the Merger Agreement is intended to provide information regarding certain key terms of the Merger Agreement. The Merger Agreement
contains representations and warranties by us, Parent and Merger Sub which were made only for purposes of that agreement and as of specified dates. The representations,
warranties and covenants in the Merger Agreement were made solely for the benefit of the parties to the Merger Agreement and were made for the purposes of allocating
contractual risk between the parties to the Merger Agreement instead of establishing these

matters as facts. The representations, warranties and covenants in the Merger Agreement may be subject to limitations agreed upon by the contracting parties, including being
qualified by the disclosure letter delivered contemporaneously with the execution of the Merger Agreement, and being subject to contractual standards of materiality or
material adverse effect that generally differ from those applicable to investors. In addition, information concerning the subject matter of the representations, warranties and
covenants may change after the date of the Merger Agreement, which subsequent information may or may not be fully reflected in our public disclosures.

Structure of the Merger

        At the Effective Time, Merger Sub will merge with and into us. We will be the Surviving Company in the Merger and will continue our corporate existence under the
laws of the State of Delaware as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. The LLC Agreement in effect at the Effective Time will be amended in connection with the Merger
and will be the limited liability company agreement of the Surviving Company. The directors of Merger Sub at the Effective Time will be the directors of the Surviving
Company and our officers at the Effective Time will be the initial officers of the Surviving Company, in each case until their respective successors are duly elected and
qualified.

Closing and Effective Time of the Merger

        The closing of the Merger will take place at 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on the third business day following the satisfaction or waiver (subject to applicable law) of
all conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement and described below under "—Conditions to the Completion of the Merger" (other than those conditions that, by their terms,
cannot be satisfied until the closing date, but subject to the satisfaction or, where permitted, waiver of those conditions as of the closing).

        The Merger will become effective at such time as the certificate of merger is duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such subsequent time as
we and Parent shall agree and as will be specified in the certificate of merger. As of the date of this proxy statement, we expect to consummate the Merger in the fourth
quarter of 2016. However, completion of the Merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to the completion of the Merger, and it is possible that factors
outside the control of us, Parent or Merger Sub could delay the completion of the Merger, or prevent it from being completed at all. There may be a substantial amount of
time between the date of the Annual Meeting and the completion of the Merger. We expect to consummate the Merger promptly following the receipt of all required
approvals.

Effect of the Merger on Our Shares

        At the Effective Time, each Common Share outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than the Excluded Shares (as defined below)) will be converted
into the right to receive $11.36, in cash, subject to any withholding of taxes required by applicable law. At the Effective Time, all of our Common Shares (other than the
Excluded Shares) will cease to be outstanding, will automatically be canceled and retired and will cease to exist, and will thereafter represent only the right to receive the per
share Merger Consideration of $11.36 in cash, subject to any withholding of taxes required by applicable law.

        At the Effective Time, each Common Share held by us, Parent or Merger Sub or any of our or their respective subsidiaries (other than shares held by any subsidiary of
ours, which shall remain outstanding with appropriate adjustment to the number thereof to preserve its relative interest in us, and other than shares held on behalf of third
parties) will be canceled without payment of any consideration. We refer to the shares described in the preceding sentence, the dissenting shares described below and the
shares subject to the Rollover Agreements as the "Excluded Shares." Each

Table of Contents

common share of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be converted into one common share representing one membership interest
of the Surviving Company.

        Common Shares held by a dissenting shareholder who properly perfected its rights of appraisal within the meaning of Section 262 of the DGCL will represent the right
to receive payment of the appraised value of those shares as determined in accordance with the DGCL. Further information related to dissenting shareholders and their rights
is described in the section below "Appraisal Rights".

Procedures for Surrendering Common Shares for Payment

        Prior to the Effective Time, Parent or Merger Sub will deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the paying agent cash in the aggregate amount necessary for the paying
agent to pay the Merger Consideration (other than amounts to be paid through our payroll system) to our shareholders (other than shareholders that properly perfect appraisal
rights and Common Shares cancelled without payment as described above under "—Effect of the Merger on Our Shares").

        Promptly (and no later than two (2) business days) after the closing, Parent shall send, or shall cause the paying agent to send, to each record holder, as of the Effective
Time, of Common Shares which have converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration with respect thereto, a form of letter of transmittal and instructions for
effecting the surrender of any certificate representing Common Shares or uncertificated shares represented by book-entry, which we refer to as book-entry shares, as the case
may be, in exchange for the Merger Consideration to which such shareholder is entitled pursuant to the Merger Agreement.

        Upon proper surrender to the paying agent of a certificate representing Common Shares or book-entry shares, together with the letter of transmittal, duly executed and
properly completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, the paying agent will issue and deliver to the holder of such certificate or book-entry shares the Merger
Consideration for such shares.

        Any shareholder who surrenders a certificate representing Common Shares or book-entry shares at least three (3) business days prior to the Effective Time, together
with a duly executed and properly completed letter of transmittal and such other proper documentation as the paying agent reasonably requests (which letter of transmittal
and other documentation Parent will cause the paying agent to provide promptly upon request of a shareholder, but in no event later than five (5) business days prior to the
Effective Time), the paying agent shall pay to such shareholder on the closing date the Merger Consideration for such shares.

        If any certificate representing Common Shares has been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such certificate to
be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Company, the posting by such person of a bond in such reasonable amount as may be directed by the Surviving
Company as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such certificate and delivery to the paying agent of any other documentation (including
an indemnity in customary form) reasonably requested by Parent, the paying agent will pay an amount equal to the consideration that would be payable in respect thereof
pursuant to the Merger Agreement.

        In the event of a transfer of ownership of Common Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of CIFC, it will be a condition of payment that such certificate so
surrendered or such book-entry share will be accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer
tax either has been paid or is not payable.

        Any portion of the funds deposited with the paying agent for payment to our shareholders that remains unclaimed by our shareholders twelve (12) months after the
Effective Time will be returned to the Surviving Company. Any holder of our Common Shares may thereafter look only to the Surviving Company for payment of the
Merger Consideration.

Withholding

        The Surviving Company, Parent and paying agent are entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any person pursuant to the Merger
Agreement such amounts as they are required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any other applicable state, local or
foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are withheld, such amounts will be treated as having been paid to the person in respect of which such deduction and withholding
was made.

Treatment of Our Equity-Based Awards

        The Merger Agreement provides that CIFC's equity and equity-based awards that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be subject to the
following treatment at the Effective Time:

        Share Options.    Each share option to purchase Common Shares that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, that has not been forfeited (or if previously
forfeited, is required to be reinstated if a change in control event or sale event occurs within a specified period following such forfeiture), will become fully vested to the
extent then unvested and be canceled in exchange for the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of (i) the total number of Common Shares
subject to the share option as of the Effective Time and (ii) the amount by which the Merger Consideration exceeds the exercise price per share of Common Shares
underlying the share option (but if the foregoing equals or is less than zero, such share option will be cancelled and forfeited without payment).

        Time-Based Vesting Restricted Share Units.    Each Company RSU that is outstanding prior to the Effective Time (other than certain specified Company RSUs and any
Company RSU to be assumed by Parent pursuant to the Rollover Agreements), that has not been forfeited (or if previously forfeited, is required to be reinstated if a change in
control event or sale event occurs within a specified period following such forfeiture), will be fully vested and be canceled in exchange for the right to receive an amount in
cash determined by multiplying (i) the Merger Consideration by (ii) the total number of Common Shares subject to such Company RSU as of the Effective Time. In addition,
certain Company RSUs that are entitled to receive dividend equivalents will be paid any accrued dividend equivalents at the Effective Time.

        Performance-Based Vesting Restricted Share Units.    Each Company PSU that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any Company PSU
to be assumed by Parent pursuant to the Rollover Agreements), that has not been forfeited (or if previously forfeited, is required to be reinstated if a change in control event
or sale event occurs within a specified period following such forfeiture), will be fully vested and be canceled and the holder will be entitled to receive an amount in cash,
without interest, equal to the amount determined by multiplying (i) the Merger Consideration and (ii) the total number of Common Shares subject to any such Company PSU
(assuming such aggregate number of Common Shares shall be determined assuming the maximum level of performance for such Company PSU except for those Company
PSUs that become earned based on the Merger Consideration, in which case the total number of Common Shares subject to any such Company PSU shall be based on the
amount of the Merger Consideration). In addition, certain Company PSUs that are entitled to receive dividend equivalents will be paid any accrued dividend equivalents at
the Effective Time.

        Warrant.    CIFC currently has a Company Warrant outstanding to acquire Common Shares. At the Effective Time, the Company Warrant will be canceled in exchange
for the right to receive pursuant to the terms of the Company Warrant (i) an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of (x) the aggregate number of Common
Shares for which such Company Warrant is exercisable into as of

the Effective Time and (y) the amount by which the Merger Consideration exceeds the exercise price per share of the Common Shares underlying the Company Warrant and
(ii) the product of the aggregate number of Common Shares for which such Company Warrant is exercisable, and the sum of the amount of dividends declared since the date
of issuance of the Company Warrant prior to the date of the Merger Agreement (which shall be an amount equal to $1.59) plus any dividends paid after the date of the
Merger Agreement and prior to the closing of the Merger.

• the enforceability of, and absence of default under, the Guarantee delivered by the Guarantor.

        None of the representations and warranties in the Merger Agreement will survive the Effective Time.

• enter into or participate in any discussions or negotiations in connection with any Acquisition Proposal or inquiry with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, or
furnish any non-public information with respect to its business, properties or assets in connection with any Acquisition Proposal; 

• waive, terminate, modify or release any person (other than Parent, Merger Sub and their respective affiliates) from any provision of or grant any permission,
waiver or request under any "standstill" or similar agreement or obligation, unless the Board has determined in good faith after consultation with outside legal
counsel that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law; or 

• agree to resolve to take, or take, any of the actions prohibited by the Merger Agreement, as described in the above bullets.

        For purposes of the Merger Agreement, "Acquisition Proposal" means any offer or proposal (other than a proposal or offer by Parent or any of its subsidiaries) (a) for a
merger, reorganization, recapitalization, consolidation, share exchange, business combination, liquidation, dissolution or other similar transaction involving us or any of our
subsidiaries whose assets constitute more than 15% of our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (b) to acquire, directly or indirectly, securities
representing more than 15% of the voting power of CIFC, more than 15% of our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or more than 15% of the total
capital stock of CIFC and our subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

        We agreed to immediately cease, and cause our representatives and other intermediaries to immediately cease, any and all existing activities, discussions or negotiations
with any parties conducted prior to signing the Merger Agreement with respect to an Acquisition Proposal and agreed to immediately terminate online data room access to all
such parties and their representatives. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we may, following the receipt of an Acquisition Proposal, contact the person that has made such
Acquisition Proposal to (i) clarify and understand the terms and conditions thereof solely to facilitate the determination by the Board of whether such Acquisition Proposal
constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to, a Superior Proposal (as defined below), and (ii) inform such person of the existence of our obligations under the
Merger Agreement related to Acquisition Proposals.

        Notwithstanding these restrictions, we, directly or indirectly through our affiliates, directors, officers, employees, representatives or other intermediaries, may, prior to
the adoption of the Merger Agreement by the affirmative vote or consent of the holders of a majority of our outstanding Common Shares, (i) engage in negotiations or
discussions with any person (and its representatives and intermediaries) that has made an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal not resulting from or arising out
of a breach of our non-solicitation obligations under the Merger Agreement, and/or (ii) furnish to such person information relating to us or any of our subsidiaries pursuant to
an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement (as defined below) and to the extent nonpublic information that has not been made available to Parent is made available to such
person, make available or furnish such nonpublic information to Parent promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) following the time it is provided to such person, in the
case of each of clauses (i) or (ii), if, and only if, prior to taking such particular action, the Board has determined in good faith after consultation with its financial advisors and
outside legal counsel that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to, a Superior Proposal, and that the failure to take such action
would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law.

        For purposes of the Merger Agreement (i) "Superior Proposal" means any proposal (on its most recently amended or modified terms, if amended or modified) made by
a third party to enter into any transaction involving an Acquisition Proposal that the Board determines in its good faith judgment (after consultation with our outside legal
counsel and financial advisor) would be, if consummated,

more favorable to our shareholders than the Merger Agreement and the Merger, considering such factors as the Board considers to be appropriate, except that the references
to "15%" in the definition of "Acquisition Proposal" shall be deemed to be references to "50%"; and (ii) "Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement" means a confidentiality
agreement that contains provisions that are no less favorable to us in the aggregate than those contained in that certain letter agreement, dated June 13, 2016, between CIFC
and Parent; provided, however, such confidentiality agreement shall not be required to include a standstill provision or in any way prohibit the making or amendment of an
Acquisition Proposal.

        We have agreed to notify Parent promptly (but in any event within 24 hours) after receipt of any bona fide Acquisition Proposal and the material terms and conditions of
any such Acquisition Proposal. We have also agreed to keep Parent reasonably informed of the status and material details (including any amendments or proposed
amendments) of any such Acquisition Proposal and keep Parent reasonably informed as to the material details of all discussions or negotiations with respect to any such
Acquisition Proposal (in each case in a manner that is not unduly disruptive of our ability to conduct good faith discussions in accordance with the Merger Agreement with
the party making such Acquisition Proposal and its representatives, advisors and agents) and shall provide Parent within 24 hours after receipt thereof all copies of any other
documentation, including any drafts of any definitive acquisition agreement, merger agreement or similar definitive agreement with respect to such Acquisition Proposal,
material to understanding such Acquisition Proposal (as determined by us) received by us from the person (or from any representatives, advisors or agents of such person)
making such Acquisition Proposal or with whom such discussions or negotiations are taking place; provided that, for the sake of clarity, it is understood and agreed that all
such information and communications shall be subject to the confidentiality agreement between us and Parent.

        Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Merger Agreement, prior to the adoption of the Merger Agreement by the affirmative vote or consent of the holders of a
majority of our outstanding Common Shares, the Board may: (x) withdraw, modify or amend in any manner adverse to Parent its approval or recommendation of the Merger
Agreement or the Merger or recommend an Acquisition Proposal, or enter into a definitive acquisition agreement, merger agreement or similar definitive agreement or
resolve or agree to take any of the foregoing actions (any of the foregoing actions, a "Company Adverse Recommendation Change") (i) in response to an intervening event
(which refers to a material event or circumstance that was not known to the Board on the date of the Merger Agreement (or if known, the consequences of which were not
known to nor reasonably foreseeable by the Board as of such date which event or circumstance, or any material consequences thereof, becomes known to the Board);
provided, however, that in no event shall the receipt, existence or terms of an Acquisition Proposal or any matter relating thereto or consequence thereof constitute an
intervening event, or (ii) following receipt of an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a breach of certain of our obligations under the
Merger Agreement and which the Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action
would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law, or (y) following receipt of an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that did not result from
a breach of certain of our obligations under the Merger Agreement and which the Board determines in good faith, in consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal
counsel constitutes a Superior Proposal or would reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal, terminate the Merger Agreement in accordance with the provisions
thereof and enter into a definitive acquisition agreement, merger agreement or similar definitive agreement (not to include an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement) with
respect to such Superior Proposal, if, and only if, the Board has determined in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that the
failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law and we pay the applicable Termination Fee to Parent substantially concurrently
with such termination, as further described in "—Termination of the Merger Agreement" and "—Termination Fee."

        However, we can make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate the Merger Agreement as described above if and only if we have taken the
following actions:

• we have provided Parent with at least four (4) business days' prior written notice advising Parent we intend to effect a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change and specifying, in reasonable detail, the reasons therefor and all material information with respect to such intervening event (including in relation to
all developments related thereto); 

• if requested by Parent, we have negotiated in good faith with Parent during such four-business-day period following our delivery of the notice described
above (the "Negotiation Period"), to the extent Parent desires to negotiate, to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement
such that the Board would determine in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that the failure of the Board to
make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change would not be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law; 

• following the end of the Negotiation Period, the Board has considered in good faith Parent's revisions to the Merger Agreement, if any, and determined in
good faith such Superior Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal or the failure to effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change with
respect to such intervening event continues to be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with fiduciary duties under applicable law or even if the revisions in
Parent's written proposal, if any, were given effect; 

• we have provided Parent with at least four (4) business days' prior written notice (it being understood and agreed that any material amendment to the amount
or form of consideration payable in connection with the applicable Acquisition Proposal shall require a new notice and a two-business-day period) advising
Parent that the Board intends to take such action, specifying the material terms and conditions of the Superior Proposal and that we shall, if requested by
Parent, during such four-business-day period (or two-business-day period, if applicable), negotiate with Parent (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) to
make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement such that such Acquisition Proposal would no longer constitute a Superior
Proposal; and 

• in the event of any material change to the terms of or any change to the Merger Consideration of such Superior Proposal, we have delivered to Parent an
additional notice consistent the requirements described above and extended the Negotiation Period for two (2) business days.

Board Obligation to Call a Shareholders' Meeting

        We have agreed under the Merger Agreement to call, give notice of, and convene a meeting of our shareholders to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement as promptly
as reasonably practicable after the date on which the SEC confirms that is has no further comments on this proxy statement.

Required Efforts to Consummate the Merger

        We and Parent have agreed to cooperate and use our respective reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to
assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, and to satisfy all conditions to, in the most
expeditious manner practicable, the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including:

• the obtaining of all necessary consents from governmental entities, and the making of all necessary registrations and filings (including filings with
governmental entities) and the taking of all steps as may be necessary to obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid an action or proceeding by, any
governmental entities;

• the execution and delivery of any additional instruments necessary to consummate the Merger and to fully carry out the purposes of the Merger Agreement.

        We and Parent have agreed to file or cause to be filed any and all initial notifications with respect to the Merger and other transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement required under the HSR Act as promptly as practicable and in any event within ten (10) business days after the date of the Merger Agreement and to use our
reasonable best efforts to obtain prompt approval of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement or cause the expiration or termination of
any applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act. There is no filing required under the HSR Act in connection with the Merger, and therefore, the condition related to the
HSR Act has been satisfied. We and Parent have agreed to allow the other party, if permitted by applicable law, the opportunity to attend and participate in any material
meeting with any governmental entity in respect of any filing made therewith in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

Certain Investor-Related Consents and Waivers

        We have agreed under the Merger Agreement to use commercially reasonable efforts (without a requirement to offer or grant any material accommodation or material
alteration of terms (financial or otherwise)) to obtain the required investment-related consents; provided, however, that prior to obtaining any consent which would require
payment of any fee above a certain threshold, we shall have obtained the written consent of Parent.

        We have agreed under the Merger Agreement to use commercially reasonable efforts (without a requirement to offer or grant any material accommodation or material
alteration of terms (financial or otherwise)) to obtain the required investor waivers in the manner prescribed under the applicable fund documents as to constitute a valid
consent thereunder on the earliest practicable date; provided, however, that prior to obtaining any Investor Waiver which would require payment of any fee above a certain
threshold, CIFC shall have obtained the written consent of Parent.

        At the reasonable request of Parent, subject to applicable fiduciary duties, the terms of the relevant investment advisory arrangement and as permitted by applicable law,
we, as determined in our reasonable discretion, may request that each investment adviser subsidiary (x) provide a notice to any client that has not consented to the assignment
prior to the closing stating that such client's account may be terminated if such consent is not received by the closing and (y) terminate the investment advisory arrangement
with such client effective immediately prior to the closing if such consent has not been received.

        We have agreed to seek Parent's approval of the form and substance of any notice or other materials to be distributed to any client or other persons in order to obtain the
necessary consent or investor waiver, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed. In addition, the consent of Parent shall be required with
respect to any amendment or modification to any client contract for the purpose of obtaining any such consent that is adverse in any material respect to Parent, CIFC or any
of our subsidiaries; provided, however, that the payment of any fee in connection with obtaining a consent or investor waiver that is effectuated in accordance with the
Merger Agreement shall in no circumstance be determined to be an amendment or modification to a client contract that is adverse in any material respect to Parent, CIFC or
any of our subsidiaries.

Shareholder Litigation Related to the Merger

        We have agreed under the Merger Agreement to keep Parent informed of and consult and cooperate with Parent in connection with, any shareholder litigation or claim
against CIFC and/or our directors or officers relating to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (other than any litigation where the
interests of CIFC or any of its affiliates are adverse to

Employee Benefits Matters

        From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Company and its subsidiaries to honor all employee benefit plans, and compensation arrangements
and agreements in accordance with their terms as in effect immediately before the Effective Time, provided that the foregoing shall not be construed as prohibiting the
amendment or termination of any such employee benefit plans, and compensation arrangements and agreements in accordance with its terms.

        Until the first anniversary of the Effective Time, each employee of CIFC or our subsidiaries who remains employed following the Merger, who we refer to as a
continuing employee, will be provided with base salaries, wages and commission rates and bonus opportunities that, in the aggregate, are at least equal to those provided by
CIFC and our subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time and all other employee benefits (excluding change of control benefits, retention bonuses and equity
incentive awards) that are no less favorable, in the aggregate, than the employee benefits provided by CIFC and our subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time.
Until the first anniversary of the Effective Time, Parent has also agreed to provide or cause the Surviving Company to provide severance benefits no less favorable than the
severance benefits required under the applicable severance benefit plans and arrangements of CIFC and our subsidiaries as in effect on the date of the Merger Agreement.

        Parent has agreed that it would give the continuing employees credit for their service with CIFC prior to the Merger in connection with any employee benefit plan
maintained by Parent or any of its subsidiaries or any respective affiliate (including the Surviving Company), except where such credit would result in the duplication of
benefits.

exclusions and limitations and actively-at-work requirements, eligibility waiting periods and evidence of insurability to be waived for continuing employees and their

plans following the Effective Time.

Agreement, or pursuant to any other contracts in effect on the date of the Merger Agreement and disclosed to Parent, shall survive the Merger and remain in full force and
effect in accordance with their terms for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time.

        From and after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted by the organizational documents of CIFC, Parent and the Surviving Company shall jointly and
severally, indemnify, defend and hold harmless each Indemnified Party, against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, fees, expenses, judgments, fines and amounts

financing. In addition, Parent provided us with a true and complete copy of the Commitment Letter prior to executing the Merger Agreement and represented that such letter

Amendments, Waivers

        The Merger Agreement may be amended by the parties thereto, by action taken or authorized by their respective boards of directors, at any time before or after approval
of the matters presented in connection with the Merger by the shareholders of CIFC, but, after any such approval, no amendment shall be made which by law requires further
approval by such shareholders without such further approval. The Merger Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the
parties thereto.

Governing Law and Venue, Waiver of Jury Trial

        The Merger Agreement and all claims or causes of action (whether in contract or tort) that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to the Merger Agreement or the
negotiation, execution or performance of the Merger Agreement shall be construed, performed and enforced in accordance with, and governed by, the laws of the State of
Delaware, without giving effect to any applicable principles of conflict of laws that would cause the laws of another State to otherwise govern the Merger Agreement. Each
party agreed to irrevocably consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or, if such court does not have jurisdiction, any federal
court located in the State of Delaware or other Delaware state courts (and in each case, any appellate court therefrom) for purposes of any action, suit or proceeding seeking

ADVISORY VOTE ON NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICER
MERGER-RELATED COMPENSATION

(PROPOSAL 2) 

        We are submitting to our shareholders a proposal to approve on an advisory (non-binding) basis compensation that will or may become payable to our named executive
officers in connection with the Merger. This compensation is summarized under the heading "Merger-Related Compensation to Named Executive Officers of CIFC" in
"Approval of the Merger and the Merger Agreement (Proposal 1)—Interests of Our Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger."

        The Board encourages you to review carefully the Merger-related compensation information disclosed in this proxy statement. The Board recommends that our
shareholders approve the following resolution (the "Merger Consideration Resolution"):

        "RESOLVED, that the shareholders of CIFC LLC hereby approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the compensation that will or may become payable to the named
executive officers of CIFC LLC that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger as disclosed pursuant to Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K in the section entitled "Merger-
Related Compensation to Named Executive Officers of CIFC" under "Approval of the Merger and the Merger Agreement (Proposal 1)—Interests of Our Directors and
Executive Officers in the Merger" in the proxy statement."

        The vote to approve the Merger-related compensation that will or may become payable to our named executive officers is a vote separate and apart from the vote on the
proposal to authorize, approve and adopt the Merger Agreement. Accordingly, you may vote "FOR" the approval of the proposal to authorize, approve and adopt the Merger
Agreement, and "AGAINST" the proposal to approve Merger-related compensation, or vice versa. Because the vote to approve the Merger-related compensation to be paid
or become payable to our named executive officers is advisory only, it will not be binding on us or Parent. Accordingly, if the Merger Agreement is authorized, approved and
adopted

and the Merger is completed, the compensation will be payable, subject only to the conditions applicable thereto, regardless of the outcome of this advisory (non-binding)
vote.

        The above resolution approving the Merger-related compensation of our named executive officers on an advisory basis will require the affirmative vote of holders of a
majority of the Common Shares present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on such proposal at the Annual Meeting.

        The Board recommends a vote "FOR" the approval of the Merger Consideration Resolution.

VOTE ON ADJOURNMENT (PROPOSAL 3) 

        Our shareholders are being asked to approve a proposal that will give us authority to adjourn the Annual Meeting from time to time to, if necessary or appropriate,
among other things, solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of the Annual Meeting, or any adjournment thereof, to approve the proposal to
authorize, approve and adopt the Merger Agreement. If this proposal is authorized, approved and adopted, the Annual Meeting could be adjourned by the Board to any date
for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes at the time of the Annual Meeting, or any adjournment thereof, to approve the proposal to
authorize, approve and adopt the Merger Agreement. The Board could postpone the Annual Meeting before it commences, whether for the purpose of soliciting additional
proxies or for other reasons. If the Annual Meeting is adjourned, shareholders who have already submitted their proxies will be able to revoke them at any time prior to their
use. We do not intend to call a vote on this proposal if the proposal to authorize, approve and adopt the Merger Agreement has been approved and adopted by our
shareholders at the Annual Meeting.

        Approval of this proposal requires the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the Common Shares present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on

purpose of soliciting additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes at the time of the Annual Meeting to approve the proposal to authorize, approve and adopt the
Merger Agreement.

The Board, Its Committees and Corporate Governance

Board Composition and Criteria for Selection of Directors

        Pursuant to the Third Amended and Restated Stockholders Agreement (the "Shareholders Agreement") by and among CIFC and DFR Holdings, the Board will
nominate, or cause to be nominated, and recommend for election, and DFR Holdings will take all necessary action to ensure that at each annual or special meeting of the
shareholders at which an election of directors is held or pursuant to any written consent of the shareholders for the election of directors, the following persons will be elected

        With respect to the independent directors that the Nominating Committee may recommend, the Nominating Committee has not established specific minimum
qualifications, or specific qualities or skills, for directors. The Nominating Committee typically recommends candidates based on its overall assessment of their skills and
characteristics and the composition of our Board as a whole, including the nominee's independence under our categorical independence standards and director diversity, skills
and experience in the context of our Board's needs. The Nominating Committee's process for identifying and evaluating director nominees is based on various factors,

Table of Contents

Committee considers, without limitation, a director nominee's independence, skills and other attributes, experience, perspective, background and diversity. In evaluating
director nominees, the Nominating Committee defines "diversity" broadly and considers diversity with respect to viewpoints, background, experience, skill, education,
national origin, gender, race, age, culture and current affiliations. The Nominating Committee nominates each independent director for election at the annual meeting based
upon an evaluation of each director.

Recommendation of Directors by Shareholders

        The charter of the Nominating Committee provides that such committee shall consider director nominations from our shareholders. The nominating shareholder must
deliver the nomination to our Secretary at least ninety (90) days and no more than 120 days before the first anniversary of the date of the preceding year's annual shareholders
meeting, and the shareholder must provide a detailed statement of the nominee's qualifications and the nominee's written consent. If the date of the annual meeting is more
than thirty (30) days before or more than seventy (70) days after the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting, then the nomination must be delivered not
earlier than the 120th day prior to the date of such annual meeting and not later than 5:00 p.m., Eastern time, on the later of (i) the 90th day prior to such annual meeting or
(ii) if the first public announcement of the date of such annual meeting is less than 100 days prior to the date of such annual meeting, the 10th day following the day on which
public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made.

Independence of Directors; Controlled Company Exemption

        As required by the NASDAQ Listing Rules, the Board evaluates the independence of its members at least annually and at other appropriate times when a change in
circumstances could potentially impact the independence or effectiveness of one of our directors. The Board has determined that Messrs. Serota, Schrupp and Smith have no
material relationships with us and are "independent" as that term is defined under the general independence standards of NASDAQ. The remaining members of the Board are
not "independent" as that term is defined under the general independence standards of NASDAQ. DFR Holdings holds over 50% of the outstanding shares of CIFC thereby
allowing CIFC to elect to become a "controlled company" as defined by Rule 5615(c) of the NASDAQ Listing Rules. As a result, CIFC is exempt from substantially all
corporate governance and independence requirements other than those related to the Audit Committee of the Board (the "Audit Committee"). Pursuant to the Shareholders
Agreement, CIFC must elect to be a "controlled company" for so long as DFR Holdings holds over 50% of the outstanding shares of CIFC. DFR Holdings will take all action
necessary for CIFC to be treated as a "controlled company" (other than not transferring shares) and make all necessary filings and disclosures associated with such status. As
such, CIFC is not required to have a majority of independent directors, and Messrs. Serota, Schrupp and Smith are CIFC's only independent directors.

Board's Role in Risk Oversight

        The Board is responsible for consideration and oversight of risks facing CIFC, and is responsible for ensuring that material risks are identified and managed
appropriately. As set forth in the Audit Committee charter, the Audit Committee is charged with the evaluation of risk assessment and CIFC's risk management policies. In
fulfilling this role, the Audit Committee receives reports directly from CIFC's internal audit function. In addition, the Audit Committee reviews and approves the internal
audit plan once a year and receives periodic reports from members of senior management and an internal audit on areas of material risk to CIFC, including operational and
financial risks.

Table of Contents

        Our other Board committees also have responsibility for the oversight of risk management. For example, the Compensation Committee of the Board (the
"Compensation Committee") considers the risks associated with our compensation policies and practices. Further, the Nominating Committee oversees risks associated
with our governance structure and processes and annually reviews our organizational documents and other policies. The committees primarily keep the Board informed of
their risk oversight and related activities through reports of the committee chairmen to the full Board. The Board also considers specific risk topics in connection with
strategic planning and other matters.

Corporate Governance

        CIFC and its operating subsidiaries have adopted codes of ethics that apply to their officers, directors and employees. CIFC's codes include a Code of Ethics, as defined
in Item 406 of Regulation S-K, that applies to its principal executive officers, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or controller and persons performing
similar functions. All of CIFC's corporate governance documents, including the Code of Ethics and committee charters are available free of charge on CIFC's website at
www.cifc.com and will be provided free of charge to any Shareholder requesting copies by writing to: Attn: Investor Relations, CIFC LLC, 250 Park Avenue, 4th Floor, New

of Ethics, or certain amendments to the Code of Ethics or its other corporate governance documents that are required to be disclosed pursuant to the rules of the SEC or
NASDAQ, will be disclosed on CIFC's website at www.cifc.com under the section entitled "Our Shareholders—Board & Corporate Governance."

Other Board Information

Leadership Structure of the Board

        The Board has separated the roles of Co-Presidents and Chairman of the Board; however, the Board has not created the role of a lead independent director. We believe
that separation of the roles of our Co-Presidents and Chairman allows our Co-Presidents to focus on the direction of our business strategy, growth and development, while
allowing our Chairman to lead the Board in its fundamental role of providing advice to, and oversight of, management. Jeffrey S. Serota has served as the Chairman of the
Board since January 1, 2016 and has been a member of the Board since 2014. The Board believes Mr. Serota is best suited to serve as Chairman of the Board because of his
extensive capital markets expertise and investment banking experience, financial skills obtained through leadership positions with asset management firms, and service on
the boards of directors of other companies.

Board Meetings

        The Board and its committees meet throughout the year on a predetermined schedule, and also hold special meetings and act by written consent from time to time. The
Board held seven meetings (including regularly scheduled and special meetings) during the year ended December 31, 2015. With the exception of Mr. Barak, each director
attended at least 75% of the total number of Board meetings and committee meetings on which they served in the year ended December 31, 2015.

        Although CIFC does not maintain a formal policy regarding director and management attendance at Shareholder meetings, we encourage our directors and key members
of management to attend CIFC's annual meetings. All of CIFC's current directors attended the 2015 annual Shareholder meeting.

Meetings of Independent Directors

        The NASDAQ Listing Rules contemplate that the independent members of the Board will meet during the year in separate closed meetings referred to as "executive
sessions" without any employee director or executive officer present. Executive sessions were held from time to time before or after regularly scheduled Board and/or Audit
Committee meetings during the year ended December 31, 2015.

Committees of the Board

        The Board has established three committees—the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee, and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee—to
carry out certain responsibilities and to assist the Board in meeting its fiduciary obligations. The Audit Committee consists entirely of independent directors. The following
table sets forth certain information for each current standing committee of the Board:

Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance

        Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our directors and executive officers and all persons who beneficially own more than 10 percent (10%) of the outstanding

greater than 10 percent (10%) beneficial owners also are required to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file.

(1) The bonus amounts in 2015 represent discretionary cash bonuses paid to our executive officers based on the Compensation Committee's assessment of their performance in 2015. The bonus
amount in 2014 in respect of Mr. Wriedt includes a discretionary bonus of $280,000 which is equivalent to the deferred amounts that he would have received in 2013 and 2014 under the 2012
CIFC Executive Incentive Compensation Plan had he been a participant of that plan in 2012. The additional bonus amounts listed for 2014 represent discretionary awards by the Compensation
Committee. 

(2) The amounts listed do not represent the actual amounts paid in cash to or value realized by the named executive officers. The valuation of share awards is based on the grant date fair value
computed in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Certification ("ASC") Topic 718. The assumptions used to calculate the value of share
awards are set forth in Note 12 to CIFC's Form 10-K. For performance-based awards, the grant date value is based upon the probable outcome of the awards. For performance-based awards
granted in 2015, had performance at the maximum level been assumed, the restricted share units granted to Messrs. Vaccaro and Wriedt would have had a value under ASC Topic 718 on the
grant date of $1,775,199 for each such individual. Messrs. Agarwal and Weldon did not receive performance-based restricted share units in 2015. For performance-based awards granted in
2014, the awards disclosed are at maximum value. On June 13, 2014, CIFC granted to each of Messrs. Vaccaro and Wriedt the following awards: 

(a) 300,000 restricted share units that vest in five equal tranches and installments of 60,000 at a rate of 20% on December 31, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively ("first
tranche," "second tranche," "third tranche," "fourth tranche," and "fifth tranche," respectively, and together "initial tranche date") and in 16 equal quarterly installments after
the initial tranche date. On December 31, 2015, CIFC and Messrs. Vaccaro and Wriedt agreed to an amended and restated time-based restricted share unit award agreement relating to
these awards. As the result of the amendment and restatement, the vesting schedule for the third, fourth and fifth tranche of each such award was amended to cliff vest on March 31,
2017, March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2019, respectively, generally subject to the executive's continued employment with CIFC or a subsidiary on the applicable vesting date. The
modification value under ASC Topic 718 of revising the vesting schedule of these awards ($100,062 for each of Messrs. Vaccaro and Wriedt) has been included in the table above. 

(b) 100,000 restricted share units 50% of which vested on January 1, 2015 and the remaining 50% of which vested on January 1, 2016; and

Outstanding Equity Awards at 2015 Year-End

(c) 75,000 restricted share units subject to performance vesting hurdles in 2014 and service vesting through January 1, 2017. In addition, on December 31, 2015, CIFC and each of
Messrs. Wriedt and Vaccaro agreed to an amended and restated performance-based restricted share unit award agreement relating to 375,000 restricted share units originally granted or
promised to be granted to the executives on June 13, 2014. As the result of the amendment and restatement, CIFC memorialized the 2015 restricted share units granted to each such
executive on March 30, 2015 (75,000 restricted share units) and awarded each such executive the 2016-2018 restricted share units promised by CIFC under the terms of the original
award agreements (75,000 restricted share units for each such year). The Compensation Committee determined that 18,750 of the 75,000 restricted share units relating to 2015
performance were earned, and, in its discretion, an additional 37,500 were deemed earned, and all such restricted stock units vested on March 31, 2016. The modification value under
ASC Topic 718 of causing restricted stock units in excess of those earned based on performance to not be forfeited and to become eligible for vesting has been included in the table
above ($40,836 for each of Messrs. Vaccaro and Wriedt). The remaining restricted share units relating to 2015 performance were forfeited. The 2016-2018 restricted share units
(covering 75,000 restricted share units for each such year) will be earned based on performance goals that will be established in the future. The restricted share units earned for any
such year will vest on March 31 of the immediately following calendar year, generally subject to the executive's continued employment from the grant date to such vesting date. The
earned 2014 restricted share units (56,250 restricted share units) will vest on December 31, 2016, generally subject to the executive's continued employment on such vesting date. 

The amounts reported in this column for 2015 includes the discretionary portion of 2015 bonuses paid to Messrs. Agarwal and Weldon ($150,000 and $275,000, respectively) in restricted share
unit awards, the value of which grants was determined in 2015 but such grants were not made until 2016. The grants vest 1/3 on December 31, 2016 and 1/12 on each of the next eight quarterly
anniversaries thereafter, beginning on March 31, 2017. The amount reported in this column for Mr. Agarwal for 2014 reflects the value of 48,544 restricted share units granted by CIFC on
December 18, 2014, 1/3 of which vested on December 31, 2015 and 1/12 of which vest on each of the next eight quarterly anniversaries thereafter, beginning on March 31, 2016. The amount
reported in this column for Mr. Weldon for 2015 also includes the value of 40,000 restricted share units granted by CIFC on March 30, 2015, 1/3 of which vested on December 31, 2015 and 1/12
of which vest on each of the next eight quarterly anniversaries thereafter, beginning on March 31, 2016. 

(3) The amounts listed do not represent the actual amounts paid in cash to or value realized by the named executive officers. The valuation of option awards is based on the grant date fair value
computed in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718. The assumptions used to calculate the value of option awards are set forth in Note 12 to CIFC's Form 10-K. On June 13, 2014, CIFC
granted to (1) each of Messrs. Vaccaro and Wriedt an option to acquire 100,000 Common Shares, with 1/3 of the underlying shares vesting on January 1, 2015 and 1/12th vesting on each of the
next eight quarterly anniversaries, with the first quarterly installment vesting on the date that is one year and 3 months from January 1, 2015 and (2) Mr. Wriedt an option to acquire 200,000
Common Shares, with 1/4 of the underlying shares vesting on January 1, 2015 and 1/16th vesting on each of the next twelve quarterly anniversaries, with the first quarterly installment vesting on
the date that is one year and 3 months from January 1, 2015. All of the share options awarded on June 13, 2014 had a strike price of $8.81 and are exercisable over a period of ten years from the
date of grant. 

(4) The amounts reported with respect to 2015 represent performance-based bonuses awarded to Messrs. Vaccaro and Wriedt based on the achievement of performance goals including CIFC's
successful launch of certain funds and certain qualitative factors. The amounts listed with respect to 2014 represent cash incentive bonus payments under the 2014 CIFC Executive Incentive
Compensation Plan, adopted pursuant to the CIFC LLC Amended and Restated 2011 Share Option and Incentive Plan, as amended (the "Existing Equity Plan"), which were based on CIFC's
achievement of a specified EBITDA target, CIFC's successful launch of certain funds and certain qualitative factors. The amounts listed with respect to 2014 were paid in 2015. In addition, the
amount listed in 2014 in respect of Mr. Vaccaro included payments under the 2012 CIFC Executive Incentive Compensation Plan, adopted pursuant to the Existing Equity Plan, which were
based in equal parts on CIFC's achievement of an EBITDA target, CIFC's achievement of a new advisory fee revenue target and awards at the Board's discretion. Such additional amount in
respect of the 2012 CIFC Executive Incentive Compensation Plan was $279,234 payable to Mr. Vaccaro, paid in two equal installments in each of 2013 and 2014. 

(5) Other compensation for 2015 is comprised of matching and other Company contributions to the executives in the 401(k) plan ($35,000 for each of Mr. Vaccaro, Mr. Wriedt, and Mr. Agarwal)
and Company-paid life insurance premiums ($129 for Mr. Vaccaro, $30 for Mr. Wriedt, $240 for Mr. Agarwal, and $225 for Mr. Weldon). Mr. Weldon did not participate in CIFC's 401(k) plan
in 2015.

2015 DIRECTOR COMPENSATION 

Summary of 2015 Director Compensation

Narrative to Director's Compensation Table

        The table above describes the compensation earned by our directors in 2015. Our processes and procedures for considering and determining the amount of compensation
we pay our non-employee directors consist of an annual review of director compensation by the Compensation Committee. Pursuant to its charter, the Compensation
Committee recommends to the Board the compensation for the current year, and the Board makes a determination. The charter permits the Compensation Committee to
delegate the consideration of director compensation to one or more subcommittees of the Compensation Committee, but the Compensation Committee has not done so to
date.

(1) Mr. Amato's first term as a director of CIFC commenced on the date of the 2015 Annual Meeting (June 26, 2015). 

(2) Each of Messrs. Bakaleynik and Lipari chose not to be re-nominated for election at the 2015 Annual Meeting and therefore their respective
terms as directors expired at the 2015 Annual Meeting (June 26,2015). 

(3) In the first quarter of 2016, Mr. Machinist forfeited 5,988 of his 2015 restricted share units (representing half of the restricted share units
granted to him as Chairman of the Board) due to his resignation as Chairman of the Board effective December 31, 2015. 

(4) Mr. Gleysteen holds a non-executive employee position with CIFC. As the result, he does not receive any compensation for his service on
the Board, but did receive a base salary for 2015 of $600,000, a bonus for 2015 in the amount of $350,000 and miscellaneous compensation
in 2015 in the amount of $198 (Company paid life insurance premiums). 

(5) In connection with Mr. Serota's appointment as the Chairman of the Board, he was granted half of the restricted share units the Chairman of
the Board typically receives each year ($50,000) on February 9, 2016 based on the closing share price on December 31, 2015. Such amount
is not reflected in the table. Instead, only Mr. Serota's initial 2015 director grant (also having a grant date value of $50,000) is reflected. 

(6) The "Equity-Based Awards" section below sets forth the outstanding equity awards for each director as of December 31, 2015.

2015 Director Compensation

        In 2015, CIFC did not compensate its employee directors.

        In December 2015, each of the non-employee directors was granted a restricted share unit award with an initial value of approximately $50,000 and the Board
chairperson was granted an additional restricted share unit award with an initial value of approximately $100,000 (for a total grant value of $150,000) under CIFC's Plan,
each of which awards became fully vested and settled on July 1, 2016. As noted above, in connection with Mr. Machinist's cessation as Chairman of the Board, he forfeited
50% of his 2015 restricted share unit award relating to his service as Chairman. In addition, non-employee directors receive the following cash compensation: (i) $80,000
annual retainer fee, paid quarterly in arrears, (ii) $2,500 fee for each full Board meeting attended in person, (iii) $5,000 fee for service on one of the standing committees of
the Board, (iv) $95,000 fee for the Board chairperson, and (v) $30,000 fee for the Audit Committee chairperson.

Equity-Based Awards

        Each of the restricted share units outstanding represents the right to receive one share of our Common Shares, subject to acceleration upon the occurrence of certain
specified events.

AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT 

        The following Audit Committee report is submitted by the directors who served on the Audit Committee for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 and who reviewed
and approved the audited financial statements that were included in CIFC's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 that was filed with the
SEC on March 25, 2016.

        The Audit Committee assists the Board in monitoring CIFC's financial reporting process. Management has primary responsibility for the financial statements and the
reporting process, including the system of internal controls. Deloitte, CIFC's independent registered public accounting firm, is responsible for expressing an opinion on the
conformity of CIFC's financial statements with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S.

        In this context, the Audit Committee hereby reports as follows:

1. The Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed the audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 with management. 

2. The Audit Committee has discussed with CIFC's independent registered public accounting firm the matters required to be discussed by Statement on Auditing
Standards No. 61, Communication with Audit Committees, as amended, and the independent registered public accounting firm's independence from CIFC
and its management. 

3. The Audit Committee has reviewed written disclosures and the letter from CIFC's independent registered public accounting firm required by applicable
requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding the independent accountant's communications with the Audit Committee
concerning independence, and has discussed with the independent accountant the independent accountant's independence. 

4. Based on the review and discussion referred to in paragraphs (1) through (3) above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board, and the Board has
approved, that the audited financial statements be included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, filed with the
SEC on March 25, 2016.

        The information contained in this Report shall not be deemed to be "soliciting material" or to be "filed" with the SEC or subject to Regulation 14A or 14C, other than
as set forth in Item 407 of Regulation S-K, or subject to the liabilities of Section 18 of the Exchange Act, except to the extent that we specifically request that the information
contained in this Report be treated as soliciting material, nor shall such information be incorporated by reference into any past or future filing under the Securities Act or the
Exchange Act, except to the extent that we specifically incorporate it by reference in such filing.

FEES OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS 

        For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, all of the services performed by Deloitte were approved by the Audit Committee. The following table sets forth the
services provided by, and aggregate fees paid to, Deloitte for each of the last two years:

        Our Audit Committee continues to evaluate the terms of the engagement of Deloitte as CIFC's independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending
December 31, 2016.

        CIFC has been advised that a representative of Deloitte will be present at the Annual Meeting and will be available to respond to appropriate questions and, if such
person chooses to do so, make a statement.

Pre-Approval of the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm's Services

        The Audit Committee has adopted policies and procedures for pre-approving all audit and non-audit services provided by our independent registered public accounting
firm and its affiliates. These policies require the specific pre-approval of any such services that have not received the Audit Committee's general pre-approval or have
exceeded the Audit Committee's pre-approved fee levels. These procedures include monitoring the independent registered public accounting firm's services to determine
whether they comply with the pre-approval policies and the independent registered public accounting firm's submission of a statement to the Audit Committee that any
services it performs that require separate pre-approval comply with the rules of the SEC on auditor independence.

        The Audit Committee pre-approved 100% of the audit-related, tax and other fees described in the table above for 2014 and 2015.

audit and tax services for the Consolidated Entities aggregated $700,573 and $753,951, respectively.

ADVISORY VOTE ON THE COMPENSATION
OF OUR NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS

(PROPOSAL 5) 

        In accordance with Section 14A of the Exchange Act, shareholders are being given the opportunity to vote on an advisory resolution at the Annual Meeting to approve
the compensation of our "named executive officers," as described in this proxy statement under "Executive Compensation." Shareholders are urged to read this section of this
proxy statement, which discusses our compensation of our named executive officers. This vote is not intended to address any specific item of compensation or the
compensation of any particular officer, but rather the overall compensation of our named executive officers and our compensation practices.

        The purpose of our compensation practices is to attract and retain experienced, highly qualified executives critical to CIFC's long-term success and enhancement of
shareholder value. The Board believes CIFC's compensation practices achieve this objective, and therefore recommends shareholders vote "FOR" the proposal. Specifically,
shareholders are being asked to approve the following:

        "RESOLVED, that the compensation paid to the Company's named executive officers, as disclosed in this proxy statement under the section entitled "Executive
Compensation," including the compensation tables and narrative discussions therein required pursuant to Item 402 of SEC Regulation S-K, is hereby APPROVED."

        This advisory vote, commonly referred to as a "say on pay" advisory vote, is non-binding on the Board. Although non-binding, the Board and the Compensation
Committee value constructive dialogue on executive compensation and other important governance topics with our shareholders and encourage all shareholders to vote their
shares on this matter. The Board and the Compensation Committee will review the voting results and take them into consideration when making future decisions regarding
our executive compensation programs.

APPROVAL OF THE CIFC LLC AMENDED AND
RESTATED SHARE OPTION AND INCENTIVE PLAN

(PROPOSAL 6) 

        The Board has adopted, and recommended that the shareholders approve, the CIFC LLC Amended and Restated Share Option and Incentive Plan (the "Amended and
Restated Plan") at the Annual Meeting. Subject to shareholder approval, the Amended and Restated Plan will amend and restate in its entirety the Existing Equity Plan.

        The general purpose of the Amended and Restated Plan is to provide an effective method of compensating employees, consultants and non-employee directors of CIFC
and its subsidiaries and to align these interests with those of CIFC's shareholders. The Amended and Restated Plan will accomplish these goals by allowing eligible
employees, consultants and non-employee directors of CIFC

and its subsidiaries to receive awards of share options, share appreciation rights ("SARs"), restricted shares, restricted stock units ("RSUs"), unrestricted shares, performance
shares, dividend equivalent rights and cash-based awards (collectively, "Awards").

        The Amended and Restated Plan will be administered by the Board or the Compensation Committee (as applicable, the "Administrator"). None of the members of the
Administrator receive additional compensation for administering the Amended and Restated Plan.

Basis for Board's Adoption of the Amended and Restated Plan

        Prior to adopting the Amended and Restated Plan, the Compensation Committee and the Board considered the various aspects of the Amended and Restated Plan,
including the number of shares authorized under the Amended and Restated Plan, the cost of issuing additional shares, the impact of share dilution on our existing
shareholders and the central role of equity-based incentive compensation in CIFC's executive compensation program. The Board's purpose in adopting the Amended and
Restated Plan was to ensure the longevity, effectiveness and administrative flexibility of the long-term equity incentive component of CIFC's executive compensation
program.

        The Amended and Restated Plan is intended to give CIFC the flexibility to grant new Awards to eligible employees, directors and consultants. The Amended and
Restated Plan would allow CIFC to grant 2,000,000 more shares than is currently authorized under the Existing Equity Plan, which, as of October 12, 2016, represents
approximately 6.4% of CIFC's Common Shares on a fully diluted basis. If the Amended and Restated Plan is approved by shareholders, CIFC will have the flexibility to
grant equity-based incentive Awards at levels the Board and the Compensation Committee believe to be critical to motivating and rewarding CIFC's service providers for
their contributions to the success of CIFC and the growth in shareholder value.

        As of the date of this proxy statement, CIFC has issued 1,155,374 RSUs under the Existing Equity Plan that will be settled in cash, unless the Amended and Restated
Plan is approved by shareholders, in which case such RSUs will count against the share reserve in the Amended and Restated Plan and will be settled in shares (such RSUs,
the "2016 Restricted Share Unit Awards").

        Based on the foregoing considerations, the Board concluded that it is in the best interests of CIFC and its shareholders for its shareholders to approve the Amended and
Restated Plan. The Board determined that the costs to CIFC's shareholders of approving the Amended and Restated Plan would be outweighed by the benefits to be achieved
by appropriately compensated and motivated service providers. If the Amended and Restated Plan is approved, the Board and the Compensation Committee will continue to
monitor and evaluate the benefits and risks to CIFC and its shareholders in granting the shares available for issuance under the Amended and Restated Plan.

        If the Merger is approved by CIFC's shareholders and is consummated, the Amended and Restated Plan will be terminated. However, CIFC believes that it is important
for the Amended and Restated Plan to be approved by its shareholders at this Annual Meeting in order to provide CIFC with an equity compensation plan reflecting the terms
of the Amended and Restated Plan for the future in the event that the Merger is not consummated.

Best Practices

        The Amended and Restated Plan includes a number of provisions that CIFC believes will reinforce the alignment between the interests of the participants in the
Amended and Restated Plan and those of CIFC's shareholders. These provisions include, but are not limited to, the following:

• No Discounted Options or SARs.  Share options and SARs may not be granted with exercise prices lower than the fair market value of the underlying shares
on the grant date.

Table of Contents

• No Repricing, Replacement or Buy Back without Shareholder Approval.  Generally, CIFC may not reprice, replace or buy back any underwater share option or
SAR without shareholder approval. 

• Recoupment and Claw back.  Awards granted under the Amended and Restated Plan are subject to recoupment and clawback pursuant to any incentive
compensation policy established by CIFC to comply with applicable law and any other clawback policy adopted by CIFC from time to time. 

• No Transferability.  No Award (other than unrestricted shares) may be sold, assigned, transferred or otherwise encumbered or disposed of by a participant
except by will or the laws of descent and distribution or pursuant to a domestic relations order, or as approved by the Compensation Committee (or the Board,
as applicable) to certain family members. 

• No Evergreen Provision.  There is no "evergreen" feature pursuant to which the shares authorized for issuance under the Amended and Restated Plan can be
automatically replenished. 

• No Automatic Grants.  The Amended and Restated Plan does not provide for "reload" or other automatic grants to participants. 

• No Tax Gross-Ups.  The Amended and Restated Plan does not provide for any tax gross-ups to participants.

Outstanding Awards / Three Year Burn Rate

        CIFC's "burn rate" is a measure of the speed at which CIFC uses (or "burns") shares available for grant under CIFC's equity compensation plans and shows the potential
dilutive effect of equity grants on CIFC's outstanding equity over the course of a year.

        The following table sets forth information regarding outstanding equity awards as of December 31, 2015 and August 31, 2016 and excludes awards that may be settled
only in cash.

        The following table sets forth information regarding awards granted and/or vested under the Existing Equity Plan during the last three calendar years, the burn rate for
each of the last three calendar years and the average burn rate over the period of the last three calendar years, in each case, for share-settled awards. Awards that are settled in
cash are not included in this analysis.

        The following table sets forth information for 2016, through August 31, regarding awards granted and/or vested under the Existing Equity Plan and the burn rate, in each
case, for share-settled awards. Awards that are settled in cash are not included in this analysis.

        A summary of the Amended and Restated Plan is provided below. This summary is qualified in its entirety by the full text of the Amended and Restated Plan, a copy of
which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex D.

General

        The purpose of the Amended and Restated Plan is to encourage and enable officers, employees, non-employee directors and consultants of CIFC and its subsidiaries to
acquire a proprietary interest in CIFC and to assure a closer identification of their interests with those of CIFC and its shareholders, thereby stimulating their efforts on
CIFC's behalf and strengthening their desire to remain with CIFC. Under the Amended and Restated Plan, CIFC may grant Awards in respect of its Common Shares
representing a limited liability company interest in CIFC to employees, consultants and non-employee directors of CIFC and its subsidiaries, pursuant to options, SARs,
restricted Shares, RSUs, unrestricted Shares, performance Shares, dividend equivalent rights and cash-based awards. The terms and conditions of grants under the Amended
and Restated Plan are governed by the provisions of the Amended and Restated Plan and the Award agreements thereunder. The Amended and Restated Plan is not qualified
under Section 401(a) of Code.

Eligibility

        Any officer, employee, non-employee director or consultant (whether full-time or part-time) of CIFC and its subsidiaries is eligible to receive Awards under the
Amended and Restated Plan, as selected by the Administrator in its sole discretion. As of October 12, 2016, there were approximately 82 eligible individuals.

Administration

        The Amended and Restated Plan will be administered by the Administrator. The Administrator consists of either the Board or the compensation committee of the Board
or a similar committee performing the functions of the compensation committee and which is comprised of not less than two "non-employee directors." To the extent that an
Award is intended to constitute "qualified performance-based compensation" within the meaning of the regulations promulgated under Section 162(m) of the Code, the
Administrator also must consist of two or more members, each of

(1) Shares granted include performance-based awards in the year in which they are vested and not in the year in which they are granted. 

(2) The burn rate is calculated as (a) all time-based restricted share units, all option and SAR awards and all other time-based awards granted in a year,
plus (b) all share-settled performance based awards that vested in such year, the sum of which is then divided by the weighted average number of
Company shares outstanding. All award types are counted on a one-for-one basis and cash-settled awards are excluded.

whom is an outside director. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the amount, timing and terms of Awards granted to persons who are subject to the reporting and other provisions
of Section 16 of the Exchange Act will be determined by the Board or a committee of the Board of at least two members that is comprised solely of non-employee directors
who meet the conditions set forth in Rule 16b-3(b)(3) of the Exchange Act.

        The Administrator's power and authority includes, but is not limited to, the power and authority to: (i) select the individuals to whom Awards may be granted;
(ii) determine the time(s) of grant and the type(s) and amount of Awards granted to any one or more participants; (iii) determine and modify the terms and conditions of any
Award, including restrictions, in a manner not inconsistent with the terms of the Amended and Restated Plan; (iv) determine the exercise price or purchase price (if any) of an
Award; (v) determine whether, to what extent, and under what circumstances an Award may be cancelled, forfeited or surrendered; (vi) accelerate at any time the
exercisability or vesting of all or any portion of any Award; (vii) subject to the provisions of the Amended and Restated Plan and Section 409A of the Code, extend at any
time the exercisability or vesting of all or any portion of any award; (viii) determine whether, and to certify that, performance goals to which an Award is subject are
satisfied; (ix) adopt, alter and repeal such rules, guidelines and practices for administration of the Amended and Restated Plan and Awards and for its own acts and
proceedings as it deems advisable; (x) interpret the terms and provisions of the Amended and Restated Plan and any Award; (xi) make all determinations it deems advisable
for the administration of the Amended and Restated Plan and Awards; (xii) decide all disputes arising in connection with the Amended and Restated Plan and Awards; and
(xiii) otherwise supervise the administration of the Amended and Restated Plan and Awards.

        The Administrator may delegate to any executive officer(s) of CIFC all or part of its authority and duties with respect to the granting of options to individuals who are
(i) not subject to the reporting and other provisions of Section 16 of the Exchange Act; (ii) not "covered employees" within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code
("Covered Employees"), (iii) not officers who are delegated authority by the Administrator and (iv) not members of the Board.

        Awards under the Amended and Restated Plan will be evidenced by Award agreements that set forth the terms, conditions and limitations for each Award which may
include, without limitation, the term of an Award and the provisions applicable in the event employment or service terminates.

        Neither the Board nor the Administrator are liable for any act, omission, interpretation, construction or determination made in good faith in connection with the
Amended and Restated Plan or any Award, and the Board and the Administrator are entitled in all cases to indemnification for any such act, omission, interpretation,
construction or determination.

Common Shares Available Under the Amended and Restated Plan

        The total number of Common Shares available for Awards under the Amended and Restated Plan is 8,181,929 (which includes Common Shares issued in respect of
awards granted under the Existing Equity Plan). This represents a 2,000,000 Common Share increase from the share reserve under the Existing Equity Plan. The total number
of Common Shares available for options or SARs with respect to any one individual during any one calendar year is 8,181,929. Common Shares underlying any Awards or
any awards granted under the Existing Equity Plan that are forfeited, canceled or held back to cover the exercise price or tax withholding, or reacquired by CIFC prior to
vesting, or satisfied without the issuance of Common Shares or otherwise terminated (other than by exercise) will be added to the Common Shares available for issuance
under the Amended and Restated Plan. Common Shares issued by CIFC in connection with the substitution of outstanding grants from an acquired company will not reduce
the number of Common Shares available under the Amended and Restated Plan.

Table of Contents

Awards—Types of Awards

        Options.    Options give a participant the right to purchase a specified number of Common Shares from CIFC for a specified time period at a fixed exercise price. The
price at which Common Shares may be purchased upon exercise will be determined by the Administrator at the time of grant, but will not be less than 100% of the fair
market value of one Common Share on the date of grant. The Administrator may grant options that have a term of up to ten years. The Award agreement will specify the
exercise price, term, vesting requirements and any other terms and conditions applicable to the option.

        Generally, unless otherwise provided in an Award agreement, upon the termination of a participant's employment (or other service relationship) with CIFC and its
subsidiaries, the unvested portion of such participant's option will automatically terminate and be forfeited, and the vested portion of such participant's option will remain
exercisable for a period set forth in the Award agreement.

        Share Appreciation Rights.    A grant of a SAR entitles a participant to receive, upon exercise of the SAR, Common Shares or cash having a value equal to the excess of
(i) the fair market value of one Common Share on the date of exercise, over (ii) the grant price of the SAR. No payment from the participant is required upon the exercise of
a SAR. The Administrator will determine and specify in an Award agreement the number of SARs granted, the grant price of the SAR (which will not be less than 100% of
the fair market value of a Common Share on the date of grant), the term of the SAR (which will not be greater than 10 years) and any other terms and conditions applicable
to the SAR.

        Generally, unless otherwise provided in an Award agreement, upon the termination of a participant's employment (or other service relationship) with CIFC and its
subsidiaries, any SARs that have not vested will automatically terminate and be forfeited, and any SARs that have vested as of such termination will remain exercisable for a
period set forth in the Award agreement.

        Restricted Shares.    An Award of restricted Common Shares is a grant of a specified number of Common Shares that are subject to certain restrictions and conditions,
which may be based on continuing service and/or achievement of pre-established performance goals. Generally, restricted Common Shares may not be sold, assigned,
transferred, pledged or otherwise encumbered or disposed of prior to vesting. The Administrator will determine the duration of the restriction period, the conditions under
which the Common Shares may be forfeited, and the amount, if any, the participant must pay to receive the Common Shares, and such other terms and conditions applicable
to the restricted Common Shares. During the restriction period, the participant will have the rights of a shareholder with respect to dividends and the voting of the restricted
Common Shares, subject to the conditions contained in the Award agreement. Provided that the restrictions, including any performance goals, applicable to the restricted
Common Share Award have lapsed, Common Shares will no longer be restricted Common Shares. Notwithstanding the foregoing, dividends and distributions paid on
restricted Common Share Awards that vest based on the achievement of performance goals will become vested and paid only if the relevant performance goals are achieved
(other than any portion of such dividend or distribution that is a tax distribution).

        Generally, unless otherwise provided in an Award agreement, if a participant's employment (or other service relationship) with CIFC and its subsidiaries terminates for
any reason, such participant's rights in any restricted Common Shares that have not vested will automatically terminate and such unvested restricted Common Shares will
automatically be deemed to have been reacquired by CIFC at its original purchase price (if any) from such participant.

        Restricted Share Units.    A RSU Award is a grant of phantom Common Share units entitling the participant to a payment in Common Shares or cash (as determined by
the Administrator) at the expiration of the applicable restriction period. The Administrator will determine the restrictions and

conditions applicable to each RSU, which may be based on continuing service and/or achievement of pre-established performance goals. The participant will have the rights
as a shareholder only after Common Shares are acquired upon settlement of the RSUs; however, the Administrator may provide a dividend equivalent right entitling the
participant to receive credits for cash dividends that would have been paid on Common Shares subject to the RSU Award had the Common Shares been held by the
participant. Dividend equivalents relating to an RSU Award that vests based on the achievement of performance goals will be paid only if the relevant performance goals are
achieved.

        The Administrator may permit a participant to elect to receive a portion of future cash compensation otherwise due to the participant in the form of RSUs. Any RSUs
received pursuant to such election will be fully vested, unless otherwise provided in the Award agreement.

        Generally, unless otherwise provided in an Award agreement, a participant's rights in all RSUs that have not vested will automatically terminate upon the participant's
termination of employment (or cessation of service relationship) with CIFC and its subsidiaries for any reason.

        Unrestricted Shares.    Unrestricted Shares may be granted (or sold at such purchase price determined by the Administrator) in respect of past services or other valid
consideration, or in lieu of cash compensation due to the participant, in all events, subject to such terms and conditions as the Administrator may establish.

        Performance Shares.    A performance Common Share Award entitles a participant to acquire Common Shares upon the attainment of specified performance goals.
Performance Common Share Awards are solely a device for determining amounts to be paid to a participant and do not constitute Common Shares. The Administrator will
determine the applicable performance goals, the performance measurement period, and any other limitations and conditions applicable to performance Common Share
Awards. A participant receiving performance Common Share Awards will have the rights of a shareholder only after the Common Shares are actually received; however, the
Administrator may provide a dividend equivalent right entitling the participant to receive credits for cash dividends that would have been paid on the Common Shares subject
to the performance Common Share Award had the Common Shares been held by the participant (provided that such dividend equivalents will be paid only if the relevant
performance Common Share Award becomes earned and vested).

        Generally, unless otherwise provided in an Award agreement, a participant's rights in the performance Common Share Award will automatically terminate upon the
participant's termination of employment (or cessation of service relationship) with CIFC and its subsidiaries for any reason.

        Dividend Equivalent Rights.    A dividend equivalent right entitles the participant to receive credits based on cash dividends that would have been paid on the Common
Shares specified in the dividend equivalent right (or other Award to which it relates) if such Common Shares had been held by the participant. Dividend equivalent rights
may be granted as a component of an RSU or performance Common Share Award or as a freestanding Award. Amounts credited to the holder of a dividend equivalent right
may be paid currently or on a deferred basis, and may be reinvested pursuant to any dividend reinvestment plan sponsored by CIFC. Dividend equivalent rights may be
settled in cash or Common Shares or a combination thereof, in a lump sum or in installments. A dividend equivalent right granted as a component of an RSU or performance
Common Share Award may provide that such dividend equivalent right will be settled upon settlement or payment of, or lapse of restrictions on, such other Award and that
such dividend equivalent right will be forfeited under the same conditions as such other Award, or such dividend equivalent right may contain terms and conditions different
from such other Award.

        Generally, unless otherwise provided in an Award agreement, a participant's rights in dividend equivalent rights granted as a component of an award of RSUs or
performance Common Share Award

that have not vested will automatically terminate upon the participant's termination of employment (or cessation of service relationship) with CIFC and its Subsidiaries for
any reason.

        Cash-Based Awards.    The Administrator may grant cash-based Awards to any participant in such amount and upon such terms and conditions as the Administrator will
determine at the time of grant. Each cash-based Award will specify the cash-denominated payment amount, formula or payment ranges, the maximum duration of the Award
and the conditions upon which the Award will become vested or payable. A cash-based Award may be paid in cash or in Common Shares, as the Administrator determines.

Performance-Based Awards

        The Administrator may grant to a Covered Employee any performance-based Award in the form of restricted Common Shares, RSUs, performance Common Shares or
cash-based Awards (the "Performance-Based Award"). Performance-Based Awards are intended to be treated as "qualified performance-based compensation" under
Section 162(m) of the Code. Any Performance-Based Award will be earned based upon the attainment of the performance goals established by the Administrator that are
substantially uncertain to be met during the applicable performance period at the time such goals are established. The Administrator will select the performance criteria that
will be used to establish the applicable performance goals. Such performance criteria may be applicable to the individual and/or to the organizational level specified by the
Administrator, including CIFC, a subsidiary of CIFC or a unit, division or group of any of the foregoing. The performance goals established by the Administrator, for a
Performance-Based Award will be based on one or more of the following: (a) earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and/or amortization, (b) net income (loss) (either
before or after interest, taxes, depreciation and/or amortization), (c) changes in the market price of the Common Shares, (d) economic value-added, (e) funds from operations
or similar measure, (f) sales or revenue, (g) acquisitions or strategic transactions, (h) operating income (loss), (i) cash flow (including, but not limited to, operating cash flow
and free cash flow), (j) return on capital, assets, equity, investment or assets under management, (k) shareholder returns, (l) return on sales, (m) gross or net profit levels,
(n) productivity, (o) expense, (p) margins, (q) operating efficiency, (r) client satisfaction, (s) working capital, (t) earnings (loss) per Common Share, (u) sales, (v) market
share, (w) number of clients, (x) REIT taxable income, (y) cash dividends per share, (z) book value, (aa) ratio of pre-tax net income to gross income, (ab) assets under
investment management, (ac) investment management fees, and (ad) new originations of assets. Any of the foregoing performance criteria may be measured in absolute
terms or as compared to any incremental increase or as compared to results of a peer group. Awards not intended to constitute "qualified performance-based compensation"
under Section 162(m) of the Code may be subject to any performance goal(s) determined by the Administrator, including, without limitation, any of the goals set forth above.

        The Administrator, in its discretion, may adjust or modify the calculation of performance goals for the applicable performance period in order to prevent the dilution or
enlargement of the rights of any participant in the event of, or in anticipation of, (i) any unusual or extraordinary corporate item, transaction, event or development, (ii) any
other unusual or nonrecurring events affecting CIFC or the financial statements of CIFC, or (iii) any changes in applicable laws, regulations, accounting principles or
business conditions.

        The maximum amount of Performance-Based Award granted to any Covered Employee in any calendar year is 843,976 Common Shares or $5,000,000 in the case of a
Performance-Based Award that is a cash-based Award. Each Performance-Based Award will specify the amount payable, or the formula for determining the amount payable,
upon achievement of the various applicable performance targets. Following the completion of a performance period, the Administrator will review and certify in writing
whether, and to what extent, the performance goals for the performance period have been achieved

126

and, if so, will also calculate and certify in writing the amount of the Performance-Based Award earned for the performance period.

        Generally, except as may otherwise be provided in the Award Agreement, a participant's rights in the Performance-Based Award will terminate automatically upon the
termination of the participant's employment (or service relationship) with CIFC and its subsidiaries for any reason.

        Covered Employees may be granted Awards under the Amended and Restated Plan that are not Performance-Based Awards (even though such Awards are subject to
performance goals). Awards not intended to constitute "qualified performance-based compensation" under Section 162(m) of the Code are not treated as "Performance-Based
Awards" and therefore may be subject to any performance goal(s) determined by the Administrator (including, without limitation, any of the goals set forth above) and are
not subject to the annual share or dollar limitations applicable to Performance-Based Awards described in this subsection.

Change in Control and other Corporate Transactions

        In the event of a change in control, unless otherwise specifically prohibited under applicable laws or by the rules and regulations of any governing governmental
agencies or national securities exchanges, or unless the Administrator determines otherwise in the Award agreement, and in all events, to the extent permitted by
Section 409A of the Code (if applicable), the Administrator is authorized (but not obligated) to make adjustments in the terms and conditions of outstanding Awards, such as
continuing Awards or causing them to be assumed by or substituted with new awards from the surviving company or corporation or acquirer, or a parent of any of the
foregoing; accelerating the exercisability, vesting and/or lapse of restrictions under outstanding Awards; requiring Awards to be exercised, to the extent then exercisable, and
cancelling and/or cashing out Awards.

        In the event of any corporate event or transaction involving CIFC or a subsidiary such as a merger, consolidation, reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, share
dividend, share split, reverse share split, exchange of shares, spinoff, extraordinary cash dividend designated as such by the Board (but in all cases, excluding any ordinary
cash dividend or distribution or tax distribution) or other similar change in capital structure or similar corporate event or transaction, the Administrator shall, to prevent
dilution or enlargement of a participant's rights under the Amended and Restated Plan, in its sole discretion, make an appropriate or proportionate adjustment in (i) the
maximum number and kind of Common Shares or other securities reserved for issuance under the Amended and Restated Plan, (ii) the maximum number of Common Shares
subject to options or SARs that can be granted to any one participant and the maximum number of Common Shares that may be granted under a Performance-Based Award,
(iii) the number and kind of Common Shares or other securities subject to any then-outstanding Awards under the Amended and Restated Plan, (iv) the purchase price, if any,
per Common Share relating to any Award and the repurchase price, if any, per Common Share relating to each outstanding restricted Common Share Award and (v) the
exercise price for each Common Share subject to any then-outstanding option or SAR, however, no adjustment may be made that would adversely affect the status of any
Award that is intended to qualify as "qualified performance-based compensation" under Section 162(m) of the Code.

Clawback and Recoupment

        If CIFC is required to prepare an accounting restatement due to the material noncompliance of CIFC, as a result of misconduct, with any financial reporting requirement
under the securities laws, then any participant who is subject to automatic forfeiture under Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 is required to reimburse CIFC for
the amount of any Award received by such participant under the Amended and Restated Plan during the 12-month period following the first public issuance or filing with the
SEC, as the case may be, of the financial document embodying such financial reporting

requirement. All Awards, if and to the extent subject to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, will be subject to any incentive compensation
policy established from time to time by CIFC to comply with such Act, and all Awards will be subject to any other clawback policy that CIFC may adopt from time to time,
even after an Award is granted.

Amendment and Termination

        The Board may, at any time, amend or discontinue the Amended and Restated Plan and the Administrator may, at any time, amend or cancel any outstanding Award for
the purpose of satisfying changes in law or for any other lawful purpose, but no such action will adversely affect rights under any outstanding Award without the participant's
consent, unless such action is necessary or appropriate to comply with Section 409A of the Code or an exemption therefrom or to ensure a deduction under Section 162(m) of
the Code. Except as specifically permitted under the Amended and Restated Plan, without prior shareholder approval, the Administrator may not exercise its discretion to
reduce the exercise price of outstanding options or SARs or effect repricing through cancellation and re-grants or cancellation of underwater options or underwater SARs in
exchange for cash or other Awards. Solely to the extent required under the rules of any securities exchange or market system on which the Common Shares are listed or to
ensure that compensation earned under Awards qualifies as "qualified performance-based compensation" under Section 162(m) of the Code, Amended and Restated Plan
amendments will be subject to approval by CIFC shareholders entitled to vote at a meeting of shareholders.

        Unless earlier terminated, the Amended and Restated Plan will terminate with respect to the grant of new Awards on September 23, 2026. However, if CIFC's
shareholders approve the Merger and the Merger is consummated, the Amended and Restated Plan will terminate upon the consummation of the Merger.

Limitation on Benefits

        If the benefits that a participant may be entitled to receive under the Amended and Restated Plan and other benefits that a participant is entitled to receive under other
plans, agreements and arrangements constitute "parachute payments" that are subject to Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code (as described below under the heading
"Summary of U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences—Excess Parachute Payments"), such parachute payments will be reduced only to the extent that a reduction will allow
the participant to receive a greater net after-tax amount than the participant would receive absent a reduction (unless the participant is party to an agreement that provides for
different treatment).

New Plan Benefits

        CIFC has granted certain RSUs that, if the Amended and Restated Plan is approved by shareholders, will be settled from the Common Shares authorized for issuance
under the Amended and Restated Plan. If such approval is not obtained, those RSUs will be settled in cash. Certain information about such RSUs is set forth in the table
below. Aside from those RSUs, because grants of Awards will be made from time to time by the Administrator to those persons whom the Administrator determines in its
discretion should receive grants of Awards, the benefits and amounts that may be received in the future by persons eligible to participate in the Amended and Restated Plan
are not presently determinable.

Summary of U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences

        The following discussion is a summary of certain federal income tax considerations that may be relevant to participants in the Amended and Restated Plan. The
discussion is for general informational purposes only and does not purport to address specific federal income tax considerations that might apply to a participant based on his
or her particular circumstances, nor does it address state, local or foreign income tax or other tax considerations that may be relevant to a participant.

        PARTICIPANTS ARE URGED TO CONSULT THEIR OWN TAX ADVISORS WITH RESPECT TO THE PARTICULAR FEDERAL INCOME TAX
CONSEQUENCES TO THEM OF PARTICIPATING IN THE AMENDED AND RESTATED PLAN, AS WELL AS WITH RESPECT TO ANY APPLICABLE
STATE, LOCAL OR FOREIGN INCOME TAX OR OTHER TAX CONSIDERATIONS.

        Share Options.    An option holder will not recognize taxable income, and a subsidiary of CIFC is not entitled to a deduction, when a share option is granted. Upon the
exercise of a share option, an option holder will recognize compensation taxable as ordinary income equal to the excess of the fair market value of the Common Shares
received over the exercise price of the share option and, subject to Section 162(m) of the Code, CIFC or a subsidiary of CIFC may be entitled to a corresponding deduction.
An option holder's tax basis in the Common Shares received upon the exercise of a share option will be equal to the fair market value of such Common Shares on the
exercise date, and the option holder's holding period for such Common Shares will begin at that time. Upon the subsequent

sale of the Common Shares received in exercise of a share option, the option holder generally will recognize short-term or long-term capital gain or loss, depending upon
whether the Common Shares have been held for more than one year. The amount of such gain or loss will be equal to the difference between the amount realized in
connection with the sale of the Common Shares and the option holder's tax basis in such Common Shares.

        See the Section below titled "—Tax Consequences of Owning Shares" for a brief explanation of the U.S. Federal income tax consequences of owning Common Shares.

        Restricted Shares.    Restricted Common Shares may be considered subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture for federal income tax purposes. If a participant who
receives such restricted Common Shares does not make the election described below, the participant does not recognize any taxable income upon the receipt of restricted
Common Shares and neither CIFC nor any subsidiary of CIFC is entitled to a deduction at such time. When the forfeiture restrictions with respect to the restricted Common
Shares lapse, the participant will recognize compensation taxable as ordinary income equal to the fair market value of the Common Shares at that time, less any amount paid
for the Common Shares and, subject to Section 162(m) of the Code, CIFC or a subsidiary of CIFC may be entitled to a corresponding deduction. A participant's tax basis in
restricted Common Shares will be equal to the fair market value of such restricted Common Shares when the forfeiture restrictions lapse, and the participant's holding period
for the Common Shares will begin on such date. Upon a subsequent sale of the Common Shares, the participant generally will recognize short-term or long-term capital gain
or loss, depending upon whether the Common Shares have been held for more than one year at the time of sale. Such gain or loss will be equal to the difference between the
amount realized upon the sale of the Common Shares and the tax basis of the Common Shares in the participant's hands.

        Participants receiving restricted Common Shares subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture may make an election under Section 83(b) of the Code to recognize
compensation taxable as ordinary income with respect to the Common Shares when such Common Shares are received rather than at the time the forfeiture restrictions lapse.
The amount of such compensation income will be equal to the fair market value of the Common Shares when the participant receives them (valued without taking into
account restrictions other than restrictions that by their terms will never lapse), less any amount paid for the Common Shares. Subject to Section 162(m) of the Code, CIFC
or a subsidiary of CIFC may be entitled to a corresponding deduction at that time. By making a Section 83(b) election, the participant will recognize no additional ordinary
compensation income with respect to the Common Shares when the forfeiture restrictions lapse, and instead generally will recognize short-term or long-term capital gain or
loss with respect to the Common Shares when they are sold, depending upon whether the Common Shares have been held for more than one year at the time of sale. The
participant's tax basis in the Common Shares with respect to which a Section 83(b) election is made will be equal to their fair market value when the election is made by the
participant, and the participant's holding period for such Common Shares will begin at that time. If the Common Shares are subsequently forfeited, the participant will not be
entitled to a deduction as a result of such forfeiture, but will be entitled to claim a short-term or long-term capital loss (depending upon whether the Common Shares have
been held for more than one year at the time of forfeiture) with respect to the Common Shares to the extent of the consideration paid by the participant for such Common
Shares.

        Generally, during the restriction period, distributions paid with respect to restricted Common Shares will be treated as compensation taxable as ordinary income (not
partnership distributions) received by the participant and, subject to Section 162(m) of the Code, CIFC or a subsidiary of CIFC may receive a corresponding deduction.
Partnership distributions received with respect to restricted Common Shares for which a Section 83(b) election has been made or which are paid after the restriction period
lapses generally will be treated and taxed as distributions from a partnership.

Table of Contents

        Common Shares that are fully vested on grant will generally have the same tax treatment as the restricted Common Shares with respect to which a Section 83(b) election
is made.

        See the Section below titled "—Tax Consequences of Owning Shares" for a brief explanation of the U.S. Federal income tax consequences of owning Common Shares.

        SARs.    A participant will recognize no taxable income, and neither CIFC nor any subsidiary of CIFC is entitled to a deduction, when an SAR is granted. Upon exercise
or settlement of an SAR, a participant will recognize compensation taxable as ordinary income in an amount equal to the cash or the fair market value of the Common Shares
received and, subject to Section 162(m) of the Code, CIFC or a subsidiary of CIFC may be entitled to a corresponding deduction. A participant's tax basis in Common Shares
received upon the exercise of an SAR will be equal to the fair market value of such Common Shares on the exercise date, and the participant's holding period for such
Common Shares will begin at that time. Upon the sale of Common Shares received in exercise of an SAR, the participant generally will recognize short-term or long-term
capital gain or loss, depending on whether the Common Shares have been held for more than one year. The amount of such gain or loss will be equal to the difference
between the amount realized in connection with the sale of the Common Shares and the participant's tax basis in such Common Shares. See the Section below titled "—Tax
Consequences of Owning Shares" for a brief explanation of the U.S. Federal income tax consequences of owning Common Shares.

        RSUs.    A participant will recognize no taxable income when RSUs are granted, and neither CIFC nor any subsidiary of CIFC is entitled to a deduction upon such grant.
When the Award is settled and the participant receives cash or Common Shares, the participant will recognize compensation taxable as ordinary income equal to the amount
of cash received or the fair market value of the Common Shares at that time (as applicable) and, subject to Section 162(m) of the Code, CIFC or a subsidiary of CIFC may be
entitled to a corresponding deduction. A participant's tax basis in Common Shares received at the end of a restriction period will be equal to the fair market value of such
Common Shares when the participant receives them, and the participant's holding period will begin on such date. Upon the sale of such Common Shares, the participant
generally will recognize short-term or long-term capital gain or loss, depending upon whether the Common Shares have been held for more than one year at the time of sale.
Such gain or loss will be equal to the difference between the amount realized upon the sale of the Common Shares and the tax basis of the Common Shares in the
participant's hands. Dividend equivalents will be taxable to participants upon distribution as compensation, and accordingly, the participant will recognize ordinary income in
such amount and, subject to Section 162(m) of the Code, CIFC or a subsidiary of CIFC may receive a corresponding deduction. In addition, as discussed below, RSUs may
be considered deferred compensation that must comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code in order to avoid early income inclusion and tax penalties. See the
Section below titled "—Tax Consequences of Owning Shares" for a brief explanation of the U.S. Federal income tax consequences of owning Common Shares.

        Performance Shares.    The federal income tax consequences for performance Common Shares are generally the same as for RSUs.

        Withholding.    Participants will be responsible for making appropriate provision for all taxes required to be withheld in connection with any Awards, vesting, exercises
and transfers of Common Shares pursuant to the Amended and Restated Plan. This includes responsibility for all applicable federal, state, local and foreign withholding
taxes. Subject to approval by the Administrator, participants may elect to have the minimum required tax withholding obligation satisfied, in whole or in part, by authorizing
CIFC to withhold from Common Shares to be issued pursuant to any Award a number of Common Shares (or that amount of cash, in the case of a cash payment) with an
aggregate fair market value (as of the date the withholding is effected) that would satisfy the minimum withholding amount due; provided, however, that, participants who
are subject to Section 16 of the

Exchange Act may direct CIFC to so withhold from Common Shares to be issued pursuant to any Award without the Administrator's approval.

        Million Dollar Deduction Limit.    Under Section 162(m) of the Code, a publicly traded corporation generally may not deduct remuneration paid to the chief executive
officer of CIFC and the three next highest paid executive officers other than the chief financial officer (as disclosed in CIFC's proxy statement) to the extent that such
remuneration exceeds $1 million, unless such remuneration is performance-based compensation. Under the Amended and Restated Plan, the Administrator may, in its
discretion, grant Awards that are intended to qualify as performance-based compensation to the extent that Section 162(m) of the Code applies to CIFC.

        Nonqualified Deferred Compensation.    Section 409A of the Code contains certain restrictions on the ability to defer receipt of compensation to future tax years. Any
Award that provides for the deferral of compensation, such as RSUs that are settled more than two and one-half months after the end of the year in which they vest, must
comply with Section 409A of the Code. If the requirements of Section 409A of the Code are not met, all amounts deferred under the Amended and Restated Plan (and all
similar plans) during the taxable year and all prior taxable years (to the extent not already included in gross income) will be included in the participant's taxable income in the
later of the year in which such violation occurs or the year in which such amounts are no longer subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture, even if such amounts have not been
actually received. In addition, such violation will result in an additional tax to the participant of 20% of the deferred amount plus applicable interest computed from the date
the award was earned, or if later, the date on which it vested.

        Excess Parachute Payments.    If the granting, vesting and/or payment of an Award made to a "disqualified individual" (as defined in Section 280G of the Code
including, but not limited to, officers, certain shareholders and certain employees) occurs in connection with a change in control of CIFC, such granting, vesting and/or
payment, either alone or when combined with other compensation payments which such disqualified individual is entitled to receive, may result in an "excess parachute
payment" (as defined in Section 280G of the Code). Section 4999 of the Code generally imposes a 20% excise tax on the amount of any such "excess parachute payment"
received by such "disqualified individual" and Section 280G of the Code would prevent CIFC or a subsidiary or affiliate of CIFC, as applicable, from deducting such "excess
parachute payment."

        Tax Consequences of Owning Shares.    CIFC LLC believes that it has been organized and intends to operate so that it will qualify to be treated for U.S. federal income
tax purposes as a partnership, and not as an association or a publicly traded partnership taxable as a corporation. As a holder of Common Shares, a Participant will be
required to take into account his or her allocable share of items of CIFC LLC's income, gain, loss, deduction and credit for the taxable year of CIFC LLC ending within or
with his or her taxable year. Distributions to a Participant treated as distributions from a partnership (and not as compensation, as described above) generally will be taxable
for U.S. federal income tax purposes only to the extent the amount distributed exceeds the Participant's tax basis in his or her Common Share. CIFC LLC's ability to qualify
to be treated as a partnership will depend on its ability to satisfy certain income and other tests on an ongoing basis.

CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 

        CIFC's policies and procedures for the review, approval and ratification of CIFC's transactions with related persons consist of various conflict of interest provisions in its
Code of Ethics, including that its directors report to the Board any conflict of interest they may have with respect to any matter being considered by the Board and that
CIFC's related persons involved in CIFC's portfolio management obtain the prior approval of CIFC's Chief Compliance Officer for their personal purchases of securities in
private offerings.

        Since January 1, 2015, CIFC has entered into certain transactions, summarized below, that exceeded $120,000 in amount and in which CIFC's related persons—in
general, CIFC's directors, executive officers and their immediate family members—had or would have a direct or indirect material interest.

• DFR Holdings is considered a related party as a result of its ownership of approximately 18.8 million Common Shares, a portion of which was issued as part
of the consideration for CIFC's June 9, 2010 acquisition of CN Credit Investments Management, LLC. On July 12, 2014, DFR Holdings converted
$25.0 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding Senior Subordinated Notes of CIFC due December 9, 2017 into 4.1 million shares of CIFC's
Common Shares. In addition, DFR Holdings holds warrants that provide the holder the right to purchase 2.0 million Common Shares, which were scheduled
to expire on September 24, 2015. On September 24, 2015, the warrants were extended to January 24, 2017 in exchange for cash of $0.4 million. On
August 15, 2014, CIFC entered into a consulting agreement with DFR Holdings whereby DFR Holdings agreed to provide CIFC with ongoing advisory
services such as the participation in financial, tax and strategic planning/budgeting, investor interface, new product initiatives, fund raising and recruiting. As
part of the consulting agreement, CIFC incurred professional fees of $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.

        During the year ended December 31, 2015, the following members of the Board made the following investments:

• Iosif Bakaleynik, through an entity in which his is the sole equity holder, purchased $250,000 of Series B interests in the CIFC CLO Warehouse Fund.
Mr. Bakaleynik served as a director on the Board until the date of the 2015 Annual Meeting.

        During the year ended December 31, 2015, the following executive officers made the following investments:

• Oliver Wriedt purchased $200,000 of Series B Interests in the CIFC CLO Warehouse Fund.

MARKET PRICE OF COMMON SHARES 

        The Common Shares are traded on NASDAQ under the symbol "CIFC." The following table sets forth during each fiscal quarter indicated the high and low sales prices
of Common Shares:

        The closing sale price of our Common Shares on NASDAQ on August 19, 2016, which was the last trading day before the Merger was publicly announced, was $6.95
per share. On October 12, 2016 the most recent practicable date before this proxy statement was mailed to our shareholders, the closing price for our Common Shares on
NASDAQ was $11.24 per share. You are encouraged to obtain current market quotations for our Common Shares in connection with voting your shares of our Common
Shares.

        For each of the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, total aggregated annual distributions declared were $0.40 per Common Share. Through October 12, 2016, the
Board has declared aggregate cash distribution of $0.69 per Common Share.

APPRAISAL RIGHTS 

General

        If you hold Common Shares, you are entitled to appraisal rights under Delaware law and have the right to have your shares appraised by the Delaware Court of
Chancery and receive the "fair value" of such shares (exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger) as of completion of
the merger in place of the merger consideration, as determined by the court, if you strictly comply with the procedures specified in Section 262 of the DGCL. Any such
shareholder awarded "fair value" for its, his or her shares by the court would receive payment of that fair value in cash, together with interest, if any, in lieu of the right to
receive the Merger Consideration.

        The following discussion is not a full summary of the law pertaining to appraisal rights under the DGCL and is qualified in its entirety by the full text of Section 262 of
the DGCL that is attached to this proxy statement/prospectus as Annex C. All references in Section 262 of the DGCL and in this summary to a "stockholder" are to the
record holder of the shares of CIFC LLC common shares. The following discussion does not constitute any legal or other advice, nor does it constitute a recommendation
that you exercise your rights to seek appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL.

        Under Section 262 of the DGCL, when a merger is submitted for approval at a meeting of stockholders as in the case of the adoption of the Merger Agreement,
CIFC LLC, not less than 20 days prior to the meeting, must notify each stockholder who was a CIFC shareholder on the record date for notice of such meeting with respect
to shares for which appraisal rights are available, that appraisal rights are available and include in the notice a copy of Section 262 of the DGCL. This proxy statement
constitutes the required notice, and the copy of Section 262 of the DGCL is attached to this proxy statement/prospectus as Annex C. A holder of Common Shares who
wishes to exercise appraisal rights or who wishes to preserve the right to do so should review the following discussion and Annex C carefully. Failure to strictly comply with
the procedures of Section 262 of the DGCL in a timely and proper manner may result in the loss of appraisal rights. A stockholder who loses his, her or its appraisal rights
will be entitled to receive the per share Merger Consideration.

How to Exercise and Perfect Your Appraisal Rights.

        Holders of Common Shares wishing to exercise the rights to seek an appraisal of their shares must do ALL of the following:

• you must not vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement. Because a proxy that is signed and submitted but does not otherwise contain voting
instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement, if you submit a proxy and wish to exercise your appraisal rights,
you must instruct the proxy to vote your shares against the adoption of the Merger Agreement or abstain from voting your shares; 

• you must deliver to us a written demand for appraisal before the vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement at the Annual Meeting; 

• you must continuously hold the shares from the date of making the demand through the Effective Time; and 

• you or the Surviving Company (or any other shareholder that has properly demanded appraisal rights and is otherwise entitled to appraisal rights) must file a
petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery requesting a determination of the fair value of the shares within 120 days after the Effective Time. The Surviving
Company is under no obligation to file any such petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery and has no intention of doing so. Accordingly, it is the obligation
of the holders of Common Shares to initiate all necessary action to perfect their appraisal rights in respect of Common Shares within the time prescribed in
Section 262 of the DGCL.

        Voting, in person or by proxy, against, abstaining from voting on or failing to vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement will not constitute a written demand for
appraisal as required by Section 262 of the DGCL. The written demand for appraisal must be in addition to and separate from any proxy or vote.

Who May Exercise Appraisal Rights.

        A demand for appraisal must be executed by or on behalf of the shareholder of record. The demand should set forth, fully and correctly, the shareholder's name as it
appears on the stock certificates (or in the stock ledger). The demand must reasonably inform us of the identity of the shareholder and that the shareholder intends to demand
appraisal of his, her or its Common Shares. Non-record owners may not directly make appraisal demands to CIFC LLC. The non-record owner must, in such cases,
have the owner of record, such as a bank, brokerage firm or other nominee, submit the required demand in respect of those Common Shares. A record owner, such
as a bank, brokerage firm or other nominee, who holds Common Shares as a nominee for others, may exercise appraisal rights with respect to the Common Shares held for
one or more non-record owners, while not exercising this right for other non-record owners. In that case, the written demand should state the

Table of Contents

number of Common Shares as to which appraisal is sought. Where no number of Common Shares is expressly mentioned, the demand will be presumed to cover all
Common Shares held in the name of the record owner.

        IF YOU HOLD YOUR SHARES IN BANK OR BROKERAGE ACCOUNTS OR OTHER NOMINEE FORMS, AND YOU WISH TO EXERCISE
APPRAISAL RIGHTS, YOU SHOULD CONSULT WITH YOUR BANK, BROKERAGE FIRM OR OTHER NOMINEE, AS APPLICABLE, TO DETERMINE
THE APPROPRIATE PROCEDURES FOR THE BANK, BROKERAGE FIRM OR OTHER NOMINEE TO MAKE A DEMAND FOR APPRAISAL OF THOSE
SHARES. IF YOU HAVE A BENEFICIAL INTEREST IN SHARES HELD OF RECORD IN THE NAME OF ANOTHER PERSON, SUCH AS A BANK,
BROKERAGE FIRM OR OTHER NOMINEE, YOU MUST ACT PROMPTLY TO CAUSE THE RECORD HOLDER TO FOLLOW PROPERLY AND IN A
TIMELY MANNER THE STEPS NECESSARY TO PERFECT YOUR APPRAISAL RIGHTS.

        If you own Common Shares jointly with one or more other persons, as in a joint tenancy or tenancy in common, demand for appraisal must be executed by or for you
and all other joint owners. An authorized agent, including an agent for two or more joint owners, may execute the demand for appraisal for a holder of record; however, the
agent must identify the record owner and expressly disclose the fact that, in making the demand, such person is acting as agent for the record owner. If you hold Common
Shares through a broker who in turn holds the shares through a central securities depository nominee such as Cede & Co., a demand for appraisal of such shares must be
made by or on behalf of the depository nominee and must identify the depository nominee as record holder.

        If you elect to exercise appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL, you should mail or deliver a written demand, executed as set forth above, to:

Actions After Completion of the Merger

        If the Merger is consummated, the Surviving Company will give written notice that the Merger has become effective within ten (10) days after the Effective Time to
each shareholder that did not vote in favor of the Merger Agreement and delivered a written demand for appraisal in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL. At any time
within sixty (60) days after the Effective Time, any shareholder that did not commence an appraisal proceeding or join in such a proceeding as a named party will have the
right to withdraw such demand and to accept the Merger Consideration in accordance with the Merger Agreement for his, her or its Common Shares. Within 120 days after
the Effective Time, but not later, any shareholder that has complied with the requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL, or the Surviving Company may commence an
appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery, with a copy served on the Surviving Company in the case of a petition filed by a shareholder,
demanding a determination of the value of the Common Shares held by all such shareholders. The Surviving Company is under no obligation to file an appraisal petition and
has no intention of doing so. If you desire to have your shares appraised and have otherwise complied with the requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL, you should initiate
any petitions necessary for the perfection of your appraisal rights within the time periods and in the manner prescribed in Section 262 of the DGCL.

        Within 120 days after the Effective Time, any shareholder that has complied with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL will be entitled to receive from the
Surviving Company, upon written request, a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the adoption of the

Merger Agreement and with respect to which CIFC has received demands for appraisal, and the aggregate number of holders of those shares. The Surviving Company must
mail this statement within the later of ten (10) days of receipt by the Surviving Company of the request therefor or ten (10) days after expiration of the period for delivery of
demands for appraisal. If you are the non-record owner of Common Shares held in a voting trust or by a nominee on your behalf you may, in your own name, file an
appraisal petition or request from the Surviving Company the statement described in this paragraph.

        If a petition for appraisal is duly filed, and a copy of the petition is delivered to the Surviving Company, the Surviving Company will then be obligated, within twenty
(20) days after receiving service of a copy of the petition, to provide the Delaware Register in Chancery with a duly verified list containing the names and addresses of all
holders who have demanded an appraisal of their shares. The Delaware Court of Chancery will then determine which shareholders are entitled to appraisal rights and may
require the shareholders demanding appraisal who hold certificated shares to submit their stock certificates to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency
of the appraisal proceedings and the Delaware Court of Chancery may dismiss the proceedings as to any shareholder who fails to comply with this direction. Where
proceedings are not dismissed or the demand for appraisal is not successfully withdrawn, the appraisal proceeding will be conducted as to the Common Shares owned by
such shareholders in accordance with the rules of the Delaware Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings. The Delaware Court of
Chancery will thereafter determine the fair value of the Common Shares at the Effective Time held by all shareholders who have properly perfected appraisal rights,
exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger. Unless the Delaware Court of Chancery in its discretion determines
otherwise for good cause shown, interest from the Effective Time through the date of payment of the judgment will be compounded quarterly and will accrue at 5% over the
Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the Effective Time and the date of payment of the
judgment. When the value is determined, the Delaware Court of Chancery will direct the payment of such value, with interest thereon, if any, to the shareholders entitled to
receive the same, upon surrender by such shareholders of their stock certificates or, in the case of book-entry shares, forthwith.

        In determining the fair value, the Delaware Court of Chancery is required to take into account all relevant factors. In Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the Delaware Supreme
Court discussed the factors that could be considered in determining fair value in an appraisal proceeding, stating that "proof of value by any techniques or methods which are
generally considered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court" should be considered and that "[f]air price obviously requires consideration of
all relevant factors involving the value of a company." The Delaware Supreme Court has stated that, in making this determination of fair value, the court must consider
market value, asset value, dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the enterprise and any other factors which could be ascertained as of the date of the merger which
throw any light on future prospects of the merged corporation. Section 262 of the DGCL provides that fair value is to be "exclusive of any element of value arising from the
accomplishment or expectation of the merger." In Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court stated that such exclusion is a "narrow exclusion [that] does
not encompass known elements of value," but which rather applies only to the speculative elements of value arising from such accomplishment or expectation. In
Weinberger, the Delaware Supreme Court construed Section 262 of the DGCL to mean that "elements of future value, including the nature of the enterprise, which are known
or susceptible of proof as of the date of the merger and not the product of speculation, may be considered." An opinion of an investment banking firm as to the fairness from
a financial point of view of the consideration payable in a merger is not an opinion as to, and does not in any manner address, fair value under Section 262 of the DGCL. The
fair value of your shares as determined under Section 262 of the DGCL could be greater than, the same as, or less than the value of the merger consideration. The Surviving
Company does not anticipate offering more than the per share Merger Consideration to any shareholder exercising appraisal rights and reserves the

right to assert, in any appraisal proceeding, that, for purposes of Section 262, the "fair value" of a Common Share is less than the per share Merger Consideration.

        If no party files a petition for appraisal within 120 days after the Effective Time, then all shareholders will lose the right to an appraisal, and will instead receive the
Merger Consideration described in the Merger Agreement, without interest thereon, less any withholding taxes.

        The Delaware Court of Chancery may determine the costs of the appraisal proceeding and may tax those costs against the parties as the Delaware Court of Chancery
deems to be equitable under the circumstances. However, costs do not include attorneys and expert witness fees. Each shareholder is responsible for its own attorneys and
expert witnesses expenses, although, upon application of a shareholder, the Delaware Court of Chancery may order all or a portion of the expenses incurred by any
shareholder in connection with the appraisal proceeding, including reasonable attorneys' fees and the fees and expenses of experts, to be charged pro rata against the value of
all shares entitled to appraisal.

        Any shareholder that has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined such a proceeding as a named party may withdraw a demand for appraisal and accept the
Merger Consideration by delivering a written withdrawal of the demand for appraisal to the Surviving Company, except that any attempt to withdraw made more than sixty
(60) days after the Effective Time will require written approval of the Surviving Company. No appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery will be dismissed as
to any shareholder without the approval of the Delaware Court of Chancery and such approval may be conditioned on the terms the Delaware Court of Chancery deems just,
provided, however, that this provision will not affect the right of any shareholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined such proceeding as a named
party to withdraw such shareholder's demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered in the Merger within sixty (60) days after the Effective Time. If you fail to perfect,
successfully withdraw or lose the appraisal right, your shares will be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest thereon, less any
withholding taxes.

        Failure to follow the steps required by Section 262 of the DGCL for perfecting appraisal rights may result in the loss of appraisal rights. In that event, you will be
entitled to receive the Merger Consideration for your shares in accordance with the Merger Agreement. In view of the complexity of the provisions of Section 262 of the
DGCL, if you are a CIFC shareholder and are considering exercising your appraisal rights under the DGCL, you should consult your own legal advisor.

        THE PROCESS OF DEMANDING AND EXERCISING APPRAISAL RIGHTS REQUIRES STRICT COMPLIANCE WITH TECHNICAL
PREREQUISITES. IF YOU WISH TO EXERCISE YOUR APPRAISAL RIGHTS, YOU SHOULD CONSULT WITH YOUR OWN LEGAL COUNSEL IN
CONNECTION WITH COMPLIANCE UNDER SECTION 262 OF THE DGCL. TO THE EXTENT THERE ARE ANY INCONSISTENCIES BETWEEN THE
FOREGOING SUMMARY AND SECTION 262 OF THE DGCL, THE DGCL WILL GOVERN.

SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS FOR 2017 ANNUAL MEETING

        Shareholders who intend to present proposals at CIFC's annual meeting of shareholders in 2017 (which we do not anticipate holding) pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the
Exchange Act must send notice of their proposal to us so that we receive it no later than August 18, 2017. Shareholders who intend to present proposals at the annual meeting
of shareholders in 2017 other than pursuant to Rule 14a-8 must comply with the notice provisions in our LLC Agreement. The notice provisions in our LLC Agreement
require that, for a proposal to be properly brought before the annual meeting of shareholders in 2017, proper notice of the proposal be received by us not less than 90 days or

HOUSEHOLDING 

        The SEC permits companies and intermediaries, such as a brokerage firm or a bank, to satisfy the delivery requirements for notices and proxy materials with respect to
two or more security holders sharing the same address by delivering only one notice or set of proxy materials to that address. This process, which is commonly referred to as
"householding," can effectively reduce CIFC's printing and postage costs.

        Certain shareholders (beneficial owners) whose shares are held in "street name" (i.e., in the name of a brokerage firm or other intermediary) and who have consented to
householding will receive only one notice or set of proxy materials per household. If a shareholder's household received a single notice and set of proxy materials this year
and would like to receive additional copies, or if a shareholder's household received multiple copies of the same items and would like to receive only a single copy in the
future, that shareholder should contact the shareholder's brokerage firm, bank or other nominee.

        Registered shareholders (i.e., shareholders who hold shares in their own name through CIFC's transfer agent) should contact American Stock Transfer & Trust
Company, LLC by mail at 6201 15th Avenue, Brooklyn, NY 11219, or by telephone at 1-800-937-5449 and indicate your name, the name of each of your brokerage firms or
banks where your shares are held and your account numbers.

legally bound hereby, the parties hereto agree as follows:

ARTICLE I.

THE MERGER 

        Section 1.1.    The Merger.     Upon the terms and subject to the conditions hereof, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company and
the separate existence of Merger Sub shall thereupon cease, and the Company, as the surviving entity in the Merger (the "Surviving Company"), shall, by virtue of the
Merger, continue its existence under the laws of the State of Delaware.

        Section 1.2.    Closing.     Unless this Agreement shall have been terminated pursuant to the provisions of Section 9.1, the closing of the Merger (the "Closing") will
take place at 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on the third Business Day after the satisfaction or waiver (subject to applicable Law) of the conditions to Closing set forth in
ARTICLE VIII hereof (excluding conditions that, by their terms, cannot be satisfied until the Closing Date, but subject to the satisfaction or, where permitted, waiver of those
conditions as of the Closing), unless another time or date is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto (the actual date of the Closing, the "Closing Date"). The Closing shall be
held at the offices of Dechert LLP, 1095 Avenue of the Americas, New York, New York 10036, unless another place is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto provided,
however, that any party may participate remotely by electronic delivery of documents and/or funds.

        Section 1.3.    Effective Time.     Upon the Closing, the parties shall file with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware a certificate of merger (the "Certificate of

"Effective Time").

Effective Time, all the property, rights, privileges, powers, and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Company, and all debts, liabilities and
duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Company.

        Section 1.5.    Limited Liability Company Agreement.     The LLC Agreement of the Company will be amended in connection with the Merger to read in its entirety as
set forth on Exhibit A hereto, shall be the limited liability company agreement of the Surviving Company and thereafter may be amended as provided therein or by Law,
subject to Section 6.2.

Table of Contents

        Section 1.6.    Directors; Officers.     The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Company and the
officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Company, in each case, until their respective successors are duly
elected and qualified or until their death, resignation or removal in accordance with the Act and the limited liability company agreement of the Surviving Company.

ARTICLE II.

EFFECT OF MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK 

        Section 2.1.    Effect on Capital Stock.     At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company or
the holder of any capital stock of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company:

        (a)    Cancellation of Certain Common Shares.    Each Common Share that is owned by Parent, Merger Sub or the Company (as treasury stock or otherwise) or
any of their respective direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiaries (other than shares held by any Subsidiary of the Company, which shall remain outstanding with
appropriate adjustment to the number thereof to preserve its relative interest in the Company, and other than shares held on behalf of third parties) will automatically
be cancelled and retired and will cease to exist, and no consideration will be delivered in exchange therefor.

        (b)    Conversion of Common Shares.    Each Common Share that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than (i) shares
described in Section 2.1(a), (ii) Dissenting Shares and (iii) Rollover Shares (each, an "Excluded Share" and collectively, the "Excluded Shares")) will automatically
be converted into solely the right to receive, in cash, the Merger Consideration, payable upon surrender of such shares in the manner provided in Section 2.4.

        (c)    Cancellation of Common Shares.    All Common Shares shall cease to be outstanding and shall be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and, in the
case of book-entry shares ("Book-Entry Shares"), the names of the former registered holders shall be removed from the registry of holders of such shares, and,
subject to Section 2.1(a) and Section 2.3, each holder of Book-Entry Shares and each holder of a certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented any such Common Shares (each, a "Certificate") shall thereafter cease to have any rights with respect to such Common Shares, except, in the case of the
Company Shares that are not Excluded Shares, the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 2.4.

        (d)    Conversion of Merger Sub Capital Stock.    Each common share of Merger Sub that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will
automatically be converted into one (1) common share representing one membership interest of the Surviving Company.

        (e)    Adjustments to Prevent Dilution.    If prior to the Effective Time, the Company should, subject to and in accordance with Section 5.1, split, combine, or
otherwise reclassify the Common Shares or any rights, warrants or options to acquire any Company Securities, or pay a dividend or other distribution in Common
Shares or otherwise change the Common Shares into any other securities, or make any other such dividend or distribution in equity interests of the Company in
respect of the Common Shares, then any number or amount contained herein which is based upon the price or the number of Common Shares will be appropriately
adjusted to reflect such split, combination, reclassification, dividend or other distribution or change.

        Section 2.2.    Treatment of Equity Awards.     

        (a)    Company Share Options.     The Company shall take all actions as may be necessary so that, at the Effective Time, each option to acquire Common Shares (each, a
"Company Share Option") that

has not been forfeited (or if previously forfeited, is required to be reinstated if a change in control event or sale event occurs within a specified period following such
forfeiture) shall become fully vested to the extent not then fully vested, and each Company Share Option shall be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount
in cash, without interest, equal to the product of (x) the aggregate number of Common Shares subject to such Company Share Option, multiplied by (y) the excess, if any, of
the Merger Consideration over the per share exercise price of such Company Share Option; provided, however, that if the result in clause (y) equals or is less than zero, such
Company Share Option shall be cancelled and forfeited with no payment due the holder thereof. Parent shall cause the Surviving Company or one of its Subsidiaries to pay,
through the Company's regular payroll system on a special payroll date which shall have been established by Company with its payroll provider prior to Closing, the holders
of Company Share Options the amounts due under this Section 2.2(a) (less all applicable withholding Taxes and deductions) as promptly as practicable (but in any event no
later than three (3) days) after the Effective Time.

        (b)    Company Share Awards.     The Company shall take all actions as may be necessary so that, at the Effective Time, each Company Share Award (other than any
Company Share Award to be assumed by Parent pursuant to the Rollover Agreements) that has not been forfeited (or if previously forfeited, is required to be reinstated if a
change in control event or sale event occurs within a specified period following such forfeiture) shall become fully vested if not already fully vested (and if such Company
Share Award is subject to performance based vesting, such Company Share Award shall become vested based on the maximum level of performance for such Company
Share Award except to the extent provided in Section 2.2(b) of the Disclosure Letter), and all Company Share Awards (other than any Company Share Award to be assumed
by Parent pursuant to the Rollover Agreements) shall be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of (x) the
aggregate number of Common Shares in respect of such Company Share Award (if such Company Share Award is subject to performance based vesting, such aggregate
number of Common Shares shall be determined assuming the maximum level of performance for such Company Share Award except to the extent provided in Section 2.2(b)
of the Disclosure Letter) multiplied by (y) the Merger Consideration. Parent shall cause the Surviving Company or one of its Subsidiaries to pay the holders of Company
Share Awards (other than any Company Share Award to be assumed by Parent pursuant to the Rollover Agreements), through the Company's regular payroll system on a
special payroll date which shall have been established by Company with its payroll provider prior to Closing, the amounts due under this Section 2.2(b) (less all applicable
withholding Taxes and deductions) as promptly as practicable (but in any event no later than three (3) days) after the Effective Time (or at such later date as may be required
to comply with Code Section 409A).

        (c)    Company Warrant.     The Company shall take all actions as may be necessary so that, at the Effective Time, each warrant to acquire Common Shares (each, a
"Company Warrant") that has not been exercised shall be redeemed or cancelled in exchange for the right to receive (i) an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the
product of (x) the aggregate number of Common Shares for which such Company Warrant is exercisable into, multiplied by (y) the excess, if any, of the Merger
Consideration over the per share exercise price of such Company Warrant and (ii) dividends pursuant to Section 4.03 of the Warrant Agreement in an amount equal to $1.59
per Common Share, plus any dividends paid after the date hereof and prior to the Closing Date. Parent shall cause the Surviving Company or one of its Subsidiaries to pay
the holders of Company Warrants the amounts due under this Section 2.2(c) (less all applicable withholding Taxes and deductions) at the Closing.

        Section 2.3.    Dissenting Shares.     Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Common Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time and that are owned by Shareholders that have properly perfected their rights of appraisal within the meaning of Section 262 of the General Corporation
Law of the State of Delaware (the "DGCL") (as applicable to the Company pursuant to the LLC Agreement (the "Dissenting Shares")) shall not be converted into

the right to receive the Merger Consideration, unless and until such Shareholders shall have failed to perfect any available right of appraisal thereunder, but, instead, the
holders thereof shall be entitled to payment of the appraised value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (as applicable to the Company
pursuant to the LLC Agreement). If any such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such right of appraisal, the Common Shares held
by such Shareholder shall not be deemed Dissenting Shares for purposes of this Agreement and shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into the Merger
Consideration at the Effective Time in accordance with Section 2.1(b). The Company shall give Parent (a) prompt written notice of any demands for appraisal filed pursuant
to Section 262 of the DGCL (as applicable to the Company pursuant to the LLC Agreement) received by Company, withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments
served or delivered in connection with such demands pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL (as applicable to the Company pursuant to the LLC Agreement) and received by
the Company, and (b) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands made pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL (as applicable to
the Company pursuant to the LLC Agreement). The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, (i) make any payment with respect to any such
demand, (ii) offer to settle or settle any such demand, or (iii) waive any failure to timely deliver a written demand for appraisal or timely take any other action to perfect
appraisal rights in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (as applicable to the Company pursuant to the LLC Agreement).

        Section 2.4.    Payment Fund and Payment Procedures.     

        (a)   Prior to the Effective Time, for the benefit of the holders of the Common Shares (other than Excluded Shares), Parent will designate, or cause to be designated, a
bank or trust company that is reasonably acceptable to the Company (the "Paying Agent") to act as agent for the payment of the Merger Consideration in respect of
Certificates upon surrender of such Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof that comply with the requirements of Section 2.5) and Book-Entry Shares in
accordance with this ARTICLE II from time to time after the Effective Time. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent or Merger Sub will deposit, or cause to be deposited,
with the Paying Agent sufficient cash in U.S. dollars to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration that is payable in respect of all of the issued and outstanding Common
Shares, other than amounts to be paid through the Company's payroll system, which shall be paid to the Company (the "Payment Fund"). The Payment Fund shall not be
used for any purpose other than to fund payments pursuant to Section 2.1(b). Parent shall pay all charges and expenses, including those of the Paying Agent, in connection
with the exchange of Common Shares for the Merger Consideration. Parent will enter into a paying agent agreement on customary terms, which terms shall be in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to the Company, prior to the Effective Time.

        (b)   As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time and in any event no later than the second (2nd) Business Day following the Closing, Parent shall send, or cause
the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of Common Shares (other than Excluded Shares) a letter of transmittal in customary form as reasonably agreed by the
parties specifying that delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and title to Certificates and Book-Entry Shares will pass, only upon proper delivery of Certificates (or
customary effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof that comply with the requirements of Section 2.5) or Book-Entry Shares, as the case may be, to the Paying Agent and
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or customary effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof that comply with the requirements of Section 2.5) and
Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration.

        (c)   Upon the proper surrender of a Certificate (or customary effective affidavit of loss in lieu thereof that comply with the requirements of Section 2.5) or Book-Entry
Share to the Paying Agent, together with a duly executed and properly completed letter of transmittal, and such other documents as may reasonably be requested by the

Share will be entitled to receive as promptly as practicable in exchange therefor cash in the amount (after giving effect to any required tax withholdings) that such holder has
the right to receive pursuant to this ARTICLE II, and the Certificate (and the Common Shares represented thereby) or Book-Entry Share so surrendered will forthwith be
cancelled; provided that, with respect to any Shareholder who surrenders Certificates or Book-Entry Shares at least three (3) Business Days prior to the Effective Time
together with a properly completed letter of transmittal and such other proper documentation as the Paying Agent reasonably requests (which letter of transmittal and other
documentation Parent will cause the Paying Agent to provide promptly upon request of a Shareholder, but in no event later than five (5) Business Days prior to the Effective
Time) the Paying Agent shall pay to such Shareholder by wire transfer of immediately available funds on the Closing Date the amount such Shareholder has the right to
receive pursuant to this ARTICLE II.

        (d)   Until such Certificates (or customary effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof that comply with the requirements of Section 2.5) or Book-Entry Shares, as the case
may be, are so properly delivered, each such Certificate or Book-Entry Share, as the case may be, shall represent after the Effective Time for all purposes only the right to
receive the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof, subject to the terms set forth in Section 2.3. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due
surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares.

        (e)   In the event of a transfer of ownership of the Common Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, cash to be paid upon due surrender of the
Certificate or Book-Entry Share may be paid to such a transferee if the Certificate or Book-Entry Share formerly representing such Common Shares is presented to the
Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid or are not
applicable.

        (f)    Any funds included in the Payment Fund may be invested by the Paying Agent, as directed by Parent; provided that such investments shall be limited to direct
short-term obligations of, or short-term obligations fully guaranteed by, the United States of America and backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of America.
Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall promptly be paid to Parent. Nothing contained herein and no investment losses resulting from
investment of the Payment Fund shall diminish the rights of any holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares to receive the Merger Consideration as provided herein. If for
any reason (including losses) the Payment Fund is at any time inadequate to pay the amounts to which holders of Common Shares shall be entitled under Section 2.1(b),
Parent shall take all steps necessary to promptly deposit additional cash in U.S. dollars with the Paying Agent sufficient to make all payments required under this Agreement,
and Parent and the Surviving Company shall in any event be liable for the payment thereof.

        (g)   Any portion of the Payment Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares twelve (12) months after the Effective Time
will be delivered to the Surviving Company, on demand, and any holder of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share who has not theretofore complied with this ARTICLE II will
thereafter look only to the Surviving Company for payment of his or her claims for Merger Consideration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company, the Surviving Company, the Paying Agent or any other Person will be liable to any Person in respect of any Merger Consideration from the Payment Fund
properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

        Section 2.5.    Lost Certificates.     If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon (a) the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Company, (b) the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as the
Surviving Company may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate and (c) the delivery of any other documentation

required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any provision of state,
local or foreign tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving Company or Parent, as the case may be, and duly paid to the applicable Governmental
Entity, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Common Shares or the holder of a Company Equity
Award or Company Warrant in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Company or Parent, as the case may be.

        Section 2.7.    Contribution and Issuance.     Immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Rollover Holders and Parent shall effectuate the Contribution and Issuance in
accordance with the Rollover Agreements, pursuant to which each such Rollover Holder shall receive equity interests in Parent determined in accordance with such Rollover
Holder's Rollover Agreement. The Company shall take such actions as are necessary and reasonably requested by Parent in order to allow the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by the Rollover Agreements, including the assumption by Parent of certain Company Share Awards, provided, that such actions shall not have an
adverse effect on the Company or its equityholders (other than delaying the deductibility of such Company Share Awards upon vesting).

        Section 2.8.    Further Assurances.     At and after the Effective Time, the officers and directors of the Surviving Company will be authorized to execute and deliver, in
the name and on behalf of the Company or Merger Sub, any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf of the Company or
Merger Sub, any other actions and things to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Company any and all right, title and interest in, to and under any
of the rights, properties or assets acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Company as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger.

        Section 2.9.    Stock Transfer Books.     At the close of business, New York time, on the day the Effective Time occurs, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be

Supreme Universal Holdings Limited, a company organized and existing under the laws of the Cayman Islands (the "Sponsor") pursuant to which the Sponsor has
committed to invest the amounts set forth therein (the "Equity Financing"). The Equity Commitment Letter provides, and will continue to provide, that the Company is a
third party beneficiary thereof. The Equity Commitment Letter is, as of the date hereof, in full force and effect and has not been withdrawn or terminated or otherwise
amended, supplemented or modified in any respect. The Equity Commitment Letter, in the form so delivered, is a legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent and Merger
Sub and, to the knowledge of Parent, the other parties thereto. There are no side letters or other agreements, contracts or arrangements relating to the Equity Commitment
Letter (and the transactions contemplated thereby) between Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the Sponsor, on the other hand. No event has occurred which, with
or without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default or breach on the part of Parent or Merger Sub under any term, or a failure of any condition, of the Equity
Commitment Letter or otherwise result in any portion of the Equity Financing contemplated thereby to be unavailable. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub has reason to believe
that it could be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any term or condition of the Equity Commitment Letter required to be satisfied by it (other than the conditions in
Section 8.1 and Section 8.2). Parent and/or Merger Sub have fully paid any and all commitment fees or other fees required by the Equity Commitment Letter to be paid on or
before the date of this Agreement. Assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties set forth in ARTICLE III hereof and compliance by the Company with its
covenants and agreement hereunder, to the extent relevant to the representation set forth in this sentence, and subject to the satisfaction of the conditions of the Equity
Financing, the aggregate proceeds from the Equity Financing, are sufficient to fund all of the amounts required to be provided by Parent for the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and are sufficient for the satisfaction of all of Parent's and Merger Sub's obligations under this Agreement, including the
payment of the Merger Consideration in respect of each Common Share and the payment of all associated costs and expenses of the Merger (including any repayment or
refinancing of indebtedness of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company required in connection therewith). There are no conditions precedent or other contingencies related to the
funding or investing, as applicable, of the full amount of the Equity Financing, other than as expressly set forth in or contemplated by the Equity Commitment Letter.

        (b)   Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Parent and Merger Sub have delivered to the Company the Guarantee of the Guarantor, dated as of the date
hereof, in respect of all the payment obligations of Parent or Merger Sub pursuant to this Agreement and all liabilities and damages payable by Parent or Merger Sub arising
under or in connection with this Agreement. The Guarantee is in full force and effect and is a valid and binding obligation of the Guarantor, enforceable against the Guarantor
in accordance with its terms (subject to (a) the effect of bankruptcy, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and other similar Laws relating to or affecting the
enforcement of creditors' rights generally, (b) general equitable principles (whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law) and (c) an implied covenant of good faith
and fair dealing), and no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, could constitute a default on the part of the Guarantor under such Guarantee.

        Section 4.10.    Ownership of Company Stock.     As of the date hereof, none of Parent, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective "affiliates" or "associates" owns
any Company Securities.

        Section 4.11.    Acknowledgement of Disclaimer of Other Representations and Warranties.     Parent and Merger Sub each acknowledges and agrees that, except for
the representations and warranties expressly set forth in ARTICLE III hereof and the Ancillary Agreements, (x) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries makes, or
has made, any representation or warranty relating to itself or its business or otherwise in connection with this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated

        (a)   From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries to honor all Employee Benefit Plans, and compensation
arrangements and agreements in accordance with their terms as in effect immediately before the Effective Time, provided that nothing herein shall be construed as
prohibiting the amendment or termination of any of the foregoing in accordance with its terms. During the twelve (12) month period commencing at the Effective Time,
Parent shall provide, or shall cause the Surviving Company to provide, each employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time

(the "New Plans"), each Continuing Employee shall be credited with his or her years of service with the Company and its Subsidiaries (and their respective predecessors),
except where such credit would result in a duplication of benefits. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing: (i) each Continuing Employee shall be immediately
eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent coverage under such New Plan replaces coverage under an Employee Benefit Plan in
which such Continuing Employee participated immediately before such replacement and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical,
disability, life and/or vision benefits to any Continuing Employee, Parent shall cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and limitations and actively-at-work requirements
of such New Plan to be waived, or caused to be waived, for such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents, and Parent shall cause any eligible expenses
incurred by such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents under an Employee Benefit Plan during the portion of the plan year prior to such replacement to be
taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, co-insurance, co-payment and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such
employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan.

        (d)   Parent acknowledges that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be a "change in control," a "sale event" or similar event for purposes of any
applicable Employee Benefit Plan.

        (e)   Nothing contained herein shall be construed as requiring Parent or the Surviving Company to continue any specific employee benefit plans or to continue the
employment of any specific person. The provisions of this Section 6.1 are for the sole benefit of the parties to this Agreement and nothing herein, expressed or implied, is
intended or shall be construed to (i) constitute an amendment to any of the compensation and benefits plans maintained for or provided to employees prior to or following the
Effective Time or (ii) confer upon or give to any person (including for the avoidance of doubt any current or former employees, directors, or independent contractors of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or on or after the Effective Time, the Surviving Company or any of its Subsidiaries), other than the parties hereto and their respective
permitted successors and assigns, any legal or equitable or other rights or remedies (with respect to the matters provided for in this Section 6.1) under or by reason of any
provision of this Agreement.

        Section 6.2.    D&O Indemnification Continuation.     

        (a)   Parent and Merger Sub agree (i) that all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation by the Company and its Subsidiaries now existing in
favor of each Person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date hereof or who becomes prior to the Effective Time an officer or director of the Company or its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective predecessors and each Person who served at the request of the Company or its Subsidiaries as a director, officer, member, trustee or
fiduciary of another company, corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, pension or other employee benefit plan or enterprise (each, together with such Person's heirs,
executors or administrators "Indemnified Party") as provided in the Company Organizational Documents, in each case as in effect on the date of this Agreement, or
pursuant to any other Contracts in effect on the date hereof and disclosed in Section 6.2 of the Disclosure Letter, shall survive the Merger (with the obligations of the
Company being assumed by the Surviving Company) and shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with their terms for a period of six (6) years following the
Effective Time, and, in the event that any proceeding with respect to which such indemnification or advancement of expenses may be available is pending or asserted or any
claim with respect to which such indemnification or advancement of expenses may be available is made during such period, until the final disposition of such proceeding or
claim and (ii) to cause the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries to fulfill, honor and respect all such rights of the Indemnified Parties.

amounts paid in settlement of any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, in each case, arising in whole or in part out of or pertaining to (i) the
fact that such Indemnified Party is or was a director, officer, member, trustee or fiduciary of Company or its Subsidiaries or any of their respective predecessors, or served at
the request of the Company or its Subsidiaries as a director, officer, member, trustee or fiduciary of another company, corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, pension or
other employee benefit plan or enterprise at or prior to the Effective Time, (ii) matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, including this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or (iii) actions or omissions of an Indemnified Party taken in their capacity as such occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time (including in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement), and shall reimburse each Indemnified Party for any legal or other expenses reasonably
incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with investigating or defending any such losses, claims, damages, liabilities, fees, expenses, judgments and fines as such
expenses are incurred, subject to the Surviving Company's receipt of an undertaking by such Indemnified Party to repay such legal and other fees and expenses paid in
advance if it is ultimately determined in a final and non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to be indemnified
under the Company Organizational Documents.

        (c)   The Surviving Company shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to, (i) maintain in effect for a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, if
available, the current policies of directors' and officers' liability insurance maintained by the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time (provided that the Surviving
Company may substitute therefor policies, of at least the same coverage and amounts and containing terms and conditions that are not less advantageous to the directors and
officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries and other Indemnified Parties when compared to the insurance maintained by the Company as of the date hereof), or (ii) obtain
"tail" insurance policies from the Company's current insurance carrier or an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Company's current insurance carrier
with respect to directors' and officers' liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance with a claims period of six (6) years from the Effective Time with at least the same
coverage and amounts and containing terms and conditions that are not less advantageous to the directors and officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries and other
Indemnified Parties, in each case with respect to claims arising out of or relating to events which occurred at or before the Effective Time (including in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement); provided, however, that in no event will the Company expend or the Surviving Company be required to expend an annual
premium for such coverage in excess of 300% of the last annual premium paid by the Company for such insurance prior to the date of this Agreement (the "Maximum
Premium"). If such insurance coverage cannot be obtained at an annual premium equal to or less than the Maximum Premium, the Company or Surviving Company, as
applicable will obtain, and Parent will cause the Surviving Company to obtain, that amount of directors' and officers' insurance (or "tail" coverage) obtainable for an annual
premium equal to the Maximum Premium.

        (d)   The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Company under this Section 6.2 shall survive the consummation of the Merger and shall not be terminated or modified
in such a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnified Party to whom this Section 6.2 applies without the consent of such affected Indemnified Party (it being expressly
agreed that the Indemnified Parties to whom this Section 6.2 applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this Section 6.2, each of whom may enforce the provisions of this
Section 6.2). In the event Parent, the Surviving Company or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not
be the continuing or surviving company or entity in such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
either such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Company, as the case may be, shall assume all of the obligations
set forth in this Section 6.2. The agreements and covenants contained herein shall

not be deemed to be exclusive of any other rights to which any Indemnified Party is entitled, whether pursuant to Law, Contract or otherwise. Nothing in this Agreement is
intended to, shall be construed to or shall release, waive or impair any rights to directors' and officers' insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with
respect to the Company or its officers, directors and employees, it being understood and agreed that the indemnification provided for in this Section 6.2 is not prior to, or in
substitution for, any such claims under any such policies. If Parent or the Surviving Company make any payment with respect to a claim for indemnification or advancement
of expenses pursuant to Section 6.2(a), Parent or the Surviving Company, as applicable, shall be subrogated, to the extent of such payment, to all rights and remedies of the
Indemnified Party to any insurance benefits or other claims of the Indemnified Party with respect to such claim. In the event of any payment by Parent or its Affiliate to an
Indemnified Party under this Section 6.2, Parent or its Affiliate (as the case may be) shall be subrogated, to the extent of any such payment, to all rights of the Surviving
Company and its Subsidiaries under the applicable directors' and officers' (or other) insurance policy referred to in this Section 6.2. Without limiting the generality of any
other provision hereof, the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries shall duly execute upon request all instruments reasonably necessary to evidence and perfect the
subrogation rights described in the preceding sentence.

        Section 6.3.    Tax Matters.     Parent shall cause the Company to prepare all Tax Returns of the Company for any taxable period ending on or prior to the Closing Date
which are not filed as of the Closing Date. All such Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent with the past practices of the Company, except as otherwise
required by applicable Law. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, to the extent a valid election under Section 754 of the Code (and any corresponding provision of state
and local Law) is not in effect as of the date hereof for the Company, the Company shall make such election in the prescribed time and manner required for such election to
be effective for the taxable year that includes the Closing Date. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall provide to Parent drafts of any material Tax Return with respect to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries no later than ten (10) days prior to filing of such Tax Return, and shall, prior to filing thereof, make any changes reasonably requested by
Parent.

        (a)   The Company shall take all action necessary to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the Company Shareholders Meeting as promptly as reasonably
practicable after the SEC confirms that it has no further comments on the Proxy Statement (whether or not the Board of Directors of the Company has made a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change, but subject to the Company's rights under Section 9.1(f)) and, in connection therewith, the Company shall mail the Proxy Statement to
the holders of Common Shares in advance of such meeting. Except to the extent that the Board of Directors of the Company shall have effected a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change as permitted by Section 7.5 hereof, the Proxy Statement shall include the Company Board Recommendation. Subject to Section 7.5 hereof, the
Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to solicit from the holders of Common Shares proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and approval of the

practicable prepare, file and distribute to the Company's Shareholders any supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement if any event shall occur which requires such
action at any time after the mailing of the Proxy Statement and prior to the Company Shareholders Meeting. Parent and Merger Sub shall each cooperate with the Company

the Proxy Statement from the SEC, including furnishing the Company as promptly as reasonably practicable with any and all information with respect to Parent and Merger
Sub as may be required to be set forth in the Proxy Statement under the Exchange Act or as otherwise requested by the SEC. The Company will, to the extent practicable,
(i) provide Parent and Merger Sub a reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon the Proxy Statement, or any amendments or supplements thereto and (ii) consider
in good faith all additions, deletions or changes reasonably proposed by Parent and Merger Sub, in each case, prior to filing the same with the SEC. If at any time prior to the
Effective Time, any information relating to the Company, Merger Sub or Parent, or any of their respective Affiliates, officers or directors, should be discovered by the
Company, Merger Sub or Parent that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, so that the Proxy Statement would not include any
misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading, the party which discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such
information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by applicable Law, disseminated to the Shareholders.

        Section 7.2.    Investment Advisory Arrangement Consents and Investor Waivers.     

        (a)   In the event that the Consent (including any Consent set forth in Section 3.4 of the Disclosure Letter) to the assignment or deemed assignment of an Investment
Advisory Arrangement with Clients of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a direct result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is required by applicable
Law or by such Client's Investment Advisory Arrangement, the Company and each such Subsidiary shall send to such Clients two (2) written notices (other than with respect
to an Investment Advisory Arrangement that permits a Negative Consent, in which case the Company and each such Subsidiary shall send at least one (1) written notice)
(each, a "Notice") (the first at least forty-five (45) days prior to the Closing Date and the second, if applicable, approximately thirty (30) days after the first) informing such
Clients of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and requesting the appropriate Consent (or through the acquisition of Negative Consent if expressly permitted by
the applicable Investment Advisory Arrangement) to the assignment or deemed assignment of such Client's Investment Advisory Arrangement (such Notices to state, for
those Investment Advisory Arrangements that expressly permit a Negative Consent, consistent with customary practice that, following delivery of an appropriate notice to a
Client, such Client's Consent will be deemed to have been obtained if the Client does not object by a specified means prior to the Closing Date (a "Negative Consent")).
With respect to Contracts with Clients the terms of which require a Consent other than a Negative Consent as a consequence of the transactions contemplated herein, the
Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts (without a requirement to offer or grant any material accommodation or material alteration of terms (financial or
otherwise)) to obtain the required Consents; provided, however, that prior to obtaining any Consent which would require payment of any fee above the Fee Payment

the Closing Date.

        (b)   In respect of the Investor Waivers which are required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, as promptly as practicable following the
date of this Agreement, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall use commercially reasonable efforts (without a requirement to offer or grant any material accommodation or
material alteration of terms (financial or otherwise)) to obtain such Investor Waivers in the manner prescribed under the applicable Fund Documents as to constitute a valid
Consent thereunder on the earliest practicable date; provided, however, that prior to obtaining any Investor Waiver which would require payment of any fee above the Fee
Payment Threshold, the Company shall have obtained the written consent of Parent.

        (c)   At the reasonable request of Parent, subject to applicable fiduciary duties, the terms of the relevant Investment Advisory Arrangement and as permitted by
applicable Law, the Company, as determined in the Company's reasonable discretion, may request that each Investment Adviser Subsidiary (x) provide a Notice to any Client
that has not consented to the assignment prior to the Closing stating that such Client's account may be terminated if such consent is not received by the Closing and
(y) terminate the Investment Advisory Arrangement with such Client effective immediately prior to the Closing if such consent has not been received.

        (d)   In connection with obtaining the Advisers Act Consents, the Investor Waivers and other actions required by Section 7.2(a) and Section 7.2(b), at all times prior to
the Effective Time, the Company shall take reasonable steps to keep Parent informed of the status of obtaining such Advisers Act Consents and Investor Waivers and shall
prior to Closing make available to Parent copies of all such executed Advisers Act Consents and Investor Waivers and, upon reasonable prior notice from Parent, make
available for Parent's inspection the originals of such Advisers Act Consents and Investor Waivers and any related materials and other records relating to such consent
process. Without limiting the foregoing or the terms set forth in Section 7.3, in connection with obtaining the Advisers Act Consents and Investor Waivers required under
Section 7.2(a) and Section 7.2(b), the Company shall have obtained Parent's approval of the form and substance of any Notice or other materials to be distributed to the
Client or other Persons in order to obtain the necessary Advisers Act Consent or Investor Waiver, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or
delayed.

        (e)   The Company shall promptly notify Parent after the receipt by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of any written notice that any Client (i) has ceased or will
cease, to use any services of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) has substantially reduced, or will substantially reduce, the use of services of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or (iii) has sought, or is seeking, to reduce any fees it will pay for any services of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

faith to develop a mutually acceptable communications plan for communicating the status of the transaction to the Clients, investors in Funds, employees, suppliers and
vendors to the extent the Company and Parent mutually determine in good faith that it would be advisable to have such communications.

        (g)   The consent of Parent shall be required with respect to any amendment or modification to any Client Contract for the purpose of obtaining any such consent that is
adverse in any material respect to Parent, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; provided, however, that the payment of any fee in connection with obtaining a Consent or
Investor Waiver that is effectuated in accordance with Section 7.2(a) and Section 7.2(b) above shall in no circumstance be determined to be an amendment or modification to
a Client Contract that is adverse in any material respect to Parent, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

        (h)   Except as contemplated by this Agreement, each of Parent and Merger Sub agree that it will not intentionally (or recklessly) take (or fail to take) any action
(including by means of announcing intentions with respect to the operations of the Company following the Closing) that would reasonably be expected to be materially
adverse to or otherwise materially impair in any respect the efforts of the Company to obtain the Advisers Act Consents or the Investor Waivers as contemplated in this
Section 7.2.

        Section 7.3.    Access to Information.     Upon reasonable prior notice, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, afford to Parent and its Representatives
reasonable access during normal business hours, in a manner as shall not unreasonably interfere with the business or operations of the Company or any Subsidiary thereof,
during the period prior to the Effective Time, to the properties, offices, personnel, other facilities and all books and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and, during
such period, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, furnish promptly to Parent and its Representatives, all other data, information, agreements and documents
concerning its business, properties and personnel as Parent or its Representatives may reasonably request; provided, however, that the Company may restrict the foregoing
access to the extent that, in the Company's reasonable judgment, (i) providing such access would violate any of its contractual obligations to a third party with respect to
confidentiality, or (ii) any Law applicable to the Company or its Subsidiaries requires the Company, its Subsidiaries to preclude Parent or its Representatives from gaining
access to such properties or information; provided, further, that the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the required consent of any third party
necessary to provide such disclosure under clause (i) above; provided, further, that Parent and its Representatives shall not have access to individual medical histories or
information that is subject to attorney client privilege (provided, that with respect to any such privileged information, the Company shall promptly provide a description of
any information, documents, data or other material withheld (without disclosing privileged information) and the reason for which it was withheld), nor shall they be
permitted to conduct any environmental sampling. Parent will hold, and will cause its Representatives to hold, any information or documents received or provided pursuant
to this Section 7.3 in confidence to the extent required by, and in accordance with, the provisions of that certain letter agreement, dated June 13, 2016 (the "Confidentiality
Agreement"), between the Company and Parent, which shall survive the termination of this Agreement in accordance with the terms set forth therein. Notwithstanding

        (b)   Each party hereto shall promptly inform the other party or parties hereto, as the case may be, of any material communication from any Governmental Entity
regarding any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. If the Company or Parent receives a request for additional information or documentary material from any
Governmental Entity with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, then it shall use reasonable best efforts to make, or cause to be made, as soon as
reasonably practicable and after consultation with the other party, an appropriate response in compliance with such request, and, if permitted by applicable Law and by any
applicable Governmental Entity, provide the other party and its counsel with advance notice and the opportunity to participate in any material meeting with any
Governmental Entity in respect of any filing made thereto in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

        (c)   Without limiting the generality of the undertakings pursuant to Section 7.4(a) hereof, the parties hereto shall (i) provide or cause to be provided as promptly as
practicable to Governmental Entities with jurisdiction over the HSR Act (each such Governmental Entity, a "Governmental Antitrust Authority") information and
documents requested by any Governmental Antitrust Authority as necessary, proper or advisable to permit consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including preparing and filing any notification and report form and related material required under the HSR Act as promptly as practicable following the date of
this Agreement (but in any event within ten (10) Business Days of the date of this Agreement) and thereafter to respond as promptly as practicable to any request for
additional information or documentary material that may be made under the HSR Act, and (ii) subject to the terms set forth in Section 7.4(d) hereof, use their reasonable best
efforts to take such actions as are necessary or advisable to obtain prompt approval of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by any
Governmental Entity or expiration of applicable waiting periods.

        (d)   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, each of Parent and Merger Sub shall take any and all action necessary to obtain any
necessary approval from any Governmental Antitrust Authority or Governmental Entity or to prevent the initiation of any lawsuit by any Governmental Entity under the HSR
Act or to prevent the entry of any Order that would otherwise make the Merger unlawful, including but not limited to: (i) disposing or transferring any asset, including those
of Parent, Merger Sub, their respective Affiliates or the Company; (ii) licensing or otherwise making available to any Person, any technology or other Intellectual Property of
Parent, Merger Sub, their respective Affiliates or the Company; (iii) holding separate any assets or operations (either before or after the Closing Date) of Parent, Merger Sub,
their respective Affiliates or the Company; or (iv) changing or modifying any course of conduct or otherwise making any commitment (to any Governmental Entity or
otherwise) regarding future operations of the business of Parent, Merger Sub, their respective Affiliates or the Company. If any Action is instituted (or threatened to be
instituted) challenging the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Merger as violative of the HSR Act, or if any Order is entered, enforced or attempted to be
entered or enforced by a court or other Governmental Entity, which Order would make the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Merger illegal or would
otherwise prohibit, prevent, restrict, impair or delay consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, each of Parent and Merger Sub shall make any and all efforts to
contest and resist any such action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any such Order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in
effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Merger and to have such Order repealed, rescinded or
made inapplicable so as to permit consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Merger.

        (e)   The Company, Merger Sub, and Parent shall cooperate with one another in determining whether any Consent (other than those Consents contemplated by

amounts), commence litigation or pay or grant any other form of compensation to any such Person in connection with obtaining such Person's Consent, and further, for the
avoidance of doubt, the failure to obtain any such Consent shall not, in and of itself, be a breach of this Agreement by the Company.

        (f)    Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided, each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall not, and shall cause their Affiliates not to, acquire
businesses or assets or enter into any agreement to acquire any businesses or assets if such action would reasonably be expected to materially delay, hinder or prohibit

        (a)   Subject to the remainder of this Section 7.5, none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall (whether directly or indirectly through Affiliates, directors,
officers, employees, Representatives or other intermediaries), nor shall (directly or indirectly) the Company authorize any of its or its Subsidiaries' officers, directors,
Representatives or other intermediaries or Subsidiaries to: (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly facilitate (it being understood and agreed that ministerial acts that are not
otherwise prohibited by this Section 7.5 (such as answering unsolicited phone calls) shall not be deemed to "facilitate" for purposes of this Section 7.5) the submission of
inquiries, proposals or offers from any Person (other than Parent) relating to any Acquisition Proposal, or agree to or recommend any Acquisition Proposal; (ii) enter into any
agreement (x) to consummate any Acquisition Proposal, (y) to approve any Acquisition Proposal or (z) requiring it to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the Merger;

any non-public information with respect to its business, properties or assets in connection with any Acquisition Proposal; (iv) waive, terminate, modify or release any Person
(other than Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Affiliates) from any provision of or grant any permission, waiver or request under any "standstill" or similar agreement or
obligation, unless the Company's Board of Directors has determined in good faith after consultation with outside legal counsel that failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, or (v) agree to resolve to take, or take, any of the actions prohibited by clause (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) of this sentence.
The Company shall immediately cease, and cause its Representatives and other intermediaries to immediately cease, any and all existing activities, discussions or
negotiations with any parties conducted heretofore with respect to an Acquisition Proposal and shall immediately terminate online data room access to all such parties and
their Representatives. For purposes of this Section 7.5, the term "Person" means any person, corporation, entity or "group," as defined in Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act,
other than, with respect to the Company, Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may, following the receipt of an Acquisition
Proposal, contact the Person that has made such Acquisition Proposal to (i) clarify and understand the terms and conditions thereof solely to facilitate the Board of Directors
of the Company's determination of whether such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to, a Superior Proposal, and (ii) inform such
Person of the existence of the provisions of this Section 7.5.

        (b)   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 7.5, the Company, directly or indirectly through Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, Representatives
or other intermediaries, may, prior to the receipt of the Required Company Vote, (i) engage in negotiations or discussions with any Person (and its Representatives and
intermediaries) that has made an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal not resulting from or arising out of a breach of Section 7.5(a), and/or (ii) furnish to such
Person information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement and to the extent nonpublic information that has
not been made available to Parent is made available to such Person, make available or furnish such nonpublic

information to Parent promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) following the time it is provided to such Person, in the case of each of clauses (i) or (ii), if, and only if,
prior to taking such particular action, the Board of Directors of the Company has determined in good faith after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal
counsel that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to, a Superior Proposal, and that the failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

        (c)   Notwithstanding anything in this Section 7.5 to the contrary, at any time prior to the receipt of the Required Company Vote, the Company's Board of Directors may
(x) withdraw, modify or amend in any manner adverse to Parent its approval or recommendation of this Agreement or the Merger or recommend an Acquisition Proposal, or

an Intervening Event, or (ii) following receipt of an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a breach of this Section 7.5 and which the
Company's Board of Directors determines in good faith, in consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel constitutes a Superior Proposal or would
reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal, in the case of each of clauses (i) and (ii), if and only if, the Company's Board of Directors has determined in good
faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law and subject to the Company's compliance with Section 7.5(d) or (y) following receipt of an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that did not
result from a breach of this Section 7.5 and which the Company's Board of Directors determines in good faith, in consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal
counsel constitutes a Superior Proposal or would reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal, terminate this Agreement in accordance with the provisions of
Section 9.1(f) and enter into a definitive acquisition agreement, merger agreement or similar definitive agreement (a "Company Acquisition Agreement" (for the avoidance
of doubt an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement shall not constitute a Company Acquisition Agreement)) with respect to such Superior Proposal, if, and only if, the
Company's Board of Directors has determined in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would
be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law and the Company complies with Section 7.5(d) and, concurrently with entering into a Company Acquisition
Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal, the Company pays the Termination Fee in accordance with Section 9.2(c).

        (d)   Prior to the Company taking any action permitted (i) under Section 7.5(c)(x)(i), the Company shall (A) provide Parent with at least four (4) Business Days' prior
written notice advising Parent it intends to effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change and specifying, in reasonable detail, the reasons therefor and all material
information with respect to such Intervening Event (including in relation to all developments related thereto), and (B) if requested by Parent, during such four (4) Business
Day period, negotiate in good faith with Parent (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement such that
the Company's Board of Directors would determine in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that the failure of the Company's
Board of Directors to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change would not be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, or (ii) under
Section 7.5(c)(x)(ii) or Section 7.5(c)(y) the Company shall provide Parent with at least four (4) Business Days' prior written notice (it being understood and agreed that any
material amendment to the amount or form of consideration payable in connection with the applicable Acquisition Proposal shall require a new notice and a two (2) Business
Day period) advising Parent that the Company's Board of Directors intends to take such action, specifying the material terms and conditions of the Superior Proposal and that
the Company shall, if requested by Parent, during such four (4) Business Day period (or two (2) Business Day period, if applicable), negotiate with Parent (to the extent
Parent desires to negotiate) to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement such that such Acquisition Proposal would no longer constitute a
Superior Proposal.

conditions of any such Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed of the status and material details (including any amendments or proposed
amendments) of any such Acquisition Proposal and keep Parent reasonably informed as to the material details of all discussions or negotiations with respect to any such
Acquisition Proposal (in each case in a manner that is not unduly disruptive of the Company's ability to conduct good faith discussions in accordance with this Section 7.5
with the party making such Acquisition Proposal and its Representatives, advisors and agents) and shall provide Parent within 24 hours after receipt thereof all copies of any
other documentation, including any drafts of a Company Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Acquisition Proposal, material to understanding such Acquisition

the Company's Shareholders a position with respect to a tender or exchange offer by a third party pursuant to Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act
(or any similar communication to the Company's Shareholders), and none of the foregoing shall constitute a Company Adverse Recommendation Change provided that any
such disclosure (other than a "stop, look and listen" communication or other similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act, or an
express rejection of the Acquisition Proposal or a reaffirmation of the Company Board Recommendation) shall be deemed to be a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change if the Company Board fails to expressly and publicly reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation within five (5) Business Days following any request by Parent
in response to such Company disclosure (it being agreed that Parent may only make one (1) request with respect to any single such disclosure).

transactions contemplated hereby shall be issued by any party without the prior written consent of the Company and Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), except as such release or announcement may be required by Law or the rules or regulations of any applicable Governmental Entity, in
which case the party required to make the release or announcement shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to allow each other party reasonable time to comment on
such release or announcement in advance of such issuance (and the disclosing party will consider such comments in good faith) provided that (i) each party may issue such
press releases or make any such public statements in connection with any dispute between the parties hereto regarding this Agreement without obtaining the other parties'
prior written consent, (ii) the restrictions in this Section 7.7 shall not apply to the receipt and existence of an Acquisition Proposal or a Company communication in
connection with or following a Company Adverse Recommendation Change effected in accordance with Section 7.5.

and material breach" means a material breach or failure to perform that is a consequence of an act or omission undertaken by the breaching party with the Knowledge that

Termination Fee, with the payment of the Termination Fee being made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such bank account as Parent may designate in
writing to the Company in connection with the termination of this Agreement.

(which is subsequently consummated) or shall have consummated any Acquisition Proposal (which, in each case, need not be the same Acquisition Proposal that was made,
disclosed or communicated prior to termination of this Agreement), then, on and subject in all respects to the consummation of such Acquisition Proposal, the Company shall

        (e)   The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 9.2 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and are not a
penalty, and that, without these agreements, Parent and Merger Sub would not enter into this Agreement.

to pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion. Parent and Merger Sub agree that, upon any termination of this Agreement under circumstances where the

before or after approval of the matters presented in connection with the Merger by the Shareholders of the Company, but, after any such approval, no amendment shall be
made which by Law requires further approval by such Shareholders without such further approval. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing
signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto.

        Section 9.4.    Extension; Waiver.     At any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors,

representations and warranties contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto, and (iii) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained
herein. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such party. The
failure of any party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of those rights.

Annex B 

August 19, 2016

The Board of Directors
CIFC LLC
250 Park Avenue
4th Floor
New York, NY 10177

Members of the Board of Directors:

        You have requested our opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of limited liability company interests (each, a "Company Common
Share"), of CIFC LLC (the "Company") of the consideration to be paid to such holders in the proposed merger (the "Transaction") of the Company with a wholly-owned
subsidiary of F.A.B. Holdings I LP (the "Acquiror"). Pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Agreement"), among the Company, the Acquiror and CIFC
ACQUISITION, LLC ("Merger Sub"), the Company will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Acquiror, and each outstanding Company Common Share, other than
(i) Company Common Shares held by the Acquiror, Merger Sub or the Company (as treasury stock or otherwise) or any of their respective direct or indirect wholly owned
subsidiaries (other than shares held by any subsidiary of the Company), (ii) Dissenting Shares and (iii) Rollover Shares (each of the foregoing (ii) and (iii) as defined in the
Agreement), will be converted into the right to receive $11.36 per share in cash (the "Consideration").

        In connection with preparing our opinion, we have (i) reviewed a draft dated August 19, 2016 of the Agreement; (ii) reviewed certain publicly available business and
financial information concerning the Company and the industries in which it operates; (iii) compared the financial and operating performance of the Company with publicly
available information concerning certain other companies we deemed relevant and reviewed the current and historical market prices of the Company Common Shares and
certain publicly traded securities of such other companies; (iv) reviewed certain internal financial analyses and forecasts prepared by the management of the Company
relating to its business; and (v) performed such other financial studies and analyses and considered such other information as we deemed appropriate for the purposes of this
opinion.

        In addition, we have held discussions with certain members of the management of the Company with respect to certain aspects of the Transaction, and the past and
current business operations of the Company, the financial condition and future prospects and operations of the Company, and certain other matters we believed necessary or
appropriate to our inquiry.

        In giving our opinion, we have relied upon and assumed the accuracy and completeness of all information that was publicly available or was furnished to or discussed
with us by the Company or otherwise reviewed by or for us. We have not independently verified any such information or its accuracy or completeness and, pursuant to our
engagement letter with the Company, we did not assume any obligation to undertake any such independent verification. We have not conducted or been provided with any
valuation or appraisal of any assets or liabilities, nor have we evaluated the solvency of the Company or the Acquiror under any state or federal laws relating to bankruptcy,
insolvency or similar matters. In relying on financial analyses and forecasts provided to us or derived therefrom, we have assumed that they have been reasonably prepared
based on assumptions reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments by management as to the expected future results of operations and financial condition of
the Company to which such analyses or forecasts relate. We express no view as to such analyses or forecasts or the assumptions on which they were based. We have

also assumed that the Transaction and the other transactions contemplated by the Agreement will have the tax consequences described in discussions with, and materials
furnished to us by, representatives of the Company, and will be consummated as described in the Agreement , and that the definitive Agreement will not differ in any material
respects from the draft thereof furnished to us. We have also assumed that the representations and warranties made by the Company and the Acquiror in the Agreement and
the related agreements are and will be true and correct in all respects material to our analysis. We are not legal, regulatory or tax experts and have relied on the assessments
made by advisors to the Company with respect to such issues. We have further assumed that all material governmental, regulatory or other consents and approvals necessary
for the consummation of the Transaction will be obtained without any adverse effect on the Company or on the contemplated benefits of the Transaction.

        Our opinion is necessarily based on economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to us as of, the date hereof. It should be
understood that subsequent developments may affect this opinion and that we do not have any obligation to update, revise, or reaffirm this opinion. Our opinion is limited to
the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the Consideration to be paid to the holders of the Company Common Shares in the proposed Transaction and we express no
opinion as to the fairness of any consideration paid in connection with the Transaction to the holders of any other class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of the
Company or as to the underlying decision by the Company to engage in the Transaction. Furthermore, we express no opinion with respect to the amount or nature of any
compensation to any officers, directors, or employees of any party to the Transaction, or any class of such persons relative to the Consideration to be paid to the holders of
the Company Common Shares in the Transaction or with respect to the fairness of any such compensation.

        We have acted as financial advisor to the Company with respect to the proposed Transaction and will receive a fee from the Company for our services, a substantial
portion of which will become payable only if the proposed Transaction is consummated. In addition, the Company has agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities arising
out of our engagement. Please be advised that during the two years preceding the date of this letter, neither we nor our affiliates have had any other material financial
advisory or other material commercial or investment banking relationships with the Company or the Acquiror. In the ordinary course of our businesses, we and our affiliates
may actively trade the debt and equity securities or financial instruments (including derivatives, bank loans or other obligations) of the Company for our own account or for
the accounts of customers and, accordingly, we may at any time hold long or short positions in such securities or other financial instruments.

        On the basis of and subject to the foregoing, it is our opinion as of the date hereof that the consideration to be paid to the holders of the Company Common Shares in the
proposed Transaction is fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.

        The issuance of this opinion has been approved by a fairness opinion committee of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC. This letter is provided to the Board of Directors of the
Company (in its capacity as such) in connection with and for the purposes of its evaluation of the Transaction. This opinion does not constitute a recommendation to any
shareholder of the Company as to how such shareholder should vote with respect to the Transaction or any other matter. This opinion may not be disclosed, referred to, or
communicated (in whole or in part) to any third party for any purpose whatsoever except with our prior written approval. This opinion may be reproduced in full in any
proxy or information statement mailed to shareholders of the Company but may not otherwise be disclosed publicly in any manner without our prior written approval.

Very truly yours,

J.P. MORGAN SECURITIES LLC

Annex C 

Section 262 of the Delaware General Corporation Law 

§ 262. Appraisal rights.

        (a)   Any stockholder of a corporation of this State who holds shares of stock on the date of the making of a demand pursuant to subsection (d) of this section with
respect to such shares, who continuously holds such shares through the effective date of the merger or consolidation, who has otherwise complied with subsection (d) of this
section and who has neither voted in favor of the merger or consolidation nor consented thereto in writing pursuant to § 228 of this title shall be entitled to an appraisal by the
Court of Chancery of the fair value of the stockholder's shares of stock under the circumstances described in subsections (b) and (c) of this section. As used in this section,
the word "stockholder" means a holder of record of stock in a corporation; the words "stock" and "share" mean and include what is ordinarily meant by those words; and the
words "depository receipt" mean a receipt or other instrument issued by a depository representing an interest in 1 or more shares, or fractions thereof, solely of stock of a
corporation, which stock is deposited with the depository.

        (b)   Appraisal rights shall be available for the shares of any class or series of stock of a constituent corporation in a merger or consolidation to be effected pursuant to
§ 251 (other than a merger effected pursuant to § 251(g) of this title and, subject to paragraph (b)(3) of this section, § 251(h) of this title), § 252, § 254, § 255, § 256, § 257,
§ 258, § 263 or § 264 of this title:

        (1)   Provided, however, that, except as expressly provided in § 363(b) of this title, no appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the shares of any
class or series of stock, which stock, or depository receipts in respect thereof, at the record date fixed to determine the stockholders entitled to receive notice of the
meeting of stockholders to act upon the agreement of merger or consolidation, were either: (i) listed on a national securities exchange or (ii) held of record by more
than 2,000 holders; and further provided that no appraisal rights shall be available for any shares of stock of the constituent corporation surviving a merger if the
merger did not require for its approval the vote of the stockholders of the surviving corporation as provided in § 251(f) of this title.

        (2)   Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1) of this section, appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the shares of any class or series of stock of a
constituent corporation if the holders thereof are required by the terms of an agreement of merger or consolidation pursuant to §§ 251, 252, 254, 255, 256, 257, 258,
263 and 264 of this title to accept for such stock anything except:

        a.     Shares of stock of the corporation surviving or resulting from such merger or consolidation, or depository receipts in respect thereof;

        b.     Shares of stock of any other corporation, or depository receipts in respect thereof, which shares of stock (or depository receipts in respect thereof) or
depository receipts at the effective date of the merger or consolidation will be either listed on a national securities exchange or held of record by more than
2,000 holders;

        c.     Cash in lieu of fractional shares or fractional depository receipts described in the foregoing paragraphs (b)(2)a. and b. of this section; or

        d.     Any combination of the shares of stock, depository receipts and cash in lieu of fractional shares or fractional depository receipts described in the
foregoing paragraphs (b)(2)a., b. and c. of this section.

parent immediately prior

to the merger, appraisal rights shall be available for the shares of the subsidiary Delaware corporation.

        (4)   In the event of an amendment to a corporation's certificate of incorporation contemplated by § 363(a) of this title, appraisal rights shall be available as
contemplated by § 363(b) of this title, and the procedures of this section, including those set forth in subsections (d) and (e) of this section, shall apply as nearly as
practicable, with the word "amendment" substituted for the words "merger or consolidation", and the word "corporation" substituted for the words "constituent
corporation" and/or "surviving or resulting corporation".

        (c)   Any corporation may provide in its certificate of incorporation that appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the shares of any class or series of its
stock as a result of an amendment to its certificate of incorporation, any merger or consolidation in which the corporation is a constituent corporation or the sale of all or
substantially all of the assets of the corporation. If the certificate of incorporation contains such a provision, the procedures of this section, including those set forth in
subsections (d) and (e) of this section, shall apply as nearly as is practicable.

        (d)   Appraisal rights shall be perfected as follows:

        (1)   If a proposed merger or consolidation for which appraisal rights are provided under this section is to be submitted for approval at a meeting of stockholders,
the corporation, not less than 20 days prior to the meeting, shall notify each of its stockholders who was such on the record date for notice of such meeting (or such
members who received notice in accordance with §255(c) of this title) with respect to shares for which appraisal rights are available pursuant to subsection (b) or
(c) of this section that appraisal rights are available for any or all of the shares of the constituent corporations, and shall include in such notice a copy of this section
and, if 1 of the constituent corporations is a nonstock corporation, a copy of § 114 of this title. Each stockholder electing to demand the appraisal of such
stockholder's shares shall deliver to the corporation, before the taking of the vote on the merger or consolidation, a written demand for appraisal of such stockholder's
shares. Such demand will be sufficient if it reasonably informs the corporation of the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to demand
the appraisal of such stockholder's shares. A proxy or vote against the merger or consolidation shall not constitute such a demand. A stockholder electing to take such
action must do so by a separate written demand as herein provided. Within 10 days after the effective date of such merger or consolidation, the surviving or resulting
corporation shall notify each stockholder of each constituent corporation who has complied with this subsection and has not voted in favor of or consented to the
merger or consolidation of the date that the merger or consolidation has become effective; or

        (2)   If the merger or consolidation was approved pursuant to § 228, § 251(h), § 253, or § 267 of this title, then either a constituent corporation before the
effective date of the merger or consolidation or the surviving or resulting corporation within 10 days thereafter shall notify each of the holders of any class or series of
stock of such constituent corporation who are entitled to appraisal rights of the approval of the merger or consolidation and that appraisal rights are available for any
or all shares of such class or series of stock of such constituent corporation, and shall include in such notice a copy of this section and, if 1 of the constituent
corporations is a nonstock corporation, a copy of § 114 of this title. Such notice may, and, if given on or after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, shall,
also notify such stockholders of the effective date of the merger or consolidation. Any stockholder entitled to appraisal rights may, within 20 days after the date of
mailing of such notice or, in the case of a merger approved pursuant to § 251(h) of this title, within the later of the consummation of the tender or exchange offer
contemplated by § 251(h) of this title and 20 days after the date of mailing of such notice, demand in writing from the surviving or resulting corporation the appraisal
of such holder's shares. Such

demand will be sufficient if it reasonably informs the corporation of the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to demand the appraisal of
such holder's shares. If such notice did not notify stockholders of the effective date of the merger or consolidation, either (i) each such constituent corporation shall
send a second notice before the effective date of the merger or consolidation notifying each of the holders of any class or series of stock of such constituent
corporation that are entitled to appraisal rights of the effective date of the merger or consolidation or (ii) the surviving or resulting corporation shall send such a
second notice to all such holders on or within 10 days after such effective date; provided, however, that if such second notice is sent more than 20 days following the
sending of the first notice or, in the case of a merger approved pursuant to § 251(h) of this title, later than the later of the consummation of the tender or exchange
offer contemplated by § 251(h) of this title and 20 days following the sending of the first notice, such second notice need only be sent to each stockholder who is
entitled to appraisal rights and who has demanded appraisal of such holder's shares in accordance with this subsection. An affidavit of the secretary or assistant
secretary or of the transfer agent of the corporation that is required to give either notice that such notice has been given shall, in the absence of fraud, be prima facie
evidence of the facts stated therein. For purposes of determining the stockholders entitled to receive either notice, each constituent corporation may fix, in advance, a
record date that shall be not more than 10 days prior to the date the notice is given, provided, that if the notice is given on or after the effective date of the merger or
consolidation, the record date shall be such effective date. If no record date is fixed and the notice is given prior to the effective date, the record date shall be the close
of business on the day next preceding the day on which the notice is given.

        (e)   Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, the surviving or resulting corporation or any stockholder who has complied with
subsections (a) and (d) of this section hereof and who is otherwise entitled to appraisal rights, may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Court of
Chancery demanding a determination of the value of the stock of all such stockholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time within 60 days after the effective date of
the merger or consolidation, any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party shall have the right to withdraw
such stockholder's demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the merger or consolidation. Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or
consolidation, any stockholder who has complied with the requirements of subsections (a) and (d) of this section hereof, upon written request, shall be entitled to receive
from the corporation surviving the merger or resulting from the consolidation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the merger or
consolidation and with respect to which demands for appraisal have been received and the aggregate number of holders of such shares. Such written statement shall be
mailed to the stockholder within 10 days after such stockholder's written request for such a statement is received by the surviving or resulting corporation or within 10 days
after expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal under subsection (d) of this section hereof, whichever is later. Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this
section, a person who is the beneficial owner of shares of such stock held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person may, in such person's own name,
file a petition or request from the corporation the statement described in this subsection.

        (f)    Upon the filing of any such petition by a stockholder, service of a copy thereof shall be made upon the surviving or resulting corporation, which shall within
20 days after such service file in the office of the Register in Chancery in which the petition was filed a duly verified list containing the names and addresses of all
stockholders who have demanded payment for their shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares have not been reached by the surviving or resulting
corporation. If the petition shall be filed by the surviving or resulting corporation, the petition shall be accompanied by such a duly verified list. The Register in Chancery, if
so ordered by the Court, shall give notice of the time and place fixed for the hearing of such petition by registered or certified mail to

the surviving or resulting corporation and to the stockholders shown on the list at the addresses therein stated. Such notice shall also be given by 1 or more publications at
least 1 week before the day of the hearing, in a newspaper of general circulation published in the City of Wilmington, Delaware or such publication as the Court deems
advisable. The forms of the notices by mail and by publication shall be approved by the Court, and the costs thereof shall be borne by the surviving or resulting corporation.

        (g)   At the hearing on such petition, the Court shall determine the stockholders who have complied with this section and who have become entitled to appraisal rights.
The Court may require the stockholders who have demanded an appraisal for their shares and who hold stock represented by certificates to submit their certificates of stock
to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings; and if any stockholder fails to comply with such direction, the Court may
dismiss the proceedings as to such stockholder.

        (h)   After the Court determines the stockholders entitled to an appraisal, the appraisal proceeding shall be conducted in accordance with the rules of the Court of
Chancery, including any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings. Through such proceeding the Court shall determine the fair value of the shares exclusive of any
element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger or consolidation, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be
the fair value. In determining such fair value, the Court shall take into account all relevant factors. Unless the Court in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause
shown, interest from the effective date of the merger through the date of payment of the judgment shall be compounded quarterly and shall accrue at 5% over the Federal
Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the effective date of the merger and the date of payment of the
judgment. Upon application by the surviving or resulting corporation or by any stockholder entitled to participate in the appraisal proceeding, the Court may, in its discretion,
proceed to trial upon the appraisal prior to the final determination of the stockholders entitled to an appraisal. Any stockholder whose name appears on the list filed by the
surviving or resulting corporation pursuant to subsection (f) of this section and who has submitted such stockholder's certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery, if such
is required, may participate fully in all proceedings until it is finally determined that such stockholder is not entitled to appraisal rights under this section.

        (i)    The Court shall direct the payment of the fair value of the shares, together with interest, if any, by the surviving or resulting corporation to the stockholders entitled
thereto. Payment shall be so made to each such stockholder, in the case of holders of uncertificated stock forthwith, and the case of holders of shares represented by
certificates upon the surrender to the corporation of the certificates representing such stock. The Court's decree may be enforced as other decrees in the Court of Chancery
may be enforced, whether such surviving or resulting corporation be a corporation of this State or of any state.

        (j)    The costs of the proceeding may be determined by the Court and taxed upon the parties as the Court deems equitable in the circumstances. Upon application of a
stockholder, the Court may order all or a portion of the expenses incurred by any stockholder in connection with the appraisal proceeding, including, without limitation,
reasonable attorney's fees and the fees and expenses of experts, to be charged pro rata against the value of all the shares entitled to an appraisal.

        (k)   From and after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, no stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights as provided in subsection (d) of this section
shall be entitled to vote such stock for any purpose or to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on the stock (except dividends or other distributions payable to
stockholders of record at a date which is prior to the effective date of the merger or consolidation); provided, however, that if no petition for an appraisal shall be filed within
the time provided in subsection (e) of this section, or if such stockholder shall deliver to the surviving or resulting corporation a written withdrawal of such stockholder's
demand for

an appraisal and an acceptance of the merger or consolidation, either within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation as provided in subsection (e) of
this section or thereafter with the written approval of the corporation, then the right of such stockholder to an appraisal shall cease. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no
appraisal proceeding in the Court of Chancery shall be dismissed as to any stockholder without the approval of the Court, and such approval may be conditioned upon such
terms as the Court deems just; provided, however that this provision shall not affect the right of any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined
that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such stockholder's demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the merger or consolidation within 60 days after
the effective date of the merger or consolidation, as set forth in subsection (e) of this section.

        (l)    The shares of the surviving or resulting corporation to which the shares of such objecting stockholders would have been converted had they assented to the merger
or consolidation shall have the status of authorized and unissued shares of the surviving or resulting corporation.

All decisions and interpretations of the Administrator shall be final, conclusive and binding on all persons and entities, including the Company, the Subsidiaries, Grantees,

        (c)    Delegation of Authority to Grant Options.     Subject to applicable law, the Administrator, in its discretion, may delegate to any one or more executive officers of

Options that may be granted during the period of the delegation and shall contain guidelines as to the determination of the exercise price and the vesting criteria. The
Administrator may revoke the delegation or amend the terms of a delegation at any time but such action shall not invalidate any prior actions of the Administrator's delegate
or delegates that were consistent with the terms of such delegation. Any delegation pursuant to this Section 2(c) shall automatically terminate, without any additional action
by the Administrator, at such time as the executive officer(s) of the Company cease(s) to serve as executive officer(s). Any action undertaken by any executive officer(s) in
accordance with the Administrator's delegation of authority pursuant to this Section 2(c) shall have the same force and effect as if undertaken directly by the Administrator.

        (d)    Award Certificate.     Awards under the Plan shall be evidenced by Award Certificates that set forth the terms, conditions and limitations for each Award which may
include, without limitation, the term of an Award and the provisions applicable in the event employment or service terminates.

        (e)    Indemnification.     Neither the Board nor the Administrator, nor any member of either or any delegate thereof, shall be liable for any act, omission, interpretation,
construction or determination made in good faith in connection with the Plan or any Award, and the members of the Board and the Administrator (and any delegate thereof)
shall be entitled in all cases to indemnification and reimbursement by the Company in respect of any claim, loss, damage or expense (including, without limitation,
reasonable attorneys' fees) arising or resulting therefrom to the fullest extent permitted by law and/or under the Company's limited liability company agreement or any
directors' and officers' liability insurance coverage which may be in effect from time to time and/or any indemnification agreement between such individual and the
Company.

        (f)    Foreign Award Recipients.     Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, in order to comply with the laws in other countries in which the Company
and its Subsidiaries operate or have employees or other individuals eligible for Awards, the Administrator, in its sole discretion, shall have the power and authority to:
(i) determine which Subsidiaries shall be covered by the Plan; (ii) determine which individuals outside the United States are eligible to participate in the Plan; (iii) modify the
terms and conditions of any Award granted to individuals outside the United States to comply with applicable foreign laws; (iv) establish subplans and modify exercise
procedures and other terms and procedures, to the extent the Administrator determines such actions to be necessary or advisable (and such subplans and/or modifications
shall be attached to this Plan as appendices); provided, however, that no such subplans and/or modifications shall increase the share limitations contained in Section 3(a)
hereof; and (v) take any action, before or after an Award is made, that the Administrator determines to be necessary or advisable to obtain approval or comply with any local
governmental regulatory exemptions or approvals. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Administrator may not take any actions hereunder, and no Awards shall be granted,
that would violate the Exchange Act or any other applicable United States securities law, the Code, or any other applicable United States governing statute or law.

SECTION 3. SHARES ISSUABLE UNDER THE PLAN; MERGERS; SUBSTITUTION

        (a)    Shares Issuable.     The maximum number of Shares reserved and available for issuance under the Plan shall be 8,181,929 Shares, subject to adjustment as
provided in this Section 3 (which includes Shares issued in respect of awards granted under the Prior Plan). For purposes of this limitation, the Shares underlying any Awards
or any awards granted under the Prior Plan that are forfeited, canceled, held back upon exercise or settlement of an Award or an award under the Prior Plan (as applicable) to
cover the exercise price or tax withholding, reacquired by the Company prior to vesting, satisfied without the issuance of Shares or otherwise terminated (other than by
exercise) shall be added back to the Shares available for issuance under the Plan. Subject to such overall limitations, Shares may be issued up to such maximum number
pursuant to any type or types of Award; provided, however, that Options or Share Appreciation Rights with respect to no more than 8,181,929 Shares may be granted to any
one individual Grantee during any one calendar year period. The Shares available for issuance under the Plan may be authorized but unissued Shares or Shares reacquired by
the Company.

        (b)    Changes in Shares.     Subject to Section 3(c) hereof, in the event of any corporate event or transaction involving the Company or a Subsidiary such as a merger,
consolidation, reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, share dividend, share split, reverse share split, exchange of shares, spinoff, extraordinary cash dividend
designated as such by the Board (but in all cases, excluding any ordinary cash dividend or distribution or tax distribution) or other similar change in capital structure or
similar corporate event or transaction, the Administrator shall, to prevent dilution or enlargement of Participant's rights under the Plan, in its sole discretion, make an
appropriate or proportionate adjustment in (i) the maximum number and kind of Shares or other securities reserved for issuance under the Plan, (ii) the maximum number of
Shares subject to Options or Share Appreciation Rights that can be granted to any one individual Grantee (as set forth in Section 3(a)) and the maximum number of Shares
that may be granted under a Performance-Based Award (as set forth in Section 12(d)), (iii) the number and kind of Shares or other securities subject to any then-outstanding
Awards under the Plan, (iv) the purchase price, if any, per Share relating to any Award and the repurchase price, if any, per Share relating to each outstanding Restricted
Share Award, and (v) the exercise price for each Share subject to any then-outstanding Option or Share Appreciation Right under the Plan; provided, however, that no
adjustment shall be made under this Section 3(b) that would adversely affect the status of any Award that is intended to qualify as "qualified performance-based
compensation" under Section 162(m) of the Code. The adjustment by the Administrator shall be final, binding and conclusive. No fractional Shares shall be issued under the
Plan resulting from any such adjustment, but the Administrator in its discretion may make a cash payment in lieu of fractional Shares.

        (c)    Sale Event.     Upon the occurrence of a Sale Event after the Effective Date, unless otherwise specifically prohibited under applicable laws or by the rules and
regulations of any governing governmental agencies or national securities exchanges, or unless the Administrator shall determine otherwise in the Award Certificate, and in
all events, to the extent permitted by Section 409A (if applicable), the Administrator is authorized (but not obligated) to make adjustments in the terms and conditions of
outstanding Awards, including without limitation the following (or any combination thereof): (i) continuation or assumption of such outstanding Awards under the Plan by
the Company (if it is the surviving company or corporation) or by the surviving company or corporation or acquiror or a parent of any of the foregoing; (ii) substitution by
the surviving company or corporation or acquiror or a parent of any of the foregoing of awards with substantially the same terms for outstanding Awards (excluding the
consideration payable upon settlement of the Awards); (iii) accelerated exercisability, vesting and/or lapse of restrictions under outstanding Awards immediately prior to the
occurrence of such Sale Event; (iv) upon written notice, providing that any outstanding Awards must be exercised, to the extent then exercisable, during a reasonable period
of time immediately prior to the scheduled consummation of the Sale Event or such other period as determined by the Administrator (contingent

upon the consummation of the event), and at the end of such period, such Awards shall terminate to the extent not so exercised within the relevant period; (v) cancellation of
all or any portion of outstanding Awards for fair value (in the form of cash, shares, other property or any combination thereof) as determined in the sole discretion of the
Administrator and which value may be zero, provided, that, in the case of Options and Share Appreciation Rights or similar Awards, the Administrator may determine that
fair value may equal the excess, if any, of the value of the consideration to be paid in the Sale Event transaction to holders of the same number of Shares subject to such
Awards (or, if no such consideration is paid, Fair Market Value of the Shares subject to such outstanding Awards or portion thereof being canceled) over the aggregate
exercise price, with respect to such Awards or portion thereof being canceled, or if no such excess, zero; (vi) cancellation of all or any portion of outstanding unvested and/or
unexercisable Awards for no consideration; and (vii) termination of any Awards if the applicable Performance Goals have not been satisfied as of (and after giving effect to)
the Sale Event. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything contained herein to the contrary, no discretionary action may be taken with respect to an Award that is subject to
Section 409A that violates Section 409A, and the Award Certificate evidencing such Award shall specify the impact of a Sale Event on such Award.

        (d)    Substitute Awards.     The Administrator may grant Awards under the Plan in substitution for share and share-based awards held by employees, directors,
consultants or other key persons that were granted by another company in connection with the merger or consolidation of such company with the Company or a Subsidiary or
the acquisition by the Company or a Subsidiary of property or stock of such company. The Administrator may direct that the substitute awards be granted on such terms and
conditions as the Administrator considers appropriate in the circumstances. Any substitute Awards granted under the Plan shall not count against the share limitation set forth
in Section 3(a).

SECTION 4. ELIGIBILITY

        Grantees under the Plan will be such full- or part-time officers and other employees, Directors and Consultants providing services to the Company and/or its
Subsidiaries as are selected from time to time by the Administrator in its sole discretion.

SECTION 5. SHARE OPTIONS

        Any Share Option granted under the Plan shall be in such form as the Administrator may from time to time approve. Share Options granted under the Plan are non-
qualified Share Options.

        Share Options granted pursuant to this Section 5 shall be subject to the following terms and conditions and shall contain such additional terms and conditions, not
inconsistent with the terms of the Plan, as the Administrator shall deem desirable.

        (a)    Exercise Price.     The exercise price per Share covered by a Share Option granted pursuant to this Section 5 shall be determined by the Administrator at the time of
grant but shall not be less than one hundred percent (100%) of the Fair Market Value on the date of grant.

        (b)    Option Term.     The term of each Share Option shall be fixed by the Administrator, but no Share Option shall be exercisable more than ten (10) years after the date
the Share Option is granted.

        (c)    Exercisability; Rights of a Shareholder.     Share Options shall become exercisable at such time or times, whether or not in installments, as shall be determined by
the Administrator at or after the grant date. The Administrator may at any time accelerate the exercisability of all or any portion of any Share Option. A Grantee shall have
the rights of a shareholder only as to shares acquired upon the exercise of a Share Option (and only from and after such exercise) and not as to unexercised Share Options.

        (d)    Method of Exercise.     Share Options may be exercised in whole or in part, by giving written or electronic notice of exercise, in accordance with procedures set
forth by the Administrator, to the

Company, specifying the number of shares to be purchased. Payment of the purchase price may be made by one or more of the following methods to the extent provided in
the Award Certificate:

          (i)  in cash, by certified or bank check or other instrument acceptable to the Administrator;

         (ii)  through the delivery (or attestation to the ownership) of Shares that are owned by the Grantee and that are not then subject to restrictions under any
Company plan, which surrendered Shares shall be valued at Fair Market Value on the exercise date;

        (iii)  by the Grantee delivering to the Company a properly executed exercise notice together with irrevocable instructions to a broker to promptly deliver to the
Company cash or a check payable and acceptable to the Company for the purchase price; provided, that in the event the Grantee chooses to pay the purchase price as
so provided, the Grantee and the broker shall comply with such procedures and enter into such agreements of indemnity and other agreements as the Administrator
shall prescribe as a condition of such payment procedure;

        (iv)  by a "net exercise" arrangement pursuant to which the Company will reduce the number of Shares issuable upon exercise by the largest whole number of
Shares with a Fair Market Value that does not exceed the aggregate exercise price; or

         (v)  such other method as may be permitted by the Administrator.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Grantee who is subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act may direct the Company to reduce the number of Shares issuable upon
exercise of his or her Share Option by the number of Shares having a Fair Market Value on the date of exercise equal to the exercise price of the portion of the Share Option
then being exercised.

        Payment instruments will be received subject to collection. The transfer to the Grantee on the records of the Company or of the transfer agent of the Shares to be
purchased pursuant to the exercise of a Share Option will be contingent upon receipt from the Grantee (or a purchaser acting in his or her stead in accordance with the
provisions of the Share Option) by the Company of the full purchase price for such Shares and the fulfillment of any other requirements contained in the Award Certificate or
applicable provisions of laws (including the satisfaction of any withholding taxes that the Company or a Subsidiary is obligated to withhold with respect to the Grantee). In
the event a Grantee chooses to pay the purchase price by previously-owned Shares through the attestation method, the number of Shares transferred to the Grantee upon the
exercise of the Share Option shall be net of the number of attested Shares having a Fair Market Value on the exercise date equal to the aggregate exercise price of the portion
of the Option being so exercised. In the event that the Company establishes, for itself or using the services of a third party, an automated system for the exercise of Share
Options, such as a system using an internet website or interactive voice response, then the paperless exercise of Share Options may be permitted through the use of such an
automated system.

        Except as may otherwise be provided by the Administrator either in the Award Certificate or, subject to Section 18 below, in writing after the Award is issued, any Share
Options that have not vested shall automatically terminate and be forfeited upon the termination of the Grantee's employment (or other service relationship) with the
Company and its Subsidiaries with no compensation or payment due to the Grantee, and any Share Options that have vested as of such termination shall remain exercisable
by the Grantee or the Grantee's beneficiary or legal representative (as applicable) for a period set forth in the Award Certificate.

SECTION 6. SHARE APPRECIATION RIGHTS

        (a)    Exercise Price of Share Appreciation Rights.     The exercise price of a Share Appreciation Right shall not be less than one hundred percent (100%) of the Fair
Market Value of a Share on the date of grant.

        (b)    Grant and Exercise of Share Appreciation Rights.     Share Appreciation Rights may be granted by the Administrator independently of any Share Option granted
pursuant to Section 5 of the Plan.

        (c)    Terms and Conditions of Share Appreciation Rights.     Share Appreciation Rights shall be subject to such terms and conditions as shall be determined from time to
time by the Administrator. The term of a Share Appreciation Right may not exceed ten (10) years. Except as may otherwise be provided by the Administrator either in the
Award Certificate or, subject to Section 18 below, in writing after the Award is issued, any Share Appreciation Rights that have not vested shall automatically terminate and
be forfeited upon the termination of the Grantee's employment (or other service relationship) with the Company and its Subsidiaries with no compensation or payment due to
the Grantee, and any Share Appreciation Rights that have vested as of such termination shall remain exercisable by the Grantee or the Grantee's beneficiary or legal
representative (as applicable) for a period set forth in the Award Certificate.

SECTION 7. RESTRICTED SHARE AWARDS

        (a)    Nature of Restricted Share Awards.     The Administrator shall determine the restrictions and conditions applicable to each Restricted Share Award at the time of
grant. Conditions may be based on continuing employment (or other service relationship) and/or achievement of pre-established performance goals and objectives. The terms
and conditions of each such Award Certificate shall be determined by the Administrator, and such terms and conditions may differ among individual Awards and Grantees.

        (b)    Rights as a Shareholder.     Unless the Administrator shall otherwise determine, upon the grant of the Restricted Share Award and payment of any applicable
purchase price, a Grantee shall have the rights of a shareholder with respect to dividends and the voting of the Restricted Share, subject to such conditions contained in the
Award Certificate (provided that any dividends and distributions paid on the Restricted Share Awards that vest based on the achievement of performance goals shall become
vested and paid only if the relevant performance goals are achieved (other than any portion of such dividends or distributions that is a tax distribution)). Unless the
Administrator shall otherwise determine, (i) uncertificated Restricted Shares shall be accompanied by a notation on the records of the Company or the transfer agent to the
effect that they are subject to forfeiture until such Restricted Shares are vested as provided in Section 7(d) below, and (ii) certificated Restricted Shares shall remain in the
possession of the Company until such Restricted Shares are vested as provided in Section 7(d) below, and the Grantee shall be required, as a condition of the grant, to deliver
to the Company such instruments of transfer as the Administrator may prescribe.

        (c)    Restrictions.     A Restricted Share may not be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise encumbered or disposed of except as specifically provided herein
or in the Restricted Share Award Certificate. Except as may otherwise be provided by the Administrator either in the Award Certificate or, subject to Section 18 below, in
writing after the Award is issued, if a Grantee's employment (or other service relationship) with the Company and its Subsidiaries terminates for any reason, any Restricted
Share that has not vested at the time of termination shall automatically and without any requirement of notice to such Grantee from, or other action by or on behalf of, the
Company be deemed to have been reacquired by the Company at its original purchase price (if any) from such Grantee or such Grantee's legal representative simultaneously
with such termination of employment (or other service relationship), and thereafter shall cease to represent any ownership of the Company by the Grantee or rights of the
Grantee as a shareholder. Following such deemed reacquisition of unvested Restricted Shares that are represented by physical certificates, a Grantee shall surrender such
certificates to the Company upon request without consideration.

        (d)    Vesting of Restricted Shares.     The Administrator at the time of grant shall specify the date or dates and/or the attainment of pre-established performance goals,
objectives and other conditions on

which the vesting conditions and/or non-transferability of the Restricted Share and the Company's right of repurchase or forfeiture shall lapse. Subsequent to such date or
dates and/or the attainment of such pre-established performance goals, objectives and other conditions, the shares on which all restrictions have lapsed shall no longer be
Restricted Shares and shall be deemed "vested."

SECTION 8. RESTRICTED SHARE UNITS

        (a)    Nature of Restricted Share Units.     The Administrator shall determine the restrictions and conditions applicable to each Restricted Share Unit at the time of grant.
Conditions may be based on continuing employment (or other service relationship) and/or achievement of pre-established performance goals and objectives. The terms and
conditions of each such Award Certificate shall be determined by the Administrator, and such terms and conditions may differ among individual Awards and Grantees. At the
end of the deferral period, the Restricted Share Units, to the extent vested, shall be settled in the form of Shares or cash, as determined by the Administrator. To the extent
that an award of Restricted Share Units is subject to Section 409A, it may contain such additional terms and conditions as the Administrator shall determine in its sole
discretion in order for such Award to comply with the requirements of Section 409A.

        (b)    Election to Receive Restricted Share Units in Lieu of Compensation.     The Administrator may, in its sole discretion, permit a Grantee to elect to receive a portion
of future cash compensation otherwise due to such Grantee in the form of an award of Restricted Share Units. Any such election shall be made in writing and shall be
delivered to the Company no later than the date specified by the Administrator and in accordance with Section 409A and such other rules and procedures established by the
Administrator. Any such future cash compensation that the Grantee elects to defer shall be converted to a fixed number of Restricted Share Units based on the Fair Market
Value of a Share on the date the compensation would otherwise have been paid to the Grantee if such payment had not been deferred as provided herein. The Administrator
shall have the sole right to determine whether and under what circumstances to permit such elections and to impose such limitations and other terms and conditions thereon
as the Administrator deems appropriate. Any Restricted Share Units that are elected to be received in lieu of cash compensation shall be fully vested, unless otherwise
provided in the Award Certificate.

        (c)    Rights as a Shareholder.     A Grantee shall have the rights as a shareholder only as to Shares acquired by the Grantee upon settlement of Restricted Share Units
(and only from and after the date of such acquisition); provided, however, that the Grantee may be credited with Dividend Equivalent Rights with respect to the phantom
share units underlying his or her Restricted Share Units, subject to such terms and conditions as the Administrator may determine (provided that any such Dividend
Equivalent Rights relating to the Restricted Share Units that vest based on the achievement of performance goals shall be paid only if the relevant performance goals are
achieved).

        (d)    Termination.     Except as may otherwise be provided by the Administrator either in the Award Certificate or, subject to Section 18 below, in writing after the
Award is issued, a Grantee's right in all Restricted Share Units that have not vested shall automatically terminate upon the termination of the Grantee's employment (or
cessation of service relationship) with the Company and its Subsidiaries for any reason.

SECTION 9. UNRESTRICTED SHARE AWARDS

        (a)    Grant or Sale of Unrestricted Share Awards.     The Administrator may, in its sole discretion, grant (or sell at such purchase price determined by the Administrator)
an Unrestricted Share Award under the Plan. Unrestricted Share Awards may be granted in respect of past services or other valid consideration, or in lieu of cash
compensation due to such Grantee, in all events, in accordance with

Section 409A (to the extent applicable) and subject to such terms and conditions as the Administrator may establish.

SECTION 10. CASH-BASED AWARDS

        (a)    Grant of Cash-Based Awards.     The Administrator may, in its sole discretion, grant Cash-Based Awards to any Grantee in such number or amount and upon such
terms, and subject to such conditions, as the Administrator shall determine at the time of grant. The Administrator shall determine the maximum duration of the Cash-Based
Award, the amount of cash to which the Cash-Based Award pertains, the conditions upon which the Cash-Based Award shall become vested or payable, and such other
provisions as the Administrator shall determine. Each Cash-Based Award shall specify a cash-denominated payment amount, formula or payment ranges as determined by
the Administrator. Payment, if any, with respect to a Cash-Based Award shall be made in accordance with the terms of the Award and may be made in cash or in Shares, as
the Administrator determines.

SECTION 11. PERFORMANCE SHARE AWARDS

        (a)    Nature of Performance Share Awards.     The Administrator may, in its sole discretion, grant Performance Share Awards independent of, or in connection with, the
granting of any other Award under the Plan. The Administrator shall determine whether and to whom Performance Share Awards shall be granted, the Performance Goals,
the periods during which performance is to be measured, and such other limitations and conditions as the Administrator shall determine.

        (b)    Rights as a Shareholder.     A Grantee receiving a Performance Share Award shall have the rights of a shareholder only as to Shares actually received by the
Grantee under the Plan (and only from and after such receipt) and not with respect to Shares subject to the Award but not actually received by the Grantee; provided,
however, that the Grantee may be credited with Dividend Equivalent Rights with respect to the Shares underlying his or her Performance Share Award, subject to such terms
and conditions as the Administrator may determine (provided that any such Dividend Equivalent Rights shall be paid only if the relevant Performance Share Award becomes
earned and vested). A Grantee shall be entitled to receive Shares under a Performance Share Award only upon satisfaction of all conditions specified in the applicable Award
Certificate (or in a performance plan adopted by the Administrator).

        (c)    Termination.     Except as may otherwise be provided by the Administrator either in the Award Certificate or, subject to Section 18 below, in writing after the
Award is issued, a Grantee's rights in all Performance Share Awards shall automatically terminate upon the termination of the Grantee's employment (or cessation of service
relationship) with the Company and its Subsidiaries for any reason.

SECTION 12. PERFORMANCE-BASED AWARDS TO COVERED EMPLOYEES

        (a)    Performance-Based Awards.     Any Covered Employee providing services to the Company or one of its Subsidiaries and who is selected by the Administrator may
be granted one or more Performance-Based Awards payable upon the attainment of Performance Goals that are established by the Administrator and relate to one or more of
the Performance Criteria, in each case on a specified date or dates or over any period or periods determined by the Administrator. The Administrator shall define in an
objective fashion the manner of calculating the Performance Criteria it selects to use for any Performance Cycle. The Administrator, in its discretion, may adjust or modify
the calculation of Performance Goals for such Performance Cycle in order to prevent the dilution or enlargement of the rights of an individual (i) in the event of, or in
anticipation of, any unusual or extraordinary corporate item, transaction, event or development, (ii) in recognition of, or in anticipation of, any other unusual or nonrecurring
events affecting the Company, or the financial statements of the Company, or (iii) in response to, or in anticipation of, changes in applicable laws, regulations, accounting
principles, or

business conditions; provided, however, that the Administrator may not exercise such discretion in a manner that would increase the Performance-Based Award granted to a
Covered Employee (unless the Administrator provided for such adjustment at the time the Performance-Based Award was granted and such adjustment is permitted by
Section 162(m) of the Code). Each Performance-Based Award shall comply with the provisions set forth below. Each provision of the Plan and each Award Certificate
relating to Performance-Based Awards shall be construed so that each such Award shall be "qualified performance-based compensation" within the meaning of
Section 162(m) of the Code and related regulations, and any provisions that cannot be so construed shall be disregarded.

        (b)    Grant of Performance-Based Awards.     With respect to each Performance-Based Award granted to a Covered Employee, the Administrator shall select, within the
first ninety (90) days of a Performance Cycle (or, if shorter, within the maximum period allowed under Section 162(m) of the Code) the Performance Criteria for such grant,
and the Performance Goals with respect to each Performance Criterion (including a threshold level of performance below which no amount will become payable with respect
to such Award). Each Performance-Based Award will specify the amount payable, or the formula for determining the amount payable, upon achievement of the various
applicable performance targets. The Performance Criteria established by the Administrator may be (but need not be) different for each Performance Cycle and different
Performance Goals may be applicable to Performance-Based Awards to different Covered Employees.

        (c)    Payment of Performance-Based Awards.     Following the completion of a Performance Cycle, the Administrator shall meet to review and certify in writing
whether, and to what extent, the Performance Goals for the Performance Cycle have been achieved and, if so, to also calculate and certify in writing the amount of the
Performance-Based Awards earned for the Performance Cycle. The Administrator shall then determine the actual size of each Covered Employee's Performance-Based
Award, and, in doing so, may reduce or eliminate the amount of the Performance-Based Award for a Covered Employee if, in its sole judgment, such reduction or elimination
is appropriate.

        (d)    Maximum Award.     The maximum amount of Performance-Based Awards that may be granted to any one Covered Employee under the Plan in any calendar year
is 843,976 Shares (subject to adjustment as provided in Section 3(b) hereof) or $5,000,000 in the case of a Performance-Based Award that is a Cash-Based Award.

        (e)    Termination.     Except as may otherwise be provided by the Administrator either in the Award Certificate or, subject to Section 18 below, in writing after the
Award is issued, a Grantee's rights in all Performance-Based Awards shall automatically terminate upon the termination of the Grantee's employment (or cessation of service
relationship) with the Company and its Subsidiaries for any reason.

        (f)    Miscellaneous.     For the avoidance of doubt, Covered Employees may be granted Awards that are not Performance-Based Awards (including, without limitation,
Restricted Share Awards, Restricted Share Unit Awards, Performance Share Awards and Cash-Based Awards).

SECTION 13. DIVIDEND EQUIVALENT RIGHTS

        (a)    Dividend Equivalent Rights.     A Dividend Equivalent Right may be granted hereunder to any Grantee as a component of an award of Restricted Share Units or
Performance Share Award or as a freestanding award. The terms and conditions of Dividend Equivalent Rights shall be specified in the Award Certificate. Dividend
equivalents credited to the holder of a Dividend Equivalent Right may be paid currently or on a deferred basis. Any reinvestment shall be at Fair Market Value on the date of
reinvestment or such other price as may then apply under a dividend reinvestment plan sponsored by the Company, if any. Dividend Equivalent Rights may be settled in cash
or Shares or a combination thereof, in a single installment or installments. A Dividend Equivalent Right granted as a component of an award of Restricted Share Units or a
Performance Share Award may provide that such Dividend Equivalent Right shall be settled upon settlement or payment of, or lapse of restrictions on, such other

Award, and that such Dividend Equivalent Right shall expire or be forfeited or annulled under the same conditions as such other Award. A Dividend Equivalent Right
granted as a component of an award of Restricted Share Units or a Performance Share Award may also contain terms and conditions different from such other Award.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Dividend Equivalent Right granted as a component of an award of Restricted Share Units that vests based on the achievement of
performance goals (or as a component of a Performance Share Award) shall be paid only if the relevant performance goals are achieved.

        (b)    Termination.     Except as may otherwise be provided by the Administrator either in the Award Certificate or, subject to Section 18 below, in writing after the
Award is issued, a Grantee's rights in all Dividend Equivalent Rights or interest equivalents granted as a component of an award of Restricted Share Units or a Performance
Share Award that have not vested shall automatically terminate upon the termination of the Grantee's employment (or cessation of service relationship) with the Company
and its Subsidiaries for any reason.

SECTION 14. TRANSFERABILITY OF AWARDS

        (a)    Transferability.     Except as provided in Section 14(b) below, during a Grantee's lifetime, his or her Awards shall be exercisable only by the Grantee, or by the
Grantee's legal representative or guardian in the event of the Grantee's incapacity. No Awards shall be sold, assigned, transferred or otherwise encumbered or disposed of
(other than to the Company or a Subsidiary) by a Grantee other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution or pursuant to a domestic relations order. No Awards
shall be subject, in whole or in part, to attachment, execution, or levy of any kind, and any purported transfer in violation hereof shall be null and void. This Section 14(a)
shall not apply to an Award of Unrestricted Shares unless otherwise explicitly provided in the Award Certificate.

        (b)    Administrator Action.     Notwithstanding Section 14(a), the Administrator, in its discretion, may provide either in the Award Certificate regarding a given Award
or by subsequent written approval that the Grantee (who is an employee or Director) may transfer his or her Awards of Share Options, Share Appreciation Rights or
Restricted Share Awards to his or her immediate family members, to trusts for the benefit of such family members, or to partnerships in which such family members are the
only partners; provided, that the transferee agrees in writing with the Company to be bound by all of the terms and conditions of this Plan and the applicable Award
Certificate. In no event may an Award be transferred by a Grantee for value.

        (c)    Family Member.     For purposes of Section 14(b), "family member" shall mean a Grantee's child, stepchild, grandchild, parent, stepparent, grandparent, spouse,
former spouse, sibling, niece, nephew, mother-in-law, father-in-law, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, brother-in-law, or sister-in-law, including adoptive relationships, a trust in
which these persons (or the Grantee) have more than fifty percent (50%) of the beneficial interest, a foundation in which these persons (or the Grantee) control the
management of assets, and any other entity in which these persons (or the Grantee) own more than fifty percent (50%) of the voting interests.

        (d)    Designation of Beneficiary.     Each Grantee to whom an Award has been granted under the Plan may designate a beneficiary or beneficiaries to exercise any
Award or receive any payment under any Award payable on or after the Grantee's death. Any such designation shall be on a form provided for that purpose by the
Administrator and shall not be effective until received by the Administrator. If no beneficiary has been designated by a deceased Grantee, or if the designated beneficiaries
have predeceased the Grantee, the beneficiary shall be the Grantee's estate. A beneficiary, guardian, legal representative or other person claiming any rights under the Plan
from or through any Grantee shall be subject to all terms and conditions of the Plan and the applicable Award Certificate, except as otherwise determined by the
Administrator, and to any additional restrictions deemed necessary or appropriate by the Administrator.

SECTION 15. TAX WITHHOLDING

        (a)    Payment by Grantee.     Each Grantee shall, no later than the date as of which the value of an Award or of any Share or other amounts received thereunder first
becomes includable in the gross income of the Grantee for Federal income tax purposes, pay to the Company (or a Subsidiary), or make arrangements satisfactory to the
Administrator regarding payment of, any Federal, state and local taxes of any kind required by law to be withheld by the Company or a Subsidiary with respect to such
income. The Company and its Subsidiaries shall, to the extent permitted by law, have the right to deduct any such taxes from any payment of any kind otherwise due to the
Grantee and to take such other action as the Administrator may deem advisable to enable the Company, the Subsidiaries and Grantees to satisfy obligations for the payment
of withholding taxes and other tax obligations relating to any Award. The Company's obligation to deliver evidence of book entry (or share certificates) to any Grantee is
subject to and conditioned on tax withholding obligations being satisfied by the Grantee.

        (b)    Payment in Shares.     Subject to approval by the Administrator, a Grantee may elect to have the minimum required tax withholding obligation satisfied, in whole
or in part, by authorizing the Company to withhold from Shares to be issued pursuant to any Award a number of Shares with an aggregate Fair Market Value (as of the date
the withholding is effected) that would satisfy the minimum withholding amount due; provided, however, that, any Grantee who is subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act
may direct the Company to so withhold from Shares to be issued pursuant to any Award without the Administrator's approval.

SECTION 16. SECTION 409A AWARDS

        (a)    General.     The Company intends that the Plan and all Awards be construed to avoid the imposition of additional taxes, interest, and penalties pursuant to
Section 409A. Notwithstanding the Company's intention, in the event any Award is subject to such additional taxes, interest or penalties pursuant to Section 409A, the
Administrator may, in its sole discretion and without a Grantee's prior consent, amend the Plan and/or Awards, adopt policies and procedures, or take any other actions
(including amendments, policies, procedures and actions with retroactive effect) as are necessary or appropriate to (i) exempt the Plan and/or any Award from the application
of Section 409A, (ii) preserve the intended tax treatment of any such Award, or (iii) comply with the requirements of Section 409A, including without limitation any such
regulations, guidance, compliance programs, and other interpretative authority that may be issued after the date of the grant.

        (b)    Specified Employees.     To the extent that any Award is determined to constitute "nonqualified deferred compensation" within the meaning of Section 409A (a
"409A Award"), the Award shall be subject to such additional rules and requirements as specified by the Administrator from time to time in order to comply with
Section 409A. In this regard, if any amount under a 409A Award becomes payable due to the Grantee's "separation from service" (within the meaning of Section 409A) to a
Grantee who is then considered a "specified employee" (within the meaning of Section 409A), then any payment that otherwise would have been made on or prior to the date
that is six months following such separation from service shall be withheld and paid in a lump sum on the earlier of (i) the date that is six (6) months and one (1) day after the
Grantee's separation from service or (ii) within ten (10) days after the date of the Grantee's death (but no earlier than the payment was otherwise scheduled to be made), but
only to the extent such delay is necessary to prevent such payment from being subject to interest, penalties and/or additional tax imposed pursuant to Section 409A (with all
other payments to be made as if no such delay had occurred). Further, the settlement or vesting of any 409A Award may not be accelerated except to the extent permitted by
Section 409A.

        (c)    Separation from Service.     A termination of employment or service shall not be deemed to have occurred for purposes of any 409A Award unless such termination
is also a "separation from service" within the meaning of Section 409A. For purposes of any such provision of the Plan or any

Table of Contents

Award Certificate relating to any such payments or benefits, references to a "termination," "termination of employment," "termination of service," or like terms shall mean
"separation from service."

SECTION 17. TRANSFER, LEAVE OF ABSENCE, ETC.

        For purposes of the Plan, the following events shall not be deemed a termination of employment:

        (a)   a transfer of employment to the Company from a Subsidiary or from the Company to a Subsidiary, or from one Subsidiary to another; or

        (b)   an approved leave of absence for military service or sickness, or for any other purpose approved by the Company or a Subsidiary , if the employee's right to
reemployment is guaranteed either by a statute or by contract or under the policy pursuant to which the leave of absence was granted or if the Administrator otherwise so
provides in writing.

SECTION 18. AMENDMENTS AND TERMINATION

        The Board may, at any time, amend or discontinue the Plan and the Administrator may, at any time, amend or cancel any outstanding Award for the purpose of
satisfying changes in law or for any other lawful purpose, but no such action shall adversely affect rights under any outstanding Award without the holder's consent, except as
provided in Section 16(a) or unless such action is necessary or appropriate to ensure a deduction under Section 162(m) of the Code. Except as provided in Section 3(b), 3(c)
or 16, without prior shareholder approval, in no event may the Administrator exercise its discretion to reduce the exercise price of outstanding Share Options or Share
Appreciation Rights or effect repricing through cancellation and re-grants or cancellation of underwater Share Options or underwater Share Appreciation Rights in exchange
for cash or other Awards. Solely to the extent required under the rules of any securities exchange or market system on which the Shares are listed or to ensure that
compensation earned under Awards qualifies as "qualified performance-based compensation" under Section 162(m) of the Code, Plan amendments shall be subject to
approval by the Company shareholders entitled to vote at a meeting of shareholders. Nothing in this Section 18 shall limit the Administrator's authority to take any action
permitted pursuant to Section 3(b), 3(c) or 16.

SECTION 19. STATUS OF PLAN

        With respect to the portion of any Award that has not been exercised and any payments in cash, Shares or other consideration not received by a Grantee, a Grantee shall
have no rights greater than those of a general unsecured creditor of the Company. In its sole discretion, the Administrator may authorize the creation of trusts or other
arrangements to meet the Company's obligations to deliver Shares or make payments with respect to Awards hereunder; provided, that the existence of such trusts or other
arrangements is consistent with the foregoing sentence.

SECTION 20. GENERAL PROVISIONS

        (a)    No Distribution.     The Administrator may require each person acquiring Shares pursuant to an Award to represent to and agree with the Company in writing that
such person is acquiring the Shares without a view to distribution thereof.

        (b)    Delivery of Share Certificates.     Under the Plan, certificated Shares shall be deemed delivered to Grantees for all purposes when the Company or a share transfer
agent of the Company shall have mailed such Share certificates in the United States mail, addressed to the Grantee at the Grantee's last known address on file with the
Company. Uncertificated Shares shall be deemed delivered to Grantees for all purposes when the Company or a share transfer agent of the Company shall have given to the
Grantee by electronic mail (with proof of receipt) or by United States mail, addressed to the Grantee,

at the Grantee's last known address on file with the Company, notice of issuance and recorded the issuance in its records (which may include electronic "book entry" records).
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company shall not be required to issue or deliver any certificates evidencing Shares pursuant to any Award, unless and
until the Administrator has determined, with advice of counsel (to the extent the Administrator deems such advice necessary or advisable), that the issuance and delivery of
such certificates is in compliance with all applicable laws, regulations of governmental authorities and, if applicable, the requirements of any exchange on which the Shares
are listed, quoted or traded. All share certificates delivered pursuant to the Plan shall be subject to any stop-transfer orders and other restrictions as the Administrator deems
necessary or advisable to comply with Federal, state or foreign jurisdiction, securities or other laws, rules and quotation systems on which the Shares are listed, quoted or
traded. The Administrator may place legends on any share certificate to reference restrictions applicable to the Shares. In addition to the terms and conditions provided
herein, the Administrator may require that an individual make such reasonable covenants, agreements, and representations as the Administrator, in its discretion, deems
necessary or advisable in order to comply with any such laws, regulations, or requirements. The Administrator shall have the right to require any individual to comply with
any timing or other restrictions with respect to the settlement or exercise of any Award, including a window-period limitation, as may be imposed in the discretion of the
Administrator.

        (c)    Shareholder Rights.     Until Shares are deemed delivered in accordance with Section 20(b), no right to vote or receive dividends or any other rights of a
shareholder will exist with respect to Shares to be issued in connection with an Award, notwithstanding the exercise of a Share Option or any other action by the Grantee with
respect to an Award.

        (d)    Other Compensation Arrangements; No Employment Rights.     Nothing contained in this Plan shall prevent the Board from adopting other or additional
compensation arrangements, including trusts, and such arrangements may be either generally applicable or applicable only in specific cases. The adoption of this Plan and the
grant of Awards do not confer upon any Grantee any right to continued employment or service with the Company or any Subsidiary.

        (e)    Trading Policy Restrictions.     Option exercises and other Awards under the Plan shall be subject to the Company's insider trading policies and procedures, as in
effect from time to time.

        (f)    Forfeiture of Awards under Sarbanes-Oxley Act.     If the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement due to the material noncompliance of the
Company, as a result of misconduct, with any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws, then any Grantee who is one of the individuals subject to automatic
forfeiture under Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 shall reimburse the Company for the amount of any Award received by such individual under the Plan during
the twelve (12)-month period following the first public issuance or filing with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, as the case may be, of the financial
document embodying such financial reporting requirement.

        (g)    Erroneously Awarded Compensation.     All Awards, if and to the extent subject to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, shall be
subject to any incentive compensation policy established from time to time by the Company to comply with such Act, and all Awards shall be subject to any other clawback
policy that the Company may adopt from time to time, even after an Award is granted.

        (h)    Unfunded Plan.     Grantees shall have no right, title, or interest whatsoever in or to any investments that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries may make to aid it
in meeting its obligations under the Plan. Nothing contained in the Plan, and no action taken pursuant to its provisions, shall create or be construed to create a trust of any
kind, or a fiduciary relationship between the Company and any Grantee, beneficiary, legal representative, or any other person. To the extent that any person acquires a right to
receive payments from the Company under the Plan, such right shall be no greater

than the right of an unsecured general creditor of the Company. All payments to be made hereunder shall be paid from the general funds of the Company and no special or
separate fund shall be established and no segregation of assets shall be made to assure payment of such amounts. The Plan is not subject to the U.S. Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974, as amended from time to time.

        (i)    No Guarantees Regarding Tax Treatment.     Grantees (or their beneficiaries) shall be responsible for all taxes with respect to any Awards under the Plan. The
Administrator and the Company make no guarantees to any person regarding the tax treatment of Awards or payments made under the Plan. Notwithstanding anything
contained in the Plan or in an Award Certificate to the contrary, neither the Administrator nor the Company has any obligation to take any action to prevent the assessment of
any tax, interest, penalty or fine on any Grantee or any other person or entity with respect to any Award under Section 409A or Section 457A of the Code or otherwise, and
none of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any member of the Board or the Administrator shall have any liability to any Grantee or any other person or entity with
respect thereto.

SECTION 21. LIMITATION ON BENEFITS

        The benefits that a Participant may be entitled to receive under this Plan and other benefits that a Participant is entitled to receive under other plans, agreements and
arrangements (which, together with the benefits provided under this Plan, are referred to as "Payments"), may constitute Parachute Payments that are subject to Code
Sections 280G and 4999. As provided in this Section 21, the Parachute Payments will be reduced if, and only to the extent that, a reduction will allow a Participant to receive
a greater Net After Tax Amount than the Participant would receive absent a reduction.

        The Accounting Firm will first determine the amount of any Parachute Payments that are payable to a Participant. The Accounting Firm also will determine the Net
After Tax Amount attributable to the Participant's total Parachute Payments.

        The Accounting Firm will next determine the largest amount of Payments that may be made to the Participant without subjecting the Participant to tax under Code
Section 4999 (the "Capped Payments"). Thereafter, the Accounting Firm will determine the Net After Tax Amount attributable to the Capped Payments.

        The Participant will receive the total Parachute Payments or the Capped Payments, whichever provides the Participant with the higher Net After Tax Amount. If the
Participant will receive the Capped Payments, the total Parachute Payments will be adjusted in the following order:

• first, if the Parachute Payments include the value of acceleration in the time at which any Payment, not subject to Section 409A, is paid, a delay in the time of
payment (but not a delay of vesting) of such Payment; provided, that such delay shall apply to the aggregate amount of such Payments (and not on a Payment-
by-Payment basis) and such aggregate amount shall be delayed only to the extent necessary to satisfy this Section 21; 

• second, to the extent further reduction is required by this Section 21, a reduction in the amount of Payments not subject to Section 409A required to be paid or
delivered; provided, that the applicable Participant shall be entitled to select among the forms of Payment (not subject to Section 409A) that shall be reduced;
and 

• third, to the extent further reduction is required by this Section 21, if the Parachute Payments include the value of acceleration in the time at which any
Payment vests, a cutback in the extent of such accelerated vesting; provided, however, that such cutback does not result in a violation of Section 409A or
make the Payment subject to Section 409A, in which case the Payment shall be forfeited or another Payment must be reduced. The cutback shall apply to the
aggregate amount

Table of Contents

of such Payments (and not on a Payment-by-Payment basis) and accelerated vesting of such aggregate amount shall be cut back only to the extent necessary
to satisfy this Section 21.

        The Accounting Firm will notify the Participant and the Company if it determines that the Parachute Payments must be reduced to the Capped Payments and will send
the Participant and the Company a copy of its detailed calculations supporting that determination.

        As a result of the uncertainty in the application of Code Sections 280G and 4999 at the time that the Accounting Firm makes its determinations under this Section 21, it
is possible that amounts will have been paid or distributed to the Participant that should not have been paid or distributed under this Section 21 ("Overpayments"), or that
additional amounts should be paid or distributed to the Participant under this Section 21 ("Underpayments"). If the Accounting Firm determines, based on the assertion of a
deficiency by the Internal Revenue Service against either the Company or the Participant, which assertion the Accounting Firm believes has a high probability of success or
controlling precedent or substantial authority, that an Overpayment has been made, the Participant must repay the amount of that Overpayment to the Company, without
interest; provided, however, that no loan will be deemed to have been made and no amount will be payable by the Participant to the Company unless, and then only to the
extent that, the deemed loan and payment would either reduce the amount on which the Participant is subject to tax under Code Section 4999 or generate a refund of tax
imposed under Code Section 4999. If the Accounting Firm determines, based upon controlling precedent or substantial authority, that an Underpayment has occurred, the
Accounting Firm will notify the Participant and the Company of that determination and the amount of that Underpayment will be paid to the Participant promptly by the
Company (unless such payment would cause a violation of Section 409A).

        For purposes of this Section 21, the term "Accounting Firm" means the independent accounting firm engaged by the Company immediately before the date of the Sale
Event. For purposes of this Section 21, the term "Net After Tax Amount" means the amount of any Parachute Payments or Capped Payments, as applicable, net of taxes
imposed under Code Sections 1, 3101(b) and 4999 and any state or local income taxes applicable to the Participant on the date of payment. The determination of the Net
After Tax Amount shall be made using the highest combined effective rate imposed by the foregoing taxes on income of the same character as the Parachute Payments or
Capped Payments, as applicable, in effect on the date of payment. For purposes of this Section 21, the term "Parachute Payment" means a payment that is described in Code
Section 280G(b)(2), determined in accordance with Code Section 280G and the regulations promulgated or proposed thereunder.

        Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 21, the limitations and provisions of this Section 21 shall not apply to any Participant who, pursuant to an agreement
with the Company or a Subsidiary, or the terms of another plan maintained by the Company or a Subsidiary, is entitled to indemnification for any liability that the Participant
may incur under Code Section 4999.

SECTION 22. EFFECTIVE DATE OF PLAN

        This Plan shall become effective upon the Effective Date in accordance with applicable state law, the Company's limited liability company agreement, and applicable
stock exchange rules. No Award shall become exercisable, realizable or vested prior to the Effective Date. No grants of Share Options and other Awards may be made
hereunder after the tenth (10th) anniversary of the Effective Date.

SECTION 23. GOVERNING LAW

        This Plan and all Awards and actions taken thereunder shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, applied without regard
to conflict of law principles.

or any other Person are necessary to authorize the execution and delivery by it of this Agreement, the performance by it of its obligations hereunder or the
consummation by it of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Shareholder and, assuming this
Agreement constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the other parties hereto, constitutes a legal, valid and binding agreement of the Shareholder, enforceable
against the Shareholder in accordance with its terms, subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception. If this Agreement is being executed in representative or
fiduciary capacity, the Person signing this Agreement has full power and authority to enter into and perform this Agreement.

        (b)    Ownership.    The Shareholder is the owner of record and Beneficial Owner of the Shareholder's Existing Shares, free and clear of any Liens and any other
limitations or restrictions (including any restrictions on the right to vote), other than (i) any Liens pursuant to the Shareholders Agreement and this Agreement,
(ii) transfer restrictions of general applicability as may be provided under the Securities Act and the "blue sky" laws of the various states of the United States and
(iii) any Liens granted in connection with a general pledge of Covered Shares to the Shareholder's prime broker, which do not and will not affect the Shareholder's
Beneficial Ownership of the Covered Shares. As of the date of this Agreement, the Existing Shares and the Warrant Shares constitute all of the Common Shares
Beneficially Owned by the Shareholder, and the Shareholder does not Beneficially Own any (i) shares of capital stock or voting securities of the Company or
(ii) options, warrants or other rights to acquire, or securities convertible into or exchangeable for (in each case, whether currently, upon lapse of time, following the
satisfaction of any conditions, upon the occurrence of any event or any combination of the foregoing), any capital stock, voting securities or securities convertible
into or exchangeable for capital stock or voting securities of the Company other than the Covered Shares. Except to the extent Covered Shares are Transferred after
the date of this Agreement pursuant to a Permitted Transfer, the Shareholder is the sole Beneficial Owner and has and will have at all times during the term of this
Agreement sole Beneficial Ownership, sole voting power (including the right to control such vote as contemplated herein), sole power of disposition, sole power to
issue instructions with respect to the matters set forth in Article 2 hereof, and sole power to agree to all of the matters set forth in this Agreement, in each case with
respect to all of the Covered Shares Beneficially Owned by the Shareholder at all times through the Closing Date.

        (c)    Warrant.    The Shareholder is the owner of record and Beneficial Owner of the warrant to acquire Common Shares of the Company granted to the
Shareholder pursuant to the Warrant Agreement (the "Warrant"), free and clear of any Liens and any other limitations or restrictions (including any restrictions on the
right to vote), other than (i) any Liens pursuant to the Shareholders Agreement and this Agreement, (ii) transfer restrictions of general applicability as may be
provided under the Securities Act and the "blue sky" laws of the various states of the United States and (iii) any Liens granted in connection with a general pledge of
the Warrant to the Shareholder's prime broker, which do not and will not affect the Shareholder's Beneficial Ownership of the Warrant. The Shareholder has not
transferred, assigned or otherwise disposed of the Warrant or any interest therein. The Shareholder acknowledges and agrees that, at the Effective Time, the Warrant
will be redeemed or cancelled in exchange for the right to receive the consideration set forth in the Merger Agreement and the amount of distributions made by the
Company (and its applicable predecessors) that the Shareholder is entitled to under the terms of the Warrant Agreement, and that no other amounts shall be due to the
Shareholder in respect of the Warrant or the Warrant Agreement.

        (d)    Non-Contravention.    The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Shareholder do not and will not (i) contravene or conflict with, or
result in any violation or breach of, any provision of the certificate of incorporation, bylaws or other comparable governing documents, as applicable, of the
Shareholder, (ii) contravene or conflict with, or result in any

bound or (iv) result in the creation of any Liens upon any of the assets or properties of the Shareholder, except for any of the foregoing as would not, individually or
in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay the ability of the Shareholder to perform its obligations hereunder or prevent or materially
delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

        (e)    Consents and Approvals.    The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Shareholder does not, and the performance by the Shareholder of its
obligations under this Agreement and the consummation by it of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not, require the Shareholder to obtain any
consent, approval, order, waiver, authorization or permit of or any filing with or notification to, any Governmental Entity or other Person.

        (f)    Reliance by Parent.    The Shareholder understands and acknowledges that Parent is entering into the Merger Agreement in reliance upon the Shareholder's
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the representations, warranties, covenants and obligations of the Shareholder contained herein.

        (g)    No Litigation.    As of the date of this Agreement, there is no suit, claim, action, investigation or other proceeding pending or, to the knowledge of the
Shareholder, threatened against the Shareholder at law or in equity before or by any Governmental Entity that could reasonably be expected to impair the ability of
the Shareholder to perform the Shareholder's obligations hereunder or consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

ARTICLE 4

enter into any voting trust or other Contract, with respect to the voting of any of the Covered Shares, or (b) Transfer any of the Covered Shares, Beneficial Ownership thereof
or any other interest therein unless such Transfer is a Permitted Transfer.

        4.2    Stop Transfer Order.    In furtherance of this Agreement, concurrently herewith the Shareholder shall and hereby does authorize Parent to notify the Company's
transfer agent that there is a stop transfer order with respect to all Covered Shares (and that this Agreement places limits on the voting and transfer of the Covered Shares).
The Shareholder further agrees to cause the Company not to register the transfer of any certificate representing any of the Covered Shares unless such transfer is made in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

        4.3    Accredited Investor.    The Shareholder hereby agrees to promptly provide, from time to time, any information that the Paying Agent or Parent reasonably requests
in verifying that the Shareholder is an "accredited investor" within the meaning of Rule 501(a) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, including, but not limited to,
the information referenced in Rule 506(c)(2)(ii) of Regulation D under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

include such shares as well as all such stock dividends and distributions and any securities of the Company into which or for which any or all of such shares may be changed
or exchanged or which are received in such transaction. The Shareholder hereby agrees, while this Agreement is in effect, promptly to notify the Sellers of the number of any
new Common Shares with respect to which Beneficial Ownership is acquired by the Shareholder, if any, after the date hereof and before the Effective Time. Any such shares
shall automatically become subject to the terms of this Agreement as Covered Shares as though owned by the Shareholder as of the date hereof.

        4.5    No Solicitation.    The Shareholder hereby agrees that it shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries, Affiliates and its and their respective representatives not to,
directly or indirectly, take any action that the Company is otherwise prohibited from taking under Section 7.5(a) of the Merger Agreement (which, for the avoidance of doubt,
for the purposes of this Section 4.5 only, shall be deemed to be the Merger Agreement in effect on the date hereof). The Shareholder agrees that it shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries, Affiliates and its and their respective representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated all discussions or negotiations with any Person conducted
heretofore with any Person other than Parent with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Shareholder, directly or indirectly through its
Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, representatives, advisors or other intermediaries, may, prior to the Company Shareholders Meeting, engage in negotiations or
discussions with any Person (and its representatives, advisors and intermediaries) that has made an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal not resulting from or
arising out of a breach of this Section 4.5 or Section 7.5(b) of the Merger Agreement; provided that the Shareholder shall be permitted to engage in such negotiations or
discussions if, and only if, prior to doing so, the Company's Board of Directors determines pursuant to Section 7.5(b) of the Merger Agreement that such Acquisition
Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to, a Superior Proposal.

        4.6    Waiver of Actions.    The Shareholder hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees not to commence or join in, and agrees to take all actions necessary to opt out
of any class in any class action with respect to, any claim, derivative or otherwise, against Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, any of the other parties to the Merger
Agreement or any of their respective successors relating to the negotiation, execution or delivery of this Agreement or the Merger Agreement or the consummation of the
Merger, including any proceeding (a) challenging the validity of, or seeking to enjoin the operation of, any provision of this Agreement or the Merger Agreement or
(b) alleging a breach of any fiduciary duty of any Person in connection with the negotiation and entry into this Agreement or the Merger Agreement. The Shareholder hereby
(i) irrevocably and unconditionally waives, and agrees not to exercise, assert or perfect, any rights to demand appraisal of the Covered Shares or rights of dissent, and
(ii) agrees to receive payment for the Covered Shares under the DGCL as applicable to the Company pursuant to the LLC Agreement.

        4.7    Further Assurances.    In addition to Section 4.3, during the term of this Agreement, from time to time, at Parent's request and without further consideration, the
Shareholder shall execute and deliver such additional documents and take all such further action as may be reasonably necessary to effect the actions and consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, the Shareholder hereby authorizes Parent and the Company to publish and disclose in the Proxy
Statement and in any other announcement or disclosure required by applicable Law the Shareholder's identity and ownership of the Covered Shares and the nature of the
Shareholder's obligations under this Agreement; provided, that in advance of any such announcement or disclosure, the Shareholder shall be afforded a reasonable
opportunity to review and approve (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) such announcement or disclosure. The Shareholder agrees to notify Parent and the Company
as promptly as practicable of any required corrections with respect to any written information supplied by the Shareholder specifically for use in any such disclosure
document. Except as otherwise required by applicable Law or listing agreement with a national securities exchange

"Consulting Services Agreement") and (ii) the Shareholders Agreement) (collectively, the "Released Claims"). The Releasing Parties hereby irrevocably covenant to refrain
from, directly or indirectly, asserting any Released Claim against any Released Party before any Governmental Entity. The Releasing Parties waive the benefit of any statute
or rule of law, which, if applied to the foregoing, would otherwise exclude from its binding effect any claim not known by the Releasing Parties on the date hereof. The
provisions of this paragraph are intended to be for the benefit of, and enforceable by, the Released Parties referenced in this paragraph, and each such Person shall be a third-
party beneficiary of this paragraph.

        5.10    Severability.    The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not affect the validity or
enforceability of the other provisions of this Agreement. If any provision of this Agreement, or the application of that provision to any Person or any circumstance, is invalid
or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and equitable provision shall be substituted for that provision in order to carry out, so far as may be valid and enforceable, the intent and
purpose of the invalid or unenforceable provision and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the application of that provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not be
affected by such invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity or unenforceability affect the validity or enforceability of that provision, or the application of that
provision, in any other jurisdiction. Upon such a determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the
parties as closely as possible in a reasonably acceptable manner so that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as originally contemplated to
the fullest extent possible.

        5.11    Successors and Assigns; Third Party Beneficiaries.    Except in connection with a Permitted Transfer (which Permitted Transfer shall not relieve the Shareholder
of its obligations hereunder), no party to this Agreement may assign or delegate, by operation of law or otherwise, all or any portion of its rights or liabilities under this
Agreement without the prior written consent of the other parties to this Agreement, which any such party may withhold in its absolute discretion. Subject to the foregoing,
this Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns. Any purported
assignment without such prior written consent shall be void. Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to confer on any Person other than the parties hereto
or their respective successors and permitted assigns any rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement.

        5.12    Rules of Construction.    The parties have participated jointly in negotiating and drafting this Agreement. If an ambiguity or a question of intent or interpretation
arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of
the authorship of any provision of this Agreement.
