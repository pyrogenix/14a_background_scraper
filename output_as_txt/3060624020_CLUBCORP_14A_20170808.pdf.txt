Dear Fellow Stockholder:

        You are cordially invited to attend a special meeting of the stockholders of ClubCorp Holdings, Inc., a Nevada corporation ("ClubCorp"), to be held at Hackberry Creek Country Club, 1901 West Royal
Lane, The Ballroom, Irving, Texas 75063 on September 15, 2017 at 10:00 am, Central Time (the "special meeting").

        At the special meeting, stockholders will be asked to consider and vote on a proposal to approve the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of July 9, 2017 (as amended or modified from time to time, the
"merger agreement"), among ClubCorp, Constellation Club Parent, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Parent"), and Constellation Merger Sub Inc., a Nevada corporation ("Merger Sub"). Subject to the terms and
conditions of the merger agreement, Merger Sub will be merged with and into ClubCorp and ClubCorp will survive the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (the "merger"). Parent and Merger Sub
were formed by certain funds managed by affiliates of Apollo Management VIII, L.P. (on behalf of its affiliated funds, "Apollo").

        If the merger is completed, our stockholders will have the right to receive $17.12 in cash, without interest and subject to any applicable withholding taxes, for each share of common stock, $0.01 par value
per share, of ClubCorp ("ClubCorp common stock") that they own immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, which represents a premium of (i) approximately 30.7% over the closing price of
ClubCorp's common stock on July 7, 2017, the last trading day prior to the date on which public announcement of the merger agreement was made and (ii) approximately 29.0% to the volume-weighted average
share price of ClubCorp common stock during the thirty (30) days ended July 7, 2017. Approval of the proposal to approve the merger agreement requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the
outstanding shares of ClubCorp common stock entitled to vote on the merger proposal.

        ClubCorp common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE") under the symbol "MYCC". The closing price of ClubCorp common stock on the NYSE on August 7, 2017, the most
recent practicable date prior to the date of the accompanying proxy statement, was $17.05 per share.

        The ClubCorp board of directors has reviewed and considered the terms and conditions of the merger and unanimously determined that the merger, the merger agreement, and the other transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement, are advisable, fair to and in the best interests of ClubCorp and its stockholders and has unanimously declared advisable and approved the merger, the merger agreement
and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. The ClubCorp board of directors made its determination after consideration of a number of factors more fully described in the accompanying
proxy statement. The ClubCorp board of directors unanimously recommends that you vote "FOR" the proposal to approve the merger agreement.

        At the special meeting, stockholders will also be asked to vote on (i) a proposal to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, compensation that will be paid or may become payable to the named executive
officers of ClubCorp in connection with the merger, as required by the rules adopted by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and (ii) a proposal that will give ClubCorp authority to adjourn the special
meeting to solicit additional proxies in favor of the merger proposal if there are not sufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the merger proposal. The ClubCorp board of directors
unanimously recommends that you vote "FOR" each of these proposals.

        The ClubCorp board of directors is soliciting your proxy to assure that a quorum is present and that your shares are represented and voted at the special meeting and any postponement or adjournment
thereof.



9/18/2019 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1577095/000104746917005072/a2232921zdefm14a.htm

Table of Contents

        If your shares are held in "street name," you should instruct your broker, bank or other nominee how to vote your shares on each proposal in accordance with your voting instruction form.

        The merger cannot be completed unless ClubCorp stockholders approve the merger agreement. Your vote is very important, regardless of the number of shares you own. Whether or not you expect to
attend the special meeting in person, please submit a proxy to vote your shares as promptly as possible so that your shares may be represented and voted at the special meeting. If you attend the
special meeting and vote in person, your vote by ballot at the special meeting will revoke any proxy previously submitted. If you fail to return your proxy or to attend the special meeting in person,
your shares will not be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present at the special meeting and also will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the approval of the merger
agreement. Similarly, if you hold your shares in "street name" and fail to instruct your broker, bank or other nominee how to vote your shares, your shares will not be counted for purposes of
determining whether a quorum is present and also will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the approval of the merger agreement.

        The obligations of ClubCorp, Parent and Merger Sub to complete the merger are subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain customary conditions. The accompanying proxy statement contains detailed
information about ClubCorp, the special meeting, the merger agreement, the merger and the merger-related named executive officer compensation proposal. A copy of the merger agreement is attached as
Annex A to the accompanying proxy statement and incorporated therein by reference. We urge you to, and you should, read the entire proxy statement carefully, including the merger agreement and the other
annexes and the documents referred to or incorporated by reference in the accompanying proxy statement. You may obtain additional information about ClubCorp from documents we have filed with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission.

        If you have any questions or need assistance voting your shares of our common stock, please contact MacKenzie Partners, Inc., our proxy solicitor, by calling (800) 322-2885.

        Thank you for your confidence in ClubCorp.

Sincerely,

        Neither the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission nor any state securities regulatory agency has approved or disapproved of the merger, passed upon the merits of the merger agreement or
the merger or determined if the accompanying proxy statement is accurate or complete. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense.

        The accompanying proxy statement is dated August 8, 2017 and, together with the enclosed form of proxy card, is first being mailed to ClubCorp stockholders on or about August 8, 2017.

        Holders of ClubCorp common stock are entitled to one vote for each share of ClubCorp common stock they own at the close of business on the record date.

        We are commencing our solicitation of proxies on or about August 8, 2017, which is before the record date. We will continue to solicit proxies until the date of the special meeting. Each holder of record of
ClubCorp common stock on the record date who has not yet received notice of the special meeting and a copy of the proxy statement prior to August 17, 2017 will receive such notice and a copy of the proxy
statement and have the opportunity to vote on the matters described in the proxy statement. Proxies delivered prior to the record date will be valid and effective so long as the stockholder providing the proxy is
a holder of record of ClubCorp common stock on the record date. If you are not a holder of record of ClubCorp common stock on the record date, any proxy you deliver will be ineffective. If you deliver a proxy
prior to the record date and remain a holder of record of ClubCorp common stock on the record date, you do not need to deliver another proxy after the record date. If you deliver a proxy prior to the record date
and do not revoke that proxy, your proxy will be deemed to cover the number of shares of ClubCorp common stock you own on the record date even if that number is different from the number of shares of
ClubCorp common stock you owned when you executed and delivered your proxy. Proxies received from persons who are not holders of record of ClubCorp common stock on the record date will not be
effective.

Quorum (see page 32) 

        Under our bylaws, the presence at the special meeting, in person or by proxy (regardless of whether the proxy has authority to vote on all matters), of the holders of a majority of the voting power of
ClubCorp common stock issued and outstanding at the close of business on the record date will constitute a quorum. Abstentions will be counted as present at the special meeting for purposes of determining
whether a quorum is present at the meeting, but broker "non-votes" will not be counted as present in person or by proxy at the special meeting. There must be a quorum for business to be conducted at the
special meeting. Failure of a quorum to be present at the special meeting will necessitate an adjournment or postponement of the special meeting and may subject ClubCorp to additional expense.

        If you submit (and do not thereafter validly revoke) a properly executed proxy card, even if you abstain from voting, your shares of ClubCorp common stock will be counted for purposes of determining
whether a quorum is present at the special meeting. In the event that a quorum is not

Table of Contents

present at the special meeting or additional votes must be solicited to approve the merger agreement, the meeting may be adjourned or postponed to solicit additional proxies.

Required Vote (see page 33) 

        Approval of the merger proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of ClubCorp common stock entitled to vote thereon. As a result, if you fail to return your
proxy card or otherwise fail to vote your shares at the special meeting, or if you abstain from voting on the merger proposal, it will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the merger proposal. Broker "non-
votes" will also have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the merger proposal.

        The outcome of the named executive officer merger-related compensation proposal vote will not be binding on ClubCorp, the Board, Parent or the surviving corporation. Therefore, there is no "required
vote" on this proposal. The Board will consider the outcome of this advisory vote in determining how to proceed following the special meeting.

        The adjournment proposal will be approved only if the number of votes cast in favor of the adjournment proposal exceeds the number of votes cast in opposition to the adjournment proposal.

        Abstentions and broker non-votes will not be counted as votes cast on the adjournment proposal or the named executive officer merger-related compensation proposal and therefore will not affect the
outcome of these proposals.

Voting at the Special Meeting (see page 34) 

        If your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, you are considered a "stockholder of record." Stockholders of record can vote their shares of ClubCorp common stock in the
following ways: (i) by completing, signing and returning by mail the enclosed proxy card authorizing the persons named as proxies on the proxy card to vote your shares at the special meeting, (ii) by submitting
a proxy by telephone using the toll-free number (1-800-690-6903), (iii) by submitting a proxy over the Internet at the website at www.proxyvote.com or (iv) attending the special meeting and voting your shares
in person. Even if you plan to be present at the special meeting, ClubCorp encourages you to complete and mail the enclosed card to vote your shares by proxy or vote by telephone or the Internet to ensure that
your shares are represented and voted at the meeting.

        If your shares are held by your broker, bank or other nominee, you are considered the beneficial owner of shares held in "street name" and you will receive a form from your broker, bank or other nominee
seeking instruction from you as to how your shares should be voted. You should instruct your broker, bank or other nominee how to vote your shares on each proposal in accordance with your voting instruction
form. If you beneficially own your shares and receive a voting instruction form, you can vote by following the instructions on your voting instruction form. Please refer to information from your bank, broker or
other nominee on how to submit voting instructions. Stockholders who own their shares in "street name" are not able to vote at the special meeting unless they have a "legal proxy", executed in their favor, from
their broker, bank or other nominee of the stockholder of record of their shares giving them the right to vote the shares at the special meeting.

        You may revoke your proxy at any time prior to the vote at the special meeting by delivering to ClubCorp's Secretary a signed notice of revocation or submitting a later-dated proxy. You may also revoke
your proxy by attending the special meeting and voting in person. Attendance at the special meeting will not, in and of itself, result in the revocation of a proxy or cause your shares of ClubCorp common stock
to be voted.

        ClubCorp recommends that you submit a proxy to vote your shares as soon as possible, even if you are planning to attend the special meeting to ensure that your shares are represented and voted at the
meeting and so that the vote count will not be delayed.

Abstentions and Broker Non-Votes (see page 33) 

        At the special meeting, abstentions will be counted as present for purposes of determining whether a quorum exists. Abstaining from voting will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the merger
proposal. If no instruction as to how to vote is given (including no instruction to abstain from voting) in an executed, duly returned and not revoked proxy, the proxy will be voted "FOR" (i) approval of the
merger proposal, (ii) approval of the named executive officer merger-related compensation proposal and (iii) approval of the adjournment proposal. Broker non-votes are shares held in "street name" by brokers,
banks and other nominees that are present or represented by proxy at the special meeting, but with respect to which the broker, bank or other nominee is not instructed by the beneficial owner of such shares how
to vote on a particular proposal and such broker, bank or other nominee does not have discretionary voting power on such proposal. Because, under NYSE rules, brokers, banks and other nominees holding
shares in "street name" do not have discretionary voting authority with respect to non-routine matters (which include the three proposals described in this proxy statement), if a beneficial owner of shares of
ClubCorp common stock held in "street name" does not give voting instructions to the broker, bank or other nominee, then those shares will not be counted as present in person or by proxy at the special
meeting. Approval of the merger proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of ClubCorp common stock entitled to vote thereon. As a result, if you fail to issue
voting instructions to your broker, bank or other nominee, it will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the merger proposal.

Solicitation of Proxies (see page 35) 

        The Board is soliciting your proxy, and ClubCorp will bear the cost of soliciting proxies. MacKenzie Partners, Inc. has been retained to assist with the solicitation of proxies. MacKenzie Partners, Inc. will
be paid approximately $25,000 and will be reimbursed for its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses for these and other advisory services in connection with the special meeting. On or about August 8, 2017, we
will begin soliciting proxies from holders of record as of August 3, 2017 and will continue to solicit proxies until the date of the special meeting. Solicitation initially will be made by mail. Forms of proxies and
proxy materials may also be distributed through brokers, banks and other nominees to the beneficial owners of shares of ClubCorp common stock, in which case these parties will be reimbursed for their
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses. Proxies may also be solicited in person or by telephone, facsimile, electronic mail, or other electronic medium by MacKenzie Partners, Inc. or, without additional
compensation by certain of ClubCorp's directors, officers and employees.

Adjournment (see page 36) 

        In addition to the merger proposal and the named executive officer merger-related compensation proposal, ClubCorp stockholders are also being asked to approve the adjournment proposal, which will give
ClubCorp authority to adjourn the special meeting for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies in favor of the merger proposal if there are not sufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the
merger proposal. If a quorum is not present, the person presiding at the special meeting or the stockholders acting by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of ClubCorp common stock
present or represented by proxy at the special meeting and entitled to vote thereon may adjourn the special meeting to another place, date or time until a quorum is represented. If the adjournment is for more
than 60 days, a new record date must be set for the adjourned meeting and a notice of the adjourned meeting will be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote. In addition, the special meeting could be
postponed before it commences, subject to the terms of the merger agreement. If the special meeting is adjourned or postponed, stockholders who have already submitted their proxies will be able to revoke
them at any time prior to the final vote on the proposals.

If you return a proxy and do not indicate how you wish to vote on the adjournment proposal, your shares will be voted in favor of the adjournment proposal.

The Merger 

        The rights and obligations of the parties to the merger agreement are governed by the specific terms and conditions of the merger agreement and not by any summary or other information in this proxy
statement. Therefore, the information in this proxy statement regarding the merger agreement and the merger is qualified in its entirety by reference to the merger agreement, a copy of which is attached as
Annex A to this proxy statement and incorporated herein by reference. We encourage you to read the merger agreement carefully and in its entirety because it is the principal legal agreement that governs the
merger.

Structure of the Merger (see page 40) 

        If the merger is completed, then at the effective time of the merger (the "effective time"), Merger Sub will merge with and into ClubCorp, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub will cease and
ClubCorp will survive the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent.

Merger Consideration (see page 40) 

        Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the merger agreement, at the effective time, ClubCorp stockholders will have the right to receive $17.12 in cash, without interest and subject to any
applicable withholding taxes, for each share of ClubCorp common stock that they own immediately prior to the effective time (other than shares (i) owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any other direct or indirect
wholly owned subsidiary of Parent immediately prior to the effective time, and in each case not held on behalf of third parties, (ii) owned by ClubCorp, including shares held in treasury by ClubCorp, and in
each case not held in a fiduciary capacity on behalf of third parties and (iii) owned by any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of ClubCorp) (the "per share merger consideration").

Treatment of ClubCorp Equity Awards (see page 40) 

        The merger agreement provides that, immediately prior to the effective time:

• each outstanding Restricted Share (as such term is defined in the merger agreement) will, automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and
converted into the right of the holder of such Restricted Share to receive $17.12 in cash plus any accrued dividends payable in respect of such Restricted Share; 

• each outstanding PSU (as such term is defined in the merger agreement) (other than any PSU granted on April 12, 2016 (each, a "Road to 300 PSU")) will automatically and without any required
action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and converted into the right of the holder of such PSU to receive, an amount in cash equal to the product of (A) the target number of shares
subject to such PSU immediately prior to the effective time multiplied by (B) $17.12, plus any accrued dividend equivalents payable in respect of such PSU; and 

• each Road to 300 PSU will be cancelled without the payment of any consideration;

provided that the amounts payable with respect to such Restricted Shares or PSUs will vest and be payable by the surviving corporation, subject to the applicable holder's continued employment through the
applicable payment date (in the case of PSUs) or vesting date (in the case of Restricted Shares), as applicable, (A) with respect to Restricted Shares or PSUs, as applicable, that are not vested in accordance with
their terms at the effective time, (i) fifty percent (50%) upon the 60-day anniversary of the date that the effective time occurs (or the next payroll date following such anniversary) and (ii) fifty percent (50%) at
or promptly after the effective time, and (B) with respect to Restricted Shares or

PSUs, as applicable, that are vested as of the effective time in accordance with their terms, at or promptly following the effective time, and in all cases, without any interest for the period from the effective time
until such date (with respect to each Restricted Share, such applicable date, the "Restricted Share Payment Date" and, with respect to each PSU, such applicable date, the "PSU Payment Date") and less
applicable taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payment; provided, further, that if the employment of a holder of Restricted Shares or PSUs is, following the effective time, but prior to the
applicable Restricted Share Payment Date or PSU Payment Date, as applicable, terminated for any reason other than (x) by Parent or any of its affiliates (including the surviving corporation) for "cause" (as such
term is defined in ClubCorp's 2012 Stock Award Plan (the "Stock Award Plan")) or (y) by such holder without "good reason" (as such term is defined in the merger agreement), then, in the case of each of the
foregoing clauses (x) and (y), the payment described above will be accelerated to the next practicable payroll date after the date of such termination.

Recommendation of the Board of Directors (see page 56) 

        The Board reviewed and considered the terms and conditions of the proposed merger with the assistance of management and outside legal counsel and financial advisors. After consideration of various
factors, the Board unanimously (i) determined that it is advisable, fair to and in the best interests of ClubCorp and our stockholders for ClubCorp to enter into the merger agreement and the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement, including the merger, (ii) declared advisable and approved the merger, the merger agreement and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and
(iii) resolved that the merger agreement be submitted to the ClubCorp stockholders for approval thereby in accordance with applicable law, the merger agreement and the bylaws of ClubCorp at a special
meeting of stockholders and recommended that our stockholders vote to approve the merger agreement. Certain factors considered by the Board in reaching its decision to adopt the merger agreement can be
found in "The Merger—Recommendation of the Board and Reasons for the Merger" beginning on page 56.

        The Board unanimously recommends that the ClubCorp stockholders vote:

• "FOR" the merger proposal; 

• "FOR" the named executive officer merger-related compensation proposal; and 

• "FOR" the adjournment proposal.

Opinions of ClubCorp's Financial Advisors (see page 61) 

Opinion of Jefferies LLC

        ClubCorp has engaged Jefferies LLC ("Jefferies") as a financial advisor to ClubCorp in connection with the merger. In connection with the merger, Jefferies delivered a written opinion, dated July 9, 2017,
to the Board as to the fairness, from a financial point of view and as of such date, of the per share merger consideration to be received by holders of ClubCorp common stock pursuant to the merger agreement.

and limitations and qualifications on the review undertaken by Jefferies. Jefferies' opinion was provided for the use and benefit of the Board (in its capacity as such) in its evaluation of the per share
merger consideration from a financial point of view and did not address any other aspect of the merger or any other matter. The opinion did not address the relative merits of the merger as
compared to any alternative transaction or opportunity that might be available to ClubCorp, nor did it address the underlying business decision by ClubCorp to engage in the merger. Jefferies'
opinion does not constitute a recommendation as to how any stockholder should vote or act

with respect to the merger or any other matter. The summary of Jefferies' opinion set forth below is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of Jefferies' opinion.

Opinion of Wells Fargo Securities, LLC

        ClubCorp also has engaged Wells Fargo Securities, LLC ("Wells Fargo Securities") as a financial advisor to ClubCorp in connection with the merger. In connection with the merger, Wells Fargo Securities
rendered an opinion, dated July 9, 2017, to the Board as to the fairness, from a financial point of view and as of such date, of the per share merger consideration to be received by holders of ClubCorp common
stock pursuant to the merger agreement. The full text of Wells Fargo Securities' written opinion is attached as Annex C to this proxy statement and is incorporated in this proxy statement by reference. The
written opinion sets forth, among other things, the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and limitations and qualifications on the review undertaken by Wells Fargo Securities in rendering
its opinion. The opinion was addressed to the Board (in its capacity as such) for its information and use in connection with its evaluation of the per share merger consideration from a financial point
of view and did not address any other terms, aspects or implications of the merger. Wells Fargo Securities' opinion did not address the merits of the underlying decision by ClubCorp to enter into
the merger agreement or the relative merits of the merger compared with other business strategies or transactions available or that have been or might be considered by ClubCorp or the Board or
in which ClubCorp might engage. Wells Fargo Securities' opinion does not constitute a recommendation to the Board or any other person or entity in respect of the merger, including as to how any
holder of any of ClubCorp's securities should vote or act in connection with the merger or any other matters.

Interests of ClubCorp's Executive Officers and Directors in the Merger (see page 79) 

        In considering the recommendation of the Board, ClubCorp stockholders should be aware that certain directors and executive officers of ClubCorp will have interests in the proposed merger that are
different from, or in addition to, the interests of ClubCorp stockholders generally and that may create potential conflicts of interest. These interests are described in more detail in "The Merger—Interests of
ClubCorp's Executive Officers and Directors in the Merger," and with respect to the named executive officers of ClubCorp, are quantified in the "Golden Parachute Compensation" table included in "The Merger
—Interests of ClubCorp's Executive Officers and Directors in the Merger" section of this proxy statement. The Board was aware of these interests and considered them when it adopted the merger agreement
and approved the merger.

        These interests include:

• Certain of ClubCorp's executive officers are entitled to protections and benefits under Change in Control Severance Agreements and certain other executive officers are entitle to protections and
benefits under the Change of Control Severance Plan adopted by ClubCorp USA, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of ClubCorp (the "Severance Plan") in the event of a qualifying termination of
employment during the two-year period and one-year period, respectively, commencing on the date of the merger; 

• ClubCorp's PSUs (other than any Road to 300 PSUs, which will be cancelled without payment) held by ClubCorp's executive officers will vest at the target level of performance and be converted
into the right to receive the per share merger consideration on specified payment dates (which payment dates are subject to acceleration in connection with certain terminations of the applicable
executive officer's employment); 

• Restricted Shares held by ClubCorp's executive officers will vest and be converted into the right to receive the per share merger consideration on specified payment dates (which payment dates

are subject to acceleration in connection with certain terminations of the applicable executive officer's employment);

• Restricted Shares held by members of the Board will vest and be converted into the right to receive the per share merger consideration promptly after the effective time; and 

• ClubCorp's directors and officers are entitled to indemnification and insurance arrangements pursuant to the merger agreement and ClubCorp's organizational documents and under certain
indemnification agreements.

        These interests are discussed in more detail in the section entitled "The Merger—Interests of ClubCorp's Executive Officers and Directors in the Merger," beginning on page 79 of this proxy statement.

Financing of the Merger (see page 87) 

        We anticipate that the total funds needed to complete the merger (including the funds to pay ClubCorp's stockholders, to pay the holders of other equity-based interests the amounts due to them under the
merger agreement, and to repay, prepay, repurchase, redeem, defease or discharge certain existing indebtedness of ClubCorp and its subsidiaries), which is expected to be approximately $2.4 billion, will be
funded through a combination of available cash of ClubCorp and its subsidiaries, if any, and the following:

          (i)  debt financing in an aggregate principal amount of $1.6 billion as well as a committed $175 million senior secured revolving facility, a portion of which will be available at closing. Parent has
received firm commitments from a consortium of financial institutions to provide the debt financing, which includes the revolving credit facility. See the section of this proxy statement entitled "The
Merger—Financing of the Merger—Debt Financing"; and

         (ii)  equity commitments by Apollo Investment Fund VIII, L.P., Apollo Overseas Partners (Delaware 892) VIII, L.P., Apollo Overseas Partners (Delaware) VIII, L.P. and Apollo Overseas Partners
VIII, L.P. (together with their alternative investment vehicles, the "Apollo Funds") in an aggregate amount of up to $675 million. See the section of this proxy statement entitled "The Merger—Financing
of the Merger—Equity Financing."

        The completion of the merger is not conditioned upon Parent's receipt of financing.

Limited Guarantee (see page 91) 

        Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in a limited guarantee, dated July 9, 2017 (the "limited guarantee"), the Apollo Funds have guaranteed the payment obligations of Parent with respect to (i) (x)
the obligation of Parent under the merger agreement to pay a reverse termination fee of $74.2 million if the merger agreement is terminated by ClubCorp under specified circumstances (see the section entitled
"The Merger Agreement—Termination Fees and Expenses"), (y) Parent's obligation to pay up to $2.5 million of certain expenses incurred by ClubCorp in connection with the successful enforcement by
ClubCorp of Parent's obligation to pay the reverse termination fee (referred to herein as "enforcement expenses"), and (z) certain reimbursement or payment obligations of Parent relating to the debt financing
and the repayment or satisfaction and discharge, as applicable, of existing ClubCorp indebtedness of up to $500,000 or (ii) damages (solely to the extent payable pursuant to a final and non-appealable order of a
court of competent jurisdiction), if any, payable for fraud or willful breach by Parent or Merger Sub of up to $74.2 million.

        The Apollo Funds' obligations under the limited guarantee are subject to a maximum aggregate cap of $74.2 million plus, if applicable, the enforcement expenses and the reimbursement obligations, in each
case subject to the applicable cap.

Table of Contents

Antitrust Review Required for the Merger (see page 92) 

        Under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the "HSR Act"), we cannot complete the merger until we have given notification and furnished information to the Federal
Trade Commission ("FTC") and the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice ("DOJ"), and until the applicable 30-day waiting period has expired or has been terminated. On July 20, 2017, ClubCorp and
Parent each filed a premerger notification and report form under the HSR Act, as a result of which the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act is scheduled to expire on August 21, 2017 at 11:59 p.m.,
Eastern Time, unless otherwise earlier terminated or extended if the DOJ or FTC requests additional information and documentary material. On July 28, 2017, the FTC granted early termination of the waiting
period of the HSR Act, effective immediately.

        While we have no reason to believe it will not be possible to complete the antitrust review in a timely manner, there is no certainty that this review will be completed within the period of time contemplated
by the merger agreement or that the completion of such review would not be conditioned upon actions that would be materially adverse to ClubCorp or Parent, or that a regulatory challenge to the merger will
not be made.

Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger (see page 93) 

        The exchange of ClubCorp common stock for cash in the merger generally will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes and may also be taxable under state and local and other tax
laws. You should read the section entitled "Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger" beginning on page 93. Tax matters can be complicated and the tax consequences of the merger to you
will depend on your particular circumstances. You should consult your tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger to you in your particular circumstances, as well as tax
consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or foreign taxing jurisdiction.

Transaction Litigation (See page 93) 

        Following the July 9, 2017 announcement of the execution of the merger agreement, four purported ClubCorp stockholders initiated legal actions asserting claims against ClubCorp's directors for allegedly
breaching various fiduciary duties, including, without limitation, the duties of loyalty, due care, good faith, candor and/or independence owed to the plaintiff and the public stockholders of ClubCorp. Three of
these legal actions also named AGM for aiding and abetting the directors' purported breach of fiduciary duty. The complaints seek, among other things, to enjoin the merger contemplated by the merger
agreement. Although it is not possible to predict the outcome of the litigations with certainty, ClubCorp, Parent and Merger Sub believe these claims are without merit and intend to vigorously defend against
these claims.

No Appraisal Rights (see page 95) 

        Pursuant to the Section 92A.390 of the Nevada Revised Statutes (the "NRS"), no holder of any shares of ClubCorp common stock will have or be entitled to assert dissenter's rights or any rights of
appraisal as a result of or in connection with the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger.

Expected Timing of the Merger 

        We expect to complete the merger in the third quarter of 2017. However, the merger is subject to approval of the merger proposal by the ClubCorp stockholders at the special meeting and other conditions,
and it is possible that factors outside of the control of ClubCorp or Parent could result in the merger being completed at a later time, or not at all. There may be a substantial amount of time

between the special meeting and the completion of the merger. We expect to complete the merger promptly following the receipt of all required clearances and approvals and the satisfaction or, to the extent
permitted, waiver of the other conditions to the consummation of the merger.

Restrictions on Solicitation of Competing Acquisition Proposals (see page 107) 

        From and after the date of the merger agreement until the effective time or, if earlier, the valid termination of the merger agreement, ClubCorp is subject to restrictions on its ability to solicit third party
proposals relating to alternative transactions or to provide information to and engage in discussions or negotiations with third parties in relation to any alternative transactions (subject to certain exceptions prior
to the approval of the merger proposal by ClubCorp stockholders at the special meeting). Specifically, ClubCorp will not, and will cause its subsidiaries not to (and will use its reasonable best efforts to cause its
and their respective directors, officers, employees, consultants, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants, agents and other advisors or representatives not to):

an acquisition proposal or the consummation thereof, or any offer or proposal that could reasonably be expected to lead to an acquisition proposal or the consummation thereof; 

• enter into, continue or otherwise participate or engage in any negotiations or discussions concerning or with respect to any inquiries from any person (other than Parent, Merger Sub or any of

        ClubCorp agreed to immediately cease and cause to be terminated, and to cause each of its subsidiaries, and use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and its subsidiaries' respective representatives to

        However, prior to approval of the merger proposal by the ClubCorp stockholders at the special meeting, we may participate or engage in discussions with any person or group that has made a bona fide
acquisition proposal after the date of the merger agreement that was not solicited in breach of the merger agreement (including the non-solicitation restrictions described above) (other than de minimis breaches)
and provide access to such person or group and its representatives to our, and our subsidiaries' properties, books and records and other information or data in response to a request therefor, if the Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that such acquisition proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to constitute a superior proposal and,
after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that failure to provide such access or engage in such discussions would be, or reasonably likely to be, inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law
and has received an acceptable confidentiality agreement from such person; provided that ClubCorp will substantially contemporaneously provide to Parent and Merger Sub any non-public information or data
that is provided to any person given such access that was not previously made available to Parent or Merger Sub.

        ClubCorp is not entitled to terminate the merger agreement to enter into an agreement for a superior proposal unless it complies with certain procedures in the merger agreement, including engaging in
good faith negotiations with Parent and its representatives during specified periods to enable Parent to make adjustments to the merger agreement such that any acquisition proposal (or modification thereof)
would cease to constitute a superior proposal. If ClubCorp terminates the merger agreement in order to accept a superior proposal, it must pay a $34.2 million termination fee to Parent. For more information,
see the section of this proxy statement captioned "The Merger Agreement—Restrictions on Solicitation of Competing Acquisition Proposals."

of the merger proposal was taken.

any such representation or warranty will be untrue in any material respect, which breach, failure to perform or failure to be true, individually or in the aggregate, would result in a condition to

applicable termination fee; or

representation or warranty will be untrue in any material respect, which breach, failure to perform or failure to be true, individually or in the aggregate, would result in a condition to Parent's and

conditions of the merger agreement. If the merger agreement is terminated as a result of (i) ClubCorp's material uncured breach of the merger agreement, or (ii) a failure to obtain stockholder approval at a
meeting where a vote for the approval of the merger agreement was taken, ClubCorp will reimburse Parent an amount up to $6.25 million in respect of its transaction-related expenses. Upon termination of the
merger agreement, under certain specified circumstances, Parent may be required to pay ClubCorp a reverse termination fee in an aggregate amount of $74.2 million and enforcement expenses pursuant to the
terms and conditions of the merger agreement. See the section entitled "The Merger Agreement—Termination Fees and Expenses" beginning on page 121 for a discussion of the circumstances under which
either party will be required to pay a termination fee.

Directors' and Officers' Indemnification and Insurance (see page 114) 

        Following the effective time and until the sixth anniversary thereof, subject to the limitations set forth in the merger agreement, Parent will cause the surviving corporation to indemnify each current and
former director and officer of the Company and its subsidiaries (in each case, to the extent acting in such capacity) for matters existing or occurring prior to the effective time and advance expenses incurred by
such indemnified party in the defense of any proceeding (provided that the person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such person
is not entitled to indemnification). The provisions in the surviving corporation's and each of its subsidiaries organizational documents with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation
of former or present directors and officers will be substantially equivalent to the provisions contained in ClubCorp's or such subsidiaries' organizational documents as in effect as of the date of the merger
agreement, which provisions will not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six years from the effective time in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any such
individuals without the prior written consent of each such individual. Additionally, for a period of six years, Parent will maintain, or will cause the surviving corporation to maintain, at no expense to the
beneficiaries, either the current policies of the directors' and officers' liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by ClubCorp and its subsidiaries (the "existing policies") or insurance policies
for the directors and officers of at least the same coverage, with deductibles substantially equivalent to those of the existing policies and containing terms and conditions and providing benefits that are
substantially equivalent to any beneficiary thereof, with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the effective time and from insurance carriers having at least an "A" rating by A.M. Best with
respect to directors' and officers' liability insurance. In lieu of providing such coverage, ClubCorp may, at its option, purchase from insurance carriers with comparable credit ratings no later than the effective
time, a six-year prepaid "tail policy" providing at least the same coverage and amounts, with deductibles substantially equivalent to those of the existing policies and containing terms and conditions that are
substantially equivalent to the insured than the existing policies maintained by ClubCorp and its subsidiaries with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred at or before the effective time,
including the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, subject to the cost limitations set forth in the merger agreement, and Parent will cause the surviving corporation to maintain such "tail policy"
in full force and effect for such six year period.

Delisting and Deregistration of ClubCorp Common Stock (see page 113) 

        As promptly as practicable following the completion of the merger, ClubCorp common stock will be delisted from the NYSE and deregistered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
"Exchange Act").

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE SPECIAL MEETING AND THE MERGER 

        The following are brief answers to certain questions that you may have regarding the merger, the special meeting and the proposals being considered at the special meeting. We urge you to carefully read
the remainder of this proxy statement because the information in this section does not provide all of the information that might be important to you with respect to the merger and the special meeting. Additional
important information is also contained in the annexes attached to this proxy statement and the documents referred to or incorporated by reference into this proxy statement.

Q. Why am I receiving these proxy materials? 

A. On July 9, 2017, ClubCorp entered into the merger agreement providing for the merger of Merger Sub with and into ClubCorp, pursuant to which ClubCorp will survive the merger as a wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent. A copy of the merger agreement is attached to this proxy statement as Annex A and is incorporated by reference herein. In order to complete the merger, ClubCorp stockholders
must vote to approve the merger agreement. The approval of this proposal by our stockholders is a condition to the consummation of the merger. See the section entitled "The Merger Agreement—
Conditions to the Closing of the Merger" beginning on page 117. You are receiving this proxy statement in connection with the solicitation by the Board of proxies of ClubCorp stockholders in favor of
the merger proposal.

You are also being asked to vote on a proposal to approve on a non-binding, advisory basis, compensation that will be paid or may become payable by ClubCorp to the named executive officers of
ClubCorp in connection with the merger and on a proposal that will give ClubCorp the authority to adjourn the special meeting for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies in favor of the merger
proposal if there are not sufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the merger agreement.

This proxy statement, which you should read carefully, contains important information about the merger, the merger agreement and the special meeting of our stockholders and the matters to be voted on
thereat. The enclosed materials allow you to submit a proxy to vote your shares without attending the special meeting and to ensure that your shares are represented and voted at the special meeting.

Your vote is very important. Even if you plan to attend the special meeting, we encourage you to submit a proxy as soon as possible

Q. What is the proposed transaction? 

A. If the merger proposal is approved by ClubCorp stockholders and the other conditions to the consummation of the merger contained in the merger agreement are satisfied or waived, Merger Sub will
merge with and into ClubCorp. ClubCorp will be the surviving corporation in the merger and will become privately held as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. 

Q. What will I receive in the merger if it is completed? 

A. Under the terms of the merger agreement, if the merger is completed, you will be entitled to receive $17.12 in cash, without interest and subject to any applicable withholding taxes, for each share of
ClubCorp common stock you own, which represents a premium of (i) approximately 30.7% of ClubCorp's closing stock price on July 7, 2017, the last trading day prior to the date on which public
announcement of the merger agreement was made and (ii) approximately 29.0% to the volume weighted average price ("VWAP") of ClubCorp common stock during the 30 days ended July 7, 2017. For
example, if you own 100 shares of ClubCorp common stock, you will be entitled to receive $1,712.00 in cash in exchange for your shares, without interest and subject to

any applicable withholding taxes. You will not be entitled to receive shares in the surviving corporation or in Parent.

Q. Where and when is the special meeting, and who may attend? What do I need to bring if I plan to attend the special meeting? 

A. The special meeting will be held at Hackberry Creek Country Club, 1901 West Royal Lane, The Ballroom, Irving, Texas 75063 on September 15, 2017 at 10:00 am, Central Time. The meeting room will
open at 9:30 am, Central Time, and registration will begin at that time. Stockholders of record as of the record date of the special meeting and their duly appointed proxy holders may attend the meeting.
Stockholders of record should bring the enclosed proxy card as evidence of ownership regardless of whether they intend to vote using such proxy card. Beneficial owners of shares held in "street name"
who have not obtained a proxy but who wish to attend the meeting should bring a copy of an account statement reflecting their ownership of ClubCorp common stock as of the record date and will only
be able to vote at the special meeting if they have a "legal proxy", executed in their favor, from their broker, bank or other nominee of the stockholder of record of their shares, giving them the right to
vote the shares at the special meeting. All stockholders and proxyholders should bring valid photo identification (such as a driver's license or passport).

Alternatively, you may make arrangements in advance by contacting our Investor Relations Department at (972) 888-7495 or by email at clubcorp.investor.relations@clubcorp.com.

No cameras, recording equipment, electronic devices, large bags, briefcases or packages will be permitted in the annual meeting.

Q. Who can vote at the Special Meeting? 

A. All ClubCorp stockholders of record as of the close of business on August 17, 2017, the record date for the special meeting, are entitled to receive notice of, attend and vote at the special meeting, or any
adjournment or postponement thereof. Each share of ClubCorp common stock issued and outstanding as of the record date is entitled to one vote on all matters that come before the special meeting. At
the close of business on August 3, 2017, there were 65,546,452 shares of ClubCorp common stock issued and outstanding, held by approximately 236 holders of record.

We are commencing our solicitation of proxies on or about August 8, 2017, which is before the record date. We will continue to solicit proxies until the date of the special meeting. Each holder of record
of ClubCorp common stock on the record date who has not yet received notice of the special meeting and a copy of the proxy statement prior to August 17, 2017 will receive such notice and a copy of
the proxy statement and have the opportunity to vote on the matters described in the proxy statement. Proxies delivered prior to the record date will be valid and effective so long as the stockholder
providing the proxy is a holder of record of ClubCorp common stock on the record date. If you are not a holder of record of ClubCorp common stock on the record date, any proxy you deliver will be
ineffective. If you deliver a proxy prior to the record date and remain a holder of record of ClubCorp common stock on the record date, you do not need to deliver another proxy after the record date. If
you deliver a proxy prior to the record date and do not revoke that proxy, your proxy will be deemed to cover the number of shares of ClubCorp common stock you own on the record date even if that
number is different from the number of shares of ClubCorp common stock you owned when you executed and delivered your proxy. Proxies received from persons who are not holders of record of
ClubCorp common stock on the record date will not be effective.

Table of Contents

Q. What matters will be voted on at the special meeting? 

A. At the special meeting, you will be asked to consider and vote on the following proposals: 

• the merger proposal; 

• the named executive officer merger-related compensation proposal; and 

• the adjournment proposal.

Stockholders may also be asked to transact such other business as may properly be brought before the special meeting or any adjournments or postponements of the special meeting, by or at the direction
of the Board. If other matters are properly presented at the special meeting for consideration and you are a stockholder of record as of the record date and have submitted a proxy card, the persons named
in your proxy card will have the discretion to vote on those matters for you.

Q. What is the position of the Board regarding the merger? 

A. After consideration of various factors, the Board has unanimously (i) determined that it is advisable, fair to and in the best interests of ClubCorp and our stockholders for ClubCorp to enter into the
merger, the merger agreement and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, (ii) declared advisable and approved the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the
merger agreement and (iii) resolved that the merger agreement be submitted to the ClubCorp stockholders for approval thereby in accordance with applicable law, the merger agreement and the bylaws
of ClubCorp at a special meeting of stockholders. 

Q. How does the Board recommend that I vote on the proposals? 

A. ClubCorp's Board unanimously recommends that you vote: 

• "FOR" the merger proposal; 

• "FOR" the named executive officer merger-related compensation proposal; and 

• "FOR" the adjournment proposal. 

Q. What vote is required to approve the merger proposal? 

A. Approval of the merger proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of ClubCorp common stock entitled to vote thereon. As a result, if you fail to return
your proxy card or otherwise fail to vote your shares at the special meeting, or if you abstain from voting on the merger proposal, it will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the merger proposal.
Broker "non-votes" will also have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the merger proposal. 

Q. What vote is required to approve the named executive officer merger-related compensation proposal and the adjournment proposal? 

A. If a quorum is present, the adjournment proposal will be approved only if the number of votes cast in favor of the adjournment proposal exceeds the number of votes cast in opposition to the adjournment
proposal.

The outcome of the named executive officer merger-related compensation proposal vote will not be binding on the Board. Therefore, there is no "required vote" on this proposal. The Board will consider
the outcome of this advisory vote in determining how to proceed following the special meeting.

Table of Contents

Abstentions and broker non-votes will not be counted as votes cast on the adjournment proposal or the named executive officer merger-related compensation proposal and therefore will not affect the
outcome of these proposals.

Q. Do you expect the merger to be taxable to ClubCorp stockholders? 

A. The exchange of ClubCorp common stock for cash in the merger generally will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes and may also be taxable under state, local or other tax laws.
You should read the section entitled "Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger" beginning on page 129. Tax matters can be complicated and the tax consequences of the merger to
you will depend on your particular circumstances. You should consult your tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger to you in your particular circumstances, as well
as tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or foreign taxing jurisdiction. 

Q. What other effects will the merger have on ClubCorp? 

A. If the merger is completed, ClubCorp common stock will be delisted from the NYSE and deregistered under the Exchange Act, and ClubCorp will no longer be required to file periodic reports with the
SEC with respect to ClubCorp common stock, in each case in accordance with applicable law, rules and regulations. Following the completion of the merger, ClubCorp common stock will no longer be
publicly traded and you will no longer have any interest in ClubCorp's future earnings or growth. In addition, each share of ClubCorp common stock you hold will represent only the right to receive
$17.12 in cash, without interest and subject to any applicable withholding taxes. ClubCorp will also become a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent at the effective time. 

Q. When is the merger expected to be completed? 

A. Assuming timely satisfaction of necessary closing conditions, including the approval by our stockholders of the merger proposal, the parties to the merger agreement expect to complete the merger in the
third quarter of this year. However, ClubCorp cannot assure completion by any particular date, if at all. Because the merger is subject to a number of conditions, including the receipt of stockholder
approval of the merger proposal and the completion of antitrust approval, the exact timing of the merger cannot be determined at this time and we cannot guarantee that the merger will be completed. 

Q. What happens if the merger is not completed? 

A. If the merger proposal is not approved by ClubCorp stockholders, or if the merger is not completed for any other reason, ClubCorp stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of ClubCorp
common stock in connection with the merger agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby. Instead, ClubCorp will remain an independent public company and shares of ClubCorp common stock
will continue to be listed and traded on the NYSE. If the merger agreement is terminated under specified circumstances, ClubCorp may be required to pay Parent a termination fee of $34.2 million, or
Parent may be required to pay ClubCorp a termination fee of $74.2 million. If the merger agreement is terminated as a result of a failure to obtain stockholder approval at a meeting where a vote for the
approval of the merger agreement was taken, ClubCorp will reimburse Parent an amount up to $6.25 million in respect of its documented out-of-pocket transaction-related expenses. See the section
entitled "The Merger Agreement—Termination Fees and Expenses" beginning on page 121 for a discussion of the circumstances under which either party will be required to pay a termination fee.

Q. How will our directors and executive officers vote on the merger proposal? 

A. The directors and officers of ClubCorp have informed ClubCorp that, as of the date of this proxy statement, they intend to vote their respective shares of ClubCorp common stock in favor of the merger
proposal.

As of August 3, 2017, the directors and executive officers of ClubCorp owned, in the aggregate, 1,951,147 shares of ClubCorp common stock, representing 3.0% of the issued and outstanding ClubCorp
common stock entitled to vote at that time.

Q. Do any of ClubCorp's directors or officers have interests in the merger that may differ from or be in addition to my interests as a stockholder? 

A. Yes. In considering the recommendation of the Board with respect to the merger proposal, you should be aware that our directors and executive officers have interests in the merger that are different
from, or in addition to, the interests of our stockholders generally. The Board was aware of and considered these differing interests, to the extent such interests existed at the time, among other matters, in
evaluating and negotiating the merger agreement and the merger, and in unanimously recommending that the merger agreement be approved by the ClubCorp stockholders. See the section entitled "The
Merger—Interests of ClubCorp's Executive Officers and Directors in the Merger" beginning on page 79 of this proxy statement. 

Q. Why am I being asked to consider and vote on the named executive officer merger-related compensation proposal? 

A. The SEC rules require ClubCorp to seek approval on a non-binding, advisory basis with respect to compensation that will be paid or may become payable to the named executive officers of ClubCorp in
connection with the merger. Approval of the named executive officer merger-related compensation proposal is not required to complete the merger. 

Q. Who is soliciting my vote? Who will pay for the cost of this proxy solicitation? 

A. The Board is soliciting your proxy, and ClubCorp will bear the cost of soliciting proxies. MacKenzie Partners, Inc. has been retained to assist with the solicitation of proxies. MacKenzie Partners, Inc.
will be paid approximately $25,000 and will be reimbursed for its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses for these and other advisory services in connection with the special meeting. On or about August 8,
2017, we will begin soliciting proxies from holders of record as of August 3, 2017 and will continue to solicit proxies until the date of the special meeting. Solicitation initially will be made by mail.
Forms of proxies and proxy materials may also be distributed through brokers, banks or other nominees to beneficial owners of shares of ClubCorp common stock, in which case these parties will be
reimbursed for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses. Proxies may also be solicited in person or by telephone, facsimile, electronic mail or other electronic medium by MacKenzie Partners, Inc. or,
without additional compensation, by certain of ClubCorp's directors, officers and employees. 

Q. What do I need to do now? If I am going to attend the special meeting, should I still submit a proxy? 

A. Carefully read and consider the information contained in and incorporated by reference into this proxy statement, including the attached annexes. Whether or not you expect to attend the special meeting
in person, please submit a proxy to vote your shares as promptly as possible so that your shares may be represented and voted at the special meeting.

Q. How do I vote if my shares are registered directly in my name? 

A. If your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, you are considered a "stockholder of record." Stockholders of record can vote their shares of ClubCorp common stock in the
following ways: 

• By Mail:  If you are a stockholder of record and elect to receive a paper copy of your proxy materials, you can vote by marking, dating and signing the proxy card and returning it by mail in the
enclosed postage-paid envelope. 

• By Internet or Telephone:  You can vote over the Internet at www.proxyvote.com by following the instructions on the proxy card or on the secured website. You can vote using a touchtone
telephone by calling 1-800-690-6903. Please have your proxy card available for reference because you will need the validation details that are located on your proxy card in order to submit your
vote via proxy over the Internet or by telephone. If you submit your vote via proxy over the Internet or by telephone, you do not have to mail in a proxy card. 

• At the Special Meeting:  If you are a stockholder of record planning to attend the special meeting and wish to vote your shares in person, we will give you a ballot at the meeting.

Even if you plan to be present at the special meeting, we encourage you to complete and mail the enclosed card to vote your shares by proxy or vote by telephone or the Internet. Telephone and Internet
voting facilities for stockholders will be available 24 hours a day and will close at 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on September 14, 2017. Proxy cards mailed by holders of record must be received no later
than September 14, 2017 in order to be counted in the vote.

If you beneficially own your shares and receive a voting instruction form, you can vote by following the instructions on your voting instruction form. Please refer to information from your bank, broker
or other nominee on how to submit voting instructions. Stockholders who own their shares in "street name" are not able to vote at the special meeting unless they have a proxy, executed in their favor,
from their broker, bank or other nominee of the stockholder of record of their shares.

Q. How do I vote if my shares are held in the name of my broker, bank or other nominee? 

A. If your shares are held by your broker, bank or other nominee, you are considered the beneficial owner of shares held in "street name" and you will receive a form from your broker, bank or other
nominee seeking instruction from you as to how your shares should be voted. If you beneficially own your shares and receive a voting instruction form, you can vote by following the instructions on
your voting instruction form. Please refer to information from your bank, broker or other nominee on how to submit voting instructions. Stockholders who own their shares in "street name" are not able
to vote at the special meeting unless they have a proxy, executed in their favor, from their broker, bank or other nominee of the stockholder of record of their shares. 

Q. What is a proxy? 

A. A proxy is your legal designation of another person, referred to as a "proxy," to vote your shares of ClubCorp common stock. The written document describing the matters to be considered and voted on
at the special meeting is called a "proxy statement." The document used to designate a proxy to vote your shares of ClubCorp common stock is called a "proxy card." 

Q. If a stockholder gives a proxy, how are the shares voted? 

A. Regardless of the method you choose to vote, the individuals named on the enclosed proxy card, or your proxies, will vote your shares in the way you indicate. When completing the Internet or telephone
process on the proxy card, you may specify whether your shares would be voted "FOR"

or "AGAINST" or to abstain from voting on all, some or none of the specific items of business to come before the special meeting.

If you properly sign and return your proxy card but do not mark the boxes showing how your shares should be voted on a matter, the shares represented by your properly signed proxy will be voted as
recommended by the Board with respect to each proposal.

Q. Can I change or revoke my proxy after it has been submitted? 

A. Yes. You can change or revoke your proxy at any time before the final vote at the special meeting. If you are the stockholder of record, you may change or revoke your proxy by: 

• submitting another proxy over the Internet or by telephone prior to 11:59 pm, Eastern Time, on September 14, 2017; 

• timely delivering a written notice that you are revoking your proxy to our Corporate Secretary; 

• timely delivering a valid, later-dated proxy card; or 

• attending the special meeting and notifying the election officials that you wish to revoke your proxy or voting by ballot in person at the special meeting. Simply attending the special meeting will
not, by itself, revoke your proxy.

If you are the beneficial owner of shares held in "street name," you will have to follow the instructions provided by your broker, bank or other nominee to change or revoke your voting instructions.

If you submit a proxy or provide instructions to vote your shares and do not thereafter validly revoke such proxy or change such instructions in accordance with one of the methods set forth above, your
shares will be represented and voted at the special meeting.

Q. How many shares of ClubCorp common stock must be present to constitute a quorum for the meeting? What if there is no quorum? 

A. Under our bylaws, the presence at the special meeting, in person or by proxy (regardless of whether the proxy has authority to vote on all matters), of the holders of a majority of the voting power of
ClubCorp common stock issued and outstanding at the close of business on the record date will constitute a quorum. Abstentions will be counted as present at the special meeting for purposes of
determining whether a quorum is present at the meeting, but broker "non-votes" will not be counted as present in person or by proxy at the special meeting. There must be a quorum for business to be
conducted at the special meeting. If a quorum is not present, a majority of the voting power represented or the person presiding at the special meeting may adjourn the special meeting to another place,
date or time until a quorum is represented. Failure of a quorum to be present at the special meeting will necessitate an adjournment or postponement of the special meeting and may subject ClubCorp to
additional expense. If the adjournment is for more than 60 days, a new record date must be set for the adjourned meeting and a notice of the adjourned meeting will be given to each stockholder of record
entitled to vote. 

Q. What if I abstain from voting on any proposal? 

A. If you attend the special meeting or submit (and do not thereafter validly revoke) a properly executed proxy card, even if you abstain from voting, your shares of ClubCorp common stock will still be
counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present at the special meeting, but will not be voted on the proposals from which you abstain, and such abstentions will not be considered a vote
"cast" at the special meeting. As a result, your abstention from voting will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the merger proposal, but will have no outcome on the effect

of the named executive officer merger-related compensation proposal and the adjournment proposal.

Q. Will my shares be voted if I do not sign and return my proxy card or vote by telephone or over the Internet or in person at the special meeting? 

A. If you are a stockholder of record of ClubCorp and you do not attend the special meeting, sign and return your proxy card, vote by submitting your proxy by telephone or vote by submitting your proxy
over the Internet, your shares will not be voted at the special meeting and will not be counted as present for purposes of determining whether a quorum exists. The failure to return your proxy card or
otherwise vote your shares at the special meeting will have no effect on the outcome of the named executive officer merger-related compensation proposal or the adjournment proposal. However, the
vote to approve the merger proposal is based on the number of votes entitled to be cast (which is based on the total number of shares of ClubCorp common stock outstanding as of the close of business
on the record date), not just the votes that are cast in person or by proxy at the special meeting. As a result, if you fail to return your proxy card or otherwise vote your shares at the special meeting, it will
have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the merger proposal.

You will have the right to receive the per share merger consideration if the merger proposal is approved and the merger is completed even if your shares are not voted at the special meeting. However, if
your shares are not voted at the special meeting, it will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the merger proposal.

Q. What is a broker non-vote? 

A. Broker non-votes are shares held in "street name" by brokers, banks and other nominees that are present or represented by proxy at the special meeting, but with respect to which the broker, bank or other
nominee is not instructed by the beneficial owner of such shares how to vote on a particular proposal and such broker, bank or other nominee does not have discretionary voting power on such proposal.
Because, under NYSE rules, brokers, banks and other nominees holding shares in "street name" do not have discretionary voting authority with respect to non-routine matters (which include the three
proposals described in this proxy statement), if a beneficial owner of shares of ClubCorp common stock held in "street name" does not give voting instructions to the broker, bank or other nominee, then
those shares will not be counted as present in person or by proxy at the special meeting. As a result, it is expected that there will not be any broker non-votes in connection with any of the three proposals
described in this proxy statement. The failure to issue voting instructions to your broker, bank or other nominee will have no effect on the outcome of the named executive officer merger-related
compensation proposal or adjournment proposal. Approval of the merger proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of ClubCorp common stock entitled
to vote thereon. As a result, if you fail to issue voting instructions to your broker, bank or other nominee, it will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the merger proposal. 

Q. Will my shares held in "street name" or another form of record ownership be combined for voting purposes with shares I hold of record? 

A. No. Because any shares you may hold in "street name" will be deemed to be held by a different stockholder than any shares you hold of record, any shares held in "street name" will not be combined for
voting purposes with shares you hold of record. Similarly, if you own shares in various registered forms, such as jointly with your spouse, as trustee of a trust or as custodian for a minor, you will
receive, and will need to sign and return, a separate proxy card for each of those shares because they are held in a different form of record ownership. Shares held by a corporation

or business entity must be voted by an authorized officer of the entity. Shares held in an individual retirement account must be voted under the rules governing the account.

Q. Am I entitled to exercise dissenter's rights under the NRS instead of receiving the per share merger consideration for my shares of ClubCorp common stock? 

A. No. Pursuant to the Section 92A.390 of the NRS, no holder of any shares of ClubCorp common stock will have or be entitled to assert dissenter's rights or any rights of appraisal as a result of or in
connection with the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger. 

Q. What happens if I sell my shares of ClubCorp common stock before the completion of the merger? 

A. If you transfer your shares of ClubCorp common stock, you will have transferred your right to receive the per share merger consideration in the merger. In order to receive the per share merger
consideration, you must hold your shares of ClubCorp common stock through the completion of the merger. 

Q. Should I send in my evidence of ownership now? 

A. No. After the merger is completed, you will receive transmittal materials from the paying agent for the merger with detailed written instructions for exchanging your shares of ClubCorp common stock
for the consideration to be paid to former ClubCorp stockholders in connection with the merger. If you are the beneficial owner of shares of ClubCorp common stock held in "street name," you may
receive instructions from your broker, bank or other nominee as to what action, if any, you need to take to effect the surrender of such shares. 

Q. What does it mean if I get more than one proxy card or voting instruction card? 

A. If your shares are registered differently or are held in more than one account, you will receive more than one proxy card or voting instruction card. Please complete and return all of the proxy cards or
voting instruction cards you receive (or submit each of your proxies over the Internet or by telephone) to ensure that all of your shares are voted. 

Q. What is householding and how does it affect me? 

A. The SEC's proxy rules permit companies and intermediaries, such as brokers and banks, to satisfy delivery requirements for proxy statements with respect to two or more stockholders sharing an address
by delivering a single proxy statement to those stockholders, unless contrary instructions have been received. This procedure reduces the amount of duplicate information that stockholders receive and
lowers printing and mailing costs for companies. Certain brokerage firms may have instituted householding for beneficial owners of common stock held through brokerage firms. If your family has
multiple accounts holding common stock, you may have already received a householding notification from your broker. You may decide at any time to revoke your decision to household, and thereby
receive multiple copies of proxy materials. If you wish to opt out of this procedure and receive a separate set of proxy materials in the future, or if you are receiving multiple copies and would like to
receive only one, you should contact your broker, trustee or other nominee or ClubCorp at the address and telephone number below. A separate copy of these proxy materials will be promptly delivered
upon request by contacting our Investor Relations Department by (a) mail at ClubCorp Holdings, Inc., Attention: Investor Relations, 3030 LBJ Freeway, Suite 600, Dallas, TX 75234, (b) telephone at
(972) 888-7495, or (c) e-mail at clubcorp.investor.relations@clubcorp.com.

Q. What will the holders of outstanding ClubCorp equity awards receive in the merger? 

A. Immediately prior to the effective time: 

• each outstanding Restricted Share will be cancelled and converted into the right of the holder of such Restricted Share to receive, $17.12 in cash plus any accrued dividends payable in respect of
such Restricted Share; 

• each outstanding PSU (other than any Road to 300 PSU, which will be cancelled without payment) will be cancelled and converted into the right of the holder of such PSU to receive, an amount
in cash equal to the product of (A) the target number of shares subject to such PSU immediately prior to the effective time multiplied by (B) $17.12, plus any accrued dividends payable in respect
of such PSU; and 

• each Road to 300 PSU will be cancelled without the payment of any consideration;

provided that the amounts payable with respect to such Restricted Shares or PSUs will vest and be payable by the surviving corporation, subject to the applicable holder's continued employment through

accordance with their terms at the effective time, (i) fifty percent (50%) upon the 60-day anniversary of the date that the effective time occurs (or the next payroll date following such anniversary) and
(ii) fifty percent (50%) at or promptly after the effective time, and (B) with respect to Restricted Shares or PSUs, as applicable, that are vested as of the effective time in accordance with their terms, at or
promptly following the effective time, and in all cases, without any interest for the period from the effective time until the applicable Restricted Share Payment Date or PSU Payment Date and less
applicable taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payment; provided, further, that if the employment of a holder of Restricted Shares or PSUs is, following the effective time, but prior to the
applicable Restricted Share Payment Date or PSU Payment Date, as applicable, terminated for any reason other than (x) by Parent or any of its affiliates (including the surviving corporation) for "cause"
(as such term is defined in the Stock Award Plan) or (y) by such holder without "good reason" (as such term is defined in the merger agreement), then, in the case of each of the foregoing clauses (x) and
(y), the payment described above will be accelerated to the next practicable payroll date after the date of such termination.

Q. When will ClubCorp announce the voting results of the special meeting, and where can I find the voting results? 

A. ClubCorp intends to announce the preliminary voting results at the special meeting, and will report the final voting results of the special meeting in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC
within four business days after the meeting. All reports that ClubCorp files with the SEC are publicly available when filed. 

Q. Where can I find more information about ClubCorp? 

A. You can find more information about us from various sources described in the section entitled "Where You Can Find More Information" beginning on page 132 of this proxy statement.

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

        This proxy statement contains forward-looking statements, within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements with respect to the proposed transaction and the
Merger, the benefits of the proposed transaction and the anticipated timing of the proposed transaction. Forward-looking statements can be generally identified by the use of words such as "may," "should,"
"expects," "plans," "anticipates," "believes," "estimates," "predicts," "intends," "continue" or similar terminology. These statements reflect only ClubCorp's current expectations and are not guarantees of future
performance or results. Forward-looking information involves risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in, or reasonably inferred
from, such statements. Specific factors that could cause actual results to differ from results contemplated by forward-looking statements include, among others, the occurrence of any event, change or other
circumstances that could give rise to the termination of the merger agreement, the inability to complete the merger due to the failure to obtain stockholder approval of the merger agreement or the failure to
satisfy other conditions to completion of the merger, including that a governmental entity may prohibit, delay or refuse to grant approval for the consummation of the transaction; risks regarding the failure of
Parent to obtain the necessary financing to complete the merger; risks related to disruption of management's attention from ClubCorp's ongoing business operations due to the transaction; the effect of the
announcement of the merger on ClubCorp's relationships with its members, operating results and business generally; the risk that certain approvals or consents will not be received in a timely manner or that the
merger will not be consummated in a timely manner; the risk of exceeding the expected costs of the merger; adverse changes in U.S. and non-U.S. governmental laws and regulations; adverse developments in
ClubCorp's relationships with its employees; capital market conditions, including availability of funding sources for us; changes in our credit ratings; risks related to our increased indebtedness, including our
ability to meet certain financial covenants in our debt instruments; the risk of litigation, including stockholder litigation in connection with the proposed transaction, and the impact of any adverse legal
judgments, fines, penalties, injunctions or settlements; and volatility in the market price of our stock.

        Therefore, caution should be taken not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements. We assume no obligation (and specifically disclaim any such obligation) to publicly update or revise
any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. For additional discussion of potential risks and uncertainties that could impact our
results of operations or financial position, refer to Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 27, 2016, as amended, and Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Form 10-Q

THE SPECIAL MEETING 

        This proxy statement is being provided to the ClubCorp stockholders as part of a solicitation by the Board of proxies for use at the special meeting to be held at the time and place specified below, and at
any properly convened meeting following an adjournment or postponement of the special meeting.

Date, Time and Place 

        The special meeting is scheduled to be held at Hackberry Creek Country Club, 1901 West Royal Lane, The Ballroom, Irving, Texas 75063 on September 15, 2017 at 10:00 am, Central Time.

Purpose of the Special Meeting 

        At the special meeting, ClubCorp stockholders will be asked to consider and vote on the following proposals:

• the merger proposal, which is further described in the sections entitled "The Merger Proposal (Proposal 1)", "The Merger" and "The Merger Agreement," beginning on pages 37, 40 and 96,
respectively, and a copy of the merger agreement is attached to this proxy statement as Annex A and is incorporated herein by reference; 

• the named executive officer merger-related compensation proposal, which is further described in the sections entitled "The Merger—Interests of ClubCorp's Executive Officers and Directors in
the Merger" and "Advisory Vote On Named Executive Officer Merger-Related Compensation Proposal (Proposal 2)" beginning on pages 79 and 38, respectively; and 

• the adjournment proposal, which is further described in the section entitled "The Adjournment Proposal (Proposal 3)" beginning on page 39.

        Stockholders may also be asked to transact such other business as may properly be brought before the special meeting or any adjournments or postponements of the special meeting, by or at the direction of
the Board.

        Approval of the merger proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of ClubCorp common stock entitled to vote thereon. As a result, if you fail to return your
proxy card or otherwise fail to vote your shares at the special meeting, or if you abstain from voting on the merger proposal, it will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the merger proposal. Broker "non-
votes" will also have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the merger proposal. If the ClubCorp stockholders fail to approve the merger proposal, the merger will not occur.

        The vote on the named executive officer merger-related compensation proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote to approve the merger proposal. Accordingly, a stockholder may vote to approve
the merger proposal and vote not to approve the named executive officer merger-related compensation proposal, and vice versa. Because the vote on the named executive officer merger-related compensation
proposal is only advisory in nature, it will not be binding on ClubCorp, Parent or the surviving corporation. Accordingly, because ClubCorp is contractually obligated to pay such merger-related compensation,
the compensation will be payable, subject only to the conditions applicable thereto, if the merger proposal is approved, regardless of the outcome of the advisory vote.

        Other than the matters described above, ClubCorp does not expect a vote to be taken on any other matters at the special meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof. However, if any other matters
are properly brought before the special meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof for consideration, the holders of the proxies will have discretion to vote on such matters in accordance with their
best judgment.

Recommendation of the Board of Directors 

        The Board has unanimously determined that the merger, the merger agreement and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, are advisable, fair to and in the best interests of ClubCorp
and its stockholders and has unanimously approved and declared advisable the merger, the merger agreement and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. The Board made its determination
after consideration of a number of factors more fully described in the section entitled "The Merger—Recommendation of the Board and Reasons for the Merger" beginning on page 56.

        The Board unanimously recommends that the ClubCorp stockholders vote "FOR" the merger proposal, "FOR" the named executive officer merger-related compensation proposal and "FOR"
the adjournment proposal.

Record Date; Stockholders Entitled to Vote 

        Only holders of record of ClubCorp common stock at the close of business on August 17, 2017, the record date for the special meeting, will be entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the special meeting and
any adjournments or postponements of the special meeting. At the close of business on August 3, 2017, 65,546,452 shares of ClubCorp common stock were issued and outstanding, held by approximately 236
holders of record.

        Holders of ClubCorp common stock are entitled to one vote for each share of ClubCorp common stock they own at the close of business on the record date.

        We are commencing our solicitation of proxies on or about August 8, 2017, which is before the record date. We will continue to solicit proxies until the date of the special meeting. Each holder of record of
ClubCorp common stock on the record date who has not yet received notice of the meeting and a copy of the proxy statement prior to August 17, 2017 will receive such notice and a copy of the proxy statement
and have the opportunity to vote on the matters described in the proxy statement. Proxies delivered prior to the record date will be valid and effective so long as the stockholder providing the proxy is a holder of
record of ClubCorp common stock on the record date. If you are not a holder of record of ClubCorp common stock on the record date, any proxy you deliver will be ineffective. If you deliver a proxy prior to
the record date and remain a holder of record of ClubCorp common stock on the record date, you do not need to deliver another proxy after the record date. If you deliver a proxy prior to the record date and do
not revoke that proxy, your proxy will be deemed to cover the number of shares of ClubCorp common stock you own on the record date even if that number is different from the number of shares of ClubCorp
common stock you owned when you executed and delivered your proxy. Proxies received from persons who are not holders of record of ClubCorp common stock on the record date will not be effective.

Quorum 

        Under our bylaws, the presence at the special meeting, in person or by proxy (regardless of whether the proxy has authority to vote on all matters), of the holders of a majority of the voting power of
ClubCorp common stock issued and outstanding at the close of business on the record date will constitute a quorum. Abstentions will be counted as present at the special meeting for purposes of determining
whether a quorum is present at the meeting, but broker "non-votes" will not be counted as present in person or by proxy at the special meeting. There must be a quorum for business to be conducted at the
special meeting. Failure of a quorum to be present at the special meeting will necessitate an adjournment or postponement of the special meeting and may subject ClubCorp to additional expense.

        If you submit (and do not thereafter validly revoke) a properly executed proxy card, even if you abstain from voting, your shares of ClubCorp common stock will be counted for purposes of

Table of Contents

determining whether a quorum is present at the special meeting. In the event that a quorum is not present at the special meeting or additional votes must be solicited to approve the merger agreement, the
meeting may be adjourned or postponed to solicit additional proxies.

Required Vote 

        Approval of the merger proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of ClubCorp common stock entitled to vote thereon. As a result, if you fail to return your
proxy card or otherwise fail to vote your shares at the special meeting, or if you abstain from voting on the merger proposal, it will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the merger proposal. Broker "non-
votes" will also have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the merger proposal.

        The outcome of the named executive officer merger-related compensation proposal vote will not be binding on ClubCorp, the Board, Parent or the surviving corporation. Therefore, there is no "required
vote" on this proposal. Accordingly, because ClubCorp is contractually obligated to pay such merger-related compensation, the compensation will be payable, subject only to the conditions applicable thereto, if
the merger proposal is approved, regardless of the outcome of the advisory vote.

        The adjournment proposal will be approved only if the number of votes cast in favor of the adjournment proposal exceeds the number of votes cast in opposition to the adjournment proposal.

        Abstentions and broker non-votes will not be counted as votes cast on the adjournment proposal or the named executive officer merger-related compensation proposal and therefore will not affect the
outcome of these proposals.

Abstentions and Broker Non-Votes 

        An abstention occurs when a stockholder attends a meeting, either in person or by proxy, but abstains from voting. At the special meeting, abstentions will be counted as present for purposes of determining
whether a quorum exists. Abstaining from voting will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the merger proposal.

        If no instruction as to how to vote is given (including no instruction to abstain from voting) in an executed, duly returned and not revoked proxy, the proxy will be voted "FOR" (i) approval of the merger
proposal, (ii) approval of the named executive officer merger-related compensation proposal and (iii) approval of the adjournment proposal.

        Broker non-votes are shares held in "street name" by brokers, banks and other nominees that are present or represented by proxy at the special meeting, but with respect to which the broker, bank or other
nominee is not instructed by the beneficial owner of such shares how to vote on a particular proposal and such broker, bank or other nominee does not have discretionary voting power on such proposal.
Because, under NYSE rules, brokers, banks and other nominees holding shares in "street name" do not have discretionary voting authority with respect to non-routine matters (which include the three proposals
described in this proxy statement), if a beneficial owner of shares of ClubCorp common stock held in "street name" does not give voting instructions to the broker, bank or other nominee, then those shares will
not be counted as present in person or by proxy at the special meeting. As a result, it is expected that there will not be any broker non-votes in connection with any of the three proposals described in this proxy
statement. However, approval of the merger proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of ClubCorp common stock entitled to vote thereon. As a result, if you
fail to issue voting instructions to your broker, bank or other nominee, it will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the merger proposal.

Failure to Vote 

        If you are a stockholder of record and you do not sign and return your proxy card or vote over the Internet, by telephone or in person at the special meeting, your shares will not be voted at the special
meeting, will not be counted as present in person or by proxy at the special meeting and will not be counted as present for purposes of determining whether a quorum exists.

        As discussed above, under NYSE rules, brokers and other record holders do not have discretionary voting authority with respect to any of the three proposals described in this proxy statement. Accordingly,
if you are the beneficial owner of shares held in "street name" and you do not issue voting instructions to your broker, bank or other nominee, your shares will not be voted at the special meeting and will not be
counted as present in person or by proxy at the special meeting or counted as present for purposes of determining whether a quorum exists.

        A failure to vote will have no effect on the outcome of the named executive officer merger-related compensation proposal or the adjournment proposal. However, approval of the merger proposal requires
the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of ClubCorp common stock entitled to vote thereon. As a result, if you fail to issue voting instructions to your broker, bank or other
nominee, it will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the merger proposal.

Voting by ClubCorp's Directors and Executive Officers 

        At the close of business on August 3, 2017, directors and executive officers of ClubCorp and their affiliates were entitled to vote 1,951,147 shares of ClubCorp common stock, or approximately 3.0% of the
shares of ClubCorp common stock issued and outstanding on that date. ClubCorp's directors and executive officers have informed us that they intend to vote their respective shares in favor of the merger
proposal and the other proposals to be considered at the special meeting, although none of ClubCorp's directors and executive officers is obligated to do so.

Voting at the Special Meeting 

        If your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, you are considered a "stockholder of record." Stockholders of record can vote their shares of ClubCorp common stock in the
following ways: (i) by completing, signing and returning by mail the enclosed proxy card authorizing the persons named as proxies on the proxy card to vote your shares at the special meeting, (ii) by submitting
a proxy by telephone, (iii) by submitting a proxy over the Internet or (iv) attending the special meeting and voting your shares in person. Even if you plan to be present at the special meeting, ClubCorp
encourages you to complete and mail the enclosed card to vote your shares by proxy or vote by telephone or the Internet to ensure that your shares are represented and voted at the meeting. Telephone and
Internet voting facilities for stockholders will be available 24 hours a day and will close at 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on September 14, 2017. Proxy cards mailed by holders of record must be received no later
than September 14, 2017 in order to be counted in the vote.

• By Mail:  If you are a stockholder of record and elect to receive a paper copy of your proxy materials, you can vote by marking, dating and signing the proxy card and returning it by mail in the
enclosed postage-paid envelope. 

• By Internet or Telephone:  You can vote over the Internet at www.proxyvote.com by following the instructions on the proxy card or on the secured website. You can vote using a touchtone
telephone by calling 1-800-690-6903. Please have your proxy card available for reference because you will need the validation details that are located on your proxy card in order to submit your
vote via proxy over the Internet or by telephone. If you submit your vote via proxy over the Internet or by telephone, you do not have to mail in a proxy card.

• At the Special Meeting:  If you are a stockholder of record planning to attend the special meeting and wish to vote your shares in person, we will give you a ballot at the meeting.

        If your shares are held by your broker, bank or other nominee, you are considered the beneficial owner of shares held in "street name" and you will receive a form from your broker, bank or other nominee
seeking instruction from you as to how your shares should be voted. You should instruct your broker, bank or other nominee how to vote your shares on each proposal in accordance with your voting instruction
form. If you beneficially own your shares and receive a voting instruction form, you can vote by following the instructions on your voting instruction form. Please refer to information from your bank, broker or
other nominee on how to submit voting instructions. Stockholders who own their shares in "street name" are not able to vote at the special meeting unless they have a proxy, executed in their favor, from their
broker, bank or other nominee of the stockholder of record of their shares giving them the right to vote the shares at the special meeting.

        Stockholders of record as of the record date for the special meeting and their duly appointed proxy holders may attend the special meeting. If you are a stockholder of record, you should bring the
admission ticket which is part of the proxy card and a valid form of photo identification (such as a driver's license or passport). If you are a beneficial owner, you must bring an account statement or letter from
your bank, broker or nominee showing that you own ClubCorp common stock as of the record date along with a valid form of photo identification (such as a driver's license or passport).

Revocation of Proxies 

        You can change or revoke your proxy at any time before the final vote at the special meeting. If you are the stockholder of record, you may revoke your proxy by:

• submitting another proxy over the Internet or by telephone prior to 11:59, Eastern Time, on September 14, 2017; 

• timely delivering a written notice that you are revoking your proxy to our Secretary; 

• timely delivering a valid, later-dated proxy; or 

• attending the special meeting and notifying the election officials that you wish to revoke your proxy to vote in person. Simply attending the special meeting will not, by itself, revoke your proxy.

        If you are the beneficial owner of shares held in "street name," you will have to follow the instructions provided by your broker, bank or other nominee to change or revoke your voting instructions.

        If you submit a proxy or provide instructions to vote your shares and do not thereafter validly revoke such proxy or change such instructions in accordance with one of the methods set forth above, your
shares will be represented and voted at the special meeting.

Solicitation of Proxies 

        The Board is soliciting your proxy, and ClubCorp will bear the cost of soliciting proxies. MacKenzie Partners, Inc. has been retained to assist with the solicitation of proxies. MacKenzie Partners, Inc. will
be paid approximately $25,000 and will be reimbursed for its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses for these and other advisory services in connection with the special meeting. On or about August 8, 2017, we
will begin soliciting proxies from holders of record as of August 3, 2017 and will continue to solicit proxies until the date of the special meeting. Solicitation initially will be made by mail. Forms of proxies and
proxy materials may also be distributed through brokers, banks and other nominees to the beneficial owners of shares of ClubCorp common stock, in which case these parties will be reimbursed for their
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses. Proxies may also be solicited in

person or by telephone, facsimile, electronic mail, or other electronic medium by MacKenzie Partners, Inc. or, without additional compensation by certain of ClubCorp's directors, officers and employees.

Adjournment 

        In addition to the merger proposal and the named executive officer merger-related compensation proposal, ClubCorp stockholders are also being asked to approve the adjournment proposal, which will give
ClubCorp authority to adjourn the special meeting for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies in favor of the merger proposal if there are not sufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the
merger proposal. If a quorum is not present, a majority of the voting power represented or the person presiding at the special meeting may adjourn the special meeting to another place, date or time until a
quorum is represented. Failure of a quorum to be present at the special meeting will necessitate an adjournment or postponement of the special meeting and may subject ClubCorp to additional expense. If the
adjournment is for more than 60 days, a new record date must be set for the adjourned meeting and a notice of the adjourned meeting will be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote. In addition, the
special meeting could be postponed before it commences, subject to the terms of the merger agreement. If the special meeting is adjourned or postponed, stockholders who have already submitted their proxies
will be able to revoke them at any time prior to the final vote on the proposals. If you return a proxy and do not indicate how you wish to vote on the adjournment proposal, your shares will be voted in favor of
the adjournment proposal.

        The Board unanimously recommends a vote "FOR" the adjournment proposal, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies.

Other Information 

        You should not send documents representing ClubCorp common stock with the proxy card. If the merger is completed, the paying agent for the merger will send you transmittal materials and instructions
for exchanging your shares of ClubCorp common stock for the consideration to be paid to the former ClubCorp stockholders in connection with the merger.

Questions 

        If you have more questions about the merger or how to submit your proxy, or if you need additional copies of this proxy statement or the enclosed proxy card or voting instructions, please contact
MacKenzie Partners, Inc., our proxy solicitor, by calling (800) 322-2885.

THE MERGER PROPOSAL
(PROPOSAL 1) 

        We are asking you to approve the merger agreement. For a summary of and detailed information regarding this proposal, see the information about the merger agreement throughout this proxy statement,
including the information set forth under the sections of this proxy statement captioned "The Merger" and "The Merger Agreement." A copy of the merger agreement is attached as Annex A to this proxy
statement. You are urged to read the merger agreement carefully and in its entirety.

        The Board unanimously recommends that the ClubCorp stockholders vote "FOR" the merger proposal.

ADVISORY VOTE ON NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICER MERGER-RELATED
COMPENSATION PROPOSAL

(PROPOSAL 2) 

        In accordance with Section 14A of the Exchange Act, ClubCorp is providing its stockholders with the opportunity to cast a non-binding, advisory vote on the compensation that will be paid or may become
payable to the named executive officers of ClubCorp in connection with the merger, the value of which is set forth in the table entitled "Golden Parachute Compensation" on page 86. This proposal, commonly
known as "say-on-golden parachutes" is referred to in this proxy statement as the named executive officer merger-related compensation proposal. As required by Section 14A of the Exchange Act, ClubCorp is
asking its stockholders to vote on the adoption of the following resolution:

        "RESOLVED, that the compensation that may be paid or become payable to ClubCorp's named executive officers in connection with the merger, as disclosed under "The Merger—Interests of
ClubCorp's Executive Officers and Directors in the Merger—Potential Merger-Related Payments to Named Executive Officers," including the table, associated footnotes and narrative discussion, is
hereby APPROVED."

        The vote on the named executive officer merger-related compensation proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote on the merger proposal. Accordingly, you may vote to approve the merger proposal
and vote not to approve the named executive officer merger-related compensation proposal, and vice versa. Because the vote to approve the named executive officer merger-related compensation proposal is
only advisory in nature, it will not be binding on ClubCorp, Parent or the surviving corporation. Accordingly, because ClubCorp is contractually obligated to pay such merger-related compensation, the
compensation will be payable, subject only to the conditions applicable thereto, if the merger proposal is approved, regardless of the outcome of the advisory vote.

        There is no "required vote" on this proposal. Abstentions and broker non-votes will not be counted as votes cast on the named executive officer merger-related compensation proposal and therefore will not
affect the outcome of this proposal.

        The Board unanimously recommends that the ClubCorp stockholders vote "FOR" the named executive officer merger-related compensation proposal.

ADJOURNMENT PROPOSAL
(PROPOSAL 3) 

        ClubCorp stockholders are being asked to approve a proposal that will give us authority from the stockholders to adjourn the special meeting for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies in favor of the
merger proposal if there are not sufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the merger proposal. If a quorum is not present, the person presiding at the special meeting or the stockholders acting
by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of ClubCorp common stock present or represented by proxy at the special meeting and entitled to vote thereon may adjourn the special meeting
to another place, date or time.

        In addition, the Board could postpone the special meeting before it commences, subject to the terms of the merger agreement. If the special meeting is adjourned or postponed, stockholders who have
already submitted their proxies will be able to revoke them at any time prior to the final vote on the proposals. If the adjournment is for more than 60 days, a new record date must be set for the adjourned
meeting and a notice of the adjourned meeting will be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote.

        The adjournment proposal will be approved only if the number of votes cast in favor of the adjournment proposal exceeds the number of votes cast in opposition to the adjournment proposal. Abstentions
and broker non-votes will not be counted as votes cast on the adjournment proposal and therefore will not affect the outcome of this proposal. If you sign and return a proxy and do not indicate how you wish to
vote on the adjournment proposal, your shares will be voted in favor of the adjournment proposal. ClubCorp does not intend to call a vote on this proposal if the merger proposal has been approved at the special
meeting.

        The Board unanimously recommends that the ClubCorp stockholders vote "FOR" the adjournment proposal.

THE MERGER 

        The discussion of the merger in this proxy statement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the merger agreement, a copy of which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex A and hereby
incorporated by reference into this proxy statement.

Structure of the Merger 

        Subject to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement and in accordance with the NRS, at the effective time, Merger Sub will merge with and into ClubCorp, the separate corporate existence of
Merger Sub will cease and ClubCorp will survive the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent.

Merger Consideration 

        At the effective time, each share of ClubCorp common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time (other than shares (i) owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any other direct or indirect
wholly owned subsidiary of Parent immediately prior to the effective time, and in each case not held on behalf of third parties, (ii) owned by ClubCorp, including shares held in treasury by ClubCorp, and in
each case not held in a fiduciary capacity on behalf of third parties, and (iii) owned by any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of ClubCorp) will be automatically converted into the right to receive
$17.12 in cash, without interest and subject to any applicable withholding taxes. After the merger is completed, holders of ClubCorp common stock as of immediately prior to the effective time will have only
the right to receive a cash payment in respect of their shares of ClubCorp common stock, and will no longer have any rights as holders of ClubCorp common stock, including voting or other rights. Shares of
ClubCorp common stock held by ClubCorp, including shares held in treasury by ClubCorp, or by Parent, Merger Sub or any other direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (in each case, not held on
behalf of third parties) as of immediately prior to the effective time will be cancelled at the effective time. Shares of ClubCorp common stock owned by any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of
ClubCorp will remain outstanding, except that the number of such shares owned by such subsidiaries may be adjusted following the merger to maintain relative ownership percentage.

Treatment of ClubCorp Equity Awards 

        The merger agreement provides that, immediately prior to the effective time:

• each outstanding Restricted Share will, automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and converted into the right of the holder of such Restricted
Share to receive $17.12 in cash plus any accrued dividends payable in respect of such Restricted Share; 

• each outstanding PSU (other than any Road to 300 PSU) will automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and converted into the right of the
holder of such PSU to receive, an amount in cash equal to the product of (A) the target number of shares subject to such PSU immediately prior to the effective time multiplied by (B) $17.12,
plus any accrued dividend equivalents payable in respect of such PSU; and 

• each Road to 300 PSU will be cancelled without the payment of any consideration;

provided that the amounts payable with respect to such Restricted Shares or PSUs will vest and be payable by the surviving corporation, subject to the applicable holder's continued employment through the
applicable payment date (in the case of PSUs) or vesting date (in the case of Restricted Shares), as applicable, (A) with respect to Restricted Shares or PSUs, as applicable, that are not vested in accordance with
their terms at the effective time, (i) fifty percent (50%) upon the 60-day anniversary of the date that the effective time occurs (or the next payroll date following such anniversary) and (ii) fifty

percent (50%) at or promptly after the effective time, and (B) with respect to Restricted Shares or PSUs, as applicable, that are vested as of the effective time in accordance with their terms, at or promptly
following the effective time, and in all cases, without any interest for the period from the effective time until the applicable Restricted Share Payment Date or PSU Payment Date and less applicable taxes
required to be withheld with respect to such payment; provided, further, that if the employment of a holder of Restricted Shares or PSUs is, following the effective time, but prior to the applicable Restricted
Share Payment Date or PSU Payment Date, as applicable, terminated for any reason other than (x) by Parent or any of its affiliates (including the surviving corporation) for "cause" (as such term is defined in
the Stock Award Plan) or (y) by such holder without "good reason" (as such term is defined in the merger agreement), then, in the case of each of the foregoing clauses (x) and (y), the payment described above
will be accelerated to the next practicable payroll date after the date of such termination.

Effects on ClubCorp if the Merger Is Not Completed 

        If the merger proposal is not approved by ClubCorp stockholders or if the merger is not completed for any other reason, ClubCorp stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares in connection
with the merger agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby. Instead, ClubCorp will remain an independent public company and shares of ClubCorp common stock will continue to be listed and traded
on the NYSE. In addition, if the merger is not completed, ClubCorp expects that management will operate ClubCorp's business in a manner similar to that in which it is being operated today and that ClubCorp
stockholders will continue to be subject to the same risks and opportunities to which they are currently subject, including, without limitation, risks related to the highly competitive industry in which ClubCorp
operates and adverse economic conditions.

        Furthermore, if the merger is not completed, and depending on the circumstances that would have caused the merger not to be completed, it is likely that the price of ClubCorp's common stock will decline
significantly. If that were to occur, it is uncertain when, if ever, the price of ClubCorp's common stock would return to the price at which it trades as of the date of this proxy statement.

        Accordingly, if the merger is not completed, there can be no assurance as to the effect of these risks and opportunities on the future value of your shares of ClubCorp common stock. If the merger is not
completed, the Board will continue to evaluate and review ClubCorp's business operations, properties, dividend policy and capitalization, among other things, make such changes as are deemed appropriate. If
the merger proposal is not approved by ClubCorp stockholders or if the merger is not completed for any other reason, there can be no assurance that any other transaction acceptable to ClubCorp will be offered
or that ClubCorp's business, prospects or results of operation will not be adversely impacted.

        Further, upon termination of the merger agreement, under certain specified circumstances, ClubCorp may be required to pay a termination fee of $34.2 million to Parent pursuant to the terms and conditions
of the merger agreement. Upon termination of the merger agreement, under certain circumstances, ClubCorp may be required to reimburse Parent, Merger Sub and their respective affiliates for up to
$2.5 million of certain fees and expenses incurred in connection with the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, or in the event that the ClubCorp stockholders fail to approve the merger
agreement, up to $6.25 million of its transaction-related expenses, in each case, pursuant to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement. Upon termination of the merger agreement, under certain specified
circumstances, Parent may be required to pay ClubCorp a reverse termination fee in an aggregate amount of $74.2 million and enforcement expenses pursuant to the terms and conditions of the merger
agreement. See the section entitled "The Merger Agreement—Termination Fees and Expenses" beginning on page 121 for a discussion of the circumstances under which either party will be required to pay a
termination fee.

Background of the Merger 

        As part of its ongoing evaluation of our business, the Board, together with management, regularly reviews opportunities to enhance stockholder value. Our long-term strategy includes pursuing organic
membership growth through a variety of methods, including, for example, the introduction and continued promotion of our Optimal Network Experience product, use of a disciplined capital investment strategy
to "reinvent" certain of our existing clubs to promote greater usage and improve member retention, and the leveraging of our operational expertise to identify acquisition targets that present opportunities to
expand our Golf and Country Club and Business, Sports and Alumni Club portfolio. For fiscal years 2010 through 2016, we spent approximately $400 million to acquire new golf and country clubs and for
fiscal years 2007 through 2016, we invested more than $690 million to build new, reinvent, upgrade, maintain and replace existing facilities and amenities. In the 24-week period ended June 13, 2017, we
acquired four new golf and country clubs for $17.8 million (including the assumption of debt) and invested $52.5 million in capital expenditures.

        As part of that ongoing evaluation, the Board and management regularly review our prospects as a standalone public company and evaluate and consider, in light of our financial performance and
applicable market, economic, competitive and other conditions and factors, a wide range of other strategic alternatives, including acquisitions, business combinations, strategic partnerships and financing
alternatives. In addition, we engage with our stockholders on an ongoing basis to encourage dialogue and understand our stockholders' perspectives.

        During the first nine months of 2016, representatives from various investment banks contacted members of the Board and management to offer their assistance and ideas to enhance stockholder value. Also
during this period, representatives of several private equity and financial investors contacted members of the Board and management to express an interest in learning more about, and exploring a potential
transaction with, ClubCorp. The Board was informed of these contacts as they occurred, and, at the direction of the Board, management conducted certain preliminary meetings described below.

        On March 30, 2016, a representative of a private equity firm (which we refer to as "Party A") met, at Party A's request, with management and John Beckert, Chairman of the Board, to learn more about
ClubCorp. On an unsolicited basis, the representative of Party A suggested the possibility of an investment by Party A in ClubCorp.

        Also on March 30, 2016, a representative of another private equity firm (which we refer to as "Party B") met, at Party B's request, with management to learn more about ClubCorp. On an unsolicited basis,
the representative of Party B suggested the possibility of an investment by Party B in ClubCorp.

        On April 6 and 7, 2016, a representative of a private equity firm (which we refer to as "Party C") met, at Party C's request, with management to learn more about ClubCorp. On an unsolicited basis, the
representative of Party C suggested the possibility of an investment by Party C in ClubCorp. Party C's representative also met with Mr. Beckert, and Doug Brooks, a director.

        On April 13, 2016, Eric Affeldt, our Chief Executive Officer, held separate follow-up calls with representatives of Party A and Party C.

        On April 19, 2016, Mr. Affeldt received a call from an executive of a financial investor (who we refer to as "Executive A"). On an unsolicited basis, Executive A suggested the possibility of an investment
by a group of financial investors (which we refer to collectively as "Party D") led by Executive A and an executive from one of the other financial investors comprising Party D (who we refer to as "Executive
B").

        On April 26, 2016, the Board held a meeting, with management present, at which potential strategic alternatives available to ClubCorp, including the above contacts and expressions of interest

from potential private equity and financial investors, were discussed. The Board also invited an investment bank (which we refer to as "Bank A"), which previously signed a non-disclosure agreement with
ClubCorp, to join this meeting so that Bank A could discuss with the Board various potential strategic alternatives that such investment bank believed the Board may wish to consider. The Board authorized
management to continue to have preliminary conversations with parties expressing inbound interest in a potential transaction or investment involving ClubCorp if, in management's judgment, such party's
interest was serious and such party's ability to undertake a transaction was credible and to update the Board on the status of those discussions. The Board also requested that Bank A participate in its June 2016
Board meeting to further discuss potential strategic alternatives with the Board.

        On May 3, 2016, members of management met again at Party A's request with representatives of Party A to continue their discussions about ClubCorp.

        On May 10, 2016, members of management met again at Party B's request with representatives of Party B to continue their discussions about ClubCorp.

        On May 18, 2016, representatives of another investment bank arranged for representatives of a foreign strategic investor (which we refer to as "Party E") to meet with members of management. During this
meeting, the parties discussed their respective business operations in order to determine whether there were potential synergies in a joint venture or other strategic alliance between ClubCorp and Party E.

        On June 10, 2016, the Board held a meeting at which representatives of Bank A and representatives of Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP ("Simpson Thacher," and solely for the purposes of this section
"The Merger—Background of the Merger", the "legal advisors") were present by invitation of the Board. Bank A reviewed potential alternative financing and strategic alternatives available to ClubCorp.
Representatives of Simpson Thacher reviewed with the Board its fiduciary duties to ClubCorp and its stockholders generally and in connection with its consideration of potential strategic alternatives. At the
meeting, the Board also discussed the interest expressed by various parties to date. The Board determined to continue to discuss potential alternative financings and strategic alternatives available to ClubCorp,
and directed management to continue to have preliminary conversations with any parties expressing inbound interest in a potential transaction or investment involving ClubCorp if, in management's judgment,
such party's interest was serious and such party's ability to undertake a transaction was credible and to update the Board on the status of those discussions.

        On August 1, 2016, Mr. Affeldt met with a representative of Party C to further discuss Party C's interest in ClubCorp.

        On September 1, 2016, representatives of a foreign-based financial investor (which we refer to as "Party F") met with management to learn more about ClubCorp.

        On September 15, 2016, FrontFour Capital Group LLC (together with its affiliates, "FrontFour Capital"), an investor in ClubCorp, sent a public letter to Mr. Affeldt and the Board expressing concerns over
ClubCorp's recent performance and requesting that the Board pursue strategic alternatives, including a potential sale of ClubCorp, in order to unlock stockholder value. ClubCorp actively engaged with its
stockholders and held several discussions with FrontFour and other stockholders after receipt of this letter.

        On September 19, 2016, representatives of an investment bank contacted management to discuss the possible sale of ClubCorp's Business, Sports and Alumni Clubs division to a prospective investor.

        On September 20, 2016, Mr. Affeldt received an unsolicited call from a representative of Party F who made a verbal expression of interest on behalf of Party F to acquire ClubCorp for $19.00 per share.

        On September 29, 2016, the Board held a meeting with management at which the verbal expression of interest from Party F and the earlier expressions of interest by several potential private equity and
financial investors were discussed. The Board determined to further explore potential strategic alternatives available to ClubCorp and to formally engage a financial advisor to assist ClubCorp with its review of,
among other things, the competitive landscape, market trends, ClubCorp's current equity market positioning and valuation, as well as potential strategies to enhance stockholder value. The Board further created
a Strategic Review Committee, consisting of three of its independent directors: John Beckert, as Chairman, Doug Brooks and Lou Grabowsky (the "Strategic Review Committee"). The Board authorized the
Strategic Review Committee to contact several investment banks to be considered to serve as a financial advisor to ClubCorp and, with the assistance of management and ClubCorp's financial and legal
advisors, to facilitate ClubCorp's entering into non-disclosure agreements and providing confidential information to prospective interested parties in order to further evaluate a potential strategic transaction.

        Over the next several months, the Strategic Review Committee met on a regular (often weekly) basis, including at times with members of management and ClubCorp's financial and legal advisors. The
Strategic Review Committee also regularly hosted calls with the Board to update the Board on developments and solicit the Board's feedback and guidance.

        During the week of October 10, 2016 and on October 18, 2016, several investment banks, including Jefferies and Wells Fargo Securities, were invited to interview for the role of financial advisor to
ClubCorp and met with the Strategic Review Committee and members of management.

        On October 17, 2016, the Strategic Review Committee held a Board update call and informed the Board of its progress with respect to engaging a financial advisor, including criteria used for evaluating
prospective financial advisors and an overview of the prospective financial advisors' past and current relationships with ClubCorp. Potential strategic alternatives, the time frame for the process of evaluating
strategic alternatives and considerations with respect to handling potential leaks and market speculation were also discussed during the call.

        On October 19, 2016, the Strategic Review Committee met to review the capabilities of the prospective financial advisors that had been interviewed and their past and current relationships with ClubCorp.
The Strategic Review Committee also received management's input and recommendations with respect to the prospective financial advisors. In consideration of such factors including, among other things, the
experience of Jefferies and Wells Fargo Securities, the Strategic Review Committee subsequently determined to engage Jefferies and Wells Fargo Securities as ClubCorp's financial advisors in connection with
ClubCorp's review and assessment of various potential strategic and/or financial alternatives.

        On October 27, 2016, a Board meeting was held, with management and ClubCorp's financial and legal advisors present, at which the status of the strategic review process was discussed. Members of the
Strategic Review Committee updated the Board on planning efforts. Representatives of Simpson Thacher and Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck, LLP, ClubCorp's Nevada counsel, who were also present at the
meeting, gave a presentation regarding the Board's fiduciary duties under Nevada corporate law generally and in connection with the Board's consideration of potential strategic alternatives. The Board also
requested that management review and update its existing long-range outlook (the "LRO"), which contained financial projections to be provided to potential investors and ClubCorp's financial advisors and
authorized the Strategic Review Committee to review and approve the LRO.

        During the period from October 28, 2016 through November 4, 2016, the Strategic Review Committee held several meetings, together with management and ClubCorp's financial advisors, to discuss,
among other things, (i) the proposed process, including preparation of marketing materials and other ClubCorp information to be provided to potential investors under non-disclosure agreements, (ii) the list of
potential investors to be approached, and (iii) the timing and communications plan for the proposed process. Management also held meetings with ClubCorp's financial advisors to review ClubCorp's history,
current operations, strategic initiatives and the LRO.

        On October 31, 2016, the Strategic Review Committee held a Board update call with respect to, among other things, the status of the preparation of marketing materials and potential interested investors.
Proposed timing and key dates regarding strategic alternatives were also discussed during the call.

        On November 9, 2016, the Strategic Review Committee met to discuss the status of the preparation efforts. The Strategic Review Committee also reviewed the LRO, and reviewed and approved a draft
non-disclosure agreement, which included customary provisions, such as a standstill and "don't ask, don't waive" provision (which provisions are waivable by the Board consistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable law). This form of non-disclosure agreement was prepared for prospective investors described below.

        From November 10, 2016 to November 17, 2016, ClubCorp's form of non-disclosure agreement was sent to 18 prospective investors, including six strategic investors, 11 private equity and financial
investors, including Apollo, and one foreign investor. These prospective investors were those that the Strategic Review Committee, with input from management and ClubCorp's financial advisors, had
determined were likely to have an interest in a strategic transaction with ClubCorp based on prior contacts with ClubCorp and investor profile.

        On November 11, 2016, the Strategic Review Committee held a meeting, together with management and ClubCorp's financial advisors, at which the status of communications with prospective investors
that had been contacted was discussed and the contacting of additional prospective investors was considered. The LRO and data room readiness were also discussed at the meeting, and the Strategic Review
Committee approved the LRO.

        On November 18, 2016, the Strategic Review Committee held a meeting, together with management and ClubCorp's financial advisors, at which the status of discussions with prospective investors and the
status of ClubCorp's marketing materials and data room was discussed. Additional prospective investors that could be contacted were also discussed, and the Strategic Review Committee authorized Jefferies
and Wells Fargo Securities to contact such additional prospective investors.

        From November 18, 2016 to November 28, 2016, ClubCorp's form of non-disclosure agreement was sent to eight additional prospective investors, including five strategic investors and three private equity
firms.

        During the period from November 17, 2016 to November 30, 2016, Apollo, Party A, Party B, Party C, Party D, Party F, a private equity firm (which we refer to as "Party H"), a private equity firm (which
we refer to as "Party I"), a private equity firm (which we refer to as "Party J"), a private equity firm (which we refer to as "Party K"), a private equity firm (which we refer to as "Party L"), and a private equity
firm (which we refer to as "Party M"), returned signed non-disclosure agreements and were provided access to the data room to conduct due diligence.

        On November 28, 2016, the Strategic Review Committee held a Board update call regarding the current status of the strategic review process, including the prospective investors that had returned signed
non-disclosure agreements. The Strategic Review Committee also informed the Board that ClubCorp's marketing materials had been finalized, and discussed with the Board proposed scheduling of initial
meetings with prospective investors.

        During the period from December 1, 2016 through December 16, 2016, a private equity firm (which we refer to as "Party G"), a strategic buyer (which we refer to as "Party N"), a private equity firm
(which we refer to as "Party O"), and four other financial and strategic investors returned signed non-disclosure agreements and were provided access to the data room to conduct due diligence.

        From December 1 to December 14, 2016, members of management conducted separate initial meetings with each of Apollo, Party A, Party B, Party C, Party F, Party G, Party H, Party I, Party J, Party M
and Party O.

        On December 7, 2016, a Board meeting was held, with management and ClubCorp's financial and legal advisors in attendance. ClubCorp's financial advisors updated the Board as to, among other things,
the status of the number of potential bidders that had entered into non-disclosure agreements, an overview of ClubCorp's current market position, and potential strategic alternatives.

        On December 8 and 9, 2016, ClubCorp's process letter was sent to each prospective investor that had returned a signed non-disclosure agreement with instructions to submit indications of interest by
December 21, 2016.

        On December 16, 2016, the Strategic Review Committee held a meeting, with management and ClubCorp's financial advisors in attendance, in which it was discussed that Party F had informed
management that it was no longer interested in pursuing a transaction with ClubCorp.

        On December 21, 2016, ClubCorp received seven non-binding, preliminary indications of interest, one from a strategic investor and six from private equity or financial investors. The 30 other prospective
investors that had been contacted declined to submit indications of interest. Of the seven preliminary indications of interest received, four were for the purchase of all of ClubCorp's outstanding common stock
(the "Potential Whole-Company IOIs"), with Apollo indicating a potential purchase price of $17.25-$19.00 per share, Party C indicating a potential purchase price of $16.00-$18.00 per share, Party G indicating
a potential purchase price of $17.50-$18.50 per share and Party I indicating a potential purchase price of $16.00-$17.50 per share, representing implied premiums ranging from approximately 10% to
approximately 31% over the $14.55 closing price per share of ClubCorp common stock on December 21, 2016. Two of the seven preliminary indications of interest were for investments in the form of
convertible preferred securities (the "Potential Preferred Investment IOIs"), with Party A indicating an interest in investing $200-$250 million in the aggregate and Party H indicating an interest in investing
approximately $220 million in the aggregate, in each case for preferred securities that would convert into approximately 19.9% of ClubCorp's outstanding common stock. Party A's indication of interest included
a conversion premium of 15% over the 30-day VWAP of ClubCorp common stock prior to signing and a 5% annual dividend and Party H's indication of interest included a conversion premium of 15% over the
20-day VWAP of ClubCorp common stock prior to signing and a 7.5% annual dividend. The remaining preliminary indication of interest was a proposal from Party N for a sale-leaseback transaction involving
50 to 100 golf and country clubs with an initial term of 15 years and an estimated transaction value of approximately $500 million to $1 billion (the "Potential Sale-Leaseback IOI"). Each of the preliminary
indications of interest was subject to, among other things, the completion of due diligence and the negotiation of a definitive agreement.

        On December 23, 2016, the Strategic Review Committee held a meeting, together with management and ClubCorp's financial and legal advisors, at which the preliminary indications of interest received,
expectations with respect to preliminary indications of interest that may be forthcoming from additional parties, and potential next steps in the process were discussed. Following this meeting, the Strategic
Review Committee held a Board update call. Prior to the call, the Strategic Review Committee distributed to the Board copies and summaries of each of the seven preliminary indications of interest. The Board
and the Strategic Review Committee discussed each of the indications of interest and potential next steps and, subsequently, at the Strategic Review Committee's request, those seven parties were invited to
participate in the second round of the process.

        The Strategic Review Committee continued to meet in 2017 on a regular (often weekly) basis, including at times with management and ClubCorp's financial and legal advisors. The Strategic Review
Committee also continued to regularly host calls with the Board to update the Board on developments and solicit the Board's feedback and guidance.

        During the period from January 5, 2017 to February 1, 2017, a strategic investor (which we refer to as "Party P"), a private equity firm (which we refer to as "Party Q"), a foreign financial investor (which
we refer to as "Party R"), two financial investors, one private equity firm and one additional foreign investor returned signed non-disclosure agreements and were provided access to the data room to conduct
due diligence. Party P informed ClubCorp's financial advisors that Party P intended to work with Party C in connection with its evaluation of ClubCorp.

        On January 6, 2017, the Strategic Review Committee held a meeting, together with management and ClubCorp's financial and legal advisors, at which the seven parties that had submitted preliminary
indications of interest, the preparation for the second round bidding process, the scope of additional materials for the data room and the availability of management to schedule site visits and management due
diligence meetings were discussed. ClubCorp's financial advisors also provided an update on possible alternative real estate and debt financing options that a potential investor may use to finance an acquisition
of ClubCorp and preliminary observations regarding ClubCorp from a financial perspective.

        On January 9, 2017, the Strategic Review Committee held a Board update call on matters discussed with management and ClubCorp's financial and legal advisors on January 6, 2017. The Strategic Review
Committee discussed with the Board the Potential Whole-Company IOIs and the Strategic Review Committee's determination that each of these bids presented meaningful opportunities to enhance stockholder
value and warranted further discussion. The Strategic Review Committee also discussed the Potential Preferred Investment IOIs with the Board and the Strategic Review Committee's determination that these
indications of interest also presented meaningful opportunities to enhance stockholder value and warranted further discussion. The Board then discussed the fact that both Potential Preferred Investment IOIs
contemplated the addition of two Board members to add operational and strategic expertise and guidance and the potential market reaction to such additions in light of each bidder's reputation in the market.
Finally, the Strategic Review Committee discussed with the Board the Potential Sale-Leaseback IOI and determined that more information was needed to determine whether such a transaction would enhance
stockholder value, particularly if the transaction involved fewer than 100 golf and country clubs. Discussion regarding the challenges of consummating the transactions proposed by the Potential Sale-Leaseback
IOI and the possible effects on ClubCorp's market valuation and trading dynamics after such a transaction were also discussed. The Strategic Review Committee noted that it planned to continue discussions
with Party N to better understand Party N's proposal for a sale-leaseback transaction.

        From January 11, 2017 to January 13, 2017, each of Apollo, Party A, Party C, Party G, Party H, Party I and Party N were granted access to additional due diligence materials in the data room.

        On January 12, 2017, Reuters published an unconfirmed story that ClubCorp was exploring a possible sale, indicating that such sale process had attracted the interest of potential buyers that included
private equity firms, and the New York Stock Exchange suspended trading of ClubCorp common stock. Thereafter, ClubCorp issued a press release stating that it had formed the Strategic Review Committee to
review and evaluate alternatives to further enhance stockholder value and had retained Jefferies and Wells Fargo Securities as financial advisors to assist in such strategic review. Following this public
announcement, a number of additional parties contacted ClubCorp's financial advisors to express interest in a potential transaction with ClubCorp and, based on management's preliminary review, and input
from ClubCorp's financial advisors, as to each party's level of interest and

        On February 13, 2017, a non-binding, preliminary indication of interest, dated February 10, 2017, was received from Party R to purchase all of ClubCorp's outstanding common stock at a purchase price of
$18.00-$21.00 per share, representing an implied premium ranging from approximately 20% to approximately 40% over the $15.00 closing price per share of ClubCorp common stock on January 11, 2017, the
last trading day prior to ClubCorp's press release regarding the Board's formation of a Strategic Review Committee.

        On February 21, 2017, ClubCorp's second round process letter was distributed to potential bidders and posted to the data room. The second round process letter requested that prospective investors submit
definitive proposals, together with a mark-up of the Draft Merger Agreement, by March 10, 2017.

        During the period from February 21, 2017 through March 8, 2017, at the request of each of Party A, Party C, Party H, Party P, and Party Q, management held multiple due diligence sessions with each such
party and their respective advisors, which sessions covered business, financial and legal matters, including with respect to membership initiation deposits.

        On February 24, 2017, the Strategic Review Committee held a meeting, together with management and ClubCorp's financial and legal advisors, to discuss feedback from prospective investors based on
recent management meetings and due diligence sessions and additional due diligence requests of the prospective investors. Updates regarding other prospective investors and the Draft Merger Agreement and

        On February 24, 2017, the Draft Merger Agreement, a draft form of an equity commitment letter (the "Draft ECL") and draft form of a limited guarantee (the "Draft Guarantee") were posted to the data
room. The Draft Merger Agreement contemplated, among other things, a ClubCorp termination fee equal to 2% of the transaction equity value and a reverse termination fee of $125 million.

        On March 7, 2017, in light of feedback received from potential bidders then to date, the deadline for submission of definitive proposals, together with a mark-up of the Draft Merger Agreement, was
extended to March 17, 2017.

        On March 9, 2017, FrontFour Capital submitted a formal nomination letter to ClubCorp, notifying ClubCorp of its intention to nominate candidates specified in such letter, including Emanuel Pearlman, for
election to the Board at ClubCorp's 2017 annual meeting of stockholders. Over the next several weeks, Mr. Beckert and management had several conversations with FrontFour Capital about its nominations and
perspectives regarding ClubCorp.

        On March 10, 2017, the Strategic Review Committee held a meeting, together with management and ClubCorp's financial and legal advisors, at which the status of prospective investors' due diligence,
including meetings with management that had occurred and those scheduled in the future, calls with and feedback from certain of the prospective investors, and the revised timeline for bids, were discussed. It
was noted that several parties informed ClubCorp's financial advisors that they did not intend to submit final proposals.

        On March 14, 2017 and March 15, 2017, management held in-person due diligence meetings with Party R and its advisors. ClubCorp's financial advisors also attended this meeting.

        On April 3, 2017, ClubCorp received a non-binding, preliminary indication of interest, dated April 2, 2017, from Party S indicating an interest in purchasing ClubCorp's Business, Sports and Alumni Club
division, on a debt-free basis, for $250 million using a combination of equity and third-party debt financing. Party S also indicated a desire to evaluate the possibility of leveraging its core capabilities to provide
additional strategic services to ClubCorp's Golf and Country Club division. The preliminary indication of interest received from Party S was subject to, among other things, the completion of due diligence and
the negotiation of a definitive agreement.

        Also on April 3, 2017, a Board meeting was held, with management and ClubCorp's financial and legal advisors in attendance. ClubCorp's financial advisors led the Board through a discussion of, among
other things, the status of the process, an overview of ClubCorp's current market position, potential strategic alternatives, including an investment in the form of convertible preferred securities and the sale of
the Business, Sports and Alumni Clubs division, and certain financial matters relating to ClubCorp. In particular, the general lack of interest then received to date from strategic buyers was discussed, which
ClubCorp's financial advisors believed to be due, in part, to ClubCorp's unique business and lack of true competitors for which the acquisition would create meaningful synergies. While a sale of the Business,
Sports and Alumni Club division was possible, the Board discussed the likelihood of potentially meaningful adverse tax consequences of such a sale and the potential impact on Golf and Country Club
memberships due to network usage among all clubs. The Board also discussed the Potential Preferred Investment IOIs then received to date, and potential impact of such an investment on ClubCorp's balance
sheet and its existing debt instruments as well as additional related dividends that ClubCorp would accrue, noting the high cost of capital associated with such an investment and the likelihood that ClubCorp
would remain a public company with many of the same challenges. The Board considered these potential risks and consequences with respect to the Potential Preferred Investments IOIs in light of the lack of a
clear and compelling use at the time for the proceeds from such investment. The Board also discussed the lack of bids to purchase ClubCorp as a whole, and the feedback from potential investors that there was
too much uncertainty regarding industry growth prospects, the economy, ongoing state unclaimed property audits, and certain tax matters.

        On April 7, 2017, Party R submitted a non-binding, preliminary indication of interest for an investment in ClubCorp of $200-$250 million in the form of common stock at a price equal to a 10% discount
from ClubCorp's then current market price (ClubCorp's closing stock price was $15.90 per share as of April 6, 2017), which indication of interest also included a requirement to appoint three of its director
nominees to the Board. Party R's preliminary indication of interest was subject to, among other things, the completion of due diligence and the negotiation of a definitive agreement.

        On April 12, 2017, ClubCorp issued three separate press releases announcing its results of operations for the fiscal quarter ended March 21, 2017, Mr. Affeldt's intention to retire from his role as Chief
Executive Officer upon the appointment of his successor and that, following the strategic review process led by the Strategic Review Committee, the Board unanimously had determined to not pursue a strategic
transaction at such time and to continue executing its three-pronged growth strategy focused on organic growth, reinvention and transformation, and acquisitions. The press release also stated that the Strategic
Review Committee would remain in place and that the Board and Strategic Review Committee would continue to consider all available alternatives to enhance stockholder value.

        On April 14, 2017, the Strategic Review Committee held a meeting, together with management and ClubCorp's financial and legal advisors, to discuss, among other things, current stockholders' reaction to
ClubCorp's public announcement on April 12, 2017, and whether to take any further steps to explore Party S's prior expressed interest in ClubCorp's Business, Sports and Alumni Club division.

        On April 21, 2017, Apollo contacted Wells Fargo Securities to discuss, among other things, Apollo's desire for additional due diligence, including on ClubCorp's Business, Sports and Alumni

Clubs division, overhead and expense information and certain information on specific clubs, and the Strategic Review Committee held a meeting, together with management and ClubCorp's financial and legal
advisors, at which such call was discussed.

        On April 27, 2017, at Apollo's request, management held a due diligence session with Apollo and its advisors, including representatives of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP ("Paul Weiss"),
Apollo's legal counsel, covering key diligence items.

        On April 28, 2017, the Strategic Review Committee held a meeting, together with management and ClubCorp's financial and legal advisors, at which the conversations that management had with Apollo,
Party C, Party P, Party Q and Party S, a potential sale of the Business, Sports and Alumni Clubs division, and an update regarding conversations with stockholders, including FrontFour Capital, were discussed.

        Also on April 28, 2017, ClubCorp received a non-binding, preliminary indication of interest from Apollo, which, among other things, reflected a proposed purchase price of $15.50 per share. In discussions
between Wells Fargo Securities and Apollo, Apollo explained that its proposed purchase price per share as compared to its prior preliminary indication of interest resulted from due diligence conducted
subsequent to Apollo's initial bid.

        On May 1, 2017, the Board held a meeting, with management and ClubCorp's financial and legal advisors in attendance, at which, among other things, Apollo's indication of interest was discussed. At the
meeting, the Board determined that it had no interest in engaging in a transaction with Apollo at its proposed purchase price of $15.50 per share and would instead focus on its existing business plan and CEO
succession planning, and directed Wells Fargo Securities to inform Apollo of the Board's decision. Wells Fargo Securities thereafter informed Apollo of the Board's determination, as instructed.

        On May 8, 2017, after discussions with the Strategic Review Committee and with input from ClubCorp's financial advisors, Mr. Beckert informed Apollo that it would need to significantly improve its
proposed purchase price in order for the Board to consider reengaging with Apollo about a potential acquisition transaction.

        On May 11, 2017, Apollo contacted Wells Fargo Securities to express continued interest in pursuing a transaction and submitted a further revised non-binding, preliminary indication of interest which,
among other things, increased its proposed purchase price to $16.50 per share.

        On May 12, 2017, the Strategic Review Committee held a meeting, together with management and ClubCorp's financial and legal advisors, at which Apollo's further revised indication of interest was
discussed.

        Also on May 12, 2017, ClubCorp and FrontFour Capital entered into an agreement pursuant to which the Board appointed Simon Turner, as a class I director, and Emanuel Pearlman, as a class II director,
to the Board effective as of May 12, 2017. Mr. Pearlman was also appointed on such date to the Strategic Review Committee.

        On May 15, 2017, a Board meeting was held, with management and ClubCorp's financial and legal advisors in attendance. ClubCorp's financial advisors led the Board through a discussion of, among other
things, the recent indications of interest received from Apollo, the expression of interest indicated by Party S in the Business, Sports and Alumni Club division, an overview of ClubCorp's current market
position, and potential strategic alternatives. In particular, the Board discussed Apollo's $16.50 per share revised indication of interest and the feedback received from multiple potential bidders indicating that
such bidders would not be able to support a bid at or near $16.50 per share. In light of these discussions, the Board, with input from management and ClubCorp's financial advisors, considered the advantages
and disadvantages of engaging in further discussions with Apollo or continuing to execute ClubCorp's current business plan. The Board noted that, while Apollo's indication of interest offered

an attractive premium to ClubCorp's current and unaffected trading prices, Apollo's bid remained below ClubCorp's historical high trading prices and implied EBITDA multiples. Further discussion ensued
regarding whether management would be able to execute the LRO and produce value in excess of Apollo's bid price, and the execution risks associated with such strategy. Following this discussion, the Board
determined that discussions should continue with Apollo in an effort to increase the value of Apollo's bid.

        On May 22, 2017, a Board meeting was held, with ClubCorp's financial and legal advisors in attendance. ClubCorp's financial advisors led the Board through a discussion of, among other things, the status
of discussions with Apollo, an overview of ClubCorp's current market position, and potential strategic alternatives. Discussion focused on a strategy to increase the value of Apollo's bid and the advantages and
disadvantages of considering a potential strategic PIPE investment, while simultaneously considering Apollo's bid. The Board determined to continue discussions with Apollo and also to contact certain other
specified strategic investors to determine their interest, if any, in a potential strategic PIPE investment in ClubCorp. In addition, the Board discussed contacting Party A and Party H to determine whether they
were still interested in pursuing a PIPE investment and Party C and Party P to determine if they were still interested in pursuing a strategic investment in ClubCorp.

        On May 24, 2017, in accordance with the Board's directives, Wells Fargo Securities had a discussion with Apollo regarding Apollo's May 11, 2017 revised indication of interest, the potential exploration by
ClubCorp of a strategic PIPE investment, and the Board's request that Apollo improve its proposed purchase price and provide a "best and final" offer for the Board to consider, together with a mark-up of the
Draft Merger Agreement.

        On May 26, 2017, in accordance with the Board's directives, ClubCorp's financial advisors contacted six potential strategic PIPE investors as well as Party A, Party C, Party H and Party P.

        On June 1, 2017, as a follow-up to the May 26, 2017 outreach, ClubCorp's financial advisors had a call with Party C and Party P to discuss the possibility of a strategic investment in ClubCorp. Both
bidders expressed interest in such an investment, and requested a meeting with the Strategic Review Committee and members of management to better understand the Board's objectives in pursuing such an
investment before submitting a formal proposal.

        During the period from June 1, 2017 through June 27, 2017, at Apollo's request, management held multiple due diligence sessions with Apollo and its advisors covering risk management and insurance
related matters, human resources matters, accounting, finance, tax, information technology and general legal matters, procurement and shared services matters, and membership initiation deposits.

        On June 2, 2017, the Strategic Review Committee updated the Board by email with respect to, among other things, continued conversations with Apollo, receipt of a signed non-disclosure agreement from
one of the six strategic PIPE investors contacted on May 26, 2017 and the status of discussions with the other five strategic PIPE investors.

        On June 5 and 6, 2017, members of the Strategic Review Committee, together with management and ClubCorp's financial advisors, met with Party C, Party P and their respective advisors in New York
and, on the following day with Party H and its advisors in New York.

        On June 12, 2017, the Strategic Review Committee held a meeting, with management and ClubCorp's financial and legal advisors in attendance. ClubCorp's financial advisors provided an update on the
conversations with Apollo, Party A, Party C, Party H (including Party H's last Potential Preferred Investment IOI), Party P and two of the potential strategic PIPE investors, and management provided an update
on its due diligence meetings.

        On June 13, 2017, management provided a revised cash flow analysis to Apollo that included a revised projection of 2017 Adjusted EBITDA of $259.4 million as compared to $261.6 million in the

LRO, which decreased as a result of reduced private event bookings and weather-related issues in the first half of 2017.

        On June 13, 2017, management held a due diligence session with Party H covering business and legal matters.

        On June 14, 2017, Apollo presented to ClubCorp a full bid package, including a bid letter, debt commitment letters signed by Apollo's lenders and a mark-up of their proposed Draft Merger Agreement,
Draft ECL and Draft Guarantee. Apollo's mark-up of the Draft Merger Agreement provided for, among other things, a purchase price of $17.00 per share in cash, an immediate suspension of ClubCorp's
quarterly dividend and a prohibition on the payment of further dividends, limitations on ClubCorp's ability to take actions that could result in a superior proposal. Apollo's bid package also contemplated an
increase in the duration of the period in which Parent would be able to market debt to fund the merger (such period, the "Marketing Period") to 20 days with rights to extend the Marketing Period for an
additional 20-day period (the "Marketing Period Extension") subsequent to receipt of approval by ClubCorp's stockholders of the final merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby and
expiration or termination of the HSR waiting period, an increase in ClubCorp's termination fee to 3% from 2% of the transaction equity value, a decrease in the reverse termination fee to 5.5% of the transaction
equity value from $125 million and provisions requiring ClubCorp to reimburse certain of Apollo's expenses in several circumstances, including if Apollo terminated the final merger agreement due to an
uncured material breach of the merger agreement by ClubCorp or if ClubCorp's stockholders did not approve the final merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby (the "Parent Vote Expense
Reimbursement").

        On June 15, 2017, members of the Strategic Review Committee met with Party A to discuss ClubCorp and its prospects and a potential strategic investment by Party A in ClubCorp.

        On June 16, 2017, the Strategic Review Committee held a meeting, with management and ClubCorp's legal advisors in attendance. Simpson Thacher led the Strategic Review Committee through a
discussion of Apollo's mark-up of the Draft Merger Agreement, a copy of which was circulated to the Strategic Review Committee and management in advance of the meeting. The parties discussed, among
other things, certain terms and provisions of such mark-up, including the proposed treatment of dividends and equity awards, the proposed termination and reverse termination fees, the proposed provisions with
respect to ClubCorp's ability to evaluate superior proposals and closing conditions following signing of a definitive merger agreement.

        Also on June 16, 2017, Party A presented to ClubCorp a revised Potential Preferred Investment IOI for a similar sized investment in convertible preferred stock as contemplated by Party A's March 17,
2017 proposal with an initial conversion price per share of $15.75 per share and an 8% dividend and other terms generally similar to its March proposal. Also on June 16, 2017, Party H presented to ClubCorp a
revised Potential Preferred Investment IOI for a similar sized investment in convertible preferred stock as contemplated by Party H's March 17, 2017 proposal with an initial conversion price of $17.25 per share
and a 6% dividend (with rights to participate in any ClubCorp common share dividend on an as converted basis) (unchanged from its March proposal) and other terms generally similar to its March proposal.

        On June 19, 2017, a Board meeting was held, with ClubCorp's financial and legal advisors in attendance. ClubCorp's financial advisors referred the Board to previously distributed disclosures to the Board
regarding their respective material relationships with AGM and certain of its portfolio companies. ClubCorp's financial advisors then led the Board through a discussion of, among other things, the status of
discussions with Apollo and various other prospective investors, and an overview of potential strategic alternatives then under consideration. ClubCorp's legal advisors also led the Board through a discussion of
Apollo's mark-up of the Draft Merger Agreement, a copy of which was circulated to the Board in advance of the meeting. The Board discussed, among other things, certain

terms and provisions of such mark-up and financial highlights provided by management, including ClubCorp's performance as compared to fiscal year 2017 and second and third quarter consensus estimates.
The discussions also included (i) the fact that, while two of the potential strategic investors had executed non-disclosure agreements and were evaluating the opportunity further, three of the six potential
strategic PIPE investors had declined the opportunity to pursue a PIPE with ClubCorp and it seemed likely that one additional strategic investor would decline such opportunity; (ii) the fact that Apollo and its
advisors had substantially completed their due diligence and expected to be in a position to sign definitive documents within the next two weeks; and (iii) a summary of the revised Potential Preferred
Investment IOIs from Party A and Party H. The Board determined that it was supportive of pursuing a transaction with Apollo and directed the Strategic Review Committee, with the assistance of management
and ClubCorp's financial and legal advisors, to continue to negotiate with Apollo and, if possible, to determine whether Apollo would be willing to increase its per share purchase price to $17.50.

        On June 20, 2017, Simpson Thacher sent revised versions of the Draft Merger Agreement, Draft ECL and Draft Guarantee to Apollo and its legal counsel. The revised Draft Merger Agreement included,
among other things, a $17.50 per share purchase price, the ability of ClubCorp to pay its regular second quarter dividend, a termination fee of 3% of the transaction equity value and a reverse termination fee of
7.5% of the transaction equity value. Later that day, in accordance with the Board's directives, Messrs. Brooks and Pearlman, together with representatives of ClubCorp's financial advisors, met with Apollo in
New York and discussed with Apollo the revised proposal and encouraged Apollo to increase its proposed purchase price to $17.50 per share.

        On June 29, 2017, Apollo submitted a revised proposal, which contemplated, among other things, the payment of one quarterly dividend of $0.13 per share, an increase in the reverse termination fee to 6%
of the transaction equity value, a requirement that ClubCorp obtain the consent of ClubCorp's lender, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. ("Wells Fargo Bank"), waiving certain change of control provisions that otherwise
would be triggered by virtue of the merger under a mortgage loan between Wells Fargo Bank and a subsidiary of ClubCorp (the "Mortgage Loan"), and a delay in payouts with respect to accelerated outstanding
equity awards tied to continued employment post-merger. Apollo's purchase price was unchanged at $17.00 per share. The proposal letter indicated that Apollo had completed its due diligence review and
expected to be able to sign definitive documents by the end of the coming week.

        Also on June 29, 2017, the Strategic Review Committee held a meeting, together with management and ClubCorp's financial and legal advisors, at which Apollo's latest proposal was discussed.

        On June 30, 2017, a Board meeting was held, with ClubCorp's financial and legal advisors in attendance, at which Apollo's latest proposal was discussed. Simpson Thacher reviewed for the Board its
fiduciary duties and legal obligations to ClubCorp and its stockholders in considering a transaction with Apollo. Discussion regarding Apollo's proposal ensued and the Board was not unanimous in agreeing to
Apollo's latest proposal. The Board determined to authorize the Strategic Review Committee to continue negotiations with Apollo regarding the Draft Merger Agreement and determine whether Apollo's latest
proposal could be increased.

        On July 1, 2017, the Strategic Review Committee held a meeting, with management and ClubCorp's financial and legal advisors in attendance, at which the current status of the Draft Merger Agreement

        On July 2, 2017, Paul Weiss sent a revised draft of the Draft Merger Agreement to Simpson Thacher, which draft provided for, among other things, a purchase price of $17.00 per share in cash, the ability
of ClubCorp to declare and pay a one-time quarterly dividend of $0.13 per share and a prohibition on the payment of further dividends. Apollo's Draft Merger Agreement also contemplated a 20-day Marketing
Period as well as the Marketing Period Extension, the vesting of equity awards at closing but payable 50% at closing and 50% within 60 days of closing (subject to the employee remaining employed at the time
of payment) unless the employee was terminated without "Cause" (as defined in the Draft Merger Agreement"), a reverse termination fee equal to 6% of the transaction equity value and the Parent Vote Expense
Reimbursement.

        On July 3, 2017, after further negotiations between representatives of ClubCorp and Apollo, regarding Apollo's revised Draft Merger Agreement, Apollo submitted a revised proposal that provided for a
purchase price of $17.25 per share, with an immediate suspension of ClubCorp's quarterly dividend and a prohibition on the payment of further dividends.

        On July 4, 2017, the Strategic Review Committee met, together with ClubCorp's financial and legal advisors, at which a counterproposal to Apollo's proposed purchase price, a per share purchase price of
$17.12 and the declaration and payment of the second quarter dividend of $0.13 per share was discussed. The Strategic Review Committee determined to recommend such counterproposal to the Board as it
would enable ClubCorp stockholders to receive a portion of the proposed purchase price earlier in the form of the second quarter dividend. Thereafter, in accordance with the Strategic Review Committee's
directives, Wells Fargo Securities discussed ClubCorp's counterproposal with Apollo and Apollo agreed to revise its proposed purchase price to $17.12 per share, to permit ClubCorp to declare and pay a one-
time quarterly dividend of $0.13 per share, and to negotiate the remaining terms of the Draft Merger Agreement.

        Also on July 4, 2017, Simpson Thacher sent a revised Draft Merger Agreement to Paul Weiss, which draft provided for, among other things, a purchase price of $17.12 per share in cash, the ability of
ClubCorp to declare and pay a one-time quarterly dividend of $0.13 per share and a prohibition on the payment of further dividends, deletion of the Marketing Period Extension, a reverse termination fee of
6.5% of the transaction equity value and a Parent Vote Expense Reimbursement of a maximum of $1.0 million.

        Throughout July 4 through 7, 2017, Simpson Thacher and Paul Weiss negotiated the Draft Merger Agreement, including the amount of the Parent Vote Expense Reimbursement to an agreed upon amount
of $6.25 million, the Draft ECL, the Draft Guarantee and the bank commitment letter relating to Apollo's debt financing (the "Bank Commitment Letter").

        Throughout July 5 through 7, 2017, ClubCorp, Apollo, and Wells Fargo Bank, as lender under the Mortgage Loan, negotiated and agreed to a waiver of the change in control default under such Mortgage
Loan.

        On July 5, 2017, ClubCorp provided Apollo with a revised 2017 projection of Adjusted EBITDA amount of $259.0 million, which amount decreased primarily as a result of continued weather-related
issues in the first half of 2017 and the closure of a club that was completed in the second quarter of 2017 and, on July 6, 2017, management and Apollo had a call to discuss these revised projections. For more
information, see the section of the proxy statement captioned "The Merger—Certain Financial Projections."

        On July 7, 2017, a Board meeting was held, with ClubCorp's financial and legal advisors in attendance. Simpson Thacher led the Board through a review of its fiduciary duties and a summary of the terms
of the Draft Merger Agreement, based on presentation materials that Simpson Thacher had circulated to the Board in advance of the meeting. ClubCorp's financial advisors then referred the Board to updated
disclosures to the Board regarding their respective material relationships with AGM

and certain of its portfolio companies. The financial advisors then led the Board through a discussion of, among other things, an overview of financial aspects of the proposed transaction with Apollo and certain
financial matters relating to ClubCorp. Simpson Thacher then informed the Board that Paul Weiss indicated that it just had been informed that Apollo was still in the process of finalizing its debt financing
commitments under the Bank Commitment Letter. The meeting was then adjourned.

        On July 8, 2017, Paul Weiss and Simpson Thacher finalized negotiations on the final form of the Draft Merger Agreement and the terms of the Draft Merger Agreement, Draft ECL, Draft Guarantee, and
Bank Commitment Letter were substantially in agreed form by all parties.

        On July 9, 2017, Paul Weiss informed Simpson Thacher that Apollo had received a fully executed Bank Commitment Letter and was prepared to sign the definitive merger agreement. Later on July 9,
2017, the Board met and Simpson Thacher reviewed again for the Board its fiduciary duties to ClubCorp and its stockholders generally and in connection with its consideration of a transaction with Apollo and
summarized the minor changes to the Draft Merger Agreement since the last Board meeting. ClubCorp's financial advisors again referred the Board to updated disclosures to the Board regarding their respective
material relationships with AGM and certain of its portfolio companies. The financial advisors then reviewed with the Board their respective financial analyses of the per share merger consideration and each
separately rendered an oral opinion, confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated July 9, 2017, to the Board to the effect that, as of such date and based on and subject to various assumptions made,
procedures followed, matters considered and limitations and qualifications described in the opinion, the per share merger consideration to be received by holders of ClubCorp common stock was fair, from a
financial point of view, to such holders. The full text of the written opinions of Jefferies and Wells Fargo are attached to this proxy statement as Annex B and Annex C, respectively, and are each incorporated by
reference in this proxy statement in their entirety.

        After further discussion by the Board, including further discussions of the resolutions to be adopted by the Board, the Board unanimously approved and declared advisable and in the best interest of
ClubCorp and its stockholders, the Draft Merger Agreement, substantially in the form presented to the Board, and the merger, and unanimously recommended that the ClubCorp stockholders vote to approve the
merger agreement (as described in more detail in the section entitled "The Merger—Recommendation of the Board and Reasons for the Merger").

        Following the approval of the Board of the Draft Merger Agreement, the parties executed the Draft Merger Agreement (such executed agreement, the "merger agreement") and the other documentation
related to the proposed transaction. The full text of the executed merger agreement is attached to this proxy statement as Annex A and is incorporated by reference in this proxy statement in its entirety. Apollo
provided executed financing commitment papers, including the Bank Commitment Letter, providing for its committed financing concurrently with the execution of the merger agreement.

        Thereafter, on July 9, 2017, a press release was issued announcing the proposed transaction.

Recommendation of the Board and Reasons for the Merger 

The Board recommends that you vote "FOR" the merger proposal.

        At a meeting of the Board held on July 9, 2017, the Board unanimously determined that the merger, the merger agreement and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement are advisable,
fair to and in the best interests of ClubCorp and the ClubCorp stockholders, declared advisable and approved the merger, the merger agreement and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement,
resolved that the merger agreement be submitted to the ClubCorp stockholders for approval thereby in accordance with applicable law, the merger agreement and the bylaws of ClubCorp at a special meeting of
stockholders and recommended that the ClubCorp stockholders vote to approve the merger agreement.

Table of Contents

        When you consider the Board's recommendation, you should be aware that ClubCorp's directors may have interests in the merger that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of ClubCorp
stockholders generally. These interests are described in the section entitled "The Merger—Interests of ClubCorp's Executive Officers and Directors in the Merger."

        In evaluating the merger, the Board consulted with our senior management and financial and legal advisors, reviewed a significant amount of information and, in reaching its decision, considered a number
of potentially positive factors with respect to the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including, among others, the following (not necessarily in order of relative
importance):

• Merger consideration.  The Board considered the $17.12 per share in cash to be paid as the per share merger consideration in relation to (i) the Board's estimate of the current and future value of
ClubCorp as an independent entity, (ii) the multiple of enterprise value to Adjusted EBITDA implied by such price and (iii) the market price of ClubCorp's common stock on July 7, 2017, the last
trading day prior to the date of the Board meeting to approve the merger and the merger agreement. 

• Premium.  The Board considered that the $17.12 per share in cash to be paid as the per share merger consideration represents a premium of approximately 30.7% to the $13.10 per share closing
price of ClubCorp's stock on July 7, 2017, the last trading day prior to the date of the Board meeting to approve the merger and the merger agreement, and a premium of approximately 29.0%,
28.2% and 19.9% to the VWAP of ClubCorp common stock for the 30, 60 and 90 day periods ended July 7, 2017, respectively. In addition, the Board considered that the price of ClubCorp
common stock in the foreseeable future was unlikely to exceed the future value equivalent of $17.12 per share. 

• Cash consideration.  The Board considered the fact that the per share merger consideration would be paid solely in cash, which provides certainty and immediate liquidity and value to our
stockholders, enabling our stockholders to realize value that has been created at ClubCorp while eliminating long-term business and execution risk. 

• Strategic alternatives.  The Board considered the potential values, benefits, risks and uncertainties facing ClubCorp's stockholders associated with possible strategic alternatives to the merger
(including alternative acquisition proposals for the sale of ClubCorp's Business, Sports and Alumni Club division and a sale-leaseback transaction for certain of ClubCorp's clubs and scenarios
involving the possibility of remaining independent with or without accepting a strategic investment), and the timing and likelihood of accomplishing such alternatives, including publicly
announcing in January 2017 that ClubCorp was evaluating strategic alternatives to further enhance shareholder value and, as part of that process, by contacting 24 potential strategic buyers
(including four inbound inquiries), 39 potential private equity firms and financial investors (including 17 inbound inquiries) and five foreign investors (including two inbound inquiries) and by
engaging in discussions with potential acquirors over the course of several months preceding the negotiation of the transaction with Parent. Based on the foregoing, the Board considered that
Parent was the only potential acquiror that submitted a formal offer to acquire ClubCorp as a whole and that none of the other options, on a risk-adjusted basis, was reasonably likely to create
value for ClubCorp stockholders greater than the per share merger consideration. 

• ClubCorp's historical, current and prospective condition.  The Board considered information with respect to our financial condition, results of operations, competitive position and business
strategy, on both a historical and prospective basis, as well as current industry, economic and market conditions, trends and cycles.

Table of Contents

• Risks associated with continued independence.  While the Board remained supportive of our strategic plan and optimistic about our prospects on a standalone basis, it also considered the risks
associated with operating as a standalone company, including the potential execution risks associated with the strategic plan, both generally and in light of the pending succession of our chief
executive officer, and the potential risk associated with the possibility that even if our strategic plan is successfully executed, the market may not reflect such execution in ClubCorp's stock price
in the near term or in the long term. The Board concluded that the per share merger consideration enabled ClubCorp's stockholders to realize a substantial portion of ClubCorp's potential future
value in the near term and without the market or execution risks associated with continued independence. 

• Economic conditions.   The Board considered the current state of the economy, debt financing markets and uncertainty surrounding forecasted economic conditions both in the near term and the
long term, generally, and within our industry in particular which could reduce our ability to attract and enroll new members, reduce our existing members' usage of our facilities, increase our
membership attrition rates or otherwise result in future operating results failing to meet the projections in the LRO. 

• Negotiations with Parent.  The Board considered the benefits that we and our advisors were able to obtain during our extensive negotiations with Parent and that the merger agreement was the
product of arm's-length negotiations and contained terms and conditions that were, in the Board's view, advisable and favorable to ClubCorp and its stockholders. 

• Timing of Parent's offer.  The timing of the merger and the risk that if ClubCorp did not accept Parent's offer, which Parent had indicated was its best and final offer, at the time that it did, the
Board might not have had another opportunity to consummate a value enhancing strategic transaction such as the merger proposed by Parent, particularly given the fluctuations in the financial
markets in a manner that makes it difficult to finance an acquisition of ClubCorp. Given that Parent was the only potential acquiror to submit a formal offer to acquire ClubCorp as a whole, the
Board considered the risk that, if negotiations with Parent ceased, the only alternative in the near-term was for ClubCorp to remain an independent company. 

• Opinions of ClubCorp's financial advisors.  The Board considered the separate opinions, each dated July 9, 2017, of Jefferies and Wells Fargo Securities to the Board as to the fairness, from a
financial point of view and as of such date, of the per share merger consideration to be received by holders of ClubCorp common stock pursuant to the merger agreement, which opinions were
based on and subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and limitations and qualifications on the review undertaken as further described in "The Merger—
Opinions of ClubCorp's Financial Advisors." 

• Merger agreement.  The Board considered, in consultation with its counsel, the terms of the merger agreement, including: 

• the representations, warranties and covenants of the parties, the conditions to the parties' obligations to complete the merger and their ability to terminate the merger agreement; 

• the fact that the consummation of the merger is not conditioned on Parent's ability to obtain financing; 

• the fact that ClubCorp has sufficient operating flexibility to conduct its business in the ordinary course between the execution of the merger agreement and consummation of the merger;

• the obligation of Parent under certain circumstances to pay us a reverse termination fee of $74.2 million, including the guarantee thereof pursuant to the terms and conditions of the
limited guarantee; 

• the fact that the definition of "material adverse effect" has a number of customary exceptions and is generally a very high standard applied by courts; 

• the fact that Parent and Merger Sub agreed to take all steps necessary to obtain certain regulatory approvals (subject to certain specified exceptions); 

• the right of ClubCorp and the Board to participate or engage in discussions with any person or group that has made a bona fide acquisition proposal that was not solicited in breach of the
merger agreement prior to obtaining the ClubCorp stockholder approval of the merger agreement if the Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and
financial advisors, that such acquisition proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to constitute a superior proposal and, after consultation with its legal advisors, that failure to
provide such access or engage in such discussions would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties and has received an acceptable confidentiality agreement from such person; 

• the belief of the Board that the $34.2 million termination fee is reasonable and customary for transactions of this type; 

• the Board's right to change its recommendation in connection with an intervening event or a superior proposal prior to obtaining the ClubCorp stockholder approval if the Board has
determined in good faith, after consultation with ClubCorp's outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that the failure to make such change in recommendation would be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties under applicable law, subject to certain notice requirements and "matching rights"; and 

• ClubCorp's right, under specified circumstances, to specifically enforce Parent's obligations under the merger agreement, including Parent's obligation to enforce the equity commitment
letter in order to consummate the merger. 

• Apollo's reputation.  The Board considered the business reputation and capabilities of Apollo and its management, and Apollo's general ability to complete acquisition transactions. 

• Financing.  The Board considered the fact that Parent has obtained committed debt financing for the transaction from reputable financial institutions and that Parent has obtained committed
equity financing from the Apollo Funds, as well as the fact that Parent must use its reasonable best efforts to consummate the debt financing, and that such funding provides for funding of the
aggregate per share merger consideration, all fees and expenses required to be paid by Parent and Merger Sub in connection with the merger and the financing, repayment or prepayment of
certain existing indebtedness of ClubCorp and its subsidiaries and all other payment obligations of Parent and Merger Sub contemplated under the merger agreement. 

• Likelihood of consummation.  The Board considered the likelihood that the merger would be completed, in light of, among other things, the conditions to the merger and the absence of a
financing condition, the relative likelihood of obtaining required regulatory approvals, and the remedies available to us under the merger agreement, as well as the level of commitment by Parent
to obtain the applicable consents imposed by regulators in connection with securing such approvals. 

• Stockholders' ability to reject the merger.  The Board considered the fact that the merger will not be consummated unless the merger agreement is approved by the affirmative vote of the holders
of a majority of the outstanding shares of ClubCorp common stock entitled to vote thereon.

Table of Contents

        In the course of reaching its decision, the Board also considered a number of potentially negative factors with respect to the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement
including, among others, the following (not necessarily in the order of relative importance):

• Participation in future gains.  The Board considered the fact that we will no longer exist as an independent public company and ClubCorp stockholders will forgo any future increase in
ClubCorp's value that might result from our earnings or possible growth as an independent company. The Board was optimistic about our prospects on a standalone basis and our strategic plan,
but concluded that the premium reflected in the per share merger consideration constituted fair compensation for the loss of the potential stockholder benefits that could be realized by our
strategic plan, particularly on a risk-adjusted basis. 

• Regulatory risk.  The Board considered the risk that the completion of necessary regulatory reviews, the completion of which is beyond ClubCorp's and Parent's control, may be delayed,
conditioned or denied. 

• Risks associated with announcement and pendency of the merger.  The Board considered the significant costs associated with entering into the merger agreement and completing the merger,
and the substantial time and effort of management required to complete the merger, as well as the risk that the announcement and pendency of the merger could potentially have negative effects
on relationships with our members and may divert management and employee attention away from the day-to-day operation of our business. In addition, the announcement and pendency of the
merger could have a negative effect on our ability to acquire and/or divest of clubs or pursue other business opportunities, even if such actions are permitted by the interim operating covenant of
the merger agreement. 

• Risks associated with a failure to consummate the merger.  The Board considered the fact that there can be no assurance that all conditions to the parties' obligations to consummate the merger
will be satisfied and as a result the possibility that the merger might not be completed, and the fact that any reverse termination fee may not fully compensate ClubCorp for the costs of non-
consummation. The Board noted the fact that, if the merger is not completed, (i) depending on the circumstances that caused the merger not to be completed, it is likely that the price of
ClubCorp's common stock will decline, potentially significantly, and (ii) the market's perception of our prospects could be adversely affected. 

• Financing risk.  The Board considered the risk that, while the merger agreement is not subject to any financing condition, if Parent fails to obtain sufficient financing, the merger is unlikely to be
consummated. 

• Restrictions on the operation of our business.  The Board considered the restrictions on the conduct of our business prior to the completion of the merger, including a restriction on our ability to
pay ordinary course dividends (other than the payment of the one-time quarterly dividend of $0.13 per share declared on July 9, 2017, which was paid on July 28, 2017), which could delay or
prevent us from realizing certain business opportunities or taking certain actions with respect to our operations we would otherwise take absent the pending merger. 

• Non-solicitation provision.  The Board considered the fact that the merger agreement limits our ability to actively solicit alternative proposals. 

• Termination fees.  The Board considered the possibility that the $34.2 million termination fee payable to Parent with respect to terminations might have the effect of discouraging alternative
acquisition proposals or reducing the price of such proposals. The Board also considered that ClubCorp could be responsible for up to $6.25 million of Parent's expenses if the ClubCorp
stockholders do not approve the merger agreement.

Table of Contents

• Parent termination fee.  The Board considered the fact that ClubCorp's monetary remedy in connection with a material breach or a material failure to perform by Parent or Merger Sub is limited
to the amount of the $74.2 million Parent termination fee plus reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses up to $2.5 million in connection with enforcing the payment of the
Parent termination fee and certain expenses related to the financing and may not be sufficient to compensate ClubCorp for losses suffered as a result of a breach of the merger agreement by
Parent or Merger Sub. 

• Tax treatment.  The Board considered the fact that any gains arising from the receipt of the per share merger consideration would generally be taxable to ClubCorp's stockholders that are U.S.
holders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. 

• Stockholder litigation.  The Board considered the likelihood of distracting litigation from stockholder suits in connection with the merger. 

• Lack of appraisal rights.  The Board considered the fact that, under Nevada law, stockholders who do not vote to approve the merger agreement will not have, and will not be entitled to assert,
dissenter's rights or any rights of appraisal as a result of or in connection with the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger.

        While the Board considered potentially positive and potentially negative factors, the Board concluded that, overall, the potentially positive factors outweighed the potentially negative factors. Accordingly,
the Board unanimously determined that the merger, merger agreement and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement are advisable, fair to and in the best interests of ClubCorp and its
stockholders.

        The foregoing discussion is not intended to be an exhaustive list of the information and factors considered by the Board in its consideration of the merger, but includes the material positive factors and
material negative factors considered by the Board in that regard. In view of the number and variety of factors and the amount of information considered, the Board did not find it practicable to, nor did it attempt
to, make specific assessments of, quantify, or otherwise assign relative weights to, the specific factors considered in reaching its determination. In addition, individual members of the Board may have given
different weights to different factors. Based on the totality of the information presented, the Board collectively reached the unanimous decision to approve and declare advisable and fair to and in the best
interests of ClubCorp and its stockholders, the merger, the merger agreement and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement in light of the factors described above and other factors that the
members of the Board believed were appropriate.

        Portions of this explanation of ClubCorp's reasons for the merger and other information presented in this section are forward-looking in nature and, therefore, should be read in light of the section entitled
"Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements."

Opinions of ClubCorp's Financial Advisors 

Opinion of Jefferies LLC

        ClubCorp has retained Jefferies as a financial advisor to ClubCorp in connection with the merger. In connection with this engagement, ClubCorp requested that Jefferies evaluate the fairness, from a
financial point of view, of the per share merger consideration to be received by holders of ClubCorp common stock pursuant to the merger agreement. At a meeting of the Board held on July 9, 2017, Jefferies
rendered an oral opinion, confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated July 9, 2017, to the Board to the effect that, as of that date and based on and subject to the various assumptions made, procedures
followed, matters considered and limitations and qualifications on the review undertaken as described in its opinion, the per share merger consideration to be received by holders of ClubCorp

common stock pursuant to the merger agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.

        The full text of Jefferies' opinion, which describes the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and limitations and qualifications on the review undertaken by Jefferies, is attached as
Annex B to this proxy statement and is incorporated herein by reference. Jefferies' opinion was provided for the use and benefit of the Board (in its capacity as such) in its evaluation of the per share
merger consideration from a financial point of view and did not address any other aspect of the merger or any other matter. The opinion did not address the relative merits of the merger as
compared to any alternative transaction or opportunity that might be available to ClubCorp, nor did it address the underlying business decision by ClubCorp to engage in the merger. Jefferies'
opinion does not constitute a recommendation as to how any stockholder should vote or act with respect to the merger or any other matter. The following summary is qualified in its entirety by
reference to the full text of Jefferies' opinion.

        In arriving at its opinion, Jefferies, among other things:

• reviewed an execution copy of the merger agreement provided to Jefferies on July 9, 2017; 

• reviewed certain publicly available financial and other information regarding ClubCorp; 

• reviewed certain information furnished to Jefferies by management relating to the businesses, operations and prospects of ClubCorp, including financial forecasts and estimates prepared or
provided by management; 

• held discussions with members of the senior management of ClubCorp concerning the matters described in the second and third bullets immediately above; 

• at the direction of ClubCorp, held discussions on behalf of ClubCorp with selected third parties to solicit indications of interest in the possible acquisition of all or a portion of, or a strategic
investment in, ClubCorp; 

• reviewed the stock trading price history and implied trading multiples for ClubCorp and compared them with those of certain publicly traded companies that Jefferies deemed relevant in
evaluating ClubCorp; 

• compared the financial terms of the merger with publicly available financial terms of certain other transactions that Jefferies deemed relevant in evaluating the merger; and 

• conducted such other financial studies, analyses and investigations as Jefferies deemed appropriate.

        In its review and analysis and in rendering its opinion, Jefferies assumed and relied upon, but did not assume any responsibility to independently investigate or verify, the accuracy and completeness of all
financial and other information that was supplied or otherwise made available by ClubCorp or that was publicly available to Jefferies (including, without limitation, the information described above) or
otherwise reviewed by Jefferies. Jefferies relied on assurances of management and other representatives of ClubCorp that they were not aware of any facts or circumstances that would make such information
incomplete, inaccurate or misleading. In its review, Jefferies did not obtain any independent evaluation or appraisal of any of the assets or liabilities (contingent, derivative, off-balance sheet or otherwise), nor
did Jefferies conduct a physical inspection of any of the properties or facilities, of ClubCorp or any other entity, and Jefferies was not furnished with, and assumed no responsibility to obtain, any such
evaluations, appraisals or physical inspections. Jefferies is not an expert in the evaluation of, and expressed no view or opinion with respect to, any matters related to tax audits or assessments, initiation deposits
and/or escheatment of unclaimed or abandoned property or the adequacy or sufficiency of allowances for losses or other matters with respect thereto.

        With respect to the financial forecasts and estimates (including estimates as to potential net operating loss carryforwards of ClubCorp on a standalone basis) provided to and reviewed by Jefferies, Jefferies
noted that projecting future results of any company is inherently subject to uncertainty. However, Jefferies was advised, and Jefferies assumed, that the financial forecasts and estimates relating to ClubCorp that
Jefferies was directed to utilize in its analyses were reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and good faith judgments of management as to the future financial performance
of ClubCorp and the other matters covered thereby. Jefferies expressed no opinion as to any such financial forecasts or estimates or the assumptions on which they were based. Jefferies relied upon the
assessments of management as to, among other things, (i) the potential impact on ClubCorp of certain market, competitive, seasonal and other trends in and prospects for the leisure industry, including the golf,
country club and business club sectors thereof and in the geographic regions in which ClubCorp operates, (ii) membership dues and initiation fees, including matters relating to the timing, amounts and
likelihood of initiation deposit refunds and/or related state escheatment claims, proceedings or investigations, (iii) planned or contemplated acquisitions, investments and alliances of ClubCorp, including the
timing, amounts and related funding, and capital expenditures associated with ClubCorp's existing properties, and (iv) existing and future relationships, agreements and arrangements with, and the ability to
attract and retain, key employees, club members and joint ventures and other commercial relationships of ClubCorp. Jefferies assumed that there would not be any developments with respect to any such matters
that would be meaningful in any respect to Jefferies' analyses or opinion.

        Jefferies' opinion was based on economic, monetary, regulatory, market and other conditions existing and which could be evaluated as of the date of Jefferies' opinion. Jefferies expressly disclaimed any
undertaking or obligation to advise any person of any change in any fact or matter affecting its opinion of which Jefferies becomes aware after the date of its opinion.

        Jefferies made no independent investigation of any legal, regulatory, accounting or tax matters affecting ClubCorp or the merger and Jefferies assumed the correctness in all respects meaningful to its
analyses and opinion of all legal, regulatory, accounting and tax advice given to ClubCorp and/or the Board, including, without limitation, advice as to legal, regulatory, accounting and tax consequences to
ClubCorp and holders of ClubCorp common stock of the terms of, and transactions contemplated by, the merger agreement and related documents. In addition, in preparing its opinion, Jefferies did not take into
account any tax or other consequences of the merger to, or individual circumstances of, any holder of ClubCorp common stock. Jefferies assumed that the merger would be consummated in accordance with its
terms without waiver, modification or amendment of any material term, condition or agreement and in compliance with all applicable laws, documents and other requirements and that, in the course of obtaining
the necessary governmental, regulatory or third party approvals, consents, waivers and releases for the merger, including with respect to any divestiture or other requirements, no delay, limitation, restriction or
condition would be imposed or occur that would have an adverse effect on ClubCorp or the merger or that otherwise would be meaningful in any respect to Jefferies' analyses or opinion. Jefferies also assumed
that the final merger agreement, when signed by the parties thereto, would be substantially similar to the execution copy reviewed by Jefferies.

        Jefferies' opinion was provided for the use and benefit of the Board (in its capacity as such) in its evaluation of the per share merger consideration from a financial point of view. Jefferies' opinion did not
address the relative merits of the merger contemplated by the merger agreement as compared to any alternative transaction or opportunity that might be available to ClubCorp, nor did it address the underlying
business decision by ClubCorp to engage in the merger or the terms of the merger agreement or the documents referred to therein, including the form or structure of the merger or any term, aspect or implication
of any guarantee, financing or other arrangements, agreements or understandings entered into in connection with, or contemplated by or resulting from, the merger or otherwise. In addition, Jefferies expressed
no opinion or view with respect to, and its opinion did not

address the relative fairness of, any consideration to holders of any class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of ClubCorp, other than the holders of ClubCorp common stock to the extent expressly
specified in Jefferies' opinion. Jefferies expressed no opinion as to the prices at which shares of ClubCorp common stock or any other securities of ClubCorp may trade or otherwise be transferable at any time.
Furthermore, Jefferies did not express any view or opinion as to the fairness, financial or otherwise, of the amount or nature of any compensation or other consideration payable to or to be received by any
officers, directors or employees, or any class of such persons, in connection with the merger relative to the per share merger consideration or otherwise. The issuance of Jefferies' opinion was authorized by
Jefferies' fairness committee.

        In connection with rendering its opinion to the Board, Jefferies performed a variety of financial and comparative analyses, which are summarized below. The following summary is not a complete
description of all analyses performed and factors considered by Jefferies in connection with its opinion. The preparation of a financial opinion is a complex process involving subjective judgments and is not
necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. With respect to the selected public companies and selected precedent transactions analyses summarized below, no company or transaction used
as a comparison was identical or directly comparable to ClubCorp or the merger. These analyses necessarily involved complex considerations and judgments concerning financial and operating characteristics
and other factors that could affect the public trading, acquisition or other values of the companies or transactions concerned.

        Jefferies believes that its analyses and the summary below must be considered as a whole and that selecting portions of its analyses and factors or focusing on information presented in tabular format,
without considering all analyses and factors or the narrative description of the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the processes underlying Jefferies' analyses and opinion. Jefferies did not
draw, in isolation, conclusions from or with regard to any one factor or method of analysis for purposes of its opinion, but rather arrived at its ultimate opinion based on the results of all analyses undertaken by
it and assessed as a whole.

        The estimates of the future performance of ClubCorp in or underlying Jefferies' analyses are not necessarily indicative of future results or values, which may be significantly more or less favorable than
those estimates. In performing its analyses, Jefferies considered industry performance, general business and economic conditions and other matters, many of which were beyond the control of ClubCorp.
Estimates of the financial value of companies do not purport to be appraisals or necessarily reflect the prices at which companies or securities actually may be sold or acquired. Accordingly, the estimates used
in, and the range of the valuations resulting from, any particular analysis described below are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty and should not be taken as Jefferies' view of the actual value of
ClubCorp or its securities.

        The per share merger consideration to be received by holders of ClubCorp common stock pursuant to the merger agreement was determined through negotiations between ClubCorp and AGM, and the
decision by ClubCorp to enter into the merger agreement was solely that of the Board. Jefferies' opinion and financial analyses were only one of many factors considered by the Board in its evaluation of the per
share merger consideration and should not be viewed as determinative of the views of the Board or management with respect to the merger or the consideration payable in the merger.

Financial Analyses

        The following is a summary of the material financial analyses provided to the Board and performed by Jefferies in connection with its opinion. The financial analyses summarized below include
information presented in tabular format. In order to fully understand Jefferies' financial analyses, the tables must be read together with the text of each summary. The tables alone do not constitute
a complete description of the financial analyses. Considering the data below without considering the full narrative description of the financial analyses, including the methodologies and assumptions
underlying the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of Jefferies' financial analyses. For purposes of the financial analyses described below, the term "adjusted EBITDA" means earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA"), as adjusted for non-cash items including equity-based compensation expense, acquisitions and dispositions and one-time non-recurring items.
Approximate implied per share equity value reference ranges derived for ClubCorp from the selected public companies and selected precedent transactions analyses described below assume no cash outlays for
annual deposit refunds or escheatment payments for membership initiation deposit liabilities. Approximate implied per share equity value reference ranges derived for ClubCorp from the discounted cash flow
analysis described below assume no additional cash outlays for annual deposit refunds beyond historical levels and no escheatment payments.

        Selected Public Companies Analysis.    Jefferies reviewed publicly available financial, stock market and operating information of ClubCorp and the following 14 selected publicly traded companies in the
leisure industry, separated into two tiers: (i) tier one consisting of five selected publicly traded companies (the "tier one selected companies") and (ii) tier two consisting of nine selected publicly traded
companies (the "tier two selected companies" and, together with the tier one selected companies, collectively, the "selected companies"), with particular focus on the tier one selected companies based on,
among other things, membership models and/or certain growth, operating and financial characteristics:

        Jefferies reviewed, among other information, enterprise values, calculated as fully-diluted equity values based on closing stock prices on July 7, 2017 (the last trading day prior to execution of the merger
agreement) plus book value of debt, preferred stock and non-controlling interests (as applicable) less cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities, as a multiple of calendar year 2017 and calendar year
2018 estimated adjusted EBITDA. Estimated financial data of the selected companies were based on publicly available Wall Street research analysts' estimates, public filings and other publicly available
information, calendarized in certain instances for comparative purposes. Estimated financial data of ClubCorp was based on publicly available information and financial forecasts and estimates of management.

        The overall low to high calendar year 2017 and calendar year 2018 estimated adjusted EBITDA multiples observed for the selected companies were 7.0x to 16.8x (with a median of 11.0x) and 6.9x to 14.6x
(with a median of 10.2x), respectively, with overall low to high calendar year 2017 and calendar year 2018 estimated adjusted EBITDA multiples observed for the tier one selected companies of 7.0x

the tier two selected companies of 8.9x to 16.8x (with a median of 11.2x) and 8.1x to 14.6x (with a median of 10.4x), respectively. Jefferies then applied selected ranges of calendar year 2017 and calendar year
2018 estimated adjusted EBITDA multiples of 7.5x to 9.5x and 7.0x to 9.0x, respectively, derived from the selected companies to ClubCorp's fiscal year 2017 and fiscal year 2018 estimated adjusted EBITDA
based on financial forecasts and estimates of management. This analysis indicated the following approximate implied per share equity value reference ranges for ClubCorp, as compared to the per share merger
consideration:

        Selected Precedent Transactions Analysis.    Using publicly available information, Jefferies reviewed, among other things, financial data relating to the following 14 selected transactions that Jefferies
considered generally relevant as transactions involving target companies in the leisure industry announced during the approximate five-year period commencing on January 1, 2012 (collectively, the "selected
transactions"):

        Jefferies reviewed, among other information, transaction values of the selected transactions, calculated as the enterprise values implied for the target companies based on the consideration payable for the
equity value of the target companies plus book value of debt, preferred stock and non-controlling interests (as applicable) less cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities, as a multiple of such target
companies' latest 12 months adjusted EBITDA as of the applicable announcement date. Financial data of the selected transactions were based on public filings and other publicly available information. Financial
data of ClubCorp was based on internal estimates of management.

        The overall low to high latest 12 months adjusted EBITDA multiples observed for the selected transactions were 6.2x to 15.0x. Jefferies then applied a selected range of latest 12 months adjusted EBITDA
multiples of 7.0x to 9.0x derived from the selected transactions to ClubCorp's latest 12 months (as of June 13, 2017) adjusted EBITDA (pro forma for ClubCorp acquisitions during the four quarters ended
June 13, 2017 as though consummated on the first day of the third quarter of

ClubCorp's fiscal year 2016). This analysis indicated the following approximate implied per share equity value reference range for ClubCorp, as compared to the per share merger consideration:

        Discounted Cash Flow Analysis.    Jefferies performed a discounted cash flow analysis of ClubCorp, using both a terminal multiple approach and a perpetuity growth rate approach, to calculate a range of
implied present values of the standalone unlevered, after-tax free cash flows that ClubCorp was forecasted to generate during the second half of the fiscal year ending December 26, 2017 through the full fiscal
year ending December 28, 2021 utilizing financial forecasts and estimates of management. For purposes of this analysis, (i) the estimated present value of ClubCorp's potential net operating loss carryforwards
expected by management to be utilized by ClubCorp during the fiscal years ending December 26, 2017 through December 28, 2021 was taken into account and (ii) stock-based compensation was treated as a
cash expense. Terminal values of ClubCorp were calculated by applying to ClubCorp's fiscal year ending December 28, 2021 estimated adjusted EBITDA a selected range of adjusted EBITDA multiples of 7.0x
to 9.0x. Terminal values of ClubCorp also were calculated by applying to ClubCorp's standalone unlevered, after-tax free cash flows for the fiscal year ending December 28, 2021 (normalized for acquisitions
and projected reinventions per management) a selected range of perpetuity growth rates of 2.75% to 3.25%. The present values (as of June 14, 2017) of the cash flows and terminal values were then calculated
using a selected discount rate range of 9.00% to 10.00% and the present value (as of June 14, 2017) of ClubCorp's net operating loss carryforwards was calculated using a selected discount rate range of 11.50%
to 12.50%. This analysis indicated the following approximate implied per share equity value reference range for ClubCorp, as compared to the per share merger consideration:

Certain Additional Information

        Jefferies observed certain additional publicly available information, which information was not considered part of its financial analyses for its opinion but rather was noted for informational purposes,
relating to the premiums paid or proposed to be paid in selected mergers and acquisition transactions announced from January 1, 2013 to July 7, 2017; applying selected ranges of premiums of approximately
13.2% and 41.3% and approximately 17.3% and 47.2% (reflecting the overall 25th and 75th percentile premiums derived from such transactions based on the closing stock prices of the target companies
involved in such transactions one trading day and four weeks, respectively, prior to public announcement of such transactions) to the closing price of ClubCorp common stock on July 7, 2017 indicated an
overall implied equity reference range for ClubCorp of approximately $14.38 to $19.87 per share.

Miscellaneous

        ClubCorp has agreed to pay Jefferies for its financial advisory services in connection with the merger an aggregate fee currently estimated to be approximately $11 million, of which a portion was payable
upon delivery of Jefferies' opinion and approximately $10 million is payable contingent upon consummation of the merger. ClubCorp also has agreed to reimburse Jefferies for expenses, including fees and
expenses of counsel, incurred in connection with Jefferies' engagement, and to indemnify Jefferies and related parties against liabilities, including liabilities under federal securities laws, arising

out of or in connection with the services rendered and to be rendered by Jefferies under its engagement.

        In the ordinary course of business, Jefferies and its affiliates may trade or hold securities of ClubCorp, AGM and certain of their respective affiliates and/or portfolio companies, as the case may be, for
Jefferies' own account and for the accounts of Jefferies' customers and, accordingly, may at any time hold long or short positions in those securities. As the Board was aware, Jefferies and its affiliates in the past
have provided and in the future may provide financial advisory and financing services unrelated to the merger to ClubCorp, AGM and certain of their respective affiliates and/or portfolio companies, as the case
may be, for which services Jefferies and its affiliates have received and would expect to receive compensation, including, during the two-year period prior to the date of its opinion, having acted as (i) in the case
of ClubCorp and its affiliates, joint lead bookrunning manager for a secondary offering of ClubCorp common stock, for which services, as described in this clause (i), Jefferies and its affiliates received an
aggregate fee of approximately $2.5 million from ClubCorp, and (ii) in the case of AGM and certain of its affiliates and/or portfolio companies, (a) financial advisor to AGM in connection with an acquisition
and financial advisor to a portfolio company of AGM in connection with a private placement of equity and debt securities, (b) dealer manager in connection with a consent solicitation for a portfolio company of
AGM, (c) joint bookrunning manager for certain senior secured and senior unsecured note offerings for certain portfolio companies of AGM, and (d) sole lead or joint lead arranger for, and as a lender under,
various credit facilities for AGM and certain of its portfolio companies, for which services, as described in clauses (ii)(a) through (d) above, Jefferies and its affiliates received aggregate fees of approximately
$44 million from AGM and certain of its affiliates and/or portfolio companies.

        Jefferies was selected to act as ClubCorp's financial advisor in connection with the merger because, among other factors, Jefferies is an internationally recognized investment banking firm with substantial
experience in merger and acquisition transactions, its familiarity with ClubCorp and its business and its reputation. Jefferies is regularly engaged in the valuation of businesses and securities in connection with
mergers and acquisitions, leveraged buyouts, negotiated underwritings, competitive bids, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities and private placements.

Opinion of Wells Fargo Securities, LLC

        ClubCorp also has engaged Wells Fargo Securities as a financial advisor to ClubCorp in connection with the merger. As part of Wells Fargo Securities' engagement, the Board requested that Wells Fargo
Securities evaluate the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the per share merger consideration to be received by holders of ClubCorp common stock pursuant to the merger agreement. On July 9, 2017, at
a meeting of the Board held to evaluate the merger, Wells Fargo Securities rendered to the Board an oral opinion, confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated July 9, 2017, to the effect that, as of such date
and based on and subject to various assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and limitations and qualifications on the review undertaken stated in its opinion, the per share merger
consideration to be received by holders of ClubCorp common stock pursuant to the merger agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.

        The full text of Wells Fargo Securities' written opinion, dated July 9, 2017, to the Board is attached as Annex C to this proxy statement and is incorporated in this proxy statement by reference.
The written opinion sets forth, among other things, the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and limitations and qualifications on the review undertaken by Wells Fargo
Securities in rendering its opinion. The following summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the opinion. The opinion was addressed to the Board (in its capacity as such) for
its information and use in connection with its evaluation of the per share merger consideration from a financial point of view and did not address any other terms, aspects or implications of the
merger. Wells Fargo Securities' opinion did not address the merits of the underlying decision by ClubCorp to

enter into the merger agreement or the relative merits of the merger compared with other business strategies or transactions available or that have been or might be considered by ClubCorp or the
Board or in which ClubCorp might engage. Wells Fargo Securities' opinion does not constitute a recommendation to the Board or any other person or entity in respect of the merger, including as to
how any holder of any of ClubCorp's securities should vote or act in connection with the merger or any other matters.

        The terms of the merger were determined through negotiations between ClubCorp and AGM, rather than by any financial advisor, and the decision to enter into the merger agreement was solely that of the
Board. Wells Fargo Securities did not recommend any specific form of consideration to the Board or that any specific form of consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration for the merger. Wells
Fargo Securities' opinion was only one of many factors considered by the Board in its evaluation of the per share merger consideration and should not be viewed as determinative of the views of the Board,
management or any other party with respect to the merger or the consideration payable in the merger.

        In arriving at its opinion, Wells Fargo Securities, among other things:

• reviewed an execution copy, provided to Wells Fargo Securities on July 9, 2017, of the merger agreement, including the financial terms thereof; 

• reviewed certain publicly available business, financial and other information regarding ClubCorp, including information set forth in ClubCorp's annual reports on Form 10-K for the fiscal years
ended December 27, 2014, December 27, 2015 and December 27, 2016 and quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2017; 

• reviewed certain other business and financial information regarding ClubCorp furnished to Wells Fargo Securities by and discussed with management, including financial forecasts and estimates
relating to ClubCorp prepared by management; 

• discussed with management the operations and prospects of ClubCorp, including the historical financial performance and trends in the results of operations of ClubCorp; 

• participated in discussions and negotiations among representatives of ClubCorp, AGM and their respective advisors regarding the merger and considered the results of the efforts on behalf of
ClubCorp to solicit, at the direction of ClubCorp, indications of interest and definitive proposals from third parties regarding a possible acquisition of all or a portion of, or a strategic investment
in, ClubCorp; 

• reviewed reported prices and trading activity for ClubCorp common stock; 

• compared certain financial data of ClubCorp with similar data of certain publicly traded companies that Wells Fargo Securities deemed relevant in evaluating ClubCorp; 

• compared the proposed financial terms of the merger with financial terms of certain business combinations and other transactions that Wells Fargo Securities deemed relevant in evaluating the
merger; 

• analyzed the estimated present value of the future cash flows per share of ClubCorp based upon the financial forecasts and estimates referred to above and related assumptions discussed with and
confirmed as reasonable by management; and 

• considered such other information, such as financial studies and analyses, as well as financial, economic and market criteria, and made such other inquiries, as Wells Fargo Securities deemed
relevant.

or sufficiency of allowances for losses or other matters with respect thereto.

        In rendering its opinion, Wells Fargo Securities assumed, at the direction of ClubCorp, that the final form of the merger agreement, when signed by the parties thereto, would not differ from the execution
copy merger agreement reviewed by Wells Fargo Securities in any respect meaningful to Wells Fargo Securities' analyses or opinion, that the merger would be consummated in accordance with the terms
described in the merger agreement and related documents and in compliance with all applicable laws, documents and other requirements without amendment or waiver of any material terms or conditions and
that, in the course of obtaining any necessary governmental, regulatory or third party consents, approvals or agreements for the merger, no delay, limitation or restriction, including any divestiture or other
requirements, would be imposed or occur or action would be taken that would be meaningful in any respect to Wells Fargo Securities' analyses or opinion.

Fargo Securities' opinion. Although subsequent developments may affect the matters set forth in its opinion, Wells Fargo Securities does not have any obligation to update, revise, reaffirm or withdraw its
opinion or otherwise comment on or consider any such events occurring or coming to Wells Fargo Securities' attention after the date of its opinion.

        Wells Fargo Securities' opinion only addressed the fairness, from a financial point of view and as of the date of the opinion, of the per share merger consideration to be received by holders of ClubCorp
common stock to the extent expressly specified in Wells Fargo Securities' opinion, without regard to individual circumstances of specific holders that may distinguish such holders or the securities of ClubCorp
held by such holders, and no opinion or view was expressed as to the relative fairness or otherwise of any consideration or other amounts payable to other securityholders or constituents or in respect of any
other securities of ClubCorp. Wells Fargo Securities' opinion did not address any other terms, aspects or implications of the merger, including, without limitation, the form or structure of the merger or any
terms, aspects or implications of any guarantee, financing or other arrangements, agreements or understandings entered into in connection with or contemplated by the merger or otherwise. In addition, Wells
Fargo Securities' opinion did not address the fairness of the amount or nature of, or any other aspects relating to, any compensation to be received by any officers, directors or employees of any parties to the
merger or any related entities, or class of such persons, relative to the per share merger consideration or otherwise. Wells Fargo Securities' opinion also did not address the merits of the underlying decision by
ClubCorp to enter into the merger agreement or the relative merits of the merger compared with other business strategies or transactions available or that have been or might be considered by ClubCorp or the
Board or in which ClubCorp might engage. Wells Fargo Securities also did not express any opinion or view with respect to, and relied upon the assessments of representatives of ClubCorp regarding,
accounting, tax, regulatory, legal or similar matters as to which Wells Fargo Securities understood that ClubCorp obtained such advice as ClubCorp deemed necessary from qualified professionals. Except as
described in this summary, ClubCorp imposed no other instructions or limitations on Wells Fargo Securities with respect to the investigations made or procedures followed by Wells Fargo Securities in rendering
its opinion.

        In connection with rendering its opinion, Wells Fargo Securities performed certain financial, comparative and other analyses as summarized below. This summary is not a complete description of the
financial analyses performed and factors considered in connection with such opinion. In arriving at its opinion, Wells Fargo Securities did not ascribe a specific value to ClubCorp common stock but rather made
its determinations as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the per share merger consideration on the basis of various financial and comparative analyses taken as a whole. The preparation of a
financial opinion is a complex process and involves various determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant methods of financial and comparative analyses and the application of those methods to the
particular circumstances. Therefore, a financial opinion is not readily susceptible to summary description.

        In arriving at its opinion, Wells Fargo Securities did not attribute any particular weight to any single analysis or factor considered but rather made qualitative judgments as to the significance and relevance
of each analysis and factor relative to all other analyses performed and factors considered in the context of the circumstances of this particular transaction. Accordingly, the analyses must be considered as a
whole, as considering any portion of such analyses and factors, without considering all analyses and factors as a whole, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the process underlying such opinion. The
fact that any specific analysis has been referred to in the summary below is not meant to indicate that such analysis was given greater weight than any other analysis referred to in the summary. No company is
identical to ClubCorp and an evaluation of Wells Fargo Securities' analyses is not entirely mathematical; rather, such analyses involve complex considerations and judgments concerning financial and operating
characteristics and other factors that could affect the public trading or other values of the companies reviewed.

        In performing its analyses, Wells Fargo Securities considered industry performance, general business and economic conditions and other matters existing as of the date of its opinion, many of which are
beyond the control of ClubCorp or any other parties to the merger. None of ClubCorp, Wells Fargo Securities or any other person assumes responsibility if future results are different from those described
whether or not any such difference is material. Any estimates contained in these analyses and the ranges of values resulting from any particular analysis are not necessarily indicative of actual values or
predictive of future results or values, which may be significantly more or less favorable than as set forth below. In addition, analyses relating to the value of properties, businesses or securities do not purport to
be appraisals or necessarily reflect the prices at which properties, businesses or securities may actually be sold or acquired. Accordingly, the assumptions and estimates used in, and the results derived from, the
following analyses are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty.

Financial Analyses

        The following is a summary of the material financial analyses provided on July 9, 2017 to the Board by Wells Fargo Securities in connection with its opinion. Certain financial analyses summarized
below include information presented in tabular format. In order to fully understand the financial analyses, the tables must be read together with the text of each summary, as the tables alone do not
constitute a complete description of the financial analyses. Considering the data in the tables below without considering the full narrative description of the financial analyses, including the
methodologies and assumptions underlying the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of such financial analyses. For purposes of the financial analyses described below, the term
"adjusted EBITDA" means EBITDA as adjusted for non-cash items including equity-based compensation expense, acquisitions and dispositions and one-time non-recurring items. Approximate implied equity
value per share reference ranges derived for ClubCorp from the selected public companies and selected precedent transactions analyses described below assume no cash outlays in connection with refunds or
escheatment of membership initiation deposits. Approximate implied equity value per share reference range derived for ClubCorp from the discounted cash flow analysis described below assumes no additional
cash outlays beyond historical levels for membership initiation deposit liabilities and no escheatment payments.

        Selected Public Companies Analysis.    Wells Fargo Securities reviewed publicly available financial, stock market and operating information of ClubCorp and the following 14 selected publicly traded
companies in the leisure industry, separated into two tiers: (i) tier one consisting of five selected publicly traded companies (the "tier one selected companies") and (ii) tier two consisting of nine selected
publicly traded companies (the "tier two selected companies" and, together with the tier one selected companies, collectively, the "selected companies"), with particular focus on the tier one selected companies
based on, among other things, membership models and/or certain growth, operating and financial characteristics:

        Wells Fargo Securities reviewed, among other information, enterprise values, calculated as fully-diluted equity values based on closing stock prices on July 7, 2017 (the last trading day prior to execution of
the merger agreement) plus book value of debt, preferred stock and non-controlling interests (as applicable) less cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities, as a multiple of calendar year 2017 and
calendar year 2018 estimated adjusted EBITDA. Estimated financial data of the selected companies were based on publicly available Wall Street research analysts' estimates, public filings and other publicly
available information, calendarized in certain instances for comparative purposes. Estimated financial data of ClubCorp was based on publicly available Wall Street research analysts' estimates, public filings
and financial forecasts and estimates of management.

        The overall low to high calendar year 2017 and calendar year 2018 estimated adjusted EBITDA multiples observed for the selected companies were 7.0x to 16.8x and 6.9x to 14.6x, respectively, with
overall low to high calendar year 2017 and calendar year 2018 estimated adjusted EBITDA multiples observed for the tier one selected companies of 7.0x to 11.2x (with a median of 9.6x) and 6.9x to 10.3x
(with a median of 9.1x), respectively, and overall low to high calendar year 2017 and calendar year 2018 estimated adjusted EBITDA multiples observed for the tier two selected companies of 8.9x to 16.8x
(with a median of 11.2x) and 8.1x to 14.6x (with a median of 10.4x), respectively. Wells Fargo Securities noted that the fiscal year 2017 and fiscal year 2018 estimated adjusted EBITDA multiples observed for
ClubCorp were 7.5x and 7.0x, respectively (in each case, based on publicly available Wall Street research analysts' estimates). Wells Fargo Securities then applied selected ranges of calendar year 2017 and
calendar year 2018 estimated adjusted EBITDA multiples of 7.5x to 9.5x and 7.0x to 9.0x, respectively, derived from the selected companies to fiscal year 2017 and fiscal year 2018 estimated adjusted EBITDA
of ClubCorp based on financial forecasts and estimates of management. This analysis indicated the following approximate implied equity value per share reference ranges for ClubCorp, as compared to the per
share merger consideration:

        Selected Precedent Transactions Analysis.    Using publicly available information, Wells Fargo Securities reviewed, among other things, financial data relating to the following 14 selected transactions that
Wells Fargo Securities considered generally relevant as transactions involving target companies in the leisure industry announced during the approximate five-year period commencing on January 1, 2012

        Wells Fargo Securities reviewed, among other information, transaction values of the selected transactions, calculated as the enterprise values implied for the target companies based on the consideration
payable for the equity value of the target companies plus book value of debt, preferred stock and non-controlling interests (as applicable) less cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities, as a multiple
of such target companies' latest 12 months adjusted EBITDA as of the applicable announcement date. Financial data of the selected transactions were based on public filings and other publicly available
information. Financial data of ClubCorp was based on internal estimates of management.

        The overall low to high latest 12 months adjusted EBITDA multiples observed for the selected transactions were 6.2x to 15.0x. Wells Fargo Securities then applied a selected range of latest 12 months
adjusted EBITDA multiples of 7.0x to 9.0x derived from the selected transactions to ClubCorp's latest 12 months (as of June 13, 2017) adjusted EBITDA (which reflected incremental run-rate EBITDA from
ClubCorp acquisitions per management). This analysis indicated the following approximate implied equity value per share reference range for ClubCorp, as compared to the per share merger consideration:

        Discounted Cash Flow Analysis.    Wells Fargo Securities performed a discounted cash flow analysis of ClubCorp to calculate a range of implied present values of the standalone unlevered, after-tax free
cash flows that ClubCorp was forecasted to generate during the second half of the fiscal year ending December 26, 2017 through the full fiscal year ending December 28, 2021 utilizing financial forecasts and
estimates of management. For purposes of this analysis, (i) the estimated present value of ClubCorp's potential net operating loss carryforwards expected by the management of ClubCorp to be utilized by
ClubCorp during the fiscal years ending December 26, 2017 through December 28, 2021 was taken into account, and (ii) stock-based compensation was treated as a cash expense. Terminal values of ClubCorp
were calculated by applying to ClubCorp's fiscal year ending December 28, 2021 estimated adjusted EBITDA a selected range of adjusted EBITDA multiples of 7.0x to 9.0x. The present values (as of June 14,
2017) of the cash flows and terminal values were then calculated using a selected discount rate range of 9.00% to 10.00% and the estimated present value (as of June 14, 2017) of ClubCorp's net operating loss
carryforwards was calculated using a selected discount rate range of 11.50% to 12.50%. This analysis indicated the following approximate implied equity value per share reference range for ClubCorp, as
compared to the per share merger consideration:

Miscellaneous

        Wells Fargo Securities is the trade name for certain capital markets and investment banking services of Wells Fargo & Company and its subsidiaries, including Wells Fargo Securities. Wells Fargo
Securities is an internationally recognized investment banking firm which is regularly engaged in providing financial advisory services in connection with mergers and acquisitions. ClubCorp selected Wells
Fargo Securities as a financial advisor in connection with the merger because of its qualifications, reputation and experience generally and particularly in the real estate industry and its familiarity with ClubCorp
and its business. The issuance of Wells Fargo Securities' opinion was approved by an authorized committee of Wells Fargo Securities.

        ClubCorp has agreed to pay Wells Fargo Securities for its financial advisory services in connection with the merger an aggregate fee currently estimated to be approximately $11 million, of which a

portion was payable upon delivery of Wells Fargo Securities' opinion and approximately $10 million is payable contingent upon consummation of the merger. ClubCorp also has agreed to reimburse certain of
Wells Fargo Securities' expenses, including fees and disbursements of Wells Fargo Securities' counsel, and to indemnify Wells Fargo Securities and certain related parties against certain liabilities, including
liabilities under the U.S. federal securities laws, that may arise out of Wells Fargo Securities' engagement. In addition, as the Board was aware, Wells Fargo Securities' affiliate, Wells Fargo Bank, was requested
to provide, and provided, a consent waiving certain change-of-control provisions that otherwise would be triggered by virtue of the merger under Wells Fargo Bank's secured mortgage loan to an affiliate of
ClubCorp, for which consent Wells Fargo Securities' affiliate received compensation.

        Wells Fargo Securities and its affiliates provide a full range of investment banking and financial advisory, securities trading, brokerage and lending services in the ordinary course of business, for which
Wells Fargo Securities and such affiliates receive customary fees and, given certain policies and procedures designed to preserve the independence of Wells Fargo Securities' research and credit analysts, the
views of such analysts may differ from those reflected in Wells Fargo Securities' analyses and opinion. In connection with unrelated matters, Wells Fargo Securities and its affiliates in the past have provided,
currently are providing and in the future may provide investment banking services to ClubCorp, AGM and certain of their respective affiliates and/or portfolio companies, as the case may be, for which Wells
Fargo Securities and its affiliates have received and would expect to receive fees including, during the two-year period prior to the date of Wells Fargo Securities' opinion, having acted or acting as (i) in the case
of ClubCorp and certain of its affiliates, (a) joint bookrunning manager for a secondary offering of ClubCorp common stock, (b) joint bookrunning manager for a debt offering of a subsidiary of ClubCorp, and
(c) joint lead arranger and joint bookrunner for, and as a lender under, certain credit facilities of ClubCorp and certain of its affiliates, and (ii) in the case of AGM and certain of its affiliates and/or portfolio
companies, (a) joint bookrunning manager and/or placement agent for certain equity offerings of AGM and certain of its portfolio companies, (b) joint lead or joint bookrunning manager and/or co-manager for
certain debt offerings of AGM and certain of its portfolio companies, (c) joint lead arranger, joint bookrunner and/or syndication agent for, and as a lender under, certain credit facilities of AGM and certain of
its portfolio companies, and (d) broker for certain real estate sales. During the two-year period prior to the date of Wells Fargo Securities' opinion, Wells Fargo Securities and its affiliates received or expected to
receive for the services described in clauses (i)(a) through (c) and (ii)(a) through (d) above aggregate fees of approximately $2.5 million from ClubCorp and/or certain of its affiliates and approximately
$31 million from AGM and certain of its affiliates and/or portfolio companies. In the ordinary course of business, Wells Fargo Securities and its affiliates may actively trade, hold or otherwise effect transactions
in the securities or financial instruments (including bank loans or other obligations) of ClubCorp, AGM, and certain of their respective affiliates and/or portfolio companies, as the case may be, for Wells Fargo
Securities' and its affiliates' own account and for the accounts of customers and, accordingly, may at any time hold a long or short position in such securities or financial instruments.

Certain Financial Projections 

        ClubCorp provided certain prospective financial information to Apollo and each of the other potential investors that were granted access to the data room. In addition, based on certain estimates and
assumptions of management, the Board considered certain other estimates and assumptions regarding ClubCorp. We refer to this prospective financial information for 2017 to 2021 as the "Projections."
ClubCorp also provided the Projections to Jefferies and Wells Fargo for their use and reliance in connection with their respective financial analyses and opinions summarized above under "The Merger—
Opinions of ClubCorp's Financial Advisors." The Projections were largely based on a LRO previously prepared for our Board, which projections were updated as deemed necessary by management. A summary
of the Projections is set forth below.

        ClubCorp does not as a matter of course make public projections as to future sales, earnings or other results. However, the management of ClubCorp has prepared the prospective financial information set
forth below for the reasons described in the preceding paragraph. The accompanying Projections were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure or with a view toward complying with the guidelines
established by the SEC, or by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants with respect to prospective financial information, but, in the view of ClubCorp's management, were prepared on a
reasonable basis, reflect the best currently available estimates and judgments and present, to the best of management's knowledge and belief, the expected course of action and the expected future results and
readers of this proxy statement are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the prospective financial information.

        Neither ClubCorp's independent registered public accounting firm nor any other independent accountants have compiled, examined or performed any procedures with respect to the Projections contained
herein, nor have they expressed any opinion or any other form of assurance on such information or its achievability and assume no responsibility for, and disclaim any association with, the Projections.
ClubCorp's independent registered public accounting firm disclaims any association with the Projections. The Projections included in this proxy statement have been prepared by, and are the responsibility of,
our management. The Projections were prepared solely for internal use of ClubCorp and are subjective in many respects.

        The Projections are forward-looking statements. For information on factors that may cause ClubCorp's future results to materially vary, see the section of this proxy statement captioned "Cautionary
Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements." Although the Projections are presented with numerical specificity, they reflect numerous assumptions and estimates as to future events that management
believed were reasonable taking into account relevant information available to management at the time prepared. Because the Projections cover multiple years, by their nature, they become subject to greater
uncertainty with each successive year. This information is not fact and should not be relied upon as necessarily indicative of actual future results. Important factors that may affect actual results and cause the
Projections not to be achieved include (1) general economic conditions; (2) changes in certain accounting assumptions; (3) changes in actual or projected cash flows; (4) competitive pressures; and (5) changes
in tax laws. In addition, the Projections do not take into account any circumstances or events occurring after the date that they were prepared and do not give effect to the merger. As a result, there can be no
assurance that the Projections will be realized, and actual results may be materially better or worse than those contained in the Projections. The inclusion of this information should not be regarded as an
indication that the Board, ClubCorp or any other recipient of this information considered, or now considers, the Projections to be predictive of actual future results. The Projections are not included in this proxy
statement in order to induce any ClubCorp stockholder to vote in favor of any proposal to be considered at the special meeting. ClubCorp does not intend to update or otherwise revise the Projections to
reflect circumstances existing after the date when made or to reflect the occurrence of future events, even in the event that any or all of the assumptions underlying the Projections are shown to be in
error or no longer appropriate.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

        Adjusted EBITDA and levered free cash flow are non-GAAP financial measures and should not be considered in isolation, more meaningful than or as a substitute for a measure of performance or liquidity
prepared in accordance with GAAP and are not indicative of net income or loss or operating cash flows as determined under GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations that should be considered
before being used as measures to evaluate ClubCorp's financial performance or liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA and levered free cash flow, as presented, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported
by other companies due to varying methods of calculation. ClubCorp uses Adjusted EBITDA to (1) internally measure our operating performance, (2) evaluate segment performance and allocate resources and
support certain valuation analyses and (3) assess our ability to service our debt, incur additional debt, make acquisitions, pay dividends and make capital expenditures. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is
useful to investors and lenders as a performance measure because it adjusts our operating results to be reflective of our core, ongoing, operating performance. As such, Adjusted EBITDA provides relevant
information about trends for the periods presented and adjusts for the impact of certain items on a consistent basis from period to period. Levered free cash flow provides another measure by which to evaluate
ClubCorp's core operating performance and trends, but is not used by ClubCorp for financial and operational decision making or as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. The non-GAAP financial
measures included in the Projections are defined below. In addition, a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, which is the most directly comparable GAAP measure, is included below. We have not
reconciled levered free cash flow to operating cash flows, which is the most directly comparable GAAP measure, because this cannot be done without unreasonable effort due to the high variability associated
with working capital fluctuations, and the complexity and low visibility with respect to other transactions that impact operating cash flows. We expect the variability of these charges to have a potentially
unpredictable, and potentially significant, impact on our future GAAP financial results.

        For purposes of determining Adjusted EBITDA, (i) "EBITDA" is defined as net income before interest expense, income taxes, interest and investment income, and depreciation and amortization, and
(ii) "Adjusted EBITDA" is defined as EBITDA plus or minus impairments, gain or loss on disposition and acquisition of assets, income or loss from divested clubs, loss on extinguishment of debt, non-cash and
other adjustments, equity-based compensation expense and an acquisition adjustment.

        Levered cash flow is defined as Adjusted EBITDA plus or minus interest, income taxes, maintenance capital expenditures, expansion capital, capital lease payments and certain other payments.

        ClubCorp's use of non-GAAP financial measures, including Adjusted EBITDA and levered free cash flow, has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider any non-GAAP financial
measure in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are: (1) although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being
depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and our non-GAAP financial measures do not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure
requirements; (2) our non-GAAP financial measures do not reflect gains or losses on divestitures; (3) our non-GAAP financial measures do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, ClubCorp's working
capital needs; (4) our non-GAAP financial measures do not consider the potentially dilutive impact of share-based compensation; (5) our non-GAAP financial measures do not reflect tax payments that may
represent a reduction in cash available to us; and (6) our levered free cash flow measure excludes adjustments related to net membership cash flow, other working capital adjustments, expansion capital,
dividends, voluntary prepayments on our term loan, and other

adjustments including finance transformation costs, acquisition closing costs, and other non-recurring expenses.

        Given these limitations, you should consider our non-GAAP financial measures alongside other financial performance measures, including various cash flow metrics, net income and our other GAAP
results.

Reconciliation of Levered Free Cash Flow to Adjusted EBITDA

Interests of ClubCorp's Executive Officers and Directors in the Merger 

        In considering the recommendation of the ClubCorp Board that you vote to approve the merger proposal, you should be aware that, aside from their interests as ClubCorp stockholders, ClubCorp's directors
and executive officers have interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of ClubCorp stockholders generally, which may create potential conflicts of interest. These interests are
described in more detail below, and with respect to the named executive officers of ClubCorp, are quantified in the "Golden Parachute Compensation" table below. The ClubCorp Board was aware of these
interests and considered them when it adopted the merger agreement and approved the merger.

        With regard to our directors serving on the ClubCorp Board (other than Eric L. Affeldt, whose interests are as an executive officer and further described below), these interests relate to the impact of the
transaction on the directors' outstanding equity awards (which consist solely of Restricted Shares) and the provision of indemnification, the advancement of expenses, exculpation and insurance arrangements
pursuant to the merger agreement and ClubCorp's articles of incorporation and bylaws, which reflect that such directors may be subject to claims arising from their service on the ClubCorp Board, subject in all
respects to the limitations set forth in the merger agreement. In addition, Parent has agreed in the merger agreement to perform the indemnification agreements between ClubCorp and the directors serving on the
ClubCorp Board, subject in all respects to the limitations set forth in the merger agreement. We estimate that the aggregate amount that would become payable to our directors serving on the ClubCorp Board
(other than Eric L. Affeldt, whose interests are as an executive officer and further described below) in settlement of their unvested equity awards if the effective time was November 1, 2017, based on a price per
share of ClubCorp common stock of $17.12, is approximately $632,652.

but for the application of purchase accounting in connection with the acquisition of CCI in 2006 and the acquisition of Sequoia Golf on September 30, 2014.

and insurance arrangements, in each case as further described below:

• accelerated vesting of equity awards (other than (y) the Road to 300 PSUs, which are cancelled without payment, and (z) equity awards granted in 2017, which are treated as described in the next
bullet point) at the effective time for Messrs. Affeldt, Burnett and McClellan and Ms. Keiser, such that these executives will receive cash proceeds from the cancellation of such awards in the
aggregate amount of approximately $6,583,204 promptly following the effective time; 

• cancellation of Messrs. Affeldt, Burnett and McClellan and Ms. Keiser's 2017 equity awards and the equity awards of all other executive officers (other than the Road to 300 PSUs and the equity
awards referred to in the preceding bullet point) at the effective time for an aggregate payment of approximately $7,178,759, 50% of which will vest and be payable promptly following the
effective time and the remaining 50% will be payable 60 days following the effective time, subject to such executive officer's continued employment on the vesting dates (for Restricted Shares)
and the payment dates (for PSUs), with accelerated payment if such executive officer's employment is terminated for any reason other than for Cause or due to such executive officer's resignation
without Good Reason; 

• payment of cash transaction bonuses anticipated to be paid in the aggregate amount for all executive officers of approximately $2,525,000; 

• possible cash severance payments and other termination benefits under Change in Control Severance Agreements (in the case of Messrs. Affeldt, Burnett and McClellan and Ms. Keiser) and the
Severance Plan (in the case of Messrs. Feddersen, Droesch, Miller and Dupuis), in an aggregate amount of approximately $13,278,119 for all executive officers; and 

• the provision of indemnification, advancement of expenses and insurance arrangements pursuant to the merger agreement and ClubCorp's articles of incorporation and bylaws, and performance
under indemnification agreements between ClubCorp and its executive officers.

Treatment of Director and Executive Officer Common Stock

        As is the case for any stockholder of ClubCorp, ClubCorp's directors and executive officers will receive $17.12 in cash, without interest, for each share of ClubCorp common stock that they own at the
effective time. For information regarding beneficial ownership of ClubCorp's common stock by each of ClubCorp's current directors, ClubCorp's named executive officers and all directors and executive officers
as a group, see the section entitled "Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management" beginning on page 127.

Treatment of Director and Executive Officer Equity Awards

        As described under "The Merger Agreement—Treatment of ClubCorp Equity Awards" beginning on page 98, the merger agreement provides that each Restricted Share and each PSU will be treated as set
forth below.

Treatment of Restricted Shares

        Immediately prior to the effective time, each outstanding Restricted Share shall, automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and converted into the right of
the holder of such Restricted Share to receive $17.12 in cash plus any accrued dividends payable in respect of such Restricted Share; provided that the amounts payable with respect to such Restricted Shares
shall vest and be payable by the surviving corporation 50% at or promptly following the effective time and the remaining 50% 60 days following the effective time for awards that do not provide for accelerated
vesting at the effective time (and 100% promptly following the effective time for awards that provide for such accelerated vesting), subject to the applicable holder's continued employment through the
applicable vesting date (which payment date is subject to acceleration in connection with a termination of the applicable holder's employment for any reason other than for Cause or by such holder without Good
Reason (as each such term is defined in the merger agreement)) and in all cases, without any interest for the period from the effective time until such payment date and subject to applicable taxes required to be
withheld with respect to such payment.

Treatment of PSUs

        Immediately prior to the effective time, each outstanding PSU (other than any Road to 300 PSU) shall automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and
converted into the right of the holder of such PSU to receive, an amount in cash equal to the product of (A) the target number of shares subject to such PSU immediately prior to the effective time multiplied by
(B) $17.12 plus any accrued dividend equivalents payable in respect of such PSU; provided that the amounts payable with respect to such PSUs shall vest and be payable by the surviving corporation 50% at or
promptly following the effective time and the remaining 50% 60 days following the effective time for awards that do not provide for accelerated vesting at the effective time (and 100% promptly following the
effective time for awards that provide for such accelerated vesting), subject to the applicable holder's continued employment through the applicable payment date (which payment date is subject to acceleration
in connection with a termination of the applicable holder's employment for any reason other than for Cause or by such holder without Good Reason (as each such term is defined in the merger agreement)) and
in all cases, without any interest for the period from the effective time until such payment date and subject to applicable taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payment.

        Each Road to 300 PSU will automatically be cancelled immediately prior to the effective time without the payment of any consideration to the holder thereof.

Payments for Unvested Equity Awards

        The following table sets forth the amounts that each director, named executive officer and all other executive officers as a group of ClubCorp would receive with respect to Restricted Shares and PSUs
(other than Road to 300 PSUs, which are cancelled without payment), assuming the completion of the merger occurred on November 1, 2017.

        Under the Severance Plan, an eligible employee will be entitled to specified benefits if such eligible employee experiences a qualifying termination of employment (an involuntary termination of
employment by ClubCorp USA other than for "cause," as long as such eligible employee did not decline an offer of a "substantially similar position" (as each such term is defined in the Severance Plan)) during
the one-year period commencing on the date of the merger.

        Upon a qualifying termination, an executive officer would become entitled to the following:

• a lump-sum cash payment equal to (a) 3.0 for Mr. Affeldt, 2.0 for each of Messrs. Burnett and McClellan and Ms. Keiser and 1.0 for all other executive officers, multiplied by (b) the sum of
(1) the executive officer's annual base salary plus (2) for Messrs. Affeldt, Burnett and McClellan and Ms. Keiser, his or her target annual cash bonus award or, for our other executive officers,
such executive officer's annual cash bonus award actually earned from the prior year, if any; 

• payment of an amount equal to the annual cash bonus award, if any, for the year of termination that the executive officer would have earned if he or she had remained employed on the applicable
payment date for such bonus prorated based on the number of days that the named executive officer was employed during such year, payable when such bonus would have ordinarily been paid in
accordance with the applicable bonus plan; 

• payment by us of the executive officer's COBRA premiums for continued medical and dental (and, for participants in the Severance Plan, vision) coverage for a period of 36 months (for
Mr. Affeldt), 24 months (for Messrs. Burnett and McClellan and Ms. Keiser) or 12 months (for our other executive officers) following termination or, for Messrs. Affeldt, Burnett and McClellan
and Ms. Keiser, until such executive officer becomes eligible for coverage under another employer group plan or for our other executive officers, until such executive officer secures other
employment, unless the executive officer ceases to receive such COBRA premiums from us due to adverse tax consequences or becomes ineligible for COBRA coverage prior to the expiration of
the applicable period, in which case Messrs. Affeldt, Burnett and McClellan and Ms. Keiser shall instead receive a fully taxable monthly cash payment equal to the amount of the monthly
COBRA premium until the earlier of the expiration of the COBRA premium period and the date on which such executive officer becomes eligible for coverage under another employer group
plan and each other executive officer shall receive only the employer portion of such premium, paid on a fully tax grossed up basis, until the earlier of the expiration of the COBRA premium
period and the date on which such executive officer secures other employment; 

• for Messrs. Affeldt, Burnett and McClellan and Ms. Keiser, a dues-free recallable "life membership" at a country club of the executive officer's choice with "signature gold golf" and
"community" privileges, and "O.N.E." privileges and discounts for a period of 60 calendar months following termination (with such membership subject to certain transfer restrictions); 

• for Messrs. Feddersen, Droesch, Miller and Dupuis, a five-year dues-free membership, at a country club of the named executive officer's choice (subject to approval by the Chief Executive
Officer of the Company) with no other discounts associated with these privileges (with such membership subject to certain transfer restrictions); and 

• up to $10,000 for outplacement services.

        Each executive officer's receipt of severance payments and benefits under their respective Severance Agreement or the Severance Plan, as applicable, is conditioned upon his or her execution of an effective
release of claims against us. Each Severance Agreement contains a 280G best-after-tax cutback, which applies to any payments or benefits the named executive officers party to such agreements are entitled to
receive that are "excess parachute payments" under the "golden parachute" excise tax rules of the Internal Revenue Code.

Table of Contents

        Although it is not currently anticipated that any of ClubCorp's named executive officers will experience a termination of employment in connection with the completion of the merger, for an estimate of the
amounts that would become payable to each of ClubCorp's named executive officers under the Severance Agreements or the Severance Plan, as applicable, if a severance-qualifying termination of employment
were to occur immediately following consummation of the merger, see "—Potential Merger-Related Payments to Named Executive Officers" below. We estimate that the maximum aggregate amount that would
become payable to our other executive officers (Messrs. Droesch, Miller and Dupuis) as a group under the Severance Plan if the effective time was November 1, 2017 and each incurred a severance-qualifying
termination of employment on that date and immediately following consummation of the merger, is $1,499,916.

Transaction Bonus Pool

        The ClubCorp Board has approved a transaction bonus pool in the amount of $3,200,000 in the aggregate from which the ClubCorp Board may allocate transaction bonuses to employees in its discretion.
As of the date hereof no amounts have been so allocated; however, the ClubCorp Board anticipates paying transaction bonuses to our named executive officers from the transaction bonus pool in the following
amounts: $450,000 for Mr. Affeldt, $450,000 for Mr. Burnett, $550,000 for Mr. McClellan, $550,000 for Ms. Keiser and $125,000 Mr. Feddersen. These transaction bonuses are payable on the 60th day
following the closing date of the merger, subject to continued employment on such payment date. The payment of transaction bonuses will be accelerated upon any termination other than a termination of
employment for Cause (as such term is defined in the Stock Award Plan) or resignation without Good Reason (as such term is defined in the merger agreement).

Director's and Officer's Indemnification and Insurance

        Following the effective time and until the sixth anniversary thereof, subject to the limitations set forth in the merger agreement, Parent will cause the surviving corporation to indemnify each current and
former director and officer of the Company and its subsidiaries (in each case, to the extent acting in such capacity) for matters existing or occurring prior to the effective time and advance expenses incurred by
such indemnified party in the defense of any proceeding (provided that the person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such person
is not entitled to indemnification). The provisions in the surviving corporation's and each of its subsidiaries organizational documents with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation
of former or present directors and officers shall be substantially equivalent to the provisions contained in ClubCorp's or such subsidiaries' organizational documents as in effect as of the date of the merger
agreement, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six years from the effective time in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any such
individuals without the prior written consent of each such individual. Additionally, for a period of six years, Parent will maintain, or will cause the surviving corporation to maintain, at no expense to the
beneficiaries, either the existing policies or insurance policies for the directors and officers of at least the same coverage, with deductibles substantially equivalent to those of the existing policies and containing
terms and conditions and providing benefits that are substantially equivalent to any beneficiary thereof, with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the effective time and from insurance carriers
having at least an "A" rating by A.M. Best with respect to directors' and officers' liability insurance. In lieu of providing such coverage, ClubCorp may, at its option, purchase from insurance carriers with
comparable credit ratings no later than the effective time, a six-year prepaid "tail policy" providing at least the same coverage and amounts, with deductibles substantially equivalent to those of the existing
policies and containing terms and conditions that are substantially equivalent to the insured than the existing policies maintained by ClubCorp and its subsidiaries with respect to claims arising from facts or
events that occurred at or before the effective time, including the transactions contemplated hereby, and from insurance carriers having at least an "A"

rating by A.M. Best with respect to directors' and officers' liability insurance; provided, however, that after the effective time, Parent and the surviving corporation shall not be required to pay in the aggregate for
such coverage under each such policy more than 250% of the last annual premium paid by ClubCorp prior to the date of the merger agreement in respect of the coverage required to be obtained pursuant to the
merger agreement under each such policy, but in such case shall purchase as much coverage as possible for such amount. In the event ClubCorp elects to purchase such a "tail policy", Parent shall cause the
surviving corporation to maintain such "tail policy" in full force and effect for such six-year period. Parent also agreed to cause the surviving corporation and each of its subsidiaries to honor and perform under
all indemnification agreements entered into by ClubCorp or any of its subsidiaries with any indemnified party prior to the date of the merger agreement.

        The indemnification and insurance provisions of the merger agreement are intended to benefit, and are enforceable by, the indemnified persons and their respective heirs or representatives.

Continuation of Employee Compensation and Benefit Levels

        Under the merger agreement, for a period of at least 12 months following the effective time, each continuing employee of ClubCorp or its subsidiaries, including our executive officers, will receive (i) an
annual base-salary or wage rate, as applicable, and short term incentive opportunity (other than equity based benefits) that in the aggregate are substantially similar to the base salary or wage rate, as applicable,
and short term incentive opportunity that was provided to such continuing employee immediately prior to the effective time and (ii) employee pension, welfare and other benefits that are substantially similar in
the aggregate to the employee pension, welfare and other benefits provided to such continuing employee immediately prior to the effective time. For a period of at least twelve months following the effective
time, Parent or one of its affiliates will maintain for the benefit of each continuing employee a severance or termination arrangement no less favorable than the Severance Agreement or the Severance Plan, as
applicable.

Other Interests

        As of the date of this proxy statement, other than the arrangements discussed in this proxy statement, none of our executive officers has entered into any agreement with Parent regarding employment with,
or compensation from, or equity participation or reinvestment in, the surviving corporation or Parent on a going-forward basis following the completion of the merger. However, Parent (or its representatives)
and some or all of our executive officers may have discussions from time to time with respect to such arrangements.

Potential Merger-Related Payments to Named Executive Officers

        The following table sets forth the information required by Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K regarding the compensation for ClubCorp's named executive officers based on the merger, assuming that the merger
was completed on November 1, 2017, and the named executive officers are terminated without cause (or, if applicable, resign for good reason) immediately following the completion of the merger. The actual
amounts payable would depend on the date of termination, the manner of the termination and the terms of the agreements in effect at such time. Additionally, the amounts indicated in the following table do not
attempt to quantify any reduction that may be required as a result of the "best-net" Section 280G cutback included in the Severance Agreements; therefore, actual payments to Messrs. Affeldt, Burnett, and
McClellan and Ms. Keiser may be less than the amounts indicated below. More detail on the included payments and benefits are set forth above in the section entitled "—Interests of ClubCorp's Executive
Officers and Directors in the Merger."

as the product of (i) 3.0 for Mr. Affeldt, 2.0 for each of Messrs. Burnett and McClellan and Ms. Keiser and 1.0 for Mr. Feddersen, multiplied by (ii) the sum of (1) the named
executive officer's annual base salary plus (2) his or her target annual cash bonus award (for Mr. Feddersen, his annual cash bonus award actually earned from the prior year)
(assuming a termination date of November 1, 2017) and (b) an amount equal to the annual cash bonus award, if any, for the year of termination that the named executive officer
would have earned (assuming that performance resulted in a payout of the target awards) if he or she had remained employed on the applicable payment date for such bonus prorated
based on the number of days that the named executive officer was employed during such year payable when such bonus would have ordinarily been paid in accordance with the
applicable bonus plan. 

All components of the cash severance amount are "double-trigger" (i.e., they are contingent upon a qualifying termination of employment during the two-year period, for
Messrs. Affeldt, Burnett and McClellan and Ms. Keiser, or one-year period, for Mr. Feddersen, following the completion of the merger). As a condition of receiving the severance
benefits under the Severance Agreements and Severance Plan, as applicable, each named executive officer must execute (and not revoke) a general release of claims in favor of
ClubCorp. The estimated amount of each component of the cash severance payment is set forth in the table below.

(a) Assumes each executive officer is paid 100% of the discretionary bonus component for which he or she is eligible under the applicable bonus plan.

(2) This amount includes transaction bonuses that the ClubCorp Board anticipates paying to our named executive officers. These transaction bonuses are payable on the 60th day
following the closing date of the merger, subject to continued employment on such payment date. The payment of these transaction bonuses will be accelerated upon any termination
other than a termination for Cause (as such term is defined in the Stock Award Plan) or resignation without Good Reason (as such term is defined in the merger agreement). The
transaction bonuses are "single-trigger" payments as they are not conditioned on a termination without "cause" or for "good reason" (although they would be forfeited on a
termination for "cause" or a voluntary resignation without "good reason").

Table of Contents

Financing of the Merger 

        We anticipate that the total funds needed to complete the merger (including the funds to pay ClubCorp's stockholders and to pay the holders of other equity-based interests the amounts due to them under
the merger agreement), which is expected to be approximately $1.1 billion, will be funded through a combination of available cash of ClubCorp and its subsidiaries, if any, and the following:

          (i)  debt financing in an aggregate principal amount of $1.6 billion as well as a committed $175 million senior secured revolving facility, a portion of which will be available at closing. Parent has
received firm commitments from a consortium of financial institutions to provide the debt financing, which includes the revolving credit facility. See the section below entitled "Debt Financing"; and

(3) This amount includes the estimated value of Restricted Shares and the estimated value of PSUs (other than Road to 300 PSUs, which will be cancelled without payment, and
assuming that performance resulted in a payout at the target level of performance for all other PSUs). This amount also includes any accrued dividends payable in respect of such
Restricted Shares and accrued dividend equivalents payable in respect of such PSUs. The value set forth in the "Equity" column in the table above attributable to each type of
accelerated equity held by ClubCorp's named executive officers is set forth above in the section entitled "—Payments for Unvested Equity Awards" and assumes that each such
named executive officer has been terminated without Cause on the day following the closing of the merger. A portion of these payments is "single-trigger" because it will become
payable solely as a result of the merger, while the remaining portion would become payable on the 60-day anniversary of the date that the effective time occurs (or, earlier, on the
date of termination other than (x) by Parent or any of its affiliates (including the surviving corporation), for "cause" or (y) by such holder without "good reason," in which case it
would be a "double-trigger" payment). 

(4) The amounts in this column include for all named executive officers (i) the net present value of club membership privileges for each named executive officer calculated based on the
average joining fee, average annual base dues, average annual upgrade dues (for the five-year use period) and the expected lifetime of such executive officer, (ii) the value of
continuation of medical and dental (and, in the case of Mr. Feddersen, vision) care reimbursement account coverage for the named executive officer and, where applicable, his or her
spouse or domestic partner and dependents, as if the named executive officer had continued in employment during the 36 months (for Mr. Affeldt) or 24 months (for each other
named executive officer) immediately following termination; and (iii) the value of outplacement services benefits (assuming the maximum amount provided under the named
executive officer's Severance Agreement or the Severance Plan, as applicable). The table below identifies and quantifies the individual perquisites and benefits for each of the named
executive officers.

         (ii)  equity commitments by the Apollo Funds in an aggregate amount of up to $675 million. See the section below entitled "Equity Financing."

The completion of the merger is not conditioned upon Parent's receipt of financing.

Debt Financing

        In connection with the entry into the merger agreement, Parent has obtained a commitment letter (the "debt commitment letter") from Citigroup Global Markets, Inc., Royal Bank of Canada and RBC
Capital Markets, LLC, Barclays Bank PLC, Credit Suisse AG, Cayman Islands Branch, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch, Deutsche Bank AG Cayman Islands Branch,
Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. and Goldman Sachs Bank USA (in each case, acting directly or through their respective affiliates or branches, as appropriate and collectively, the "debt commitment parties") to
provide, severally but not jointly, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the debt commitment letter, in the aggregate $1.6 billion in debt financing as well as a $175 million senior secured
revolving facility (only a portion of which is available to be drawn at the closing of the merger), consisting of the following:

• $1.125 billion senior secured term facility; 

• $175 million senior secured revolving facility; and 

• $475 million senior unsecured bridge facility (less the amount of any senior unsecured notes issued as described below).

        The debt commitment letter also contemplates that Merger Sub will, at its option, either (1) issue senior unsecured notes in a Rule 144A or other private placement on or prior to the closing of the merger
yielding up to $475 million in aggregate gross cash proceeds and/or (2) if any or all of the senior unsecured notes are not issued on or prior to the closing date of the merger and the proceeds thereof made
available to Merger Sub on the closing date of the merger, borrow up to such unissued amount in the form of senior unsecured bridge loans under the senior unsecured bridge facility.

        The proceeds of the debt financing will be used (i) to finance, in part, the payment of the amounts payable under the merger agreement, (ii) to repay, prepay, repurchase, redeem, defease or discharge certain
existing indebtedness of ClubCorp and its subsidiaries, and (iii) for general corporate purposes.

        The obligations of the debt commitment parties to provide the debt financing under the debt commitment letter are subject to a number of conditions, including (i) the execution and delivery of definitive
documentation consistent with the terms of the debt commitment letter, (ii) the simultaneous or substantially concurrent completion of the merger in accordance with the merger agreement (without giving effect
to any amendment, waiver, consent or other modification to the merger agreement that is materially adverse to the lenders in their capacities as such unless approved by the debt commitment parties), (iii) the
consummation of the equity financing prior to, or substantially simultaneously or concurrently with, the initial borrowings under the debt facilities, (iv) since July 9, 2017, there not having been a material
adverse event (as defined under the section entitled "The Merger Agreement—Representations and Warranties"), (v) delivery of certain audited, unaudited and pro forma financial statements, (vi) as a condition
to the availability of the senior unsecured bridge facility, Merger Sub having used commercially reasonable efforts to afford the investment banks a marketing period of at least 15 consecutive calendar days
(subject to certain blackout dates) following receipt of a complete customary preliminary prospectus or preliminary offering memorandum or preliminary private placement memorandum, in each case, which
includes certain financial statements, (vii) as a condition to the availability of the senior secured term loan facility and the senior secured revolving facility, Merger Sub having used commercially reasonable
efforts to afford the arrangers a marketing period of at least 15 consecutive calendar days (subject to certain blackout dates) following receipt of a customary confidential information memorandum,
(viii) payment of all applicable fees and

reasonable and, to the extent invoiced, documented out-of-pocket expenses, (ix) the repayment, prepayment, repurchase, redemption, defeasance or discharge of certain existing debt of ClubCorp and its
subsidiaries, (x) the receipt of all documentation and other information about the borrower and guarantors required by regulatory authorities under applicable "know your customer" and anti-money laundering
rules and regulations (including the PATRIOT Act), (xi) the execution and delivery of guarantees by certain guarantors and the taking of certain actions necessary to create and perfect a security interest in
specified items of collateral, (xii) the accuracy in all material respects of specified representations and warranties in the loan documents under which the debt financing will be provided and of certain
representations and warranties in the merger agreement and (xiii) delivery of certain customary closing documents.

        The obligations of the debt commitment parties to provide the debt financing under the debt commitment letter will terminate at the earlier of (i) the outside date (as defined in and, if applicable, extended
pursuant to and as set forth in the section entitled "The Merger Agreement—Termination of the Merger Agreement) if the closing of the merger will not have occurred on or prior to such date, (ii) the
termination of the merger agreement without the consummation of the merger having occurred, or (iii) the closing of the merger occurs (x) in the case of the senior secured term facility, without the use of the
senior secured term facility or (y) in the case of the senior unsecured bridge facility, without the use of the senior unsecured bridge facility.

        Parent and Merger Sub are required under the merger agreement to use their respective reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to arrange, obtain and consummate the debt financing on the terms and conditions described in or contemplated by the debt commitment letter and any related fee letter. In the event any
portion of the debt financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated in the debt commitment letter and any related fee letter for any reason, Parent is required under the merger
agreement to use its reasonable best efforts to, as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event, notify ClubCorp and Parent and to use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange to obtain alternative financing from alternative sources in an amount sufficient, when added to the available portion
of the debt financing that is and remains available, the equity financing and available cash of ClubCorp and its subsidiaries, if any, to fund the payment of the aggregate per share merger consideration, fund the
payment of fees and expenses required to be paid by Parent and Merger Sub at the closing of the merger in connection with the merger and the financing, repay, prepay, repurchase, redeem, defease or discharge
certain existing indebtedness of ClubCorp and its subsidiaries required by the merger agreement to be repaid, prepaid, repurchased, redeemed, defeased or discharged and satisfy all of the other payment
obligations of Parent and Merger Sub contemplated under the merger agreement and on terms and conditions that are at least as favorable to Parent and Merger Sub as those contained in the debt commitment
letter. In no event will the reasonable best efforts of Parent or Merger Sub be deemed or construed to require Parent or Merger Sub to pay any material fees in excess of those contemplated by the debt
commitment letter. As of the last practicable date before the printing of this proxy statement, the debt commitment letter remains in effect, and Parent has not notified us of any plans to utilize alternate
financing. Except as described in this proxy statement, there is no plan or arrangement regarding the refinancing or repayment of the debt financing. The documentation governing the debt financing
contemplated by the debt commitment letter has not been finalized and, accordingly, the actual terms of the debt financing may differ from those described in this proxy statement.

        The debt commitment parties may invite other banks, financial institutions and institutional lenders to participate in the debt financing contemplated by the debt commitment letter and to undertake a
portion of the commitments to provide such debt financing.

        Parent and Merger Sub's obligations to consummate the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement are not contingent on Parent's or Merger Sub's ability to obtain the debt financing (or any
alternative financing) or any specific term with respect to such debt financing.

Equity Financing

        Parent has received an equity commitment letter, dated as of July 9, 2017 (the "equity commitment letter"), from the Apollo Funds pursuant to which the Apollo Funds have committed, on a several but not
joint basis, subject to the conditions and limitations set forth in the equity commitment letter, to provide equity financing in an aggregate amount of up to approximately $675 million, or such lesser amount,
together with available cash of ClubCorp and its subsidiaries, if any, and the debt financing, as may be required by Parent to make the payment of the per share merger consideration to the ClubCorp
equityholders at the closing of the merger as set forth in the merger agreement on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein.

        Funding of the equity financing is subject to the conditions and limitations provided in the equity commitment letter, which include: (i) the satisfaction in full or valid waiver, on or before the closing of the
merger, of all of the conditions precedent to Parent and Merger Sub's obligations to consummate the merger under the merger agreement, (ii) the substantially concurrent receipt by Parent or Merger Sub of the
net cash proceeds of the debt financing (on the terms and subject to the conditions described in the debt commitment letter) and (iii) the concurrent consummation of the transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement (including the merger) on the terms and subject to the conditions of the merger agreement.

        The equity commitment letter and each Apollo Fund's obligation to fund all or any portion of the equity financing will automatically terminate and cease to be of any further force or effect without the need
for any further action by any person (at which time the obligations of each Apollo Fund under the equity commitment letter will be immediately discharged in full) upon the earliest of (i) the valid termination of
the merger agreement in accordance with its terms, (ii) the closing of the merger, (iii) the payment by the Apollo Funds of their obligations under and pursuant to the limited guarantee and (iv) the assertion,
directly or indirectly, by ClubCorp or any of its affiliates, or any of its or their respective controlled representatives (in each case, other than its stockholders), of any claim (whether at law or equity or in tort,
contract or otherwise) against any Apollo Fund or any of their former, current or future equityholders, controlling persons, limited or general partners, managers, members, affiliates, directors, officers,
employees, agents, attorneys, stockholders, assignees, investment bankers, accountants, advisors, financing sources or representatives of any of the foregoing or any of their respective successors or assigns
other than Parent or Merger Sub under the merger agreement and subject to the terms and conditions therein (each, a "related party") or any related party of a related party in connection with the equity
commitment letter, the merger agreement, the debt commitment letter, the limited guarantee, or any other document or instrument delivered in connection therewith or any of the transactions contemplated
thereby other than (A) claims against the Apollo Funds solely to the extent expressly provided under the limited guarantee and pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions thereof or (B) the rights of
ClubCorp, if any, against any person that is party to and solely pursuant to the terms and conditions of, the confidentiality agreement between ClubCorp and Apollo Management VIII, L.P., dated as of
November 18, 2016 (as amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified) (the matters described in (A) and (B), collectively, "specified claims"). Immediately upon termination of the equity commitment
letter and without the need for any further action by any person, no Apollo Fund or any related party of an Apollo Fund or any related party of a related party will have any further obligation or liability
thereunder. The Apollo Funds have no obligation to make any payment or contribution under the equity commitment letter at any time if the closing of the merger does not occur.

        Pursuant to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, Parent and Merger Sub will use their reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable to arrange, obtain and consummate the equity financing on the terms and conditions contemplated by the equity commitment letter. In no event will the reasonable best efforts of
Parent or Merger Sub be deemed or construed to either require Parent or Merger Sub to pay any material fees in excess of those contemplated by the equity commitment letter or seek equity financing from any
source other than a counterparty to, or in any amount in excess of that contemplated by, the equity commitment letter.

        ClubCorp is an express third party beneficiary of the equity commitment letter for the purpose of causing the equity financing to be funded, but solely to the extent that ClubCorp has been awarded, in
accordance with, and subject to, the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, specific performance to require Parent to cause the equity financing under the equity commitment letter to be funded (see the
section entitled "The Merger Agreement—Specific Performance").

Limited Guarantee 

        Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in a limited guarantee, dated July 9, 2017 (the "limited guarantee") and executed concurrently with the execution of the merger agreement, the Apollo Funds
have guaranteed the payment obligations of Parent with respect to (i) (x) the obligation of Parent under the merger agreement to pay a reverse termination fee of $74.2 million if the merger agreement is
terminated by ClubCorp under specified circumstances (see the section entitled "The Merger Agreement—Termination Fees and Expenses"), (y) Parent's obligation to pay certain expenses incurred by ClubCorp
in connection with the successful enforcement by ClubCorp of Parent's obligation to pay the reverse termination fee to a maximum aggregate amount of $2.5 million (referred to herein as "enforcement
expenses"), and (z) certain reimbursement or payment obligations of Parent relating to the debt financing and the repayment, prepayment, repurchase, redemption, defeasance or discharge, as applicable, of
existing indebtedness of ClubCorp and its subsidiaries to a maximum aggregate amount of $500,000 (referred to herein as "reimbursement obligations") or (ii) damages (solely to the extent payable pursuant to
a final and non-appealable order of a court of competent jurisdiction), if any, payable for fraud or willful breach by Parent or Merger Sub to a maximum aggregate amount of $74.2 million.

        The Apollo Funds' obligations under the limited guarantee are subject to a maximum aggregate cap of $74.2 million plus, if applicable, the enforcement expenses and the reimbursement obligations, in each
case subject to the applicable cap.

        The limited guarantee will terminate and be of no further force and effect and the Apollo Funds will have no further obligation or liability under the limited guarantee, the merger agreement, the equity
commitment letter or any other document or instrument delivered in connection therewith or in respect of the transactions contemplated thereby (or the termination or abandonment thereof), upon the earliest to
occur of: (i) the closing of the merger, (ii) the payment of the guaranteed obligations by the Apollo Funds to ClubCorp under and pursuant to the limited guarantee, (iii) the date that is 90 days after the
termination of the merger agreement, provided that if (A) by such date ClubCorp will have made a claim in writing with respect to any guaranteed obligation during such 90-day period and (B) ClubCorp has
commenced a legal proceeding during such 90-day period against the Apollo Funds alleging that Parent is liable for such guaranteed obligation, then the limited guarantee will survive solely with respect to the
amounts claimed or alleged to be so owing and, with respect to the immediately preceding proviso, the Apollo Funds will not have any further liability or obligation under the limited guarantee from and after
the earlier of (x) the entry of a final, non-appealable order of a court of competent jurisdiction and (y) the execution and delivery of a written agreement between the Apollo Funds and ClubCorp, and, in either
case, the payment by the Apollo Funds to ClubCorp of all

amounts payable by the Apollo Funds pursuant to such order or agreement, and (iv) the termination of the limited guarantee by mutual written agreement of the Apollo Funds and ClubCorp.

        ClubCorp's recourse against the Apollo Funds under the limited guarantee (subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein) is the sole and exclusive remedy against the Apollo Funds and any related
persons of the Apollo Funds (and any related person of such related persons), and none of the Apollo Funds nor any related person of an Apollo Fund (nor any related person of such person) will have any
obligation or liability to any person, in each case, in respect of any breaches, losses, damages, liabilities or obligations arising under, or in connection with, the limited guarantee, the merger agreement, the
equity commitment letter or any other document or instrument delivered in connection therewith or the transactions contemplated thereby (or the termination or abandonment thereof) or otherwise, including in
respect of any oral representations made or alleged to be made in connection therewith, except for (A) specified claims and (B) claims by ClubCorp seeking specific performance of the Apollo Funds' obligation
to cause the equity financing to be funded, solely pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions of the equity commitment letter and the merger agreement.

Antitrust Review Required for the Merger 

U.S. Antitrust

        Under the HSR Act and the rules that have been promulgated thereunder by the FTC, we cannot complete the merger until we have given notification and furnished information to the FTC and the DOJ,
and until the applicable waiting period has expired or has been terminated. The merger is subject to the waiting period requirements and may not be completed until the expiration of a 30-day waiting period,
which cannot expire on a Saturday, a Sunday, or on a federal holiday (and which may be extended as described below) following the filing of the premerger notification and report forms with the DOJ and the
FTC. On July 20, 2017, ClubCorp and Parent each filed a premerger notification and report form under the HSR Act with the DOJ and the FTC, as a result of which the applicable waiting period under the HSR
Act is scheduled to expire on August 21, 2017 at 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, unless otherwise earlier terminated or extended if the DOJ or FTC requests additional information and documentary material. On
July 28, 2017, the FTC granted early termination of the waiting period of the HSR Act, effective immediately.

General

        Under the merger agreement, each party is required to use best efforts to satisfy the closing conditions relating to the required antitrust review, including (i) cooperating in all respects with each other in
connection with any filing or submission and in connection with any investigation or other inquiry, including any proceeding initiated by a private party, (ii) subject to applicable law, furnishing to the other
party as promptly as reasonably practicable all information required for any application or other filing to be made by the other party pursuant to any applicable law in connection with the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement, (iii) promptly notifying the other party of any substantive communication received by such party from, or given by such party to, any U.S. or foreign governmental
authorities and of any substantive communication received or given in connection with any proceeding by a private party, in each case, regarding any of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement
and, subject to applicable law, furnish the other party promptly with copies of all correspondence, filings and communications between them and the governmental authority with respect to the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement, (iv) responding as promptly as reasonably practicable to any inquiries received from, and supply as promptly as reasonably practicable any additional information or
documentation that may be requested by any governmental authority in respect of such registrations, declarations and filings or such transactions, and (v) permitting the other party to review any substantive
communication given by it to, and consult with each other in advance, and consider in good faith the other party's reasonable comments in connection with, any

Table of Contents

communication, meeting or conference with, the governmental authority or, in connection with any proceeding by a private party, with any other person.

        While we have no reason to believe it will not be possible to complete the antitrust review in a timely manner, there is no certainty that this review will be completed within the period of time contemplated
by the merger agreement or that the completion of such review would not be conditioned upon actions that would be materially adverse to ClubCorp or Parent, or that a regulatory challenge to the merger will
not be made. If a regulatory challenge is made, we cannot predict the result. For example, at any time before or after the effective time of the merger, the DOJ, the FTC, antitrust or regulatory authorities outside
the United States, or U.S. state attorneys general could take action under applicable antitrust or regulatory laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest, including seeking to enjoin the
completion of the merger, conditionally approving the merger upon the divestiture of ClubCorp's or Parent's assets, subjecting the completion of the merger to regulatory conditions or seeking other remedies.
Private parties may also seek to take legal action under antitrust and other laws under certain circumstances.

        The expiration or termination of the HSR waiting period approval merely implies the satisfaction of certain regulatory criteria, which do not include review of the merger from the standpoint of the
adequacy of the consideration to be received by ClubCorp's stockholders. Further, an antitrust review does not constitute an endorsement or recommendation of the merger.

Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger 

        The exchange of ClubCorp common stock for cash in the merger generally will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes and may also be taxable under state and local and other tax
laws. In general, a U.S. holder (as defined in the section entitled "Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger" beginning on page 129) whose shares of ClubCorp common stock are
converted into the right to receive cash in the merger will recognize capital gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received
with respect to such shares and the U.S. holder's adjusted tax basis in such shares. Gain or loss will be determined separately for each block of shares of ClubCorp common stock (i.e., shares of ClubCorp
common stock acquired at the same cost in a single transaction). The determination of the actual tax consequences of the merger to a holder of ClubCorp common stock will depend on the holder's specific
situation.

        Tax matters can be complicated and the tax consequences of the merger to you will depend on your particular circumstances. You should read the section entitled "Material U.S. Federal Income Tax
Consequences of the Merger" beginning on page 129 and consult your tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger to you in your particular circumstances, as well as tax
consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or foreign taxing jurisdiction.

Delisting and Deregistration of ClubCorp Common Stock 

        As promptly as practicable following the completion of the merger, the ClubCorp common stock currently listed on the NYSE will cease to be listed on the NYSE and will be deregistered under the
Exchange Act.

Transaction Litigation 

        On July 25, 2017, Haowen Meng filed a purported stockholder class action against ClubCorp, ClubCorp's directors, and AGM in connection with the merger contemplated by the merger agreement in the
Eighth Judicial District Court of the State of Nevada in Clark County. The case is captioned Meng v. ClubCorp Holdings, Inc., et al., No. A-17-758912-B. On August 2, 2017, plaintiff filed an amended
complaint. The amended complaint purports to assert a claim against ClubCorp's directors

for allegedly breaching their fiduciary duties of loyalty, due care, good faith, and candor owed to the plaintiff and the public stockholders of ClubCorp, including by allegedly agreeing to a transaction at an
unreasonably low price, failing to take the necessary steps to maximize stockholder value, giving preferential severance benefits to certain executives, agreeing to allegedly preclusive deal protection provisions,
and failing to include critical information in the preliminary proxy statement previously filed by ClubCorp with the SEC. The amended complaint also purports to assert a claim against AGM for aiding and
abetting the directors' purported breach of fiduciary duty. The amended complaint seeks, among other things, to enjoin the merger contemplated by the merger agreement unless and until ClubCorp adopts a
process for obtaining a merger agreement with the best possible terms for ClubCorp stockholders. On August 2, 2017, counsel for plaintiffs in the Blaschak and McNally actions (discussed below) filed a motion
to consolidate this action with those other actions. ClubCorp, Parent and Merger Sub believe these claims are without merit and intend to vigorously defend against these claims.

        On July 31, 2017, Richard Baum filed a purported stockholder class action against AGM, ClubCorp, and ClubCorp's directors in connection with the merger contemplated by the merger agreement in the
Eighth Judicial District Court of the State of Nevada in Clark County. The case is captioned Baum v. Affeldt, et al., No. A-17-759227-C. The complaint purports to assert a claim against ClubCorp's directors for
allegedly breaching their fiduciary duties of care, loyalty, good faith, and independence owed to the plaintiff and the public stockholders of ClubCorp, including by allegedly agreeing to a transaction at an
unreasonably low price, engaging in an allegedly unfair process that involved conflicts of interests, agreeing to allegedly preclusive deal protection provisions, and allegedly including materially incomplete and
misleading information in the preliminary proxy statement. The complaint seeks, among other things, to enjoin the merger contemplated by the merger agreement. ClubCorp, Parent and Merger Sub believe
these claims are without merit and intend to vigorously defend against these claims.

        On August 1, 2017, Dan Blaschak filed a purported stockholder class action against ClubCorp's directors in connection with the merger contemplated by the merger agreement in the Eighth Judicial District
Court of the State of Nevada in Clark County. The case is captioned Blaschak v. Beckert, et al., No. A-17-759270-B. The complaint purports to assert a claim against directors for allegedly breaching their
fiduciary duties of care, loyalty, good faith, candor, and independence owed to the plaintiff and the public stockholders of ClubCorp, including by allegedly agreeing to a transaction at an unreasonably low
price, agreeing to allegedly preclusive deal protection provisions, and allegedly including materially incomplete and misleading information in the preliminary proxy statement. The complaint seeks, among
other things, to enjoin the merger contemplated by the merger agreement. On August 2, 2017, counsel for plaintiffs in this action and the McNally action (discussed below) filed a motion to consolidate this
action with the McNally action and the Meng action (discussed above).

        On August 1, 2017, Joyce McNally filed a purported stockholder class action against ClubCorp's directors in connection with the merger contemplated by the merger agreement in the Eighth Judicial
District Court of the State of Nevada in Clark County. The case is captioned McNally v. Beckert, et al., No. A-17-759271-B. The complaint purports to assert a claim against ClubCorp's directors for allegedly
breaching their fiduciary duties of care, loyalty, good faith, candor, and independence owed to the plaintiff and the public stockholders of ClubCorp, including by allegedly agreeing to a transaction at an
unreasonably low price, agreeing to allegedly preclusive deal protection provisions, and allegedly including materially incomplete and misleading information in the preliminary proxy statement. The complaint
seeks, among other things, to enjoin the merger contemplated by the merger agreement. On August 2, 2017, counsel for plaintiffs in this action and the Blaschak action (discussed above) filed a motion to

THE MERGER AGREEMENT 

        The following discussion sets forth the material provisions of the merger agreement, a copy of which is attached as Annex A to this proxy statement and is incorporated by reference herein. The rights and
obligations of the parties are governed by the express terms and conditions of the merger agreement and not by this discussion, which is summary by nature. This discussion is not complete and is qualified in its
entirety by reference to the complete text of the merger agreement. You are encouraged to read the merger agreement carefully in its entirety, as well as this proxy statement and any documents incorporated by
reference herein, before making any decisions regarding the merger. This section is not intended to provide you with any factual information about us. Such information can be found elsewhere in this proxy
statement and in the public filings we make with the SEC, as described in the section entitled "Where You Can Find More Information," beginning on page 132.

The Merger 

        Subject to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement and in accordance with the NRS, at the effective time, Merger Sub will merge with and into ClubCorp, the separate corporate existence of
Merger Sub will cease, and ClubCorp will continue as the surviving corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. The merger will have the effects set forth in the merger agreement and the relevant
provisions of the NRS.

Closing and Effectiveness of the Merger 

        The closing of the merger will take place at 7:00 a.m. (Palo Alto, California time) on the third business day following the day on which the conditions to closing (described below under "The Merger
Agreement—Conditions to Closing of the Merger") have been satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the closing (but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of
such conditions at the closing)), or such other time as ClubCorp and Parent may agree, provided that, unless otherwise agreed upon by the parties. if the marketing period (described below under "The Merger
Agreement—Marketing Period and Efforts") has not ended at such time, then subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to closing at that time, the closing will occur on the earlier of (i) a business
day during the marketing period specified by Parent on no less than three business days' prior written notice to ClubCorp and (ii) the third business day after the final day of the marketing period, subject to
certain terms and conditions set forth in the merger agreement.

        On the closing date, the parties will file articles of merger with the Nevada Secretary of State in accordance with the relevant provisions of the NRS. The merger will become effective at the time the
articles of merger is filed with the Nevada Secretary of State or a later time as the parties agree upon in writing and specify in the articles of merger in accordance with the NRS.

Merger Consideration 

        At the effective time, shares of ClubCorp common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time will be cancelled and extinguished automatically and will cease to exist and will be
converted automatically into the right to receive the per share merger consideration. After the effective time, holders of ClubCorp common stock as of immediately prior to the effective time will have only the
right to receive the per share merger consideration, and will no longer have any rights as holders of ClubCorp common stock. Shares of ClubCorp common stock held by ClubCorp, including shares held in
treasury by ClubCorp or by Parent or Merger Sub or any other direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (in each case, not held on behalf of third parties) as of immediately prior to the effective time
will be cancelled without payment at the effective time. Pursuant to the merger agreement, Parent, the surviving corporation and the paying agent will be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable in respect of the ClubCorp common stock,

Restricted Shares or PSUs such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the payment of certain taxes as required by applicable law. To the extent that amounts are withheld or deducted
and paid over to the applicable governmental entity, the withheld or deducted amounts will be treated for all purposes of the merger agreement as having been paid to the holder of ClubCorp common stock,
Restricted Shares or PSUs in respect of which such deduction and withholding were made. See "Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger."

Exchange Procedures 

        Prior to the effective time, Parent or Merger Sub will enter into an agreement with a paying agent (the "paying agent") selected by Parent to receive payment of the aggregate per share merger consideration
as provided by the merger agreement in respect of shares of ClubCorp common stock. At or prior to the closing, Parent will deposit (or cause to be deposited) with the paying agent in trust for the benefit of
holders of ClubCorp common stock entitled to receive the per share merger consideration a cash amount in U.S. dollars in immediately available funds that, when taken together with the available cash of
ClubCorp and its subsidiaries deposited with the paying agent, is sufficient in the aggregate to provide all funds necessary for the paying agent to pay the per share merger consideration as provided by the
merger agreement in exchange for issued and outstanding shares of ClubCorp common stock entitled thereto. Promptly after the effective time (and in any event within three business days thereafter), the
surviving corporation will cause the paying agent to mail or otherwise provide to each former holder of record of certificate(s) representing shares of ClubCorp common stock and each former holder of record
of book-entry shares of ClubCorp common stock that have converted into the right to receive the per share merger consideration with respect thereto (i) transmittal materials specifying that delivery will be
effected and risk of loss and title to the certificates will pass only upon delivery of such certificates to the paying agent and, with respect to book-entry shares, only upon delivery of an "agent's message"
regarding the book-entry transfer of such shares (or such other evidence, if any, of the transfer as the paying agent may reasonably request) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of such holder's
certificate or book-entry shares, as applicable in exchange for the per share merger consideration.

        On or before the first anniversary of the effective time, upon surrender of one or more certificates to the paying agent in accordance with the terms of the transmittal materials and related instructions, the
holder of such certificates will be entitled to receive a cash amount in U.S. dollars in immediately available funds (subject to tax withholdings) equal to the number of shares surrendered by such holder
multiplied by the per share merger consideration, and Parent will cause the paying agent to pay and deliver as promptly as reasonably practicable after the effective time. On or before the first anniversary of the
effective time, each holder of record of one or more book-entry shares will be deemed to have surrendered such book-entry shares upon the receipt by the paying agent of a customary "agent's message" on
behalf of such holder, and such holder will be entitled to receive a cash amount in U.S. dollars in immediately available funds (subject to tax withholdings) equal to the number of shares surrendered by such
holder multiplied by the per share merger consideration, and Parent will cause the paying agent to pay and deliver as promptly as reasonably practicable after the effective time.

        In the event a transfer of ownership of shares of ClubCorp common stock that is not registered in the transfer records of the company or if payment of the per share merger consideration is to be made to a
person other than the person in whose name the surrendered certificates or book-entry shares is registered, payment may be issued to such transferee or other person if the applicable certificates or book-entry
shares formerly representing such shares of ClubCorp common stock is properly presented to the paying agent along with reasonable documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that
any applicable taxes have been paid.

        After the effective time, until surrendered in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement, each certificate and book-entry share will be deemed to represent only the right to receive the

applicable per share merger consideration. The per share merger consideration paid upon the surrender of a certificate or book-entry share in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement will be deemed
to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of ClubCorp common stock previously represented by such certificate or book-entry share.

Treatment of ClubCorp Equity Awards 

        The merger agreement provides that, immediately prior to the effective time:

• each outstanding Restricted Share will, automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and converted into the right of the holder of such Restricted
Share to receive $17.12 in cash plus any accrued dividends payable in respect of such Restricted Share; 

• each outstanding PSU (other than any Road to 300 PSU) will automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and converted into the right of the
holder of such PSU to receive, an amount in cash equal to the product of (A) the target number of shares subject to such PSU immediately prior to the effective time multiplied by (B) $17.12,
plus any accrued dividend equivalents payable in respect of such PSU; and 

• each Road to 300 PSU will automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled immediately prior to the effective time without the payment of any
consideration to the holder thereof;

provided that the amounts payable with respect to such Restricted Shares or PSUs will vest and be payable by the surviving corporation, subject to the applicable holder's continued employment through the
applicable payment date (in the case of PSUs) or vesting date (in the case of Restricted Shares), as applicable, (A) with respect to Restricted Shares or PSUs, as applicable, that are not vested in accordance with
their terms at the effective time, (i) fifty percent (50%) upon the 60-day anniversary of the date that the effective time occurs (or the next payroll date following such anniversary) and (ii) fifty percent (50%) at
or promptly after the effective time, and (B) with respect to Restricted Shares or PSUs, as applicable, that are vested as of the effective time in accordance with their terms, at or promptly following the effective
time, and in all cases, without any interest for the period from the effective time until the applicable Restricted Share Payment Date or PSU Payment Date and less applicable taxes required to be withheld with
respect to such payment; provided, further, that if the employment of a holder of Restricted Shares or PSUs is, following the effective time, but prior to the applicable Restricted Share Payment Date or PSU
Payment Date, as applicable, terminated for any reason other than (x) by Parent or any of its affiliates (including the surviving corporation) for "cause" (as such term is defined in the Stock Award Plan) or (y) by
such holder without "good reason" (as such term is defined in the merger agreement), then, in the case of each of the foregoing clauses (x) and (y), the payment described above will be accelerated to the next
practicable payroll date after the date of such termination.

        Where holders of Restricted Shares or PSUs are entitled to unpaid dividends and dividend equivalents in respect of such awards, the surviving corporation shall pay to the holders of such awards the cash
amounts in respect of such unpaid dividends and dividend equivalents, less applicable taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payment, on the same date that the corresponding payment is made in
respect of the underlying Restricted Share or PSU, as applicable.

Representations and Warranties 

        The merger agreement contains representations and warranties that we, on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, have made to one another (in some cases, as of specific dates)
relating to our and their respective businesses. The assertions embodied in those representations

and warranties were made solely for purposes of the merger agreement, and may be subject to important qualifications and limitations (including through the use of exceptions for certain matters disclosed by
the party that made the representations and warranties to the other party) agreed to by the parties in connection with negotiating the terms of the merger agreement. Accordingly, ClubCorp stockholders should
not rely on representations and warranties as characterizations of the actual state of facts or circumstances, and should bear in mind that the representations and warranties were made solely for the benefit of the
parties to the merger agreement, were negotiated for purposes of governing contractual rights and relationships and allocating contractual risk among the parties to the merger agreement as of specific dates,
rather than to establish matters as facts, and may be subject to contractual standards of materiality different from those generally applicable to stockholders. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter
of such representations and warranties may change after the date of the merger agreement, which subsequent information may or may not be reflected in our public disclosures. Other than the representations
and warranties (i) described in the last bullet point of the summary of the ClubCorp representations and warranties below and (ii) described in each of the antepenultimate bullet point and the last bullet point in
the summary of the Parent and Merger Sub representations and warranties below, none of the representations and warranties will survive the closing of the merger, and, therefore, they will have no legal effect
under the merger agreement after the effective time. This description of the representations and warranties is included to provide ClubCorp stockholders with information regarding the terms of the merger
agreement. The representations and warranties in the merger agreement and their description in this proxy statement should be read in conjunction with the other information contained in the reports, statements
and filings we publicly file with the SEC.

        Our representations and warranties relate to, among other things:

• our and our subsidiaries' due organization, valid existence, good standing (to the extent such concept is applicable), corporate power, qualification to do business and similar corporate matters; 

• our and our subsidiaries' articles of incorporation, bylaws or equivalent organizational or governing documents; 

• our corporate power and authority to enter into and perform our obligations under the merger agreement and consummate the merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby, and the
enforceability and due execution and delivery of the merger agreement;

made and certain regulatory consents are obtained) in each case as a result of the execution, delivery and performance of the merger agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated thereby; 

• the absence of defaults, breaches, violations, accelerations of obligations, loss of benefit under, or certain rights (including termination, cancellation or amendment rights) of third parties under
our and our subsidiaries' material contracts, or creation of certain liens on our properties or assets, in each case as a result of the execution, delivery and performance of the merger agreement and
the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby; 

• consents, approvals, authorizations, permits, notifications and filings required by governmental entities to enter into the merger agreement, perform thereunder and complete the merger; 

• our and our subsidiaries' capitalization, capital structure and equity securities; 

• our interests in joint ventures and other minority interests in persons that are not subsidiaries and certain matters relating thereto;

other events, developments, changes, effects or occurrences, prevents, materially delays or has a material adverse effect on the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the merger and the other

individually or in the aggregate with all other events, developments, changes, effects or occurrences, has or would reasonably be expected to have, a material adverse effect on or with respect to the business,
results of operation, financial or other condition or assets or liabilities of ClubCorp and our subsidiaries, taken as a whole; provided that no events, developments, changes, effects or occurrences relating to,
arising out of or in connection with or resulting from any of the following will be deemed, either alone or in combination, to constitute or contribute to a material adverse effect (provided, further, that with
respect to the first, second, third and fourth bullet points below, to the extent that ClubCorp and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, are disproportionately affected thereby as compared with other participants in

        Parent and Merger Sub have agreed to restrictions on the operation of their businesses until the earlier of the effective time or the valid termination of the merger agreement. Parent and Merger Sub will not
(i) directly or indirectly, engage in any business activities or incur any liabilities or obligations other than as expressly contemplated by the merger agreement or (ii) and will direct each of its affiliates not to,
directly or indirectly, make any acquisition of (whether by merger, consolidation or acquisition of stock or substantially all of the assets), or any investment in any interest in, any person that would materially
delay or prevent or make illegal the consummation of the merger or the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

Restrictions on Solicitation of Competing Acquisition Proposals 

Non-Solicitation Provisions and Exceptions

        From and after the date of the merger agreement until the effective time or, if earlier, the valid termination of the merger agreement, ClubCorp is subject to restrictions on its ability to solicit third party
proposals relating to alternative transactions or to provide information to and engage in discussions or negotiations with a third party in relation to an alternative transaction (subject to certain exceptions prior to
the approval of the merger proposal by ClubCorp stockholders at the special meeting). Specifically, ClubCorp will not, and will cause its subsidiaries not to (and will use its reasonable best efforts to cause its
and their respective directors, officers, employees, consultants, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants, agents and other advisors or representatives not to):

• initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage, propose or knowingly induce the making, submission or announcement of, or knowingly facilitate or assist, any inquiries, offers or proposals that constitute,
or could reasonably be expected to lead to, any acquisition proposal or the consummation thereof;

afford access to its properties, assets, books and records, personnel (solely in connection with the submission or evaluation of an acquisition proposal) or non-public information or data to any
person (other than Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective designees) relating to the making of an acquisition proposal or any inquiry or proposal with respect thereto;

• approve, endorse or recommend, or propose publicly to approve, endorse or recommend, any proposal that constitutes an acquisition proposal; 

• execute or enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement or other agreement relating to any
acquisition proposal other than confidentiality agreements permitted under the merger agreement; 

• fail to enforce or grant any waiver or release under any standstill or similar agreement with respect to any class of securities of ClubCorp or any of its subsidiaries unless the Board (or a
committee thereof) determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable laws;
or 

• authorize, agree or commit to do any of the foregoing.

        ClubCorp agreed to immediately cease and cause to be terminated, and to cause each of its subsidiaries, and use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and its subsidiaries' respective representatives to
immediately cease and cause to be terminated, any activities, solicitations, discussions or negotiations with any person and its affiliates and representatives (other than Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
respective representatives and designees) in connection with or relating to an acquisition proposal, in each case that existed as of the date of the merger agreement. ClubCorp also agreed to (i) promptly (and in
any event within two business days) request each person (other than Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective representatives and designees) that has prior to the date of the merger agreement executed a
confidentiality agreement in connection with its consideration of acquiring ClubCorp to return or destroy all confidential information furnished to such person, its affiliates or representatives prior to the date of
the merger agreement and (ii) terminate any access to any data room (electronic or otherwise) previously provided to any such person, its affiliates or representatives.

        In response to the receipt of any acquisition proposal or bona fide inquiry in respect of a potential acquisition proposal, any requests for any non-public information, or any requests for discussions or
negotiations with us or our representatives, we must provide prompt (and in any event within 24 hours) notice to Parent in writing of the receipt of such acquisition proposal or bona fide inquiry or request,
which notice must include the identity of the person or group making such proposal, inquiry, request or offer and a summary of the material terms and conditions of such proposal, inquiry, request or offer and, if
written, a copy thereof. We have agreed to keep Parent reasonably informed, on a prompt basis, of the status and material terms of any such acquisition proposal, or inquiry or proposal in respect thereof,
including any material amendments or proposed amendments as to price and other material terms thereof.

        Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in the provisions of the merger agreement relating to acquisition proposals prevents us from taking and disclosing to our stockholders a position contemplated by
Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication to stockholders in connection with the making or amendment of a tender offer or exchange offer), making any "stop-look-
and-listen" communication pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act (or any similar communications to our stockholders) or from making any legally required disclosure to stockholders with regard to
the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement or an acquisition proposal; provided that the Board expressly publicly reaffirms its recommendation concerning the

merger proposal in such disclosure (other than a customary "stop-look-and-listen" communication to stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act (or any similar communications to
ClubCorp's stockholders)).

        Further, notwithstanding the foregoing non-solicitation restrictions, prior to approval of the merger proposal by the ClubCorp stockholders at the special meeting, we may participate or engage in
discussions with any person or group that has made a bona fide acquisition proposal after the date of the merger agreement that was not solicited in breach of the merger agreement (including the non-
solicitation restrictions described above) and provide access to such person or group to ClubCorp and its subsidiaries' properties, books and records and other information or data in response to a request
therefor, if the Board (i) determines in good faith, after consultation with ClubCorp's outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that such acquisition proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to
constitute a superior proposal; (ii) determines in good faith, after consultation with ClubCorp's outside legal counsel that failure to engage in such discussions or provide such access would be inconsistent with
its fiduciary duties under applicable law; and (iii) has received an acceptable confidentiality agreement from such person; provided that ClubCorp will substantially contemporaneously provide to Parent and
Merger Sub any non-public information or data that is provided to any person given such access that was not previously made available to Parent or Merger Sub.

        In addition, prior to obtaining the approval of the merger proposal by the ClubCorp stockholders at the special meeting, in response to a bona fide acquisition proposal that did not result from a breach of
the non-solicitation restrictions in the merger agreement (other than de minimis breaches), if the Board determines in good faith, after consultation with ClubCorp's financial advisors and outside legal counsel,
that such acquisition proposal is a superior proposal, then ClubCorp or the Board may terminate the merger agreement to contemporaneously enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such superior
proposal, provided that ClubCorp pays Parent a $34.2 million termination fee contemporaneously with such termination and subject to the notice procedures discussed below.

Notice Procedures

        Prior to terminating the merger agreement to enter into a definitive agreement concerning a superior proposal:

• we must provide written notice to Parent three business days in advance advising Parent that we or the Board propose to take such action, which notice must contain the material terms and
conditions of the superior proposal that is the basis of the proposed action, including the identity of the person or group making such acquisition proposal, the material terms of such acquisition
proposal and copies of all relevant documents relating to such acquisition proposal (including the most current version of the proposed agreement under which such acquisition proposal is
proposed to be consummated) ; 

• at the end of the three business day period following delivery of such notice (we refer to such three business day period ending at 5:00 pm (Dallas, Texas time) on such third business day as the
"notice period"), the Board must reaffirm in good faith, after consultation with ClubCorp's outside counsel and financial advisors, that such acquisition proposal continues to constitute a superior
proposal; and 

• if requested by Parent, we must (i) during the notice period, negotiate, and use reasonable best efforts to cause our representatives to negotiate, with Parent and its representatives in good faith to
make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of the merger agreement so that the superior proposal would cease to constitute a superior proposal and (ii) permit Parent and its
representatives to make a presentation (which may be telephonic) to the Board (or a committee

thereof) regarding the merger agreement and any adjustments with respect thereto (to the extent that Parent requests to make such a presentation).

        Notwithstanding the foregoing, any material revision, amendment, update or supplement to the terms and conditions of the superior proposal will be deemed to constitute a new proposal, including with
respect to the notice period, and we must follow the requirements set forth in the above bullet points with respect to such new proposal, except that the notice period will be reduced from a three business day
period to a two business day period.

Board Recommendation and Change of Recommendation

        Under the terms of the merger agreement, subject to the exceptions described below, the Board has agreed to recommend that the ClubCorp stockholders vote in favor of the merger proposal. If the Board
(i) withholds, withdraws, amends, qualifies, changes or modifies its recommendation that the ClubCorp stockholders vote in favor of the approval of the merger agreement and the merger in a manner adverse to
Parent or Merger Sub (or publicly proposes to do any of the foregoing); (ii) adopts, approves or recommends, or publicly proposes to adopt, approve or recommend, an acquisition proposal; (iii) fails to publicly
reaffirm its recommendation that the ClubCorp stockholders vote in favor of the approval of the merger agreement and the merger within ten business days of the occurrence of a bona fide material event or
development (which is not a direct result of any action by Parent, Merger Sub or their affiliates) following the making of an acquisition proposal and after Parent so requests in writing (or, if the special meeting
of ClubCorp stockholders is scheduled to be held within ten business days, then such fewer days as are remaining prior to the stockholder meeting) (provided that the Board will not be required pursuant to this
clause (iii) to publicly reaffirm its recommendation that the ClubCorp stockholders vote in favor of the approval of the merger agreement and the merger on more than two occasions in respect of any such
individual event or development); (iv) take any formal action or make any recommendation in connection with a tender or exchange offer, other than a recommendation against such offer or a "stop, look and
listen" communication by the Board to ClubCorp stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d 9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any substantially similar communication) (it being understood that the Board
(or a committee thereof) may refrain from taking a position with respect to an acquisition proposal until 5:30 p.m., Eastern time, on the tenth business day after the tender or exchange offer is commenced in
connection with such acquisition proposal without such action being considered action under this clause (iv); or (v) fails to include its recommendation that the ClubCorp stockholders vote in favor of the
approval of the merger agreement and the merger in this proxy statement, it constitutes a "change of recommendation" of the Board. The Board may, prior to obtaining the approval of the merger proposal by the
ClubCorp stockholders at the special meeting, effect a change of recommendation as a result of an event, fact, development, circumstance or occurrence (other than any acquisition proposal or superior proposal)
that does not relate to Parent or Merger Sub, is first arising or occurring after the date of the merger agreement, improves the business, assets, operations or prospects of ClubCorp or any of its subsidiaries and
was not known to the Board as of the date of the merger agreement and becomes known after the date of the merger agreement (an "intervening event") if it has determined in good faith, after consultation with
ClubCorp's financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that the failure to make a change of recommendation would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law and after complying with the
following notice procedures:

• we must provide prior written notice to Parent informing Parent of the Board's intention to make a change of recommendation, which notice will describe the intervening event in reasonable
detail; and 

• at least three business days prior to effecting such change of recommendation in response to such intervening event, if requested by Parent, we must (A) negotiate, and use reasonable best efforts
to cause our representatives to negotiate, with Parent and its representatives in good faith

to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of the merger agreement so that the Board (or a committee thereof) no longer determines in good faith (after consultation with ClubCorp's
financial advisors and outside legal counsel) that the failure to make such change of recommendation in response to such intervening event would be, or reasonably likely to be, inconsistent with
its fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable law, and (B) permit Parent and its representatives to make a presentation (which may be telephonic) to the Board (or a committee thereof) regarding the
merger agreement and any adjustments with respect thereto.

Stockholders Meeting

        Unless the Board has made a change of recommendation or the merger agreement has been validly terminated, ClubCorp has agreed to, by acting through the Board (or a committee thereof), promptly
following confirmation by the SEC that the SEC has no further comments to this proxy statement, (i) take all action required under the NRS, ClubCorp's articles of incorporation, ClubCorp's bylaws and the
applicable requirements of the NYSE necessary to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of the ClubCorp stockholders for the purpose of approving the merger agreement (including any
adjournment or postponement thereof) and (ii) promptly mail this proxy statement to the ClubCorp stockholders (but in any event no more than five business days) after the date on which the SEC confirms that
it has no further comments on this proxy statement. ClubCorp may postpone, recess, adjourn or cancel the special meeting (w) to the extent required by law, (x) with Parent's written consent, (y) to allow
reasonable additional time to solicit additional proxies to obtain approval of the merger proposal by the ClubCorp stockholders at the special meeting or (z) in the absence of a quorum.

        In addition, ClubCorp has agreed to, by acting through the Board (or a committee thereof), (a) make the recommendation that the ClubCorp stockholders vote in favor of the merger proposal, (b) reaffirm
its recommendation (including with respect to any modifications to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement irrevocably offered in writing by Parent in accordance with the notice procedures described
above in "—Notice Procedures" and "—Board Recommendation and Change of Recommendation") within five business days of a request by Parent following the date on which any acquisition proposal or
material modification to such acquisition proposal is received by ClubCorp or is published, sent or communicated to the ClubCorp stockholders (or if the special meeting is scheduled to be held within five
business days of such request, within one business day after such request and, if possible, prior to the date of the special meeting), provided that Parent may only make such a request on one occasion in respect
of each acquisition proposal or material modification thereof, and (c) use its reasonable best efforts to solicit proxies from its stockholders to obtain the approval of the merger proposal by the ClubCorp
stockholders, provided that the Board may change its recommendation in the manner described above in "—Board Recommendation and Change of Recommendation" and following such change of
recommendation, may fail to use such reasonable best efforts.

        In this proxy statement, we refer to any proposal or offer from any person or group (other than Parent, Merger Sub or their respective affiliates) relating to any direct or indirect acquisition or purchase of a
business that constitutes 15% or more of the net revenues, net income or assets of ClubCorp and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or 15% or more of the equity securities of ClubCorp (measured by economic or
voting powers), any tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any person or group beneficially owning 15% or more of the total voting power of the equity securities of ClubCorp
(measured by economic or voting powers), any issuance, sale, transfer or other disposition of more than 15% of the equity securities of ClubCorp (measured by economic or voting power), or any merger,

whole, (ii) assets that constitute more than 50% of the consolidated total assets of ClubCorp and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (iii) more than 50% of the total voting power of the equity securities of
ClubCorp, in each case, that the Board in good faith (after consultation with ClubCorp's outside counsel and financial advisors) determines would, if consummated, result in a transaction that is more favorable
from a financial point of view to ClubCorp's stockholders than the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement after taking into account all such factors and matters deemed relevant in good faith by the
Board, including legal, financial (including the financing terms of any such proposal), regulatory, timing or other aspects of such proposal and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and after
taking into account any changes to the terms of the merger agreement irrevocably offered in writing by Parent in response to such superior proposal pursuant to, and in accordance with, the notice procedures
described above in "—Notice Procedures," as applicable, as a "superior proposal".

Efforts to Complete the Merger 

        Under the merger agreement, each of the parties agreed to use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all action, and to do, or cause to be done as promptly as practicable, all things necessary,
proper and advisable under applicable laws (including antitrust laws) to consummate and make effective as promptly as practicable the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and cause the
fulfillment at the earliest practicable date of all of the conditions to their respective obligations to consummate the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. Subject to appropriate confidentiality
protections, each party will furnish to the other such necessary information and reasonable assistance as such other party may reasonably request in connection with the foregoing.

each other in connection with any filing or submission and in connection with any investigation or other inquiry, including any proceeding initiated by a private party, (ii) subject to applicable law, furnishing to
the other party as promptly as reasonably practicable all information required for any application or other filing to be made by the other party pursuant to any applicable law in connection with the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement, (iii) promptly notifying the other party of any substantive communication received by such party from, or given by such party to, any U.S. or foreign governmental

comments in connection with, any communication, meeting or conference with, the governmental authority or, in connection with any proceeding by a private party, with any other person.

        No party will independently participate in any meeting or communication with any governmental authority in respect of any such filings, investigation or other inquiry relating to the above without giving
the other parties sufficient prior notice and, to the extent permitted by such governmental authority, the opportunity to attend and/or participate in such meeting or communication. Parent will cause and cause its
HSR affiliates and subsidiaries to, take any and all steps necessary to (i) resolve, avoid, or eliminate impediments or objections, if any, that may be asserted with respect to the transactions contemplated by the
merger agreement under any antitrust law or (ii) avoid the entry of, effect the dissolution of, and have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned, any decree, order or judgment that would prevent, prohibit, restrict
or delay the consummation of the contemplated transactions, so as to enable the parties to consummate the closing expeditiously (but in no event later than the outside date).

        If any administrative or judicial action or proceeding is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) by a governmental authority or private party challenging the merger or any other transaction contemplated
by the merger agreement, Parent, Merger Sub and ClubCorp will cooperate in all respects with each other and use its respective best efforts to contest and resist any such action or proceeding and Parent and
Merger Sub are required under the merger agreement to defend, at their cost and expense, any action.

Delisting and Deregistration of ClubCorp Common Stock 

        As promptly as practicable following the effective time, ClubCorp will cooperate with Parent and will use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done all
things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its part under applicable laws and rules and policies of the NYSE to enable the delisting of its shares on the NYSE and the deregistration of its shares under
the Exchange Act.

Employee Benefits 

        Under the merger agreement, for a period of at least twelve months following the effective time, each continuing employee of ClubCorp or its subsidiaries will receive (i) an annual base-salary or wage
rate, as applicable, and short term incentive opportunity (other than equity based benefits) that, in the aggregate are substantially similar to the base salary or wage rate, as applicable, and short term incentive
opportunity that was provided to such continuing employee immediately prior to the effective time and (ii) employee pension, welfare and other benefits that are substantially similar in the aggregate to the
employee pension, welfare and other benefits provided to such continuing employee immediately prior to the effective time. For a period of at least twelve months following the effective time, Parent or one of
its affiliates will maintain for the benefit of each continuing employee a severance or termination arrangement no less favorable than the severance or termination arrangement applicable to such continuing
employee immediately prior to the effective time.

        Parent will honor and assume, or will cause to be honored and assumed, the terms of the Stock Award Plan, the fiscal year 2017 incentive compensation plans and, subject to certain exceptions, all other
"employee benefit plans" as in effect as of the date of the merger agreement, subject to the amendment and termination provisions of such plans.

        In addition, the merger agreement provides that, to the extent Parent modifies any coverage or benefit plan in which continuing employees participate, Parent or any of its subsidiaries (including ClubCorp
and any of its subsidiaries) will (i) waive or cause to be waived any pre-existing conditions, exclusions, limitations actively-at-work requirements, and eligibility waiting periods under any group health plans of
Parent or its affiliates with respect to continuing employees and their eligible

dependents, (ii) give each continuing employee credit for the plan year in which the effective time occurs towards applicable deductibles and annual out-of-pocket limits for medical expenses incurred prior to
the effective time for which payment has been made and (iii) to the extent that it would not result in a duplication of benefits and to the extent that such service was recognized under a similar company plan,
give each continuing employee service credit for such continuing employee's employment with ClubCorp for purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting credit (but excluding benefit accrual under any
defined benefit pension plan) under each applicable Parent benefit plan as if such service had been performed with Parent; provided, however, that such recognition of service will not apply (x) for purposes of
any Parent benefit plan under which similarly situated employees of Parent and its subsidiaries do not receive credit for prior service, (y) to the extent it would result in a duplication of benefits or (z) for
purposes of any plan or arrangement that is grandfathered or frozen, either with respect to the level of benefits or participation.

Directors' and Officers' Indemnification and Insurance 

        Following the effective time and until the sixth anniversary thereof, subject to the limitations set forth in the merger agreement, Parent will cause the surviving corporation to indemnify each current and
former director and officer of the Company and its subsidiaries (in each case, to the extent acting in such capacity) for matters existing or occurring prior to the effective time and advance expenses incurred by
such indemnified party in the defense of any proceeding (provided that the person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such person
is not entitled to indemnification). For a period of six years from the effective time, the provisions in the surviving corporation's and each of its subsidiaries organizational documents with respect to
indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of former or present directors and officers will be substantially equivalent to the provisions contained in ClubCorp's or such subsidiaries'
organizational documents as in effect as of the date of the merger agreement, which provisions will not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six years after the effective time in any
manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any such individuals without the prior written consent of each such individual. Additionally, for a period of six years, Parent will maintain, or will
cause the surviving corporation to maintain, at no expense to the beneficiaries, either the existing policies or insurance policies for the directors and officers of at least the same coverage, with deductibles
substantially equivalent to those of the existing policies and containing terms and conditions and providing benefits that are substantially equivalent to any beneficiary thereof, with respect to matters existing or
occurring at or prior to the effective time and from insurance carriers having at least an "A" rating by A.M. Best with respect to directors' and officers' liability insurance. In lieu of providing such coverage,
ClubCorp may, at its option, purchase from insurance carriers with comparable credit ratings no later than the effective time, a six-year prepaid "tail policy" providing at least the same coverage and amounts,
with deductibles substantially equivalent to those of the existing policies and containing terms and conditions that are substantially equivalent to the insured than the existing policies maintained by ClubCorp
and its subsidiaries with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred at or before the effective time, including the transactions contemplated hereby, and from insurance carriers having at least an
"A" rating by A.M. Best with respect to directors' and officers' liability insurance; provided, however, that after the effective time, Parent and the surviving corporation will not be required to pay in the
aggregate for such coverage under each such policy more than 250% of the last annual premium paid by ClubCorp prior to the date of the merger agreement in respect of the coverage required to be obtained
pursuant to the merger agreement under each such policy, but in such case will purchase as much coverage as possible for such amount. In the event ClubCorp elects to purchase such a "tail policy", Parent will
cause the surviving corporation to maintain such "tail policy" in full force and effect for such six-year period. Parent also agreed to cause the surviving corporation and each of its subsidiaries to honor and
perform under all indemnification

agreements entered into by ClubCorp or any of its subsidiaries with any indemnified party prior to the date of the merger agreement.

        The indemnification and insurance provisions of the merger agreement are intended to benefit, and are enforceable by, the indemnified persons and their respective heirs or representatives.

Financing 

Existing ClubCorp Indebtedness

        ClubCorp will, and will cause its applicable subsidiaries to, use reasonable best efforts to arrange for the payoff on the closing date of the merger of all outstanding indebtedness under the existing credit
facility. Parent will be permitted, at its sole expense, to commence and conduct, in accordance with the terms of the indenture governing the Senior Notes (the "Indenture"), offers to purchase, including any
"Change of Control Offer" (as such term is defined in the Indenture) and/or any tender offer or exchange offer and to conduct a consent solicitation, if any (each, a "debt offer"), with respect to any or all of the
outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes. ClubCorp will, and will cause its subsidiaries and their respective representatives to, in each case, use their reasonable best efforts to provide all
cooperation reasonably requested by Parent in connection with a debt offer. If requested by Parent, in lieu of or in addition to Parent's redeeming or exchanging the Senior Notes, ClubCorp will use its
reasonable best efforts, at Parent's sole expense, to issue one or more notices of optional redemption for all or a portion of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes and to take any other
actions reasonably requested by Parent to facilitate their satisfaction and discharge. This proxy statement does not constitute an offer to purchase, offer to exchange, consent solicitation or notice of redemption
with respect to any of the Senior Notes.

Marketing Period and Efforts

        Under the merger agreement, we have agreed to allow Parent a period of 20 consecutive calendar days (subject to customary blackout dates) to market the debt financing. This marketing period is the first
period of 20 consecutive calendar days commencing after the date of the merger agreement throughout and at the end of which (i) Parent has received certain required financial information and the required
information is compliant, (ii) the conditions to the obligations of both parties and to the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the merger are satisfied (other than those conditions that by their
nature can only be satisfied at the closing of the merger, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions), and (ii) nothing has occurred and no condition exists that would cause the conditions to the
obligations of both parties and the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the merger to fail to be satisfied (other than those conditions that by their nature can only be satisfied at the closing of the
merger, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions), assuming the closing were to be scheduled for any time during such 20 consecutive calendar day period (provided that the marketing period
shall not commence or be deemed to have commenced if prior to the completion of such 20 consecutive calendar day period (I) Deloitte & Touche LLP shall have withdrawn its audit opinion with respect to any
audited financial statements included in the required financial information, in which case the marketing period shall not commence or be deemed to commence unless and until, at the earliest, a new unqualified
audit opinion is issued with respect to such audited financial statements by Deloitte & Touche LLP or another independent public accounting firm reasonably acceptable to Parent, (II) ClubCorp publicly
announces any intention to, or determines that it must, restate any financial statements included in the required financial information or any such restatement is under active consideration, in which case the
marketing period shall not commence or be deemed to commence unless and until, at the earliest, such restatement has been completed and the required financial information has been amended or ClubCorp
announces that it has concluded that no restatement is required in accordance with GAAP, (III) any required financial information would not be compliant at any time during such 20 consecutive calendar day
period or

otherwise does not include the required information, or (IV) ClubCorp shall have failed to file any report on Form 10-K, Form 10-Q or Form 8-K required to be filed with the SEC by the date required under the
Exchange Act, in which case (a) in the case of a failure to file a Form 10-K or Form 10-Q, the marketing period will not commence or be deemed to commence unless and until all such reports have been filed
and (b) in the case of a failure to file a Form 8-K, the marketing period will be tolled until such report has been filed, except that if the failure to file such report occurs during the final five business days of the
marketing period, the marketing period will be extended so that the final day of the marketing period will be no earlier than the fifth business day after such report has been filed. If the marketing period is not
completed on or before (i) August 18, 2017, it will not commence until September 5, 2017 or (ii) December 21, 2017, it will not commence until January 3, 2018, provided that notwithstanding anything in the
section "The Merger Agreement—Marketing Period and Efforts" to the contrary, the marketing period in any event shall end on any earlier date on which the debt financing is consummated. November 22, 2017
through November 26, 2017 will not be considered calendar days for purposes of the marketing period.

        Parent and Merger Sub have agreed in the merger agreement to use their respective reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper
or advisable to arrange and consummate the debt financing and equity financing not later than the date that closing is required to occur under the merger agreement on the terms and conditions described in or
contemplated by the debt commitment letter and any related fee letter and the equity commitment letter, including using reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in full force and effect the equity financing and
debt commitment letter, (ii) negotiate and execute definitive agreements with respect thereto on terms and conditions described in the debt commitment letter, (iii) satisfy and comply with on a timely basis (or,
if deemed advisable by Parent, seek the waiver of) all of the conditions and covenants applicable to Parent and Merger Sub in the equity commitment letter and debt commitment letter and the definitive
agreements for such equity financing and debt financing that are within their control that are to be satisfied by Parent or Merger Sub and to consummate the equity financing and debt financing at or prior to the
closing, and (iv) enforce their rights under the equity commitment letter and debt commitment letter and the definitive agreements for such equity financing and debt financing to cause the persons providing
such financing to fund such financing on the closing date.

ClubCorp's Cooperation

        We have agreed to use our reasonable best efforts prior to the closing of the merger to provide, and to cause our subsidiaries and their respective representatives to provide, in each case at Parent's sole
expense, such cooperation as reasonably requested by Parent to assist Parent in causing the conditions in the debt commitment letter to be satisfied or as is otherwise reasonably requested by Parent in
connection with the arrangement of the debt financing (provided that such request does not unreasonably disrupt or interfere with the business or operations of ClubCorp or its subsidiaries), including, among
other things, using reasonable best efforts to:

• furnish Parent with the required financial information and such other pertinent and customary information regarding ClubCorp and its subsidiaries as may be reasonably requested and inform
Parent if we have knowledge of any facts as a result of which a restatement of any financial statements to comply with GAAP is probable or under consideration; 

• assist in preparation for and participate in marketing efforts and a reasonable number of meetings, conference calls, presentations and roadshows with prospective lenders and investors, due
diligence sessions, drafting sessions and sessions with rating agencies, otherwise cooperate with marketing efforts for any debt financing and assist Parent in obtaining ratings as contemplated by
the debt commitment letter;

• reasonably assist, subject to certain limitations, Parent, Merger Sub and the debt financing sources with (i) the preparation of bank information memoranda, lender presentations, investor
presentations, offering documents, rating agency presentations and similar documents required in connection with the debt financing and (ii) request and facilitate Parent's obtaining of customary
auditors consents and reports and customary comfort letters of ClubCorp's independent accountants, as reasonably requested by Parent as necessary or customary for financings similar to the debt
financing; 

• assist, subject to certain limitations, Parent with the preparation of pro forma financial information and pro forma financial statements to the extent reasonably requested by Parent or the debt
financing sources to be included in certain marketing or offering documents; 

• provide information required under applicable "know your customer" and anti-money laundering rules and regulations; and 

• execute and deliver, as of the closing, any guarantee, pledge and security documents, supplemental indentures, currency or interest hedging arrangements, other definitive financing documents or
other certificates or documents as may be reasonably requested by Parent or the debt financing sources and otherwise reasonably facilitate the pledging of collateral and the granting of security
interests in respect of the debt financing.

        The obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the merger are not conditioned upon the obtaining of the debt financing or any replacement financing. None of ClubCorp or its subsidiaries or
their respective directors, officers or employees will be required to execute, deliver or enter into or perform any agreement with respect to the equity financing or debt financing that is not contingent upon the
closing or that would be effective prior to the effective time and the directors and managers of ClubCorp's subsidiaries will not be required to adopt resolutions approving the agreements, documents and
instruments pursuant to which the equity financing or debt financing are to be obtained prior to the effective time unless such directors and managers are to remain as directors and managers after the effective
time and such resolutions are contingent upon, or only effective as of, the effective time. Parent will promptly reimburse us, upon our request, for all out-of-pocket fees, costs and expenses incurred by ClubCorp
or its subsidiaries in connection with its cooperation with the debt financing and will indemnify and hold harmless each of ClubCorp, its subsidiaries and their respective affiliates and representatives against any
and all liabilities and losses incurred by them in connection with such cooperation.

Conditions to the Closing of the Merger 

        Each party's respective obligation to effect the merger under the merger agreement is subject to the satisfaction or, to the extent permitted by applicable law, waiver of various conditions, including the
following:

• the merger agreement has been approved by the affirmative vote (in person or by proxy) of the holders of a majority of all of the outstanding shares of ClubCorp common stock entitled to vote
thereon at the special meeting; 

• no law, statute, rule, regulation, executive order, decree, ruling, injunction or other order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) will have been enacted, entered, promulgated or enforced
by any governmental authority of competent jurisdiction which prohibits, makes illegal or enjoins the consummation of the merger and will remain in effect; and 

• the waiting period (and any extension thereof) applicable to the consummation of the merger under the HSR Act will have expired or been earlier terminated and any required approvals
thereunder will have been obtained.

        In addition, Parent and Merger Sub are not obligated to effect the merger under the merger agreement unless the following conditions are satisfied (or waived by Parent (where permissible by applicable
law)) at or prior to the effective time:

• our representations and warranties regarding certain elements of our capitalization, the absence of a material adverse effect and the absence of broker's and finder's fees are true and correct in all
respects (except with respect to the representations and warranties regarding certain elements of our capitalization for any failure to be so true and correct that is de minimis in nature), both when

representation and warranty will be true and correct as of such earlier date);

protective provision, ClubCorp's ownership interests in each of its subsidiaries, the acceleration, vesting or timing of payment of certain compensation benefits, the opinion of each of our
financial advisors, certain takeover statutes and the absence of dissenters' rights are true and correct in all material respects (without giving effect to any "materiality," "material adverse effect" or
similar qualifiers contained in any such representations and warranties), both when made and as of the effective time as if made as of the effective time (except to the extent that any such
representation or warranty expressly is made as of an earlier date, in which case such representation and warranty will be true and correct as of such earlier date); 

• our other representations and warranties set forth in the merger agreement (other than those noted in the preceding two bullet points) are true and correct in all respects (without giving effect to
any "materiality," "material adverse effect" or similar qualifiers contained in any such representations and warranties), both when made and as of the effective time as though made on and as of
such date (except to the extent that any such representation or warranty expressly speaks as of an earlier date, in which case such representation and warranty will be true and correct as of such
earlier date), except where the failures of any such representations and warranties to be so true and correct, in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect; 

• we have performed in all material respects the obligations, and complied in all material respects with the agreements and covenants, required to be performed by, or complied with by, us under
the merger agreement at or prior to the effective time;

• other than the one-time quarterly dividend of $0.13 per share declared on July 9, 2017 and which was paid on July 28, 2017, none of the ClubCorp or any committee or subcommittee thereof, or
any equivalent governing body of any non-wholly owned subsidiary has declared, set aside, established a record date for, authorized, made or paid any dividend or other distribution with respect

earlier date), except where the failure of any such representations and warranties to be true and correct, in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to prevent, materially delay or have a
material adverse effect on the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement;

• Parent and Merger Sub have performed in all material respects the obligations, and complied in all material respects with the agreements and covenants, required to be performed by or complied
with by each of them under the merger agreement at or prior to the effective time; and

Neither ClubCorp nor Parent may rely, either as a basis for not consummating the merger or terminating the merger agreement and abandoning the merger, on the failure of any of the preceding conditions listed
in this section to be satisfied if such failure was primarily caused by such party's breach in any material respect of the merger agreement.

marketing period has commenced but has not yet been completed as of the time of the outside date, the outside date may be extended by Parent in its sole discretion until four business days after
the then-scheduled end of the marketing period (not to be extended by more than the remaining number of calendar days of the marketing period that have not yet been completed), provided,
further, that the right to terminate the merger agreement under this circumstance will not be available to any party whose action or failure to perform any of its obligations under the merger
agreement required to be performed prior to the effective time of the merger was the primary cause of the merger not having occurred on or prior to the outside date; 

• if any court of competent jurisdiction or other governmental authority located or having jurisdiction in the United States has issued an order, decree or ruling, or taken any other final action
permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the merger and such order, decree, ruling or other action is or will have become final and non-appealable, provided that the party
seeking to terminate the merger agreement under this circumstance has used such standard of efforts as may be required pursuant to the merger agreement to prevent, oppose and remove such
restraint, injunction or other prohibition; or 

• if the approval of the merger agreement by ClubCorp's stockholders has not been obtained at the special meeting or at any adjournment or postponement thereof at which a vote on the approval
of the merger agreement was taken.

        ClubCorp may terminate the merger agreement by written notice to Parent:

• if there will have been a material breach of or material failure to perform any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of Parent or Merger Sub contained in the merger

Termination Fees and Expenses 

        We will be required to pay Parent a termination fee in the following circumstances:

• if the merger agreement is validly terminated by ClubCorp (prior to obtaining the ClubCorp stockholder vote approving the merger proposal) to accept a superior proposal, made in compliance
with the non-solicitation restrictions described above, we are required to pay Parent $34.2 million at or prior to the time of termination; 

• if the merger agreement is validly terminated by Parent based on the Board's change of recommendation (as described above in "The Merger Agreement—Restrictions on Solicitation of
Competing Acquisition Proposals—Board Recommendation and Change of Recommendation"), we are required to pay Parent as promptly as reasonably practicable (and, in any event, within
two business days of the termination); or 

• if the merger is validly terminated by (A) (i) either party for failure of the merger to occur on or prior to the outside date, or (ii) either party if the merger agreement is not approved by the
ClubCorp stockholders at the special meeting or at any adjournment or postponement thereof at which a vote on the approval of the merger agreement was taken, or (iii) by Parent upon our
uncured material breach of or material failure to perform any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in the merger agreement that would cause certain conditions to closing to fail, and
(B) (x) at any time after the execution of the merger agreement and prior to the merger agreement being approved by the ClubCorp stockholders at the special meeting or at any adjournment or
postponement thereof at which a vote on the approval of the merger proposal is taken, an acquisition proposal is made to ClubCorp or its representatives, to ClubCorp's stockholders, or otherwise
became publicly known or announced and (y) within 12 months after such termination, ClubCorp enters into a definitive agreement with respect to any acquisition proposal, or consummates any
acquisition proposal, then ClubCorp is required to pay Parent $34.2 million concurrently with the earlier of two business days from the consummation of any acquisition proposal and the entry
into a definitive agreement with respect to any acquisition proposal, provided that for purposes of this termination fee trigger, each reference in the definition of "acquisition proposal" to "15% or
more" is deemed to be a reference to "more than 50%".

        If the agreement is validly terminated (i) by either party because the merger agreement is not approved by the ClubCorp stockholders at the special meeting or at any adjournment or postponement thereof
at which a vote on the approval of the merger proposal was taken or (ii) by Parent due to ClubCorp's material breach of or material failure to perform any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in the
merger agreement that would cause certain conditions to closing to fail, then ClubCorp is required to pay to Parent promptly (and, in any event, within two business days of the termination) an amount equal to
that required to reimburse Parent, Merger Sub and their respective affiliates for all fees and expenses incurred in connection with the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby up to
$6.25 million.

        Parent will be required to pay us a reverse termination fee in the form of a cash amount equal to $74.2 million in the event that the merger agreement:

• is validly terminated by us, if (i) the marketing period has ended and (a) all of the conditions applicable to Parent, Merger Sub and ClubCorp's obligations to effect the merger and (b) Parent and
Merger Sub's obligations to effect the merger have, in each case, been and continue to be

Parent that we stand ready, willing and able to consummate the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and all the conditions to ClubCorp's obligation to close

contained in the merger agreement, or any such representation or warranty will be untrue in any material respect, which breach, failure to perform or failure to be true, individually or in the
aggregate, would result in a condition to our obligation to effect the merger not being satisfied (and such breach or failure is not curable or, if curable, not cured prior to the earlier of (a) 30 days
after written notice stating in reasonable detail the nature of such breach and the basis for such condition not being satisfied is given by us to Parent and (b) two business days prior to the outside
date), provided that the right to terminate the merger agreement under this circumstance will not be available to us if we are then in material breach of any of our representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements under the merger agreement and (ii) such uncured material breach or material failure to perform by Parent or Merger Sub is the primary reason for the failure of the
closing to be consummated.

        Such reverse termination fee is payable by Parent to us within two business days of the termination.

        Neither party is required to pay the applicable termination fee or reverse termination fee on more than one occasion.

        In the event Parent or Merger Sub fails to effect the merger when required pursuant to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, then ClubCorp's right to seek one or all of (but never to receive
more than one of) (i) a decree or order of specific performance or any injunction or injunctions or other equitable relief if and to the extent permitted by the terms of the merger agreement described below under
"—Specific Performance", (ii) the valid termination of the merger agreement and monetary damages for Parent's fraud or (iii) the valid termination of the merger agreement pursuant to the provisions described
above, which require Parent to pay us a reverse termination fee and receipt of such reverse termination fee if, as and when required pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, reimbursement of ClubCorp's
enforcement expenses and reimbursement for certain expenses and costs incurred by ClubCorp pursuant to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement will be the sole and exclusive remedy of ClubCorp,
its affiliates and their respective stockholders and representatives and any other person against Parent, its affiliate and their respective related parties.

        Except for the termination fee payable by either party under the circumstances in a termination of the merger agreement described above, the expense reimbursement payable by us in the circumstances
described above, and/or any enforcement expenses (which amount will not exceed $2.5 million), we and Parent are each responsible for all respective costs and expenses incurred in connection with the merger
and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. Expenses incurred in connection with the HSR Act filings and any fees and expenses of ClubCorp and its affiliates in responding to any
requests for additional information will be borne by Parent. Expenses incurred in connection with the filing, printing and mailing of this proxy statement will be shared equally by Parent.

Amendment and Waiver of the Merger Agreement 

        Subject to the provisions of applicable law, the merger agreement may be amended by the parties at any time prior to the effective time. The merger agreement may only be so amended by written
agreement, executed and delivered by duly authorized officers of the respective parties with certain exceptions related to the financing.

        At any time prior to the effective time, any party may extend the time for performance of any obligations or other acts of the other parties to the merger agreement, waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties in the merger agreement or any document delivered in connection therewith, or waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained in the merger agreement
(subject to compliance with applicable law). Any such extension or waiver will only be valid if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by the party or parties to be bound thereby and specifically referencing
the merger agreement.

Specific Performance 

        The parties have agreed in the merger agreement that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even if available, may not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that the parties do not
perform the provisions of the merger agreement in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. The parties have agreed that they will be entitled to an injunction, specific
performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches of the merger agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of the merger agreement, without proof of actual damages or inadequacy
of legal remedy and without any requirement for the posting of security, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity, subject to the terms and provisions of the merger
agreement. Furthermore, the parties have agreed that prior to the closing of the merger, subject to the terms and provisions of the merger agreement described in this section, ClubCorp will be entitled to seek
specific performance to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of, and to prevent or cure breaches of, the merger agreement by Parent or Merger Sub and to cause Parent and Merger Sub to consummate
the merger on the terms and subject to the conditions of the merger agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary in the merger agreement, ClubCorp will be entitled to seek specific
performance to cause Parent and Merger Sub to cause the equity financing to be funded and to consummate the merger only if:

• Parent is required to consummate the closing pursuant to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement; 

• the debt financing provided for by the debt commitment letter has been funded in full, or such full amount would be funded at the closing if the equity financing is funded at the closing; 

• Parent or Merger Sub fails to complete the closing by the date closing is required to have occurred pursuant to the merger agreement; and 

• ClubCorp has irrevocably confirmed in writing to Parent that, if specific performance is granted and the equity financing and the debt financing are funded, then the closing would occur, and
Parent and Merger Sub fail to complete the closing within two business days after delivery of such written notice by ClubCorp, provided that ClubCorp remains ready, willing and able to
consummate the closing during such two business day period.

Table of Contents

        The parties have also agreed that they will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief as provided in the merger agreement on the basis that either party has an
adequate remedy at law or an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity.

        Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the merger agreement, ClubCorp may concurrently seek (i) specific performance of Parent's obligation to cause the equity financing to be funded, and (ii) the
payment of the reverse termination fee or monetary damages, if, as and when payable under the merger agreement, but will not be permitted or entitled to receive (i) both a grant of specific performance to cause
the equity financing to be funded or other equitable relief, on the one hand, and payment of the reverse termination fee, monetary damages and/or certain other payments, if any, as and when due, on the other
hand, or (ii) both payment of any monetary damages whatsoever, on the one hand, and payment of the reverse termination fee and/or certain other payments, if any, as and when due, on the other hand.

No Third Party Beneficiaries 

        The merger agreement is binding upon and inures solely to the benefit of each party thereto and their respective successors and permitted assignees, and nothing in the merger agreement, express or
implied, is intended to or will confer upon any other person any rights, benefits or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of the merger agreement, other than (A) at and after the effective time
(i) benefits to the directors and officers who are intended to be third-party beneficiaries of certain terms of the merger agreement, (ii) the rights of the holders of shares of ClubCorp common stock to receive the
per share merger consideration under the merger agreement and (iii) the rights of the holders of Restricted Shares and/or PSUs under the merger agreement, (B) with respect to certain terms of the merger
agreement, the debt financing sources and their related parties, as applicable, and (C) with respect to certain terms of the merger agreement, Parent's related parties.

Governing Law 

        The merger agreement is governed by, and will be construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware (without giving effect to choice of law principles thereof), except that (i) the merger, the
internal affairs of ClubCorp, the fiduciary duties of the Board and the officers of ClubCorp and general corporation law with respect to ClubCorp and any provisions of the merger agreement that are expressly
or otherwise required to be governed by the NRS, will be governed by the laws of the State of Nevada (without giving effect to choice of law principles thereof) and (ii) any legal action, whether at law or in
equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise (other than legal actions relating to the interpretation of the merger agreement, the confidentiality agreement, the equity commitment letter and/or the limited
guarantee), against any debt financing source or its related parties will be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York.

Jurisdiction 

        The parties have irrevocably agreed not to bring or support, or permit any of their related parties to bring or support, any litigation against any financing source or its related parties relating to the merger
agreement or any of the transactions contemplated thereby in any forum other than a court of competent jurisdiction sitting in the borough of Manhattan of the City of New York, whether a state or federal court.

        Subject to the foregoing, the parties have irrevocably agreed to (i) submit themselves to the personal jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of Chancery and any state appellate court therefrom within the State
of Delaware (unless the Delaware Court of Chancery will decline to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, in which case, in any Delaware state or federal court within the State of Delaware) in

(including the debt financing and the equity financing).

Non-Recourse

MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER 

        The following is a summary of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger to "U.S. holders" and "non-U.S. holders" (in each case, as defined below) of ClubCorp common stock
whose shares of common stock are converted into the right to receive cash in the merger. This summary is based on the current provisions of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended from time to
time (the "Code"), applicable Treasury Regulations, judicial authority, and administrative rulings, all of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. Any such change could alter the tax
consequences to the holders as described herein. This summary is general in nature and does not purport to be a complete analysis of all potential tax effects of the merger. For example, it does not consider the
effect of the Medicare tax on net investment income or any applicable state, local or foreign income tax laws, or of any non-income tax laws. Furthermore, this summary applies only to holders that hold their
ClubCorp common stock as "capital assets" within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment). In addition, this discussion does not address all aspects of U.S. federal
income tax consequences that may be relevant to a holder in light of the holder's particular circumstances or to holders subject to special rules, such as:

• a bank, insurance company, or other financial institution; 

• a tax-exempt organization; 

• a retirement plan or other tax-deferred account; 

• an entity or arrangement treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a partnership, S corporation or other pass-through entity (or an investor in such an entity or arrangement); 

• a mutual fund; 

• a real estate investment trust or regulated investment company; 

• a dealer or broker in stocks and securities or currencies; 

• a trader in securities that elects mark-to-market treatment; 

• a holder of shares subject to the alternative minimum tax provisions of the Code; 

• a holder of shares that received the shares through the exercise of an employee stock option, through a tax qualified retirement plan or otherwise as compensation; 

• a U.S. holder (as defined below) that has a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar; 

• a "controlled foreign corporation," "passive foreign investment company," or corporation that accumulates earnings to avoid U.S. federal income tax; 

• a holder that holds shares as part of a hedge, straddle, constructive sale, conversion or other integrated transaction; or 

• a United States expatriate.

        If an entity that is classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds ClubCorp common stock, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of a partner will generally depend on the status of
the partner and the activities of the partnership. Partnerships holding ClubCorp common stock and partners in such partnerships should consult their tax advisors as to the particular U.S. federal income tax
consequences of the merger to them.

        For purposes of this discussion, the term "U.S. holder" means a beneficial owner of ClubCorp common stock that is:

• an individual citizen or resident of the United States;

Table of Contents

• a corporation, or other entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, created or organized under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia; 

• an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or 

• a trust if it (1) is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and one or more United States persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or
(2) has a valid election in effect under applicable United States Treasury regulations to be treated as a United States person.

        A "non-U.S. holder" means a beneficial owner of ClubCorp common stock that is not a U.S. holder or a partnership (or any other entity classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes).

U.S. Holders 

        General.    The exchange of ClubCorp common stock for cash in the merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, a U.S. holder whose shares of ClubCorp common
stock are converted into the right to receive cash in the merger will recognize capital gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash
received with respect to such shares and the U.S. holder's adjusted tax basis in such shares. A U.S. holder's adjusted tax basis generally will equal the price the U.S. holder paid for such shares. Gain or loss will
be determined separately for each block of shares of ClubCorp common stock (i.e., shares of ClubCorp common stock acquired at the same cost in a single transaction). Such gain or loss will be capital gain or
loss and generally will be treated as long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. holder has held the shares of ClubCorp common stock for more than one year at the time of the effective time of the merger. Long-
term capital gains of non-corporate U.S. holders (including individuals) are generally eligible for reduced rates of taxation. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.

        Information Reporting and Backup Withholding.    Information reporting and backup withholding may apply to payments made in connection with the merger. Backup withholding will not apply, however,
to a holder of ClubCorp common stock who (1) furnishes a correct taxpayer identification number ("TIN"), certifies that such holder is not subject to backup withholding on the Internal Revenue Service
Form W-9 (or appropriate successor form) included in the transmittal materials that such holder will receive, and otherwise complies with all applicable requirements of the backup withholding rules; or
(2) provides proof that such holder is otherwise exempt from backup withholding. Backup withholding is not an additional tax, and any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be refunded or
credited against a holder's U.S. federal income tax liability, if any, provided that such holder furnishes the required information to the Internal Revenue Service in a timely manner. The Internal Revenue Service
may impose a penalty upon any taxpayer that fails to provide the correct TIN.

Non-U.S. Holders 

        General.    A non-U.S. holder's receipt of cash in exchange for shares of ClubCorp common stock pursuant to the merger generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax unless:

• the gain, if any, on such shares is effectively connected with a trade or business of the non-U.S. holder in the United States (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to
the non-U.S. holder's permanent establishment in the United States);

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1577095/000104746917005072/a2232921zdefm14a.htm 138/262

Table of Contents

• the non-U.S. holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of the exchange of shares of ClubCorp common stock for cash pursuant to the
merger and certain other conditions are met; or 

• ClubCorp is or has been a "United States real property holding corporation" for U.S. federal income tax purposes and certain other conditions are met.

        A non-U.S. holder described in the first bullet point immediately above will generally be subject to regular U.S. federal income tax on any gain realized as if the non-U.S. holder were a U.S. holder. If such
non-U.S. holder is a foreign corporation, it may also be subject to a branch profits tax equal to 30% of its effectively connected earnings and profits (or a lower treaty rate). A non-U.S. holder described in the
second bullet point immediately above will be subject to tax at a rate of 30% (or a lower treaty rate) on any gain realized, which may be offset by U.S.-source capital losses recognized in the same taxable year,
even though the individual is not considered a resident of the United States.

        Generally, a corporation is a "United States real property holding corporation" if the fair market value of its United States real property interests equals or exceeds 50% of the sum of the fair market value of
its worldwide real property interests and its other assets used or held for use in a trade or business (all as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes). ClubCorp believes that it is currently a "United States
real property holding corporation" for U.S. federal income tax purposes. However, so long as ClubCorp common stock is regularly traded on an established securities market, ClubCorp's treatment as a "United
States real property holding corporation" would cause only a non-U.S. holder who holds or held, directly or indirectly under certain ownership rules of the Code, more than 5% of ClubCorp common stock (at
any time during the shorter of the five-year period preceding the merger or the period that the non-U.S. holder held ClubCorp common stock), and is not eligible for a treaty exemption, to be subject to U.S.
federal income tax on the exchange of ClubCorp common stock for cash in the merger.

        Information Reporting and Backup Withholding.    Information reporting and backup withholding will generally apply to payments made pursuant to the merger to a non-U.S. holder effected by or through
the U.S. office of any broker, U.S. or foreign, unless the holder certifies its status as a non-U.S. holder and satisfies certain other requirements, or otherwise establishes an exemption. Copies of applicable
information returns reporting such payments and any withholding may also be made available to the tax authorities in the non-U.S. holder's country in which such holder resides under the provisions of an
applicable treaty or agreement. Generally, information reporting and backup withholding will not apply to a payment of disposition proceeds to a non-U.S. holder where the transaction is effected outside the
United States through a non-U.S. office of a broker. However, for information reporting purposes, dispositions effected through a non-U.S. office of a U.S. broker or a non-U.S. broker with substantial U.S.
ownership or operations generally will be treated in a manner similar to dispositions effected through a U.S. office of a broker. A non-U.S. holder must generally submit an IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-
8BEN-E (or other applicable IRS Form W-8) attesting to its exempt foreign status in order to qualify as an exempt recipient. Notwithstanding the foregoing, backup withholding and information reporting may
apply if we, the paying agent or Parent has actual knowledge, or reason to know, that a non-U.S. holder is a U.S. person. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Rather, any amounts withheld under the
backup withholding rules from a payment to a non-U.S. holder can be refunded or credited against the non-U.S. holder's U.S. federal income tax liability, if any, provided that an appropriate claim is timely filed
with the Internal Revenue Service.

        THIS DISCUSSION IS FOR GENERAL INFORMATION ONLY AND IS NOT TAX ADVICE. WE URGE YOU TO CONSULT WITH YOUR TAX ADVISOR WITH RESPECT TO THE
APPLICATION OF THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX LAWS TO YOUR PARTICULAR SITUATION, AS WELL AS ANY TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER ARISING UNDER THE
FEDERAL ESTATE OR GIFT TAX RULES OR UNDER THE LAWS OF ANY STATE, LOCAL, FOREIGN OR OTHER TAXING JURISDICTION OR UNDER ANY APPLICABLE TAX TREATY.

FUTURE CLUBCORP STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS 

        If the merger is not completed, ClubCorp stockholders will continue to be entitled to attend and participate in ClubCorp's 2018 annual meeting of stockholders. If ClubCorp holds its 2018 annual meeting
of stockholders, any stockholder proposal intended for inclusion in the proxy materials for the 2018 annual meeting pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act must be received at our principal executive
offices no later than February 2, 2018. Where a stockholder does not seek inclusion of the proposal in the proxy material and submits a proposal outside of the process described in Rule 14a-8 of the Exchange
Act, the proposal must still comply with the procedural requirements in ClubCorp's bylaws. Accordingly, written notice must be sent to the Secretary of ClubCorp, at its principal executive offices, not less than
90 or more than 120 calendar days before the first anniversary of the prior year's annual meeting. This means that for the 2018 annual meeting, written notice must be delivered between the close of business on
March 12, 2018 and the close of business on Aril 11, 2018. If the date of the annual meeting, however, is more than 30 days before or more than 70 days after the anniversary of the prior year's meeting date, a
stockholder proposal must be submitted no earlier than the close of business on the day that is 120 calendar days before the actual meeting and not later than the later of (i) the close of business on the
90th calendar day before the actual meeting and (ii) the close of business on the 10th calendar day following the calendar day on which ClubCorp first announces the meeting date to the public. A copy of the
full text of the bylaw provisions discussed above may be obtained by writing to our Secretary at 3030 LBJ Freeway, Suite 600, Dallas, Texas 75234.

        Any stockholder suggestions for director nominations must be submitted by the dates by which other stockholder proposals are required to be submitted as set forth above.

MULTIPLE STOCKHOLDERS SHARING ONE ADDRESS 

        The SEC has adopted rules that permit companies and intermediaries, such as brokers and banks, to satisfy the delivery requirements for proxy statements with respect to two or more stockholders sharing
an address by delivering a single proxy statement, as applicable, addressed to those stockholders, unless contrary instructions have been received. This procedure, which is commonly referred to as
"householding," reduces the amount of duplicate information that stockholders receive and lowers printing and mailing costs for companies.

        Certain brokerage firms may have instituted householding for beneficial owners of our common stock held through brokerage firms. If your family has multiple accounts holding our common stock, you
may have already received a householding notification from your broker. You may decide at any time to revoke your decision to household, and thereby receive multiple copies of proxy materials. If you wish to
opt out of this procedure and receive a separate set of proxy materials in the future, or if you are receiving multiple copies and would like to receive only one, you should contact your broker, trustee or other
nominee or our Investor Relations Department by (a) mail at ClubCorp Holdings, Inc., Attention: Investor Relations, 3030 LBJ Freeway, Suite 600, Dallas, TX 75234, (b) telephone at (972) 888-7495, or (c) e-
mail at clubcorp.investor.relations@clubcorp.com. A separate copy of these proxy materials will be promptly delivered upon request by writing to: MacKenzie Partners, Inc., 105 Madison Avenue, New York,
NY 10016 or by calling (800) 322-2885.

pursuant to Sections 3.2(a) or 3.2(b), as applicable, cannot be made through the Company's or the Surviving Corporation's payroll system or payroll provider, then Parent shall cause the Surviving

cash being hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund") in trust for the benefit of the holders of the Shares that will be converted into the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration pursuant

Company shall, in consultation with and in accordance with the directions having been given by Parent at least three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, deposit, or cause to be deposited, with

Subsidiaries designated by Parent (such designation to be made no less than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date), which amount shall not exceed the Available Cash Amount. The Paying
Agent shall invest the Exchange Fund as reasonably directed by Parent; provided that such investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America, in commercial paper
obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or Standard & Poor's Corporation, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc., respectively, in certificates of deposit, bank

or in money market funds having a rating in the highest investment category granted by a recognized credit rating agency at the time of acquisition or a combination of the foregoing and, in any such
case, no such instrument shall have a maturity exceeding three months. To the extent that there are losses with respect to such investments, or the Exchange Fund diminishes for other reasons below the
level required to make prompt cash payment of the aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration as contemplated hereby, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, promptly replace or
restore, or cause to be replaced or restored, the cash in the Exchange Fund lost through such investments or other events so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all times maintained at a level
sufficient to make such cash payments. Any interest and other income resulting from such investment shall become a part of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess of the amounts payable under
this Article III shall be promptly returned to Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as requested by Parent. The funds deposited with the Paying Agent pursuant to this Section 3.3(a) shall not be used for
any purpose other than as contemplated by this Section 3.3(a).

        (b)    Exchange Procedures.    

        (i)    Transmittal Materials.    Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any event within three (3) Business Days thereafter), the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail
or otherwise provide to each former holder of record of a certificate or certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Shares, if any ("Certificates"), and each
former holder of record of Shares held in book-entry form ("Book-Entry Shares") (other than holders of Cancelled Shares and Subsidiary Shares) (A) transmittal materials, including a letter of
transmittal in customary form as agreed by Parent and the Company prior to the Closing, specifying that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates will pass, only upon
delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent or, with respect to Book-Entry Shares, only upon delivery of an "agent's message" regarding the book-entry transfer of Book-Entry Shares (or such
other evidence, if any, of the transfer as the Paying Agent may reasonably request), such transmittal materials to be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent and the Company may
agree prior to the Closing, and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, in exchange for the Per Share Merger Consideration.

        (ii)    Certificates.    Upon surrender of one or more Certificates to the Paying Agent, in accordance with the terms of such transmittal materials and instructions as contemplated in
Section 3.3(b)(i) above, the holder of record of such Certificate(s) shall be entitled to receive, and Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to pay and deliver as promptly as reasonably practicable
after the Effective Time, a cash amount in U.S. dollars in immediately available funds (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in Section 3.3(f)) equal to the product
obtained by multiplying (A) the number of Shares represented by such Certificate(s) by (B) the Per Share Merger Consideration, and the Certificate(s) so surrendered shall immediately be
cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of the Certificates.

        (iii)    Book-Entry Shares.    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, any holder of Book-Entry Shares will not be required to deliver a Certificate to the Paying
Agent or the Surviving Corporation in order to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive as a result of the Merger. In lieu thereof, each holder of record of
one or more Book-Entry Shares (other than Cancelled Shares and Subsidiary Shares) shall upon receipt by the Paying Agent of an "agent's message" in customary form (it being understood that
the holders of Book-Entry Shares shall be deemed to have surrendered such Shares upon receipt by the Paying Agent of such "agent's message" or such other evidence, if any, as the Paying
Agent may reasonably request) be entitled to receive, and Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to pay and deliver as promptly as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, a cash amount in
U.S. dollars in immediately available funds (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in Section 3.3(f)) equal to the product obtained by multiplying (A) the number of
Shares represented by such Book-Entry Shares by (B) the Per Share Merger Consideration, and the Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall immediately be cancelled. No interest will be paid or
accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of the Book-Entry Shares.

        (iv)    Unrecorded Transfers; Other Payments.    In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company or if payment of the Per Share
Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, is registered, a check for any cash to be
exchanged upon due surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, may be issued to such transferee or other Person if the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable,
formerly representing such Shares is properly presented to the Paying Agent accompanied by all reasonable documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any
applicable transfer or other similar Taxes have been paid or are not applicable.

        (v)    Cash Balances.    The Company shall deliver to Parent, upon written request delivered to the Company at least ten (10) Business Days prior to the anticipated Closing Date, a written
notice delivered no later than five (5) Business Days prior to the anticipated Closing Date setting forth, in each case as of the close of business on the immediately preceding Business Day, the
reasonable estimated aggregate cash balances (as determined by the Company in good faith) held by the Company and its Subsidiaries (by Subsidiary) as well as the reasonable estimated
amounts of such cash balances (as determined by the Company in good faith) that are not being used for other purposes and that are available to be utilized in respect of the obligations set forth
in Section 3.3(a) (the "Available Cash Amount").

        (vi)  Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 3.3(b), each Certificate and Book-Entry Share (other than Cancelled Shares and Subsidiary Shares) shall be deemed at any time after
the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender (together with a letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto,
and such other documents as may reasonably be required pursuant to such instructions (as applicable)) the applicable Per Share Merger Consideration as contemplated by this Article III. Any Per
Share Merger Consideration paid upon surrender of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share pursuant to this Section 3.3(b) shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining
to such Book-Entry Shares or the Shares represented by such Certificates, as applicable. The Surviving Corporation shall pay all charges and expenses, including those of the Paying Agent, in
connection with the exchange of Shares for the Per Share Merger Consideration.

Shares) who has not theretofore complied with this Article III shall thereafter be entitled to look to the Surviving Corporation for payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration (after giving effect to
any required Tax withholdings as provided in Section 3.3(f)) upon delivery of evidence of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares reasonably acceptable to the Surviving Corporation, without any interest
thereon in accordance with the provisions set forth in Section 3.3(b) upon due surrender of its Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Surviving Corporation,
Parent, the Company, the Paying Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any former holder of Shares for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Laws. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by such holders immediately prior to such time at which such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any
Governmental Authority shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims of interest of any Person previously entitled
thereto.

        (d)    Transfers.    From and after the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation
of the Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any evidence of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share is presented, and acceptable, to the Surviving
Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent for transfer, subject to compliance with the procedures set forth in this Article III, it shall be cancelled and exchanged for the cash amount in immediately
available funds to which the holder thereof is entitled pursuant to this Article III. The Per Share Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender of Certificates or receipt by the Paying Agent of an "agent's
message" in the case of Book-Entry Shares in accordance with the terms of this Article III shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Shares formerly represented

to the Company on or prior to the date hereof. As of the date hereof, Parent has fully paid any and all commitment fees or other fees in connection with the Commitment Letters that are payable on or prior to the
date hereof pursuant to the terms of the Commitment Letters and Parent will, directly or indirectly, continue to pay in full any such amounts required to be paid pursuant to the terms relating to the Debt
Financing as and when they become due and payable prior to the Closing Date. As of the date hereof, the Commitment Letters are in full force and effect and are the legal, valid, binding and enforceable
obligations of Parent and Merger Sub, as the case may be, and, to the Knowledge of Parent, each of the other parties thereto, subject, in each case, to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception. There are no
conditions precedent related to the funding or investing, as applicable, of the full amount of the Financing (including pursuant to any "market flex" provisions in the fee letter), other than as expressly set forth in
the Commitment Letters and any related fee letter delivered to the Company on or prior to the date hereof. As of the date hereof, no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both,
would or would reasonably be expected to (i) constitute a default or breach on the part of Parent or Merger Sub or, to the Knowledge of Parent, any other party thereto under any of the Commitment Letters,
(ii) constitute a failure to satisfy a condition on the part of Parent or Merger Sub or, to the Knowledge of Parent, any other party thereto under the Commitment Letters or (iii) result in any portion of the amounts
to be funded or invested in accordance with the Commitment Letters being unavailable on the Closing Date. As of the date hereof, assuming the satisfaction or waiver of conditions to Parent's and Merger Sub's
obligations to consummate the Merger, Parent has no reason to believe that any of the conditions to the Financing contemplated by the Commitment Letters will not be satisfied or that the full amount of the
Financing will not be made available to Parent in full on the Closing Date. Assuming the Financing is funded and/or invested in accordance with the Commitment Letters, Parent and Merger Sub will have on
the Closing Date funds sufficient to (i) pay the aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration and the other payments under Article III, (ii) pay any and all fees and expenses required to be paid at Closing by Parent
and Merger Sub in connection with the Merger and the Financing, (iii) prepay or repay any outstanding indebtedness of the Company or its Subsidiaries required by this Agreement to be prepaid or repaid and
(iv) satisfy all of the other payment obligations of Parent and Merger Sub contemplated hereunder (clauses (i) through (iv), the "Financing Uses").

        5.9    Parent Guarantee.     The Guarantor has furnished the Company with a true, complete and correct copy of the Parent Guarantee. The Parent Guarantee is in full force and effect and has not been
amended or modified. The Parent Guarantee is a (a) legal, valid and binding obligation of the Guarantor and of each of the other parties thereto and (b) enforceable in accordance with its respective terms against
the Guarantor and each of the other parties subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception. There is no default under the Parent Guarantee by the Guarantor, and no event has occurred that with the lapse of
time or the giving of notice or both would constitute a default thereunder by the Guarantor.

        5.10    Ownership of Shares.     None of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates or Subsidiaries beneficially owns (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) any Shares or any
securities that are convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for Shares, or holds any rights to acquire or vote any Shares, or any option warrant, convertible security, stock appreciation right, swap
agreement or other security, contract right or derivative position, whether or not presently exercisable, that provides Parent, Merger Sub, or any of their respective Affiliates or Subsidiaries with an exercise or
conversion privilege or a settlement payment or mechanism at a price related to the value of the Shares or a value determined in whole or part with reference to, or derived in whole or part from, the value of the
Shares, in any case without regard to whether (a) such derivative conveys any voting rights in such securities to such Person or such Person's Affiliates, (b) such derivative is required to be, or capable of being,
settled through delivery of securities or (c) such Person or such Person's Affiliates may have entered into other transactions that hedge the economic effect of such derivative.

Agreement to the extent the requirement of such consent would violate any Law. The failure of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to take any actions prohibited by this Section 6.1 shall not be a
breach of this Agreement.

        (d)   Each of Parent and Merger Sub agrees that, during the Interim Period, it shall not (i) directly or indirectly, engage in any business activities or incur any liabilities or obligations other than as
expressly contemplated by this Agreement or (ii) and shall direct each of its Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, make any acquisition of (whether by merger, consolidation or acquisition of stock or
substantially all of the assets), or any investment in any interest in, any Person that would materially delay or prevent or make illegal the consummation of the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

        6.2    Access to Information.     During the Interim Period and subject to applicable Laws and Section 6.5(b), Parent shall be entitled (at Parent's sole cost and expense), through its Representatives, to have
such access to the properties, businesses and operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries and such examination of the properties, offices, facilities, Contracts, Tax records, books, records and personnel of the
Company and its Subsidiaries as it reasonably requests upon reasonable advance written notice in connection with Parent's efforts to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Any such
access and examination shall be conducted during regular business hours and under reasonable circumstances and shall be subject to restrictions under applicable Law. The Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause its Representatives to reasonably cooperate with Parent and Parent's Representatives in connection with such access and examination, and Parent and its Representatives shall reasonably
cooperate with the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives and shall use their reasonable best efforts to minimize any disruption to the business. Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, (a) no such access or examination shall be permitted to the extent that (i) it would reasonably be expected to unreasonably disrupt the operations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) it
would reasonably be expected to cause significant competitive harm to the Company or its Subsidiaries if the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are not consummated or (iii) the Company determines
in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that such access or examination would reasonably be expected to jeopardize the attorney-client privilege (so long as the Company has taken all reasonable
steps to permit such access or examination or to disclose the relevant information and to respond in a timely manner to all subsequent queries by Parent and its Representatives based on such information on a
basis that does not compromise the Company's attorney-client privilege with respect thereto) or violate any applicable Law or result in a breach of or default under any Contract (so long as the Company has
used reasonable best efforts to obtain the consent of relevant third parties necessary to permit such access or examination), (b) nothing in this Section 6.2 shall require cooperation to the extent that it would
(i) cause any condition to the Closing set forth in Sections 7.1 or 7.2 to not be satisfied or (ii) cause any breach of this Agreement and (c) the Company may elect to limit, or cause any of its Subsidiaries to limit,
disclosure of any information to certain Persons designated, at the request of the Company, as a "clean team" of Parent (which Persons must be reasonably acceptable to the Company). Parent shall, and shall
cause each of its Subsidiaries to cause its and their representatives to, hold all information provided or furnished pursuant to this Section 6.2 confidential in accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, during the Interim Period, neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall have any right to perform invasive or subsurface investigations of the
properties or facilities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries without the prior written consent of the Company (which consent may be withheld for any or no reason). The Company does not make any
representation or warranty as to the accuracy of any information provided (if any) pursuant to this Section 6.2, and neither Parent nor Merger Sub may rely on the accuracy of any such information, in each case
other than as expressly set forth in the Company's representations and warranties contained in Article IV; provided that no investigation pursuant to this Section 6.2 by Parent, Merger Sub or their
Representatives shall be deemed to modify any of the Company's representations and warranties

        6.3    Consents.     Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall use (and the Company shall cause its Subsidiaries to use) their respective reasonable best efforts to obtain all consents and approvals
set forth on Section 6.3 of the Company Disclosure Schedule; provided, however, that the consent of Parent shall be required with respect to any amendment or modification to any Contract for the purposes of
obtaining any such consent or approval that is adverse in any material respect to Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries following the Closing; provided, further, that, except as set forth in
this Agreement, each of the Parties acknowledges and agrees that obtaining any such consent or approval shall not be a condition to Closing.

        6.4    Further Action; Efforts.     

        (a)   Subject to Section 6.3, without limiting any other covenant in this Agreement (including the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub set forth in this Section 6.4, Section 6.12 and Section 6.13),
each of the Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other, agrees to use its respective reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all action, and to do, or cause to be done
as promptly as practicable, all things necessary, proper and advisable under applicable Laws to (i) consummate and make effective as promptly as practicable the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and (ii) cause the fulfillment at the earliest practicable date of all of the conditions to their respective obligations to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Subject to
appropriate confidentiality protections, each of the Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other, shall furnish to the other such necessary information and reasonable assistance as
such other party may reasonably request in connection with the foregoing.

        (b)   Each Party will use its best efforts to, and, in the case of Parent, cause each of its Subsidiaries (collectively, the "Parent Group") to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to
be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws and regulations to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Without limiting the
generality of the undertakings pursuant to this Section 6.4, each of the Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, shall provide or cause to be provided (including by
(i) their "ultimate parent entities" as that term is defined in the HSR Act and (ii) their other Affiliates) as promptly as practicable to any applicable Governmental Authority information and documents
requested by such Governmental Authority or necessary, proper or advisable to permit consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including filing any notification and report
form and related material required under the HSR Act (and any Antitrust Law enforced by any Governmental Authority regarding preacquisition notifications for the purpose of competition reviews) as
promptly as practicable, but in no event later than ten (10) Business Days after the date hereof, and thereafter to respond as promptly as practicable to any request for additional information or
documentary material that may be made under the HSR Act (and any Antitrust Law enforced by any Governmental Authority regarding preacquisition notifications for the purpose of competition
reviews). Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to cause (and shall cause its "ultimate parent entity" as that term is defined in the HSR Act to cause) the filings under the HSR Act to be considered for
grant of "early termination," and make any further filings pursuant thereto that may be necessary, proper, or advisable in connection therewith. Parent shall be responsible for all fees and expenses in
connection with the HSR Act filings and any fees and expenses of the Company and its Affiliates in responding to any requests for additional information. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall,

in connection with any proceeding by a private Party, in each case regarding any of the transactions contemplated hereby and, subject to applicable Law, furnish the other Party promptly with copies of
all correspondence, filings and communications between them and the FTC, the DOJ, or any other Governmental Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (iv) respond
as promptly as reasonably practicable to any inquiries received from, and supply as promptly as reasonably practicable any additional information or documentation that may be requested by the DOJ,
FTC, or by any other Governmental Authority in respect of such registrations, declarations and filings or such transactions; and (v) permit the other Party to review any substantive communication given
by it to, and consult with each other in advance, and consider in good faith the other Party's reasonable comments in connection with, any communication, meeting or conference with, the FTC, the DOJ
or any other Governmental Authority or, in connection with any proceeding by a private party, with any other Person.

        (d)   No Party shall independently participate in any meeting or communication with any Governmental Authority in respect of any such filings, investigation or other inquiry relating to
Sections 6.4(b) or 6.4(c) without giving the other Parties' sufficient prior notice of the meeting and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Authority, the opportunity to attend and/or participate in
such meeting or communication. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, and in furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, Parent shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, take any and all steps necessary to (i) resolve, avoid, or eliminate impediments or objections, if any, that may be asserted with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
under any Antitrust Law or (ii) avoid the entry of, effect the dissolution of, and have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned, any decree, order or judgment that would prevent, prohibit, restrict or delay

or any interest or interests therein. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 6.4 shall require Parent to take any action with respect to any direct or indirect portfolio companies of
investment funds

opportunity to review and to comment on such document or response, which the Company shall consider in good faith. Each of Parent and Merger Sub will furnish to the Company the information
relating to it required by the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder to be set forth in the Proxy Statement. The Company shall promptly notify Parent and Merger Sub upon
the receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff or any request from the SEC or its staff for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement and shall provide Parent with copies of all
correspondence between it and its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC and its staff, on the other hand, relating to the Proxy Statement and shall consider in good faith the reasonable comments
or revisions that Parent may request in writing. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to resolve all SEC comments with respect to the Proxy Statement as promptly as practicable after receipt
thereof. The Company shall cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to holders of Common Stock as of the record date established for the Stockholders Meeting promptly (but in any event no more than
five (5) Business Days) after the date on which the SEC confirms that it has no further comments on the Proxy Statement.

        (c)   If at any time prior to the Stockholders Meeting any information relating to the Company or Parent, or any of their respective Affiliates, should be discovered by a Party, which information
should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, the Party that discovers such information shall promptly notify the other Party and the Company shall prepare (with the
reasonable assistance of Parent) and mail to its stockholders such an amendment or supplement, in each case, to the extent required by applicable Law. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub
agrees to promptly (i) correct any information provided by it specifically for use in the Proxy Statement if and to the extent that such information shall have become false or misleading in any material
respect and (ii) supplement the information provided by it specifically

for use in the Proxy Statement to include any information that shall become necessary in order to make the statements in the Proxy Statement, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. The Company further agrees to cause the Proxy Statement as so corrected or supplemented as promptly as practicable to be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to its stockholders,
in each case as and to the extent required by applicable Law. Except in connection with a Change of Recommendation or thereafter, no amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement will be made by
the Company without the approval of Parent, which approval will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

        6.8    Stockholders Meeting.     Unless the Board of Directors of the Company has made a Change of Recommendation, the Company, acting through its Board of Directors (or a committee thereof), shall
promptly following confirmation by the SEC that the SEC has no further comments on the Proxy Statement (but subject to the last sentence of this Section 6.8), take all action required under the NRS, the
Articles of Incorporation, the Bylaws and the applicable requirements of the New York Stock Exchange necessary to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders for the purpose of
approving and adopting this Agreement (including any adjournment or postponement thereof, the "Stockholders Meeting"), with the record date and meeting date being selected after reasonable consultation
with Parent; provided that the Company may postpone, recess, adjourn or cancel such meeting (i) to the extent required by Law, (ii) with the written consent of Parent, (iii) to allow reasonable additional time to
solicit additional proxies to obtain the Company Requisite Vote or (iv) if as of the time for which the Stockholders Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy Statement) there are insufficient
Shares represented (either in person or by proxy) and voting to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Stockholders Meeting. The Company, acting through its Board of Directors (or a
committee thereof), shall, subject to Section 6.6(b), (a) include in the Proxy Statement the Recommendation, (b) reaffirm the Recommendation (which Recommendation shall, for avoidance of doubt, be in
respect of this Agreement and the Merger, as may be modified pursuant to any changes to the terms of this Agreement irrevocably offered in writing by Parent pursuant to, and in accordance with Section 6.6(b)
(iii) or Section 6.6(c), as applicable) within five (5) Business Days after a request therefor by Parent following the date on which any Acquisition Proposal or material modification thereto is received by the
Company or is published, sent or communicated to the Company's stockholders (or, if the Stockholders Meeting is scheduled to be held within five (5) Business Days, within one (1) Business Day, if possible,
before the Stockholder Meeting) (provided that Parent may not make any such request on more than one (1) occasion in respect of each Acquisition Proposal or material modification thereof) and (c) use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain the Company Requisite Vote, including by soliciting proxies therefor; provided that the Board of Directors of the Company may fail to include the Recommendation in the Proxy
Statement or withdraw, modify, qualify or change the recommendation, or formally resolve to effect or publicly announce an intention to effect any of the foregoing solely in accordance with Section 6.6(b)(iii)
or Section 6.6(c) and following such Change of Recommendation, may fail to use such reasonable best efforts. Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the prior written consent of Parent, the Stockholder
Meeting will not be postponed or adjourned (A) by more than 10 calendar days at a time without the prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) of Parent; or (B) with
respect to Section 6.8(iii), by more than 30 calendar days after the date on which the Stockholder Meeting was (or was required to be) originally scheduled. In no event will the record date of the Stockholder
Meeting be changed without Parent's prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), unless required by applicable Law. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, the Company shall not be required to hold the Stockholders Meeting if this Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with its terms.

        6.9    Stock Exchange Delisting; Deregistration.     Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall cooperate with Parent and use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or
cause to be done all things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its part under applicable Laws and rules and policies of the New York Stock Exchange to enable the delisting by the Surviving
Corporation of the Shares from the New York Stock Exchange as promptly as practicable after (and only after) the Effective Time and the deregistration of the Shares under the Exchange Act as promptly as
practicable after the Effective Time.

        6.10    Employment and Employee Benefits.     

        (a)   For a period of at least twelve (12) months following the Effective Time (the "Benefit Continuation Period"), Parent shall provide, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide, to each
employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries who continues to be employed by the Company or the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (each, a "Continuing Employee" and
collectively, the "Continuing Employees"), (i) an annual base-salary or wage rate, as applicable, and short term incentive opportunity (other than equity-based benefits) that in the aggregate are
substantially similar to the base salary or wage rate, as applicable, and short term incentive opportunity that was provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time and
(ii) employee pension, welfare and other benefits that are substantially similar in the aggregate to the employee pension, welfare and other benefits provided to such Continuing Employee immediately
prior to the Effective Time. For the duration of the Benefit Continuation Period, Parent or one of its Affiliates shall maintain for the benefit of each Continuing Employee a severance or termination
arrangement no less favorable than the severance or termination arrangement applicable to such Continuing Employee set forth in Section 6.10(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

        (b)   Parent shall honor and assume, or shall cause to be honored and assumed, the terms of all Company Plans, subject to the amendment and termination provisions thereof.

        (c)   To the extent that Parent modifies any coverage or benefit plan in which Continuing Employees participate, Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including the Company and any Subsidiaries
thereof) shall (i) waive or cause to be waived any pre-existing conditions, exclusions, limitations, actively-at-work requirements, and eligibility waiting periods under any group health plans of Parent or
its Affiliates to be waived with respect to Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents, (ii) give each Continuing Employee credit for the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs towards
applicable deductibles and annual out-of-pocket limits for medical expenses incurred prior to the Effective Time for which payment has been made and (iii) to the extent that it would not result in a
duplication of benefits and to the extent that such service was recognized under a similar Company Plan, give each Continuing Employee service credit for such Continuing Employee's employment with
the Company for purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting credit (but excluding benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension plan) under each applicable Parent benefit plan as if such service
had been performed with Parent; provided, however, that such recognition of service shall not apply (A) for purposes of any Parent benefit plan under which similarly situated employees of Parent and
its Subsidiaries do not receive credit for prior service, (B) to the extent it would result in a duplication of benefits or (C) for purposes of any plan or arrangement that is grandfathered or frozen, either
with respect to the level of benefits or participation.

        (d)   Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any Continuing Employee any right to continue in the employ or service of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any Affiliate of Parent, or shall
interfere with or restrict in any way the rights of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any Affiliate of Parent, which rights are hereby expressly reserved, to discharge or terminate the services of any
Continuing Employee at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or without cause,

except to the extent expressly provided otherwise in a written agreement between Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Company or any Affiliate of Parent and the Continuing Employee or any
severance, benefit or other applicable plan, policy or program covering such Continuing Employee. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in this Section 6.10 shall
(i) be deemed or construed to be an amendment or other modification of any Company Plan, (ii) prevent Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any Affiliate of Parent from amending or terminating any
Company Plans in accordance with their terms or (iii) create any third-party rights in any current or former service provider of the Company or its Affiliates (or any beneficiaries or dependents thereof).

        6.11    Directors' and Officers' Indemnification and Insurance.     

        (a)   From and after the Effective Time through the sixth (6th) anniversary of the date on which the Effective Time occurs, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to indemnify and hold
harmless each present and former director and officer of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company (in each case, to the extent acting in such capacity) (the "Indemnified Parties"), against any
reasonable and documented costs or expenses (including reasonable and documented attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities or awards paid in settlement incurred in
connection with any actual or threatened claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative and whether formal or informal in each case arising out of,
relating to or in connection with matters existing or occurring prior to the Effective Time (including the fact that such Person is or was a director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
any acts or omissions occurring or alleged to occur prior to the Effective Time) (each, a "Proceeding"), to the fullest extent that the Company would have been permitted under applicable Law or
pursuant to any indemnification agreements with the Company and any of its Subsidiaries in effect as of the Effective Time, and the Surviving Corporation shall, to the fullest extent the Company would
have been permitted under applicable Law, advance expenses (including reasonable and documented legal fees and expenses) incurred by an Indemnified Party in the defense of any Proceeding,
including any expenses incurred in enforcing such Indemnified Party's rights under this Section 6.11; provided that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein or otherwise, the Person to
whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such Person is not entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Section 6.11). In the event
of any such Proceeding (x) neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any Proceeding in which indemnification could be sought by
such Indemnified Party hereunder, unless such settlement, compromise or consent relates only to monetary damages for which the Surviving Corporation is entirely responsible or includes an
unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all liability arising out of or related to such Proceeding or such Indemnified Party otherwise consents in writing, and (y) the Surviving Corporation
shall reasonably cooperate in the defense of any such matter. In the event any Proceeding is brought against any Indemnified Party and in which indemnification could be sought by such Indemnified
Party under this Section 6.11, (i) the Surviving Corporation or Parent shall have the right, but not the obligation, to control the defense thereof after the Effective Time, (ii) each Indemnified Party shall
be entitled to retain his or her own counsel, whether or not the Surviving Corporation shall elect to control the defense of any such Proceeding, (iii) the Surviving Corporation shall pay all reasonable and
documented fees and expenses of one counsel retained by an Indemnified Party reasonably promptly after statements therefor are received by the Surviving Corporation, whether or not the Surviving
Corporation shall elect to control the defense of any such Proceeding, and (iv) no Indemnified Party shall be liable for any settlement effected without his or her prior express written consent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

        (b)   The provisions in the Surviving Corporation's and each of its Subsidiaries' articles of incorporation, bylaws and other similar organizational documents with respect to indemnification,
advancement of expenses and exculpation of former or present directors and officers shall be substantially equivalent to the provisions contained in the Company's or such Subsidiaries' articles of
incorporation, bylaws and other similar organizational documents in effect as of the date hereof, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six (6) years after
the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any such individuals without the prior written consent of each such individual.

        (c)   Parent shall maintain, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain, at no expense to the beneficiaries, in effect for at least six (6) years from the Effective Time the current policies of
the directors' and officers' liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries (the "Existing Policies") (provided that Parent or the Surviving Corporation
may substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage, with deductibles substantially equivalent to those in the Existing Policies and containing terms and conditions and providing benefits that
are substantially equivalent to any beneficiary thereof) with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and from insurance carriers having at least an "A" rating by A.M.
Best with respect to directors' and officers' liability insurance. At the Company's option, the Company may purchase from insurance carriers with comparable credit ratings, no later than the Effective
Time, a six (6) year prepaid "tail policy" providing at least the same coverage and amounts, with deductibles substantially equivalent to those of the Existing Policies and containing terms and conditions
that are substantially equivalent to the insured than the Existing Policies maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred at or before the
Effective Time, including the transactions contemplated hereby, and from insurance carriers having at least an "A" rating by A.M. Best with respect to directors' and officers' liability insurance; provided
however that after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not be required to pay in the aggregate for such coverage under each such policy more than 250% of the last annual
premium paid by the Company prior to the date hereof in respect of the coverage required to be obtained pursuant hereto under each such policy, but in such case shall purchase as much coverage as
possible for such amount. In the event the Company elects to purchase such a "tail policy", the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) maintain such "tail
policy" in full force and effect for such six (6) year period. Parent agrees to cause the Surviving Corporation and each of its Subsidiaries to honor and perform under all indemnification agreements
entered into by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with any Indemnified Party prior to the date hereof.

        (d)   If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates, restructures, recapitalizes, merges with or into any other Person or otherwise reorganizes
and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation, restructuring, recapitalization, merger or other restructuring or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made by Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, so that the successors and assigns of Parent
or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this Section 6.11.

        (e)   The rights of the Indemnified Parties under this Section 6.11 shall be in addition to any rights such Indemnified Parties may have under the Articles of Incorporation or the Bylaws or the articles
of incorporation and bylaws or similar governing or constituent documents and instruments of any of its Subsidiaries, or under any applicable Contracts or Laws. Nothing in this Agreement is intended
to, shall be construed to or shall release, waive or impair any rights to directors' and officers' insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the

Company, its Subsidiaries or its or their directors, officers and employees, it being understood that the indemnification provided for in this Section 6.11 is not prior to, or in substitution for, any such
claims under any such policies.

        (f)    The provisions of this Section 6.11 shall survive the Merger and, following the Effective Time, are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties
and their heirs and representatives. The obligations of the Surviving Corporation under this Section 6.11 shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnified Party
to whom this Section 6.11 applies without the consent of the affected Indemnified Party (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) (it being expressly agreed that the
Indemnified Parties and their heirs and representatives to whom this Section 6.11 applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this Section 6.11).

        6.12    Financing.     

        (a)   Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable
to arrange, obtain and consummate the Financing not later than the date Closing is required to be effected in accordance with Section 2.2 on the terms and conditions described in or contemplated by the
Commitment Letters and any related fee letter (including complying with any request requiring the exercise of so-called "market flex" provisions in the fee letter) (or on other terms that, with respect to
conditionality, are not less favorable to Parent than the terms and conditions (including any "market flex" provisions) set forth in the Commitment Letters and any related fee letter so long as such other
terms would not (and would not reasonably be expected to) have any result, event or consequence described in any of clauses (A) through (D) of Section 6.12(d)), including using reasonable best efforts
to (i) maintain in full force and effect the Commitment Letters, (ii) negotiate and execute definitive agreements (which, with respect to the bridge facility documentation, shall not be required until
reasonably necessary in connection with the funding of the Debt Financing) with respect to the Debt Financing on the terms contained in the Debt Commitment Letter and any related fee letter (which
may reflect "market flex" provisions) (or on other terms that, with respect to conditionality, are no less favorable to Parent than the terms contained in the Debt Commitment Letter and any related fee
letter (including any "market flex" provisions applicable thereto) so long as such other terms would not (and would not reasonably be expected to) have any result, event or consequence described in
clauses (A) through (D) of Section 6.12(d)), in each case, which terms shall not in any respect expand on the conditions to the funding of the Financing at the Closing or reduce the aggregate amount of
the Financing below the amount required to satisfy the Financing Uses (after taking into account the amount of the Equity Financing and available cash of the Company and its Subsidiaries) unless the
Equity Financing is correspondingly increased (such definitive agreement, the "Definitive Financing Agreements") and (iii) satisfy and comply with on a timely basis (or, if deemed advisable by Parent,
seek the waiver of) all conditions and covenants applicable to Parent and Merger Sub in the Commitment Letters and such Definitive Financing Agreements that are within their control that are to be
satisfied by Parent or Merger Sub and to consummate the Financing at or prior to the Closing, which such reasonable best efforts shall include, for the avoidance of doubt, taking enforcement action
(including by instituting litigation in respect thereof) to cause the Debt Financing Sources and Persons committing to provide the Financing to comply with their obligations under the Commitment
Letters and the Definitive Financing Agreements and to cause the Debt Financing Sources and such Persons to fund such Financing at the Closing. Parent shall, upon the request of the Company, keep
the Company informed on a reasonably current basis in reasonable detail of any material developments concerning the status of its efforts to arrange the Debt Financing. Upon the request of the
Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly provide the Company with copies of any Definitive Financing Agreements and such other material

of banks, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or other similar entities who had not executed the Debt Commitment Letter as of the date of this Agreement.

        (b)   In the event any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions (including any "market flex" provisions applicable thereto) contemplated in the Debt
Commitment Letter and any related fee letter, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to, as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event, notify the Company and Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange to obtain alternative financing on terms and conditions
(including any "market flex" provisions) that are at least as favorable to Parent and Merger Sub as those contained in the Debt Commitment Letter and the related fee letter (including the "market flex"
provisions) from alternative sources in an amount sufficient, when added to the portion of the Financing that is and remains available and available cash of the Company and its Subsidiaries, to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to pay the amount required by the Financing Uses ("Alternative Financing") as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of
such event and to obtain and provide the Company with a copy of, the new financing commitment that provides for such Alternative Financing (the "Alternative Financing Commitment Letter"), which
Alternative Financing Commitment Letter will not (i) include terms and conditions (including any "market flex" provisions applicable thereto) that are less favorable to Parent or Merger Sub than those
contained in the Debt Commitment Letter (including any "market flex" provisions applicable thereto), (ii) involve any conditions to funding of the Debt Financing that are not contained in the Debt
Commitment Letter or (iii) reasonably be expected to prevent, impede or materially delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In furtherance of, and not in limitation
of, the foregoing, in the event that any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable, regardless of the reason therefor, but any bridge facilities contemplated by the Debt Financing (or alternative
bridge facilities obtained in accordance with this Section 6.12(b)) are available on the terms and conditions described in the Commitment Letter, then Parent shall to cause the proceeds of such bridge
financing to be used in lieu of such contemplated Debt Financing as promptly as practicable. As applicable, references in this Agreement (other than with respect to representations in this Agreement
made by Parent or Merger Sub that speak as of the date hereof) (i) to Financing or Debt Financing shall include Alternative Financing, (ii) to Commitment Letter or Debt Commitment Letter shall
include the Alternative Financing Commitment Letter and (iii) to Definitive Financing Agreements shall include the definitive documentation relating to any such Alternative Financing.

(i) termination, repudiation, rescission, cancellation or expiration of any Commitment Letter or Definitive Financing Agreement, (ii) any breach or default (or any event or circumstance that, with or

Commitment Letters or the Definitive Financing Agreements. As soon as reasonably practicable (and, in any event, within two (2) Business Days), Parent shall provide to the Company and its
Representatives any and all information reasonably requested by the Company relating to any of the circumstances referred to in this Section 6.12(c).

remedy under, (i) the Equity Commitment Letter (other than to increase the amount of Equity Financing available thereunder) without the prior written consent of the Company or (ii) the Debt
Commitment Letters, without the prior written consent of the Company, if such amendment, restatement, supplement, termination, modification or waiver would (A) impose new or additional conditions

add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities who had not executed such Debt Commitment Letter as of the date of this Agreement. Parent shall furnish to the Company
a copy of any amendment, restatement, replacement, supplement, modification, waiver or consent of or relating to the Commitment Letters or the Definitive Financing Agreements as promptly as
practicable upon execution thereof. Parent and Merger Sub shall use their reasonable best efforts to maintain the effectiveness of the Commitment Letters until the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement are consummated. For purposes of this Agreement (other than with respect to representations in this Agreement made by Parent or Merger Sub that speak as of the date hereof), (i) references
to the "Financing" will include the financing contemplated by the Commitment Letters as permitted by this Section 6.12 to be amended, restated, replaced, supplemented or otherwise modified or waived

        (e)   Notwithstanding any in this Section 6.12 to the contrary, compliance by Parent and Merger Sub with this Section 6.12 shall not relieve Parent or Merger Sub of its obligation to consummate the

referred herein as "Excluded Information").

        (b)   Notwithstanding anything in Section 6.13(a) to the contrary, (i) such requested cooperation shall not unreasonably disrupt or interfere with the business or the operations of the Company or its
Subsidiaries, (ii) nothing in this Section 6.13 shall require cooperation to the extent that it would (A) subject any of the Company's or its Subsidiaries' respective directors, managers, officers or
employees to any actual or potential personal liability (as opposed to liability in his or her capacity as an officer of such Person) with respect to matters related to the Debt Financing, (B) conflict with, or

that would subject it to actual or potential liability, to bear any cost or expense or to make any other payment or agree to provide any indemnity in connection with the Commitment Letters, the
Definitive Financing Agreements, the Financing or any information utilized in connection therewith, in each case, that would not be reimbursed or indemnified by Parent or Merger Sub or (B) deliver or

Subsidiaries or their respective directors, officers or employees shall be required to execute, deliver or enter into, or perform any agreement, document or instrument, including any Definitive Financing
Agreement, with respect to the Financing (other than customary representation letters and authorization letters referred to above) that is not contingent upon the Closing or that would be effective prior to
the Effective Time and the directors and managers of the Company's Subsidiaries shall not be required to adopt resolutions approving the agreements, documents and instruments pursuant to which the
Financing is obtained prior to the Effective Time unless Parent and Merger Sub shall have determined that such directors and managers are to remain as directors and managers of the Company's
Subsidiaries on and after the Effective Time and such resolutions are contingent upon the occurrence of, or only effective as of, the Effective Time and (vi) Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agree to
use their commercially reasonable efforts to maintain attorney-client privilege. The Parties agree that Parent's or Merger Sub's execution of an Alternative Financing Commitment Letter shall not
materially expand the scope of the assistance required under Section 6.13(a) as compared to the assistance that would be required or expected to be required in connection with the Debt Commitment
Letter in effect on the date of this Agreement and the related Debt Financing. The Company hereby consents to the use of its and its Subsidiary's logos in connection with the debt financing contemplated
by the Debt Commitment Letter; provided that such logos are used solely in a manner that is not intended to, nor reasonably likely to, harm or disparage the Company or the Company's Subsidiaries.

        (c)   The Company will use its reasonable best efforts, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to use its respective reasonable best efforts, to update any Required Financial Information provided to
Parent and the Debt Financing Sources as may be necessary so that such Required Financial Information (i) is Compliant, (ii) meets the applicable requirements set forth in the definition of "Required
Financial Information" and (iii) would not, after giving effect to such update(s), cause the Marketing Period to cease pursuant to the definition of "Marketing Period." For the avoidance of doubt, Parent
may, to most effectively access the financing markets, require the cooperation of the Company and its Subsidiaries under this Section 6.13 at any time, and from time to time and on multiple occasions,
between the date hereof and the Closing Date. The Company agrees to (i) file all reports on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q and, to the extent required to include financial information pursuant to Item 9.01
thereof, Form 8-K and (ii) use reasonable best efforts to file all other Forms 8-K, in each case, required to be filed with the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act prior to the Closing Date in accordance
with the time periods required by the Exchange Act. In addition, if, in connection with a marketing effort contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter, Parent reasonably requests the Company to file a
Current Report on Form 8-K pursuant to the Exchange Act that contains material non-public information with respect to the Company and its subsidiaries, which information Parent reasonably
determines (and the Company does not unreasonably object) to include in a customary offering memorandum or other marketing materials for the Debt Financing, then the Company shall file such
Current Report on Form 8-K.

        (d)   Parent shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless each of the Company, its Subsidiaries and their Affiliates and Representatives from and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages, claims,
costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments and penalties suffered or incurred by them in connection with their cooperation in arranging the Debt Financing and the performance of their respective
obligations under this Section 6.13 and the provision of any information utilized in connection therewith (other than information provided by the Company or its Subsidiaries), in each case, other than to
the extent any of the foregoing was suffered or incurred as a result of the bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct of, or material breach of this Agreement by, the Company and its Subsidiaries
or, in each case, their respective Representatives. Parent shall, promptly upon request of the Company, reimburse the Company and its Subsidiaries for all out-of-pocket fees, costs and expenses incurred
by the Company or its Subsidiaries (including those

of its Affiliates and Representatives) in connection with the cooperation required by this Section 6.13.

        6.14    Treatment of Company Indebtedness.     

        (a)    Prepayment of Indebtedness.    The Company shall use reasonable best efforts, and shall cause its applicable Subsidiaries to use reasonable best efforts, to deliver to Parent at least
two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date a copy of a payoff letter (subject to the delivery of funds as arranged by Parent) with respect to the Credit Facility (the "Subject Indebtedness") in
customary form, which payoff letter shall (i) indicate the total amount required to be paid to fully satisfy all principal, interest, prepayment premiums, penalties, breakage costs and any other monetary
obligations then due and payable under the Subject Indebtedness as of the anticipated Closing Date (and the daily accrual thereafter) (the "Payoff Amount"), (ii) state that upon receipt of the Payoff
Amount under such payoff letter, the Subject Indebtedness and all related loan documents shall be terminated and (iii) provide that all Liens and guarantees in connection with the Subject Indebtedness
relating to the assets and properties of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries securing the obligations under the Subject Indebtedness shall be released and terminated upon payment of the Payoff
Amount on the Closing Date. At Closing, the Surviving Corporation shall repay the outstanding amount of the Subject Indebtedness by wire transfer of immediately available funds as provided for in the
payoff letter.

        (b)    Senior Notes.    

          (i)  Parent will be permitted to commence and conduct, in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, one or more offers to purchase, including any "Change of Control Offer" (as such
term is defined in the Indenture) and/or any tender offer, or any exchange offer, and to conduct a consent solicitation, if any (each, a "Debt Offer" and collectively, the "Debt Offers"), with respect
to any or all of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes identified by Parent to the Company in writing prior to, on, or after the date hereof on terms that are acceptable to
Parent; provided that any such Debt Offer is consummated using funds provided by Parent. Parent shall not be permitted to commence any applicable Debt Offer until Parent shall have provided
the Company with the necessary offer to purchase, letter of transmittal or other related documents in connection with the Debt Offer (collectively, the "Debt Offer Documents") a reasonable
period of time in advance of commencing the applicable Debt Offer to allow the Company and its counsel to review and comment on the related Debt Offer Documents. Parent will reasonably
consult with the Company regarding the timing and commencement of any Debt Offer and any relevant tender or consent deadlines. The closing (or, if applicable, effectiveness) of the Debt
Offers shall be expressly conditioned on the occurrence of the Closing or the acceptance for purchase of the Senior Notes by Parent or Merger Sub, and the parties shall use reasonable best efforts
to cause the Debt Offers to close on the Closing Date; provided that the consummation of a Debt Offer with respect to the Senior Notes shall not be a condition to Closing. The Debt Offers shall
be conducted in compliance with the Indenture and applicable Law, including SEC rules and regulations, and the Company shall not be required to cooperate with respect to any Debt Offer that is
not in compliance with the Indenture and applicable Laws. The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives to, in each case, use their reasonable best
efforts to provide all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the Debt Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any applicable Law conflict with this Section 6.14, Parent
and the Company shall comply with the applicable Law and shall not be deemed to have breached their obligations under this Agreement by such compliance.

         (ii)  Subject to the receipt of any requisite consents, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall execute a supplemental indenture to the Indenture in accordance with the Indenture, amending
the terms and provisions of the Indenture as described in the Debt Offer Documents as reasonably requested by Parent, which supplemental indenture shall become operative no earlier than the
Effective Time or the acceptance for purchase of the Senior Notes by Parent or Merger Sub, and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the Trustee to enter into such supplemental indenture
prior to or substantially simultaneously with the Closing as determined by Parent; provided, however, that in no event shall the Company or any of its officers, directors or other Representatives
have any obligation to authorize, adopt or execute any amendments or other agreement that is not permitted under applicable Law or would become operative prior to the Effective Time or the
time of acceptance for purchase of the Senior Notes by Parent or Merger Sub. The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives to, in each case, use their
reasonable best efforts to provide all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the execution of supplemental indentures. If requested by Parent, the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause its legal counsel to provide all customary legal opinions required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Section 6.14 to the extent such legal
opinion is required to be delivered prior to the Effective Time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the Company or its legal counsel be required to give an opinion with respect to a
Debt Offer that in the opinion of the Company, its legal counsel or the Trustee does not comply with applicable Laws or the Indenture, or an opinion with respect to financing by Parent or Merger
Sub.

        (iii)  If requested by Parent, in lieu of or in addition to Parent commencing a Debt Offer for the Senior Notes, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts, to the extent permitted by the
Indenture, to (A) issue one or more notices of optional redemption for all or a portion of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes (which may be delivered at Parent's
request in advance of the Closing Date so long as they are contingent upon the occurrence of the Closing (it being understood and agreed that they may also be contingent upon the occurrence of
other events in addition to the Closing)), pursuant to the redemption provisions of the Indenture and (B) take any other actions reasonably requested by Parent to facilitate the satisfaction and
discharge of the Senior Notes pursuant to the satisfaction and discharge provisions of the Indenture and the other provisions of the Indenture applicable thereto; provided that prior to, or
substantially concurrently with, the Company being required under clause (A) above to issue any notice of redemption to be issued substantially simultaneously with the Effective Time, Parent
shall have, or shall have caused to be, deposited with the Trustee under the Indenture sufficient funds to effect such redemption and satisfaction and discharge. If a conditional notice of
redemption is given, Parent shall ensure that at the Effective Time, so long as the applicable conditions of such redemption are satisfied, the Company has all funds necessary in connection with
any such redemption and satisfaction and discharge. The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives to, in each case, use their reasonable best efforts to
provide all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent in connection with this Section 6.14.

        (iv)  Parent shall promptly, upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable outside
attorneys' fees) to the extent incurred by the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or the Trustee in connection with this Section 6.14. Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its
Subsidiaries and the Company Representatives from and against any and all losses suffered or incurred by them in connection with any action taken by them in connection with the performance
of their respective obligations under this Section 6.14 except to the extent suffered or incurred as a result of the bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct of, or

        6.15    Takeover Statutes.     If any "fair price," "moratorium," "business combination," "control share acquisition" or other form of anti-takeover statute or regulation (each, an "Anti-Takeover Statute") is or
may become applicable to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, each of the Company and Parent and the members of their respective Boards of Directors shall grant such
approvals and take all actions as are necessary so that such transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and
otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of any such Anti-Takeover Statute on such transactions. The Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, take any action that would, or would
reasonably be expected to, cause any Anti-Takeover Statute to become applicable to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby. Nothing in this Section 6.15 shall be construed to permit
Parent or Merger Sub to do any act that would constitute a violation or breach of, or as a waiver of any of the Company's rights under, any other provision of this Agreement.

        6.16    Transaction Litigation.     In the event that any stockholder litigation related to this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement is brought or threatened to be
brought against the Company or any members of its Board of Directors after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time (the "Transaction Litigation"), the Company shall promptly notify Parent
in writing of any such Transaction Litigation and shall keep Parent reasonably informed with respect to the status thereof, including by promptly informing Parent of all proceedings and correspondence relating
to such Transaction Litigation. The Company shall give Parent the opportunity to participate in the defense of any Transaction Litigation (and shall give due consideration to Parent's advice with respect to the
Transaction Litigation), and the Company shall not settle or agree to settle any Transaction Litigation without Parent's prior written consent.

        6.17    Parent Vote.     Immediately following the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Parent, in its capacity as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub, will execute and deliver to Merger Sub and the
Company a written consent approving the Merger in accordance with the NRS.

Commitment Letters and any Alternative Financing.

        6.19    Rule 16b-3.     Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall be permitted to take such steps as may be reasonably necessary or advisable hereto to cause any dispositions of Company equity
securities (including derivative securities) pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual (including any Person who is deemed to be a "director by deputization" under
applicable securities Laws) who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

        7.4    Frustration of Closing Conditions.    Neither the Company nor Parent may rely, either as a basis for not consummating the Merger or terminating this Agreement and abandoning the Merger, on the
failure of any condition set forth in Sections 7.1, 7.2 or 7.3, as the case may be, to be satisfied if such failure was primarily caused by such Party's breach in any material respect of any provision of this
Agreement.

        (a)   by mutual written consent of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company;

        (b)   by either Parent or the Company if the Effective Time shall not have occurred on or before 5:00 p.m. Dallas, Texas time on January 9, 2018 (as may be extended pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(ii),

of Parent, Merger Sub) or the failure of such Party (or, in the case of Parent, Merger Sub) to perform any of its obligations under this Agreement required to be performed at or prior to the Effective Time
has been the primary cause of the failure of the Effective Time to occur on or before the Outside Date and (ii) in the event the Marketing Period has commenced but has not completed as of the time of
the Outside Date, the Outside Date may be extended (or further extended following the initial Outside Date, but not more than the then remaining number of calendar days of the Marketing Period that

forth in Sections 7.2(a) or 7.2(b) not to be satisfied and, in either such case, such breach or failure is not curable or, if curable, is not cured prior to the earlier of (A) thirty (30) days after written
notice thereof is given by Parent to the Company, which written notice shall state in reasonable detail the nature of such breach, and the basis for such condition not being satisfied or (B) two
(2) Business Days prior to the Outside Date; provided that Parent shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(e)(i) if Parent or Merger Sub is then in material

Liability Amount and subject in all respects to the limitations set forth in Section 8.3(g). No valid termination of this Agreement will affect the rights or obligations of any Party pursuant to the

        (b)   In the event that:

          (i)  this Agreement is validly terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(d)(ii) or by Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(e)(ii), then the Company shall pay the Company Termination

practicable in the case of a termination pursuant to Section 8.1(e)(ii) (and, in any event, within two (2) Business Days following such termination), payable by wire transfer of immediately
available funds.

         (ii)  this Agreement is validly terminated by either Parent or the Company pursuant to Sections 8.1(b) or 8.1(f) or by Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(e)(i) and (A) at any time after the date of

Acquisition Proposal shall have otherwise become publicly known or announced and (B) within twelve (12) months after such termination, the Company shall have entered into a definitive

with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, by wire transfer of immediately available funds. For the purpose of this Section 8.3(b)(ii), all references in the definition of the term Acquisition
Proposal to "15% or more" will be deemed to be references to "more than 50%."

        (iii)  this Agreement is validly terminated (A) by Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(e)(i) or (B) by either the Company or Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(f), the Company shall pay to Parent (or

Company, an amount immediately available funds equal to that required to reimburse Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Affiliates for all fees and expenses incurred in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby up to $6,250,000 (the "Parent Expenses").

        (iv)  this Agreement is validly terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(d)(i) (and such material breach or material failure to perform by Parent or Merger Sub is the primary

to pay the Company Termination Payment or Parent be required to pay the Parent Termination Fee, as the case may be, on more than one occasion.

        (d)   Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 8.3 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, that the
damages resulting from the termination of this Agreement under circumstances where the Company Termination Payment, Parent Termination Fee or Parent Expenses is or are payable are uncertain and
incapable of accurate calculation and that, without these agreements, the Parties would not enter into this Agreement. If the Company fails to timely pay an amount due pursuant to Sections 8.3(b)(i),
8.3(b)(ii) or 8.3(b)(iii), or Parent fails to timely pay an amount due pursuant to Section 8.3(b)(iv), and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent or Merger Sub, on the one hand, or the Company, on the
other hand, commences a suit that results in a final non-appealable judgment against the Company for the amount set forth in Sections 8.3(b)(i), 8.3(b)(ii) or 8.3(b)(iii), or any portion thereof, or a final
non-appealable judgment against Parent for the amount set forth in Section 8.3(b)(iv), or any portion thereof, as the case may be, the Company shall pay to Parent or Merger Sub, on the one hand, or
Parent shall pay to the Company, on the other hand, its reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable and documented out-of-pocket outside attorneys' fees and the
fees and expenses of any expert or consultant engaged by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, as applicable) in connection with such suit in an amount not to exceed $2,500,000 (the "Expense Cap"),
together with interest on the amount of such payment from the date such payment was required to be made until the date of payment at the prime rate as published in The Wall Street Journal, Eastern
Edition in effect on the date of such payment. Any amount payable pursuant to this Section 8.3(d) shall be paid by the applicable Party by wire transfer of same day funds prior to or on the date such
payment is required to be made under this Section 8.3(d).

        (e)   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or any other Transaction Document or any other agreement referenced herein or therein or otherwise but subject to Section 10.13, in
any circumstance in which this Agreement is terminated and Parent is paid the Company Termination Payment from the Company pursuant to this Section 8.3, the Company Termination Payment, the
Parent Expenses and, if applicable, the costs and expenses of Parent pursuant to Section 8.3(d) (subject in all respects to the Expense Cap) shall, subject to Section 10.1, be the sole and exclusive remedy
of Parent Related Parties against the Company, its Subsidiaries and any of its or their respective former, current or future general or limited partners, stockholders, controlling Persons, managers,
members, directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, representatives, agents or any their respective assignees or successors or any former, current or future general or limited partner, stockholder,

damage suffered as a result of the failure of the Merger or any other transaction to be consummated or for a breach of, or failure to perform under, this Agreement, the other Transaction Documents or
any certificate, agreement or other document delivered in connection herewith, therewith or otherwise or in respect of any oral representation made or alleged to have been made in connection herewith
or therewith, and upon payment of such amounts, none of the Company Related Parties shall have any further liability or obligation (monetary or otherwise) relating to or arising out of this Agreement,

herewith, therewith or otherwise, whether in equity or at law, in contract, in tort or otherwise, except that notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 8.3(e) and/or payment of one or more of the

Documents or any certificate, agreement or other document delivered in connection herewith, therewith or in respect of representations made or alleged to be made in connection herewith, therewith or
otherwise, whether in equity or at law, in contract, in tort or otherwise, except that nothing shall relieve Parent of its obligations under Sections 6.5(b), 6.13(d) and 6.14(b)(iv); provided, that the Parties

and to prevent or cure breaches of this Agreement, including Sections 6.4 and 6.12, by Parent and/or Merger Sub and to cause Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby, including to effect the Closing in accordance with Section 2.2, on the terms and subject to the conditions in this Agreement. The pursuit of specific enforcement or other equitable remedies by
any Party hereto will not be deemed an election of remedies or waiver of the right to pursue any other right or remedy (whether at law or in equity) to which such Party may be entitled at any time.

        (b)   Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, but subject in all respects to this Section 10.1, it is hereby acknowledged and agreed that the Company shall be entitled to seek
specific performance to cause Parent and Merger Sub to cause the Equity Financing to be funded and to consummate the Closing if, but only if, (i) all of the conditions set forth in Section 7.1 and
Section 7.2 have been and continue to be satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, each of which is capable of being satisfied at the Closing),
(ii) the Debt Financing provided for by the Debt Commitment Letter has been funded or will be funded in full at the Closing if the Equity Financing is funded at the Closing, (iii) Parent and Merger Sub
are required to complete the Closing pursuant to Section 2.2 and Parent or Merger Sub fails to complete the Closing by the date the Closing is required to have occurred pursuant to Section 2.2 and
(iv) on or following the date referred to in clause (iii) above, the Company has irrevocably confirmed in a written notice to Parent that, if specific performance is granted and the Equity Financing and
Debt Financing are funded, then the Closing will occur, and Parent and Merger Sub fail to complete the Closing within two (2) Business Days after delivery of such irrevocable written confirmation;
provided, that the Company remains ready, willing and able to consummate the Closing during such two (2) Business Day period. In no event will the Company be entitled to enforce or seek to enforce
specifically Parent's obligation to cause the Equity Financing to be funded or to complete the Merger if the Debt Financing (i) will not be simultaneously funded with the Equity Financing or (ii) has not
been funded in full.

        (c)   Each of the Parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief as provided herein on the basis that (x) either Party has an
adequate remedy at law or (y) an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity. Any Party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall not be

shall be governed by the Laws of the State of Nevada (without giving effect to choice of law principles thereof).

        (b)   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 10.8, each party to this Agreement acknowledges and irrevocably agrees (i) that any legal action, whether at law or in equity,
whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against any Debt Financing Sources Related Party arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Debt Commitment Letter or the performance thereunder
shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York, or, if under applicable Law exclusive jurisdiction is vested in Federal courts, the United
States District Court for the Southern District of New York (and appellate courts thereof), (ii) that, except to the extent relating to the interpretation of any provisions in this Agreement, the

Agreement, any claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above-named courts for any reason other than the failure to serve process in accordance with this Section 10.9, that it or its
property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in
aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise), and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, that the suit, action or proceeding in any such court is brought in an inconvenient
forum, that the venue of such suit, action or proceeding is improper, or that this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof or thereof, may not be enforced in or by such courts and further irrevocably
waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, the benefit of any defense that would hinder, fetter or delay the levy, execution or collection of any amount to which the Party is entitled
pursuant to the final judgment of any court having jurisdiction. Each Party expressly acknowledges that the foregoing waiver is intended to be irrevocable under the Laws of the State of Delaware and of
the United States of America; provided that each such Party's consent to jurisdiction and service contained in this Section 10.9 is solely for the purpose referred

performance thereof, in any forum other than a court of competent jurisdiction sitting in the Borough of Manhattan of the City of New York, whether a state or federal court, that the provisions of
Section 10.10 relating to the waiver of jury trial shall apply to any such action, suit or proceeding and that, except to the extent relating to the interpretation of any provisions in this Agreement, the
Confidentiality Agreement, the Equity Commitment Letter and/or the Parent Guarantee, any such action, suit or proceeding shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the Laws of the State
of New York. Parent irrevocably designates the Corporation Trust Company as its agent and attorney-in-fact for the acceptance of service of process and making an appearance on its behalf in any such
claim or proceeding and for the taking of all such acts as may be necessary, proper or advisable in order to confer jurisdiction over it, and Parent stipulates that such consent and appointment are

        The purpose of the Corporation is to engage in any lawful act or activity for which corporations may be organized under Chapter 78 (the "NGCL") of the Nevada Revised Statutes (the "NRS") as it now
exists or may hereafter be amended and/or supplemented from time to time.

        The total number of shares of all classes of stock that the Corporation is authorized to issue is one thousand (1,000) shares of capital stock, all of which shall be common stock with a par value of one cent

laws of the State of Nevada at the time in force may be added or inserted in the manner and at the time prescribed by said laws, and all rights at any time conferred upon the stockholders of the Corporation by
this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation are granted subject to this reservation.

capacities in which any of them serves at the request of the Corporation. In addition to any other rights of indemnification permitted by the laws of the State of Nevada or as may be provided for by the
Corporation in the Bylaws or by agreement, the expenses of directors and officers incurred in defending a civil or criminal action, suit or proceeding, involving alleged acts or omissions of such director or
officer in his or her capacity as a director or officer of the Corporation, must be paid, by the Corporation or through insurance purchased and maintained by the Corporation or through other financial
arrangements made by the Corporation, as they are incurred and in advance of the final disposition of the action, suit or proceeding, upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the director or officer to
repay the amount if it is ultimately determined by a court of competent jurisdiction that he or she is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation.

        The liability of directors and officers of the Corporation shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent permitted by the NRS. If the NRS are amended to further eliminate or limit or authorize corporate
action to further eliminate or limit the liability of directors or officers, the liability of directors and officers of the Corporation shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent permitted by the NRS, as so
amended from time to time.

of a director or officer of the Corporation existing as of the time of such repeal or modification. In the event of any conflict between the first two paragraphs of this Article and any other provision of this
Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the terms and provisions of such paragraphs (as applicable) shall control.

ARTICLE IX 

        Meetings of stockholders may be held within or without the State of Nevada, as the Bylaws may provide. Any action required or permitted to be taken at any annual or special meeting of the stockholders
may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, if a consent or consents in writing, setting forth the action so taken, shall be signed by the holders of outstanding Common Stock having
not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares of Common Stock entitled to vote thereon were present and voted, and shall
be delivered to the Corporation.

        The books of the Corporation may be kept (subject to any provision contained in the NGCL) within or outside of the State of Nevada at such place or places as may be designated from time to time by the
Board or in the Bylaws.

ARTICLE X 

        Neither any contract or other transaction between the Corporation and any other corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, firm, association, or other entity (an "Entity"), nor any
other acts of the Corporation with relation to any other Entity will, in the absence of fraud, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, in any way be invalidated or otherwise affected by the fact that any
one or more of the directors or officers of the Corporation are pecuniary or otherwise interested in, or are directors, officers, partners, or members of, such other Entity (such directors, officers, and Entities, each
a "Related Person"). Any Related Person may be a party to, or may be pecuniary or otherwise interested in, any contract or transaction of the Corporation; provided, however, that the fact that person is a
Related Person or is pecuniary or otherwise interested in such contract or transaction is disclosed or is known to the Board or a majority of directors present at any meeting of the Board at which action upon any
such contract or transaction is taken. Any director of the Corporation who is also a Related Person or who is pecuniary or otherwise interested in such contract or transaction may be counted in determining the
existence of a quorum at any meeting of the Board

during which any such contract or transaction is authorized and may vote thereat to authorize any such contract or transaction, with like force and effect as if such person were not a Related Person or were not
pecuniary or otherwise interested in such contract or transaction. Any director of the Corporation may vote upon any contract or any other transaction between the Corporation and any subsidiary or affiliated
Entity without regard to the fact that such person is also a director, officer, manager, general partner or other fiduciary of such subsidiary or affiliated Entity.

        Any contract, transaction or act of the Corporation or of the directors of the Corporation that is ratified at any annual meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation, or at any special meeting of the
stockholders of the Corporation called for such purpose, will, insofar as permitted by applicable law, be as valid and as binding as though ratified by every stockholder of the Corporation; provided, however,
that any failure of the stockholders to approve or ratify any such contract, transaction or act, when and if submitted, will not be deemed in any way to invalidate the same or deprive the Corporation, its directors,
officers or employees, of its or their right to proceed with such contract, transaction or act.

        Subject to any express agreement that may from time to time be in effect, (x) any director or officer of the Corporation who is also an officer, director, partner, employee, managing director or other affiliate
of either Apollo Management VIII, L.P., on behalf of its investment funds ("Apollo"), or any of its respective affiliates (collectively, the "Managers") and (y) the Managers and their affiliates, may, and shall

similar lines of business as the Corporation, (ii) do business with any client, customer, vendor or lessor of any of the Corporation or its affiliates, and (iii) make investments in any kind of property in which the
Corporation may make investments. To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Corporation hereby renounces any interest or expectancy of the Corporation to participate in any business of the Managers or their
affiliates, and waives any claim against a Covered Manager Person and shall indemnify a Covered Manager Person against any claim that such Covered Manager Person is liable to the Corporation or its
stockholders for breach of any fiduciary duty solely by reason of such person's or entity's participation in any such business.

        In the event that a Covered Manager Person acquires knowledge of a potential transaction or matter which may constitute a corporate opportunity for both (x) the Covered Manager Person, in his or her
Apollo-related capacity, as the case may be, or Apollo or its affiliates, as the case may be, and (y) the Corporation, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the Covered Manager Person shall not have any duty to
offer or communicate information regarding such corporate opportunity to the Corporation. To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Corporation hereby renounces any interest or expectancy of the Corporation
in such corporate opportunity and waives any claim against each Covered Manager Person and shall indemnify a Covered Manager Person against any claim that such Covered Manager Person is liable to the
Corporation or its stockholders for breach of any fiduciary duty solely by reason of the fact that such Covered Manager Person (i) pursues or acquires any corporate opportunity for its own account or the
account of any affiliate, (ii) directs, recommends, sells, assigns or otherwise transfers such corporate opportunity to another person or (iii) does not communicate information regarding such corporate
opportunity to the Corporation.

        Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring or holding any interest in any shares of capital stock of the Corporation shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to the provisions of

        This Article X may not be amended, modified or repealed without the prior written consent of each of the Managers.

        In the event of a conflict between this Article X and any other Article or provision of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, this Article X shall prevail under all circumstances.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, under no circumstances shall any employee of the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries be deemed to be a "Covered Manager Person", and under no
circumstances shall the Corporation waive or renounce any interest or expectancy of the Corporation in, or in being offered any opportunity to participate in, any business opportunities that are presented to any
Manager who is also an employee of the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries, irrespective of whether such employee is a director or officer of the Corporation of any of its affiliates.

ARTICLE XI 

        Unless the Corporation consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Second Judicial District Court of the State of Nevada shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and
exclusive forum for (a) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Corporation, (b) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer, stockholder,
employee or agent of the Corporation to the Corporation or the Corporation's stockholders, (c) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the NGCL or (d) any action asserting a claim
governed by the internal affairs doctrine. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring or holding any interest in shares of capital stock of the Corporation shall be deemed to have notice of and
consented to the provisions of this Article XI.

ARTICLE II 

Stockholders 

        Section 1.    Place of Meetings.     All meetings of stockholders shall be held at the principal office of the Corporation or at such other place, if any, within or without the State of Nevada, or by means of
remote communication, as may be designated by the Board of Directors and stated in the notice of the meeting.

        Section 2.    Annual Meetings.     An annual meeting of stockholders for the election of directors and the transaction of such other business as may properly come before the meeting shall be held on such
day and at such hour, as shall be fixed by the Board of Directors and designated in the notice of the meeting. At each annual meeting, the stockholders entitled to vote shall elect a Board of Directors and may
transact such other corporate business as may properly be brought before the meeting.

        Section 3.    Special Meetings.     A special meeting of the stockholders (or of any class thereof) for any purpose or purposes may be called at any time by the Chairman of the Board, if any, the President or
by order of the Board of Directors and shall be called by the President or the Secretary upon the written request therefor delivered to the President or Secretary signed by stockholders holding of record more

Secretary of the Corporation a written request that notices intended for such stockholder be directed to another address, in which case such notice shall be directed to such stockholder at the address designated
in such request. Notices of each meeting of stockholders, whether annual or special, shall set forth the date, time, place, if any, the means of remote communications, if any, by which stockholders or proxy
holders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such meeting, the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote at such meeting (if such date is different from the record date for
stockholders entitled to notice of the meeting). Notices of each special meeting of stockholders shall also set forth the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called. In lieu of written notice, notice may be
given by electronic transmission if permitted by applicable law and if given in compliance therewith. If electronically transmitted by means of facsimile telecommunication or electronic mail, then notice is
deemed given when transmitted and directed to a facsimile number or electronic mail address, as the case may be, at which the stockholder has consented to receive notice. If mailed, notice shall be deemed to
be given when deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, directed to the stockholder in the manner set forth herein. An affidavit of the Secretary or of the transfer agent or other agent of the
Corporation that the notice has been given shall, in the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein.

        Section 5.    List of Stockholders.     The Secretary or any Assistant Secretary of the Corporation shall produce, at least ten (10) days before every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders
entitled to vote thereat (provided, however, if the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote is less than ten (10) days before the date of the meeting, the list shall reflect the stockholders
entitled to vote as of the tenth day before the meeting date), arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the address of each stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of such stockholder.
Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting for a period of at least ten (10) days prior to the meeting, either on a reasonably accessible electronic
network as permitted by law (provided that the information required to gain access to the list is provided with the notice of the meeting) or during ordinary business hours at the principal place of business of the
Corporation. If the meeting is to be held at a place, such list shall be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof and may be examined by any stockholder who is
present. If the meeting is to be held solely by means of remote communication, then the list shall also be open to the examination of any stockholder during the whole time of the meeting on a reasonably
accessible electronic network (provided that the information required to access such list shall be provided with the notice of the meeting). Except as otherwise provided by law, the original or duplicate stock
ledger shall be the only evidence as to the stockholders entitled to examine such list or to vote in person or by proxy at such meeting.

        Section 6.    Quorum; Adjournment of Meetings.     Except as otherwise provided by law, the Articles of Incorporation or these Amended & Restated Bylaws of the Corporation ("Bylaws"), the presence in
person or by proxy of the holders of a majority in voting power of the outstanding shares of stock entitled to vote at the meeting shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at all meetings of the
stockholders. The stockholders present at a duly called or held meeting at which a quorum is present may continue to do business until adjournment notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough stockholders to
leave less than a quorum. If less than a quorum shall be present or represented at the time for which the meeting shall have been called, the stockholders so present in person or by proxy at such meeting may, by
a majority in voting power thereof, adjourn the meeting from time to time without any notice or call other than by an announcement at the meeting of the time and place of the adjourned meeting, until a quorum
shall attend. Any meeting or adjournment thereof at which a quorum is present may also be adjourned in like manner without notice or call or upon such notice or call as may be determined by vote of the
holders of a majority in voting power voting thereon. If, however, the adjournment is for more than 30 days, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at such
meeting. If after the adjournment a new record date for determination of stockholders entitled to vote is fixed for the adjourned meeting, the Board of

Directors shall fix as the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of such adjourned meeting the same or an earlier date as that fixed for determination of stockholders entitled to vote at the
adjourned meeting, and shall give notice of the adjourned meeting to each stockholder of record as of the record date so fixed for notice of such adjourned meeting. At any adjourned meeting at which a quorum
shall be present, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted if the meeting had been held as originally called.

        Section 7.    Voting.     Except as otherwise provided in the Articles of Incorporation, at every meeting of stockholders, each holder of record of the issued and outstanding stock of the Corporation entitled
to vote at such meeting shall be entitled to one vote in person or by proxy for each such share of stock having voting power upon the matter in question held by such stockholder. Each stockholder entitled to
vote at a meeting of stockholders or to express consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting may authorize another person or persons to act for such stockholder by proxy, but no proxy shall be voted
after three years from its date unless the proxy provides for a longer period. A duly executed proxy shall be irrevocable if it states that it is irrevocable and if, and only as long as, it is coupled with an interest
sufficient in law to support an irrevocable power. A proxy may remain irrevocable regardless of whether the interest with which it is coupled is an interest in the stock itself or an interest in the Corporation
generally. Shares of its own capital stock belonging to the Corporation directly or indirectly shall not be voted directly or indirectly; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not limit the right of the
Corporation to vote any shares of the Corporation's stock held by it in a fiduciary capacity (and to count such shares for purposes of determining a quorum). Except as otherwise required by the laws of the State
of Nevada or the Articles of Incorporation, and except for the election of directors, at all meetings of the stockholders, a quorum being present, all matters shall be decided by the affirmative vote of the holders
of a majority in voting power of the shares of stock entitled to vote thereon which are present in person or by proxy. Directors shall be elected by plurality of the votes cast at a meeting for the election of
directors at which a quorum is present. Unless demanded by a stockholder of the Corporation present in person or by proxy at any meeting of the stockholders and entitled to vote thereat before the meeting
begins, or so directed by the person presiding at the meeting or required by the laws of the State of Nevada, the election of directors of the Corporation or the vote on any other question presented at the meeting
need not be by ballot. On any vote by ballot, each ballot shall be signed by the stockholder voting, or in such stockholder's name by such stockholder's proxy, if there be such a proxy, and shall state the number
of shares voted by such stockholder and the number of votes to which each share is entitled.

        Section 8.    Organization of Meeting.     The Chairman of the Board, if any, shall preside at all meetings of stockholders, or in his or her absence, the Vice Chairman of the Board, if any, shall preside, or in
his or her absence, the President of the Corporation shall preside. If neither the Chairman of the Board, the Vice Chairman of the Board or the President is present at the meeting, the holders of a majority of the
shares present at the meeting and entitled to vote, in person or by proxy, shall select a person to preside at the meeting. Subject to the requirements of any applicable law or the rules and regulations of any
national securities exchange, national securities association or interdealer quotation system upon which the Corporation's securities may be listed, the person presiding at a meeting of stockholders shall
determine the order of business and the procedure at the meeting, including, without limitation, the regulation of the manner of voting and the conduct of any discussion, as he or she believes to be in order. The
Secretary of the Corporation shall act as secretary of all meetings of stockholders, or in his or her absence, any Assistant Secretary of the Corporation who is present shall act as secretary of the meeting, or if no
Assistant Secretary shall be present, the person presiding at such meeting shall appoint a secretary for that particular meeting.

        Section 9.    Action Without a Meeting.     Unless otherwise restricted by the Articles of Incorporation, any action required or permitted to be taken at any annual or special meeting of the stockholders may
be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, if a consent or

corporate action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted and shall be delivered to the Corporation in accordance with applicable law. Prompt notice of the taking of the
corporate action without a meeting by less than unanimous consent shall be given to those stockholders who have not consented in writing. In the event that the action which is consented to is such as would
have required the filing of a certificate with any governmental body, if such action had been voted on by stockholders at a meeting thereof, the certificate filed shall state, in lieu of any statement required by law
concerning any vote of stockholders, that consent had been given in accordance with the provisions of subsection 78.320 of Chapter 78 (the "NGCL") of the Nevada Revised Statutes (the "NRS"). Without
limiting the manner by which consent may be given, written consent may be given by means of electronic transmission in the manner prescribed by Chapter 719 of the Nevada Revised Statutes.

        Section 10.    Ratification of Acts of Directors and Officers.     Except as otherwise provided by law or by the Articles of Incorporation, any transaction or contract or act of the Corporation or of the
directors or the officers of the Corporation may be ratified by the affirmative vote of the holders of the number of shares which would have been necessary to approve such transaction, contract or act at a
meeting of stockholders, or by the written consent of stockholders in lieu of a meeting.

Board of Directors 

        Section 1.    General Powers.     The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed by or under the direction of the Board of Directors, except as may be otherwise provided by the NGCL or the
Articles of Incorporation.

        Section 2.    Number of Directors; Term of Office.     The Board of Directors shall consist of three members but may be increased or decreased as hereinafter provided. Each director shall hold office until
the annual meeting of the stockholders next following his or her election and until his or her successor shall have been elected and shall qualify, or until his or her death, resignation or removal from office. At
any time or from time to time at a special meeting called for that purpose, the Board of Directors, by the vote of a majority of the entire Board, may increase the number of directors of the Corporation, or may
decrease the number of directors of the Corporation; provided, however, that in no event shall the number of directors of the Corporation be less than one. Directors shall be elected at the annual meeting of
stockholders. Directors need not be stockholders or residents of the State of Nevada. Except as otherwise provided in these Bylaws, elections of directors need not be by written ballot.

        Section 3.    Quorum; Manner of Acting; Telephonic Participation.     Unless otherwise provided by law, the presence of a majority of the entire Board of Directors shall be necessary to constitute a quorum
for the transaction of business. In the absence of a quorum, the directors present shall adjourn the meeting from time to time until a quorum shall be present. Notice of any adjourned meeting need not be given.
At all meetings of the directors, a quorum being present, all matters shall be decided by the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors present, except as otherwise required by the laws of the State of Nevada
or the Articles of Incorporation. All or any one or more directors may participate in a meeting of the Board of Directors or of any committee thereof by means of conference telephone or similar communications
equipment by means of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other and participation in a meeting pursuant to such communications equipment shall constitute presence in person at such
meeting. The minutes of any meeting of the Board of Directors or of any committee thereof held by telephone shall be prepared in the same manner as a meeting of the Board of Directors or of such committee
held in person.

        Section 5.    Annual Meeting.     As promptly as practicable after each annual meeting of the stockholders for the election of directors, the Board of Directors shall meet for the purpose of the appointment of

meeting may be held at any other time or place as shall be specified in a notice given as hereinafter provided for special meetings of the Board of Directors or in a waiver of notice thereof signed by all the
directors.

        Section 6.    Regular Meetings.     Regular meetings of the Board of Directors may be held at such time and place, within or without the State of Nevada, as shall from time to time be determined by the
Board of Directors. After there has been such determination, and notice thereof has been given to each member of the Board of Directors, regular meetings may be held without further notice being given.

        Section 7.    Special Meetings and Notice Thereof.     Special meetings of the Board of Directors shall be held whenever called by the Chairman of the Board, if any, the Vice Chairman of the Board, if any,
the President or by a majority of the directors. Notice of the time, date and place of each such meeting shall be mailed to each director, addressed to him or her at his or her residence or usual place of business,
at least four days before the date on which the meeting is to be held, or shall be given to him or her by telegram, telex, mailgram, facsimile transmission, electronic mail or other means of electronic
transmission, or be delivered personally or by telephone, not later than the day before the day on which such meeting is to be held. Such notice shall state the time and place of the meeting, but need not state the
purposes thereof. In lieu of the notice to be given as set forth above, a waiver thereof in writing, signed by the director or directors entitled to said notice, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be
deemed equivalent thereto for purposes of this Section 7. If mailed, such notice shall be deemed to be delivered when deposited in the United States mail so addressed, with first-class postage thereon prepaid. If
sent by any other means (including facsimile, courier, electronic mail or express mail, etc.), such notice shall be deemed to be delivered when actually delivered to the home or business address, electronic
address or facsimile number of the director. Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the person attends a meeting for the express purpose of
objecting, and objects at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. The person or persons authorized to call special meetings of the
Board of Directors may fix any place, either within or without the State of Nevada, as the place for holding any special meeting of the Board of Directors called by them.

        Section 8.    Removal.     Except as otherwise provided by the Articles of Incorporation or applicable law, the entire Board of Directors or any individual director may be removed from office with or
without cause by the holders of 2/3 of the voting power of the outstanding stock entitled to vote at an election of directors. In case the Board of Directors or any one or more directors be so removed, one or
more individuals may be appointed at the same meeting at which such director or directors have been so removed to fill the vacancy or vacancies created thereby, to serve for the remainder of the terms,
respectively, of the director or directors so removed.

        Section 9.    Resignation.     Any director of the Corporation may resign at any time by giving written notice thereof to the Chairman of the Board, if any, the Vice Chairman of the Board, if any, the
President or the Secretary of the Corporation. The resignation of any director shall take effect upon receipt of notice thereof or at such later time as shall be specified in such notice; and, unless otherwise
specified therein, the acceptance of such resignation shall not be necessary to make it effective.

        Section 10.    Vacancies on Board of Directors.     If any vacancy occurs in the Board of Directors caused by the death, resignation, retirement, disqualification or removal from office of any director or
otherwise, or any new directorship is created by any increase in the authorized number of directors, a majority of the directors then in office, though less than a quorum, may fill the vacancy or newly created
directorship, as the case may be, or such vacancy or newly created directorship may be filled at an annual meeting or at a special meeting of the stockholders called for that purpose. Each director so elected
shall hold office until the next annual meeting of stockholders and until his or her successor shall be elected and shall be qualified or until his or her death, resignation or removal from office.

        Section 11    Waiver of Notice and Consent.     The transactions of any meeting of the Board of Directors, however called and noticed or wherever held, shall be as valid as though such meeting had been
duly held after a regular call and notice, if a quorum be present and if, before or after the meeting, each of the directors not present signs or electronically transmits a written waiver of notice of such meeting
whether before or after the date stated therein. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or special meeting of directors or members of a committee of directors need be specified in
any written waiver of notice. All such waivers shall be filed with the corporate records or made a part of the minutes of the meeting.

        Section 12.    Committees.     The Board of Directors may, by resolution of the Board of Directors, designate one or more committees, each committee to consist of one or more directors of the Corporation,
which, to the extent provided in the resolution or in these Bylaws, shall have and may exercise such powers of the Board of Directors in the management of the business and affairs of the Corporation, as the
Board of Directors may by resolution determine and specify in the respective resolutions appointing them, subject to such restrictions as may be contained in the Articles of Incorporation or the laws of the State
of Nevada. Such committee or committees shall have such name or names as may be determined from time to time by resolutions adopted by the Board of Directors. The committees shall keep regular minutes
of their proceedings and report the same to the Board of Directors when required. A majority of all the members of any such committee may fix its rules of procedure, determine its action and fix the time and
place, whether within or without the State of Nevada, of its meetings and specify what notice thereof, if any, shall be given, unless the Board of Directors shall otherwise by resolution provide. The Board of
Directors shall have the power to change the membership of any such committee at any time, to fill vacancies thereon and to discharge any such committee, either with or without cause, at any time. Each
member of any such committee shall be paid such fee, if any, as shall be fixed by the Board of Directors for each meeting of such committee which he or she shall attend and for his or her expenses, if any, of
attendance at each regular or special meeting of such committee as shall be determined by the Board of Directors.

        Section 13.    Action Without Meeting.     Any action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the Board of Directors or of any committee thereof may be taken without a meeting if all members
of the Board of Directors or of such committee, as the case may be, consent thereto in writing, or by electronic transmission and the writing or writings or electronic transmission or transmissions are filed with
the minutes of proceedings of the Board of Directors, or committee.

        Section 14.    Fees and Compensation.     Unless otherwise restricted by the Articles of Incorporation or these Bylaws, the Board of Directors may, if it so desires, authorize members of the Board of
Directors to be compensated for their expenses, if any, of attendance at each regular or special meeting of the Board of Directors. Such compensation may, in the Board of Directors' discretion, also include a
fixed sum for each meeting and an annual fee for serving as a director, such as may be allowed by resolution of the Board of Directors. Directors who are officers or employees of the Corporation may receive, if
the Board of Directors desires, fees for serving as directors. Nothing herein contained shall be construed to preclude any director from serving the Corporation in any other capacity and receiving compensation
therefor.

ARTICLE V 

Capital Stock 

        Section 1.    Certificates of Shares.     The shares of the Corporation shall be represented by certificates, provided that the Board of Directors may provide by resolution or resolutions that some or all of any
or all classes or series of its stock shall be uncertificated shares. Any such resolution shall not apply to shares represented by a certificate until such certificate is surrendered to the Corporation. Notwithstanding
the adoption of such a resolution by the Board of Directors, every holder of stock represented by certificates shall be entitled to have a certificate signed by, or in the name of the Corporation by the Chairman or
Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors, or the President or Vice President, and by the Treasurer or an Assistant Treasurer, or the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of the Corporation representing the number
of shares registered in certificate form; provided, however, that, where any such certificate is signed (a) by a transfer agent or an assistant transfer agent, or (b) by a transfer clerk acting on behalf of the
Corporation and a registrar, if the Board of Directors shall by resolution so authorize, the signature of such Chairman of the Board, President, Vice President, Treasurer, Secretary, Assistant Treasurer or
Assistant Secretary may be facsimiles thereof. In case any officer or officers of the Corporation who shall have signed, or whose facsimile signature or signatures shall have been used on, any such certificate
shall cease to be such officer or officers, whether by reason of death, resignation or otherwise, before such certificate shall have been delivered by the Corporation, such certificate may nevertheless be adopted
by the Corporation and be issued and delivered as though the person or persons who signed such certificate, or whose facsimile signature or signatures shall have been affixed thereto, had not ceased to be such
officer or officers.

        Section 2.    Stock Ledger.     A record shall be kept by the Secretary, transfer agent or by any other officer, employee or agent designated by the Board of Directors of the name of the person, firm or
corporation holding the stock represented by such certificate, the number of shares represented by such certificate, and the date of issuance thereof, and in case of cancellation, the date of cancellation.

        Section 3.    Cancellation.     Every certificate surrendered to the Corporation for exchange or transfer shall be cancelled, and no new certificate or certificates shall be issued in exchange for any existing
certificate until such existing certificate shall have been so cancelled, except in cases provided for in Section 6 of this Article V.

authorized by power of attorney duly executed and filed with the Secretary of the Corporation or with a transfer clerk or a transfer agent appointed as provided in Section 5 of this Article V, and on surrender of
the certificate or certificates, if any, for such shares properly endorsed and the payment of all taxes thereon. The person in whose name shares of stock stand on the books of the Corporation shall be deemed the
owner thereof for all purposes as regards the Corporation; provided, however, that whenever any transfer of shares shall be made for collateral security, and not absolutely, such fact, if known to the Secretary of
the Corporation, shall be so expressed in the entry of transfer.

        Section 5.    Regulations.     The Board of Directors may make such rules and regulations as it may deem expedient, not inconsistent with the Articles of Incorporation or these Bylaws, concerning the

or more registrars, and may require all certificates of stock to bear the signature or signatures of any of them.

        Section 6.    Lost, Stolen, Mutilated or Destroyed Certificates.     As a condition to the issue of a new certificate or uncertificated shares of stock in the place of any certificate theretofore issued and alleged
to have been lost, stolen, mutilated or destroyed, the Board of Directors, in its discretion, may require the owner of any such certificate, or his legal representatives, to give the Corporation a bond in such sum
and in such form as it may direct or to otherwise indemnify the Corporation against any claim that may be made against it on account of the alleged loss, theft, mutilation or destruction of any such certificate or
the issuance of such new certificate or uncertificated shares. Proper evidence of such loss, theft, mutilation or destruction shall be procured for the Board of Directors, if required. The Board of Directors, in its
discretion, may authorize the issuance of such new certificate or uncertificated shares without any bond when in its judgment it is proper to do so.

        Section 7.    Record Date.     

        (a)   In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to notice of any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record
date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors, and which record date shall, unless otherwise required by law, not be more than sixty
(60) nor less than ten (10) days before the date of such meeting. If the Board of Directors so fixes a date, such date shall also be the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote at such meeting
unless the Board of Directors determines, at the time it fixes such record date, that a later date on or before the date of the meeting shall be the date for making such determination. If no record date is fixed by
the Board of Directors, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice
is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held. A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of
stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the Board of Directors may fix a new record date for determination of stockholders entitled to vote at the adjourned meeting,
and in such case shall also fix as the record date for stockholders entitled to notice of such adjourned meeting the same or an earlier date as that fixed for determination of stockholders entitled to vote in
accordance herewith at the adjourned meeting.

        (b)   In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of
any change, conversion or exchange of stock or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution
fixing the record date is adopted, and which record date shall not be more than sixty (60) days prior to such action. If no such record date is fixed, the record date for determining stockholders for any such
purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution relating thereto.

        (c)   Unless otherwise restricted by the Articles of Incorporation, in order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to express consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting,
the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors, and which record date shall not
be more than ten (10) days after the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors. If no record date for determining stockholders entitled to express consent to
corporate action in writing without a meeting is fixed by the Board of

Amendments 

        Section 1.    Amendments by Stockholders.     These Bylaws may be altered, amended or repealed and new Bylaws may be added by the stockholders at any annual meeting of the stockholders or at any
special meeting thereof if notice of the proposed alteration, amendment, repeal or addition be contained in the notice of such special meeting, by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority in voting power
of the stock entitled to vote thereon.

        Section 2.    Amendments by the Board of Directors.     The Board of Directors may adopt, amend or repeal these Bylaws by the affirmative vote of the Board of Directors at any regular or special meeting
of the Board of Directors. If the power to adopt, amend or repeal Bylaws is conferred upon the Board of Directors by the Articles of Incorporation it shall not divest or limit the power of the stockholders to

Miscellaneous Provisions 

        Section 1.    Fiscal Year.     The fiscal year of the Corporation shall be fixed by resolution of the Board of Directors.

        Section 3.    Dividends; Reserves.     

        (a)   Subject to any restrictions contained in the Articles of Incorporation or applicable law, the Board of Directors may declare and pay dividends upon the shares of the Corporation's capital stock from the
Corporation's surplus, or if there be none, out of its net profits for the current fiscal year and/or the preceding fiscal year. Dividends may be paid in cash, in property or in shares of capital stock of the
Corporation, subject to the provisions of the Articles of Incorporation. Upon the declaration of any dividend on fully paid shares, the Corporation shall declare a dividend upon partly paid shares of the same
class, but only upon the basis of the percentage of the consideration actually paid thereon. Dividends shall be payable upon such dates as the Board of Directors may designate.

        (b)   If the dividend is to be paid in shares of the theretofore unissued capital stock of the Corporation, the Board of Directors shall, by resolution, direct that there be designated as capital in respect of such
shares an amount which is not less than the aggregate par value of par value shares being declared as a dividend and, in the case of shares without par value being declared as a dividend, such amount as shall be
determined by the Board of Directors; provided, however, that no such designation as capital shall be necessary if shares are being distributed by the Corporation pursuant to a split-up or division of its stock.

        (c)   The Board of Directors may set apart out of the funds of the Corporation available for dividends a reserve or reserves for any proper purpose and may abolish any such reserve.

ARTICLE VIII 

Indemnification 

        Section 1.    Indemnification of Directors and Officers.     

        (a)   For purposes of this Article, (A) "Indemnitee" shall mean each director or officer who was or is a party to, or is threatened to be made a party to, or is otherwise involved in, any Proceeding (as
hereinafter defined), by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director, officer, employee or agent (including, without limitation, as a trustee, fiduciary, administrator or manager) of the Corporation or any
predecessor entity thereof, or is or was serving in any capacity at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent (including, without limitation, as a trustee, fiduciary, administrator,
partner, member, manager) of, or in any other capacity for, another corporation or any partnership, joint venture, limited liability company, trust, or other enterprise; and (B) "Proceeding" shall mean any
threatened, pending, or completed action, suit or proceeding (including, without limitation, an action, suit or proceeding by or in the right of the Corporation), whether civil, criminal, administrative, or
investigative.

        (b)   Each Indemnitee shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Corporation to the fullest extent permitted by the laws of the State of Nevada, against all expense, liability and loss (including, without
limitation, attorneys' fees, judgments, fines, taxes, penalties, and amounts paid or to be paid in settlement) reasonably incurred or suffered by the Indemnitee in connection with any Proceeding; provided that
such Indemnitee either is not liable pursuant to NRS 78.138 or acted in good faith and in a manner such Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation and, with
respect to any Proceeding that is criminal in nature, had no reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct was unlawful. The termination of any Proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction or
upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, does not, of itself, create a presumption that the Indemnitee is liable pursuant to NRS 78.138 or did not act in good faith and in a manner in which he or she
reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, or that, with respect to any criminal proceeding he or she had reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct was
unlawful. The Corporation shall not indemnify an Indemnitee for any claim, issue or matter as to which the Indemnitee has been adjudged by a court of competent jurisdiction, after exhaustion of all appeals
therefrom, to be liable to the Corporation or for any amounts paid in settlement to the Corporation, unless and only to the extent that the court in which the Proceeding was brought or other court of competent
jurisdiction determines upon application that in view of all the circumstances of the case, the Indemnitee is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such amounts as the court deems proper. Except as so
ordered by a court and for advancement of expenses pursuant to this Section, indemnification may not be made to or on behalf of an Indemnitee if a final adjudication establishes that his or her acts or omissions
involved intentional misconduct, fraud or a knowing violation of law and was material to the cause of action. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in these Bylaws, no director or officer may be
indemnified for expenses incurred in defending any threatened, pending, or completed action, suit or proceeding (including without limitation, an action, suit or proceeding by or in the right of the Corporation),
whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, that such director or officer incurred in his or her capacity as a stockholder.

        (c)   Indemnification pursuant to this Section shall continue as to an Indemnitee who has ceased to be a director or officer of the Corporation or member, manager or managing member of a predecessor

or any partnership, joint venture, limited liability company, trust, or other enterprise and shall inure to the benefit of his or her heirs, executors and administrators.

        (d)   The expenses of Indemnitees must be paid by the Corporation or through insurance purchased and maintained by the Corporation or through other financial arrangements made by the Corporation, as
such expenses are incurred and in advance of the final disposition of the Proceeding, upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such Indemnitee to repay the amount if it is ultimately determined by a
court of competent jurisdiction that he or she is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation. To the extent that an Indemnitee is successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any Proceeding, or in the
defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, the Corporation shall indemnify him or her against expenses, including attorneys' fees, actually and reasonably incurred in by him or her in connection with the
defense.

        Section 2.    Indemnification of Employees and Other Persons.     The Corporation may, by action of its Board of Directors and to the extent provided in such action, indemnify employees and other persons
as though they were Indemnitees.

        Section 3.    Non-Exclusivity of Rights.     The rights to indemnification provided in this Article shall not be exclusive of any other rights that any person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute,
provision of the Articles of Incorporation or these Bylaws, agreement, vote of stockholders or directors, or otherwise.

        Section 4.    Insurance.     The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance or make other financial arrangements on behalf of any Indemnitee for any liability asserted against him or her and liability
and expenses incurred by him or her in his or her capacity as a director, officer, employee, member, managing member or agent, or arising out of his or her status as such, whether or not the Corporation has the
authority to indemnify him or her against such liability and expenses.

        Section 5.    Other Financial Arrangements.     The other financial arrangements which may be made by the Corporation may include the following (i) the creation of a trust fund; (ii) the establishment of a
program of self-insurance; (iii) the securing of its obligation of indemnification by granting a security interest or other lien on any assets of the Corporation; and (iv) the establishment of a letter of credit,
guarantee or surety. No financial arrangement made pursuant to this subsection may provide protection for a person adjudged by a court of competent jurisdiction, after exhaustion of all appeals therefrom, to be
liable for intentional misconduct, fraud, or a knowing violation of law, except with respect to advancement of expenses or indemnification ordered by a court.

        Section 6.    Other Matters Relating to Insurance or Financial Arrangements.     Any insurance or other financial arrangement made on behalf of a person pursuant to this Section may be provided by the
Corporation or any other person approved by the Board of Directors, even if all or part of the other person's stock or other securities is owned by the Corporation. In the absence of fraud, (i) the decision of the
Board of Directors as to the propriety of the terms and conditions of any insurance or other financial arrangement made pursuant to this Section and the choice of the person to provide the insurance or other
financial arrangement is conclusive; and (ii) the insurance or other financial arrangement is not void or voidable and does not subject any director approving it to personal liability for his action; even if a
director approving the insurance or other financial arrangement is a beneficiary of the insurance or other financial arrangement.

        Section 7.    Amendments.     The provisions of this Article VIII relating to indemnification shall constitute a contract between the Corporation and each of its directors and officers which may be modified
as to any director or officer only with that person's consent or as specifically provided in this Section. Notwithstanding any other provision of these Bylaws relating to their amendment generally,

indemnification with respect to any action or failure to act occurring prior to the time of such repeal or amendment. Notwithstanding any other provision of these Bylaws (including, without limitation,
Article VI), no repeal or amendment of these Bylaws shall affect any or all of this Article VIII so as to limit or reduce the indemnification in any manner unless adopted by (i) the unanimous vote of the directors
of the Corporation then serving, or (ii) by the stockholders as set forth in Article VI; provided that no such amendment shall have a retroactive effect inconsistent with the preceding sentence.

        Section 8.    Saving Clause.     In the case of any change to relevant law which expands the liability of directors or officers of the Corporation or limits the indemnification rights or the rights to
advancement of expenses which the Corporation may provide in this Article VIII, the rights to limited liability, to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses provided in the Articles of Incorporation
and/or these Bylaws shall continue as theretofore to the extent permitted by law; and (ii) if such change permits the Corporation, without the requirement of any further action by stockholders or directors, to
limit further the liability of directors or limit the liability of officers or to provide broader indemnification rights or rights to the advancement of expenses than the Corporation was permitted to provide prior to
such change, then liability thereupon shall be so limited and the rights to indemnification and the advancement of expenses shall be so broadened to the extent permitted by law.

ANNEX B 

Opinion of Jefferies LLC 

July 9, 2017

The Board of Directors
ClubCorp Holdings, Inc.
3030 LBJ Freeway, Suite 600
Dallas, Texas 75234

The Board of Directors:

        We understand that ClubCorp Holdings, Inc., a Nevada corporation ("ClubCorp"), Constellation Club Parent, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Constellation") and affiliate of Apollo Global
Management, LLC ("Apollo"), and Constellation Merger Sub Inc., a Nevada corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Constellation ("Merger Sub"), propose to enter into an Agreement and Plan of Merger
(the "Merger Agreement") pursuant to which (i) Merger Sub will be merged with and into ClubCorp (the "Merger") and (ii) each outstanding share of the common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of ClubCorp
("ClubCorp Common Stock") will be converted into the right to receive $17.12 in cash (the "Per Share Merger Consideration"). The terms and conditions of the Merger are more fully set forth in the Merger
Agreement.

        You have asked for our opinion as to whether the Per Share Merger Consideration to be received by holders of ClubCorp Common Stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement is fair, from a financial point of
view, to such holders.

        In arriving at our opinion, we have, among other things:

(i) reviewed an execution copy of the Merger Agreement provided to us on July 9, 2017; 

(ii) reviewed certain publicly available financial and other information regarding ClubCorp; 

(iii) reviewed certain information furnished to us by the management of ClubCorp relating to the businesses, operations and prospects of ClubCorp, including financial forecasts and estimates prepared or
provided by the management of ClubCorp; 

(iv) held discussions with members of the senior management of ClubCorp concerning the matters described in clauses (ii) and (iii) above; 

(v) at the direction of ClubCorp, held discussions on behalf of ClubCorp with selected third parties to solicit indications of interest in the possible acquisition of all or a portion of, or a strategic investment
in, ClubCorp; 

(vi) reviewed the stock trading price history and implied trading multiples for ClubCorp and compared them with those of certain publicly traded companies that we deemed relevant in evaluating ClubCorp; 

(vii) compared the financial terms of the Merger with publicly available financial terms of certain other transactions that we deemed relevant in evaluating the Merger; and 

(viii) conducted such other financial studies, analyses and investigations as we deemed appropriate.

        In our review and analysis and in rendering this opinion, we have assumed and relied upon, but have not assumed any responsibility to independently investigate or verify, the accuracy and completeness of
all financial and other information that was supplied or otherwise made available by ClubCorp or that was

publicly available to us (including, without limitation, the information described above) or otherwise reviewed by us. We have relied on assurances of the management and other representatives of ClubCorp that
they are not aware of any facts or circumstances that would make such information incomplete, inaccurate or misleading. In our review, we did not obtain any independent evaluation or appraisal of any of the
assets or liabilities (contingent, derivative, off-balance sheet or otherwise), nor did we conduct a physical inspection of any of the properties or facilities, of ClubCorp or any other entity, and we have not been
furnished with, and assume no responsibility to obtain, any such evaluations, appraisals or physical inspections. We are not experts in the evaluation of, and express no view or opinion with respect to, any
matters related to tax audits or assessments, initiation deposits and/or escheatment of unclaimed or abandoned property or the adequacy or sufficiency of allowances for losses or other matters with respect
thereto.

        With respect to the financial forecasts and estimates (including estimates as to potential net operating loss carryforwards of ClubCorp on a standalone basis) provided to and reviewed by us, we note that
projecting future results of any company is inherently subject to uncertainty. However, we have been advised, and we have assumed, that the financial forecasts and estimates relating to ClubCorp that we have
been directed to utilize in our analyses were reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and good faith judgments of the management of ClubCorp as to the future financial
performance of ClubCorp and the other matters covered thereby. We express no opinion as to any such financial forecasts or estimates or the assumptions on which they are based. We have relied upon the
assessments of the management of ClubCorp as to, among other things, (i) the potential impact on ClubCorp of certain market, competitive, seasonal and other trends in and prospects for the leisure industry,
including the golf, country club and business club sectors thereof and in the geographic regions in which ClubCorp operates, (ii) membership dues and initiation fees, including matters relating to the timing,
amounts and likelihood of initiation deposit refunds and/or related state escheatment claims, proceedings or investigations, (iii) planned or contemplated acquisitions, investments and alliances of ClubCorp,
including the timing, amounts and related funding, and capital expenditures associated with ClubCorp's existing properties, and (iv) existing and future relationships, agreements and arrangements with, and the
ability to attract and retain, key employees, club members and joint ventures and other commercial relationships of ClubCorp. We have assumed that there will not be any developments with respect to any such
matters that would be meaningful in any respect to our analyses or opinion.

        Our opinion is based on economic, monetary, regulatory, market and other conditions existing and which can be evaluated as of the date hereof. We expressly disclaim any undertaking or obligation to
advise any person of any change in any fact or matter affecting our opinion of which we become aware after the date hereof.

        We have made no independent investigation of any legal, regulatory, accounting or tax matters affecting ClubCorp or the Merger and we have assumed the correctness in all respects meaningful to our
analyses and opinion of all legal, regulatory, accounting and tax advice given to ClubCorp and/or the Board of Directors of ClubCorp (the "Board"), including, without limitation, advice as to legal, regulatory,
accounting and tax consequences to ClubCorp and its stockholders of the terms of, and transactions contemplated by, the Merger Agreement and related documents. In addition, in preparing this opinion, we
have not taken into account any tax or other consequences of the Merger to, or individual circumstances of, any holder of ClubCorp Common Stock. We have assumed that the Merger will be consummated in
accordance with its terms without waiver, modification or amendment of any material term, condition or agreement and in compliance with all applicable laws, documents and other requirements and that, in the
course of obtaining the necessary governmental, regulatory or third party approvals, consents, waivers and

releases for the Merger, including with respect to any divestiture or other requirements, no delay, limitation, restriction or condition will be imposed or occur that would have an adverse effect on ClubCorp or
the Merger or that otherwise would be meaningful in any respect to our analyses or opinion. We also have assumed that the final Merger Agreement, when signed by the parties thereto, will be substantially
similar to the execution copy reviewed by us.

        It is understood that our opinion is for the use and benefit of the Board (in its capacity as such) in its evaluation of the Per Share Merger Consideration from a financial point of view. Our opinion does not
address the relative merits of the Merger contemplated by the Merger Agreement as compared to any alternative transaction or opportunity that might be available to ClubCorp, nor does it address the
underlying business decision by ClubCorp to engage in the Merger or the terms of the Merger Agreement or the documents referred to therein, including the form or structure of the Merger or any term, aspect
or implication of any guarantee, financing or other arrangements, agreements or understandings entered into in connection with, or contemplated by or resulting from, the Merger or otherwise. Our opinion does
not constitute a recommendation as to how any stockholder should vote or act with respect to the Merger or any other matter. In addition, no opinion or view is expressed with respect to, and this opinion does
not address the relative fairness of, any consideration to holders of any class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of ClubCorp, other than the holders of ClubCorp Common Stock (other than as
specified below) to the extent expressly specified herein. We express no opinion as to the prices at which shares of ClubCorp Common Stock or any other securities of ClubCorp may trade or otherwise be
transferable at any time. Furthermore, we do not express any view or opinion as to the fairness, financial or otherwise, of the amount or nature of any compensation or other consideration payable to or to be
received by any officers, directors or employees, or any class of such persons, in connection with the Merger relative to the Per Share Merger Consideration or otherwise. The issuance of our opinion has been
authorized by the Fairness Committee of Jefferies LLC.

        We have been engaged by ClubCorp to act as financial advisor to the Board in connection with the Merger and will receive a fee for our services, a portion of which is payable upon delivery of this opinion
and the principal portion of which is contingent upon consummation of the Merger. We also are entitled to be reimbursed for expenses incurred in connection with our engagement. In addition, ClubCorp has
agreed to indemnify us against liabilities arising out of or in connection with the services rendered and to be rendered by us under such engagement.

        As you are aware, we and our affiliates in the past have provided and in the future may provide financial advisory and financing services unrelated to the Merger to ClubCorp, Apollo and certain of their
respective affiliates and/or portfolio companies, as the case may be, for which services we and our affiliates have received and would expect to receive compensation, including, during the past two years, having
acted as (i) in the case of ClubCorp and its affiliates, joint lead bookrunning manager for a secondary offering of ClubCorp Common Stock, and (ii) in the case of Apollo and certain of its affiliates and/or
portfolio companies, (a) financial advisor to Apollo in connection with an acquisition and financial advisor to a portfolio company of Apollo in connection with a private placement of equity and debt securities,
(b) dealer manager in connection with a consent solicitation for a portfolio company of Apollo, (c) joint bookrunning manager for certain senior secured and senior unsecured note offerings for certain portfolio
companies of Apollo, and (d) sole lead or joint lead arranger for, and as a lender under, various credit facilities for Apollo and certain of its portfolio companies. In addition, in the ordinary course of business,
we and our affiliates may trade or hold securities of ClubCorp, Apollo and certain of their respective affiliates and/or portfolio companies, as the case may be, for our own account and for the accounts of our
customers and, accordingly, may at any time hold long or short positions in those securities.

Opinion of Wells Fargo Securities, LLC 

July 9, 2017

The Board of Directors
ClubCorp Holdings, Inc.
3030 LBJ Freeway, Suite 600
Dallas, Texas 75234

The Board of Directors:

The Board of Directors (the "Board") of ClubCorp Holdings, Inc., a Nevada corporation ("ClubCorp"), has asked Wells Fargo Securities, LLC ("Wells Fargo Securities") to advise it with respect to the fairness,
from a financial point of view, to holders of shares of the common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of ClubCorp ("ClubCorp Common Stock") of the Per Share Merger Consideration (defined below) provided
for pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement") to be entered into among Constellation Club Parent, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Constellation") and affiliate of Apollo Global
Management, LLC ("Apollo"), Constellation Merger Sub Inc., a Nevada corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Constellation ("Merger Sub"), and ClubCorp. The Merger Agreement provides for, among
other things, the merger of Merger Sub with and into ClubCorp (the "Merger"), with ClubCorp as the surviving entity, pursuant to which each outstanding share of ClubCorp Common Stock will be converted
into the right to receive $17.12 in cash (the "Per Share Merger Consideration"). The terms and conditions of the Merger are more fully set forth in the Merger Agreement.

In arriving at our opinion, we have, among other things:

• Reviewed an execution copy, provided to us on July 9, 2017, of the Merger Agreement, including the financial terms thereof; 

• Reviewed certain publicly available business, financial and other information regarding ClubCorp, including information set forth in its annual reports on Form 10-K for the fiscal years ended
December 27, 2014, December 27, 2015 and December 27, 2016 and quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2017;

ClubCorp to solicit, at the direction of ClubCorp, indications of interest and definitive proposals from third parties regarding a possible acquisition of all or a portion of, or a strategic investment
in, ClubCorp; 

• Reviewed reported prices and trading activity for ClubCorp Common Stock; 

• Compared certain financial data of ClubCorp with similar data of certain publicly traded companies that we deemed relevant in evaluating ClubCorp;

• Compared the proposed financial terms of the Merger with financial terms of certain business combinations and other transactions that we deemed relevant in evaluating the Merger; 

• Analyzed the estimated present value of the future cash flows per share of ClubCorp based upon the financial forecasts and estimates referred to above and related assumptions discussed with
and confirmed as reasonable by the management of ClubCorp; and 

• Considered such other information, such as financial studies and analyses, as well as financial, economic and market criteria, and made such other inquiries, as we deemed relevant.

In connection with our review, we have assumed and relied upon the accuracy and completeness of the financial and other information provided, discussed with or otherwise made available to us, including all
accounting, tax, regulatory and legal information, and we have not made (and have not assumed any responsibility for) any independent verification of such information. We have relied upon assurances of the
management and other representatives of ClubCorp that they are not aware of any facts or circumstances that would make such information inaccurate or misleading. With respect to the financial forecasts,
estimates (including estimates as to potential net operating loss carryforwards of ClubCorp on a standalone basis) and other information relating to ClubCorp that we have been directed to utilize in our analyses,
we have been advised by the management of ClubCorp and we have assumed that they have been reasonably prepared and reflect the best currently available estimates, judgments and assumptions of the
management of ClubCorp as to the future financial performance of ClubCorp and the other matters covered thereby. We assume no responsibility for, and express no view as to, any forecasts, estimates or other
information utilized in our analyses or the judgments or assumptions upon which they are based. We also have assumed that there have been no meaningful changes in the condition (financial or otherwise),
results of operations, businesses or prospects of ClubCorp since the date of the most recent financial statements and other information provided to us. We have relied, with the consent of ClubCorp, upon the
assessments of the management of ClubCorp as to, among other things, (i) the potential impact on ClubCorp of certain market, competitive, seasonal and other trends in and prospects for the leisure industry,
including the golf, country club and business club sectors thereof and in the geographic regions in which ClubCorp operates, (ii) membership dues and initiation fees, including matters relating to the timing,
amounts and likelihood of initiation deposit refunds and/or related state escheatment claims, proceedings or investigations, (iii) planned or contemplated acquisitions, investments and alliances of ClubCorp,
including the timing, amounts and related funding, and capital expenditures associated with ClubCorp's existing properties, and (iv) existing and future relationships, agreements and arrangements with, and the
ability to attract and retain, key employees, club members and joint ventures and other commercial relationships of ClubCorp. We have assumed, with ClubCorp's consent, that there will be no developments
with respect to any such matters that would be meaningful in any respect to our analyses or opinion.

In arriving at our opinion, we have not conducted physical inspections of the properties or assets of ClubCorp or any other entity, nor have we made or been provided with any evaluations or appraisals of the
properties, assets or liabilities (contingent, derivative, off-balance sheet or otherwise) of ClubCorp or any other entity. We are not experts in the evaluation of, and express no view or opinion with respect to, any
matters related to tax audits or assessments, initiation deposits and/or escheatment of unclaimed or abandoned property or the adequacy or sufficiency of allowances for losses or other matters with respect
thereto.

In rendering our opinion, we have assumed, at the direction of ClubCorp, that the final form of the Merger Agreement, when signed by the parties thereto, will not differ from the execution copy Merger
Agreement reviewed by us in any respect meaningful to our analyses or opinion, that the Merger will be consummated in accordance with the terms described in the Merger Agreement and related documents
and in compliance with all applicable laws, documents and other requirements without amendment or waiver of any material terms or conditions and that, in the course of obtaining any necessary governmental,
regulatory or third party consents, approvals or agreements for the Merger, no delay, limitation or restriction, including any divestiture or other requirements, will be imposed or occur or action will be taken that
will be meaningful in any respect to our analyses or opinion.

Our opinion is necessarily based on economic, market, financial and other conditions existing, and information made available to us, as of the date hereof. Although subsequent developments may affect the
matters set forth in this opinion, we do not have any obligation to update, revise, reaffirm or withdraw this opinion or otherwise comment on or consider any such events occurring or coming to our attention
after the date hereof.

Our opinion only addresses the fairness, from a financial point of view and as of the date hereof, of the Per Share Merger Consideration to be received by holders of ClubCorp Common Stock (other than as
specified below) to the extent expressly specified herein, without regard to individual circumstances of specific holders that may distinguish such holders or the securities of ClubCorp held by such holders, and
no opinion or view is expressed as to the relative fairness or otherwise of any consideration or other amounts payable to other securityholders or constituents or in respect of any other securities of ClubCorp.
Our opinion does not address any other terms, aspects or implications of the Merger, including, without limitation, the form or structure of the Merger or any terms, aspects or implications of any guarantee,
financing or other arrangements, agreements or understandings entered into in connection with or contemplated by the Merger or otherwise. In addition, our opinion does not address the fairness of the amount
or nature of, or any other aspects relating to, any compensation to be received by any officers, directors or employees of any parties to the Merger or any related entities, or class of such persons, relative to the
Per Share Merger Consideration or otherwise. Our opinion also does not address the merits of the underlying decision by ClubCorp to enter into the Merger Agreement or the relative merits of the Merger
compared with other business strategies or transactions available or that have been or might be considered by ClubCorp or the Board or in which ClubCorp might engage. We also are not expressing any opinion
or view with respect to, and have relied upon the assessments of representatives of ClubCorp regarding, accounting, tax, regulatory, legal or similar matters as to which we understand that ClubCorp obtained
such advice as it deemed necessary from qualified professionals.

The issuance of this opinion was approved by an authorized committee of Wells Fargo Securities. Wells Fargo Securities is the trade name for certain capital markets and investment banking services of Wells
Fargo & Company and its subsidiaries, including Wells Fargo Securities, LLC. Wells Fargo Securities has been engaged to act as financial advisor to ClubCorp in connection with the Merger and will receive a
fee for such services, a portion of which will be payable upon delivery of this opinion and the principal portion of which is contingent upon consummation of the Merger. ClubCorp also has agreed to reimburse
certain of Wells Fargo Securities' expenses and to indemnify us and certain related parties against certain liabilities that may arise out of our engagement. In addition, as you are aware, our affiliate, Wells Fargo

Apollo and certain of their respective affiliates and/or portfolio companies, as the case may be, for our and our affiliates' own account and for the accounts of customers and, accordingly, may at any time hold a
long or short position in such securities or financial instruments.

It is understood that this opinion is for the information and use of the Board (in its capacity as such) in connection with its evaluation of the Merger. Our opinion does not constitute a recommendation to the
Board or any other person or entity in respect of the Merger, including as to how any shareholder should vote or act in connection with the Merger or any other matters.
