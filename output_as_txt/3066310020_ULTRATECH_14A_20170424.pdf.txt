MERGER PROPOSAL—YOUR VOTE IS VERY IMPORTANT

Dear Ultratech Stockholders:

        On February 2, 2017, Veeco Instruments Inc. ("Veeco") and Ultratech, Inc. and ("Ultratech") entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of February 2, 2017
(the "merger agreement") that provides for the acquisition of Ultratech by Veeco. Under the terms of the merger agreement, a subsidiary of Veeco will merge with and into
Ultratech, with Ultratech surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Veeco (the "merger").

        If the merger is completed, you will be entitled to receive, in exchange for each share of Ultratech common stock held by you at the effective time (as defined below) of the
merger, (1) $21.75 in cash without interest, (2) 0.2675 of a share of Veeco common stock, subject to the conditions and restrictions set forth in the merger agreement and (3) cash
in lieu of fractional shares of Veeco common stock as contemplated by the merger agreement, subject to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement. The implied value of
the stock portion of the merger consideration will fluctuate as the market price of Veeco common stock fluctuates. You should obtain current stock price quotations for Ultratech
common stock and Veeco common stock before deciding how to vote with respect to the adoption of the merger agreement.

        Based on the number of shares of Ultratech common stock outstanding as of April 17, 2017, and the number of shares of Veeco common stock outstanding as of April 17,
2017, it is expected that, immediately after completion of the merger, former Ultratech stockholders will own approximately 15% of the outstanding shares of Veeco common
stock. The shares of Veeco common stock are traded, and following the merger will continue to be traded, on The NASDAQ Stock Market under the symbol "VECO."

        Ultratech will hold a special meeting of its stockholders to vote on matters related to the proposed merger. The special meeting will be held on May 25, 2017, at 2:00 p.m.,
local time, at the offices of O'Melveny & Myers LLP, located at 2765 Sand Hill Road, Menlo Park, California 94025. At the special meeting, Ultratech stockholders will be asked
to adopt the merger agreement. In addition, Ultratech stockholders will be asked to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation payments that will or may be
made to Ultratech's named executive officers in connection with the merger and to approve the adjournment of the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit
additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to adopt the merger agreement.

        The Ultratech board unanimously recommends that Ultratech stockholders vote:

1. "FOR" the adoption of the merger agreement; 

2. "FOR" the approval, on a non-binding, advisory basis, of the compensation payments that will or may be made to Ultratech's named executive officers in
connection with the merger; and 

3, "FOR" the adjournment of the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes at the time of the special
meeting to adopt the merger agreement.

        Your vote is important. We cannot complete the merger without the adoption of the merger agreement by Ultratech stockholders. It is important that your shares be
represented and voted regardless of the size of your holdings. A failure to vote will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the adoption of the merger agreement.
Whether or not you plan to attend the special meeting, we urge you to submit a proxy to have your shares voted in advance of the special meeting by using one of the
methods described in the accompanying proxy statement/prospectus.

        The accompanying proxy statement/prospectus provides important information regarding the special meeting and a detailed description of the merger agreement,
the merger and the matters to be presented at the special meeting. We urge you to read the accompanying proxy statement/prospectus carefully and in its entirety,
including the section entitled "Risk Factors" beginning on page 38 of the accompanying proxy statement/prospectus.

        We look forward to seeing you at the special meeting and thank you for your continued support of, and interest in, Ultratech.

Sincerely,

Arthur W. Zafiropoulo
Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer

April 24, 2017

Table of Contents

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS 

        The following are some questions that you, as a stockholder of Ultratech, Inc. ("Ultratech") may have regarding the merger and the other matters being considered at the
special meeting and the answers to those questions. Veeco Instruments Inc. ("Veeco") and Ultratech urge you to carefully read the remainder of this proxy statement/prospectus
because the information in this section does not provide all the information that might be important to you with respect to the merger and the other matters being considered at
the special meeting. Additional important information is also contained in the Annexes to, and the documents incorporated by reference into, this proxy statement/prospectus.

General Questions and Answers about the Merger 

Q: What is the proposed transaction on which I am being asked to vote? 

A: You are being asked to vote to adopt the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of February 2, 2017 (the "merger agreement"), entered into by and among Veeco,
Ulysses Acquisition Subsidiary Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of Veeco ("Merger Subsidiary"), and Ultratech. A copy of the merger agreement is included as Annex A
to this proxy statement/prospectus. Pursuant to the merger agreement, Merger Subsidiary will merge with and into Ultratech, with Ultratech surviving the merger as a
wholly owned subsidiary of Veeco (the "merger").

The merger cannot be completed unless, among other things, holders of a majority of the shares of the outstanding Ultratech common stock as of the record date (as
defined below) for the special meeting of Ultratech stockholders (the "special meeting") vote to adopt the merger agreement. See the section entitled "The Merger
Agreement—Conditions to Closing" beginning on page 119 of this proxy statement/prospectus for more information.

Ultratech stockholders will also be asked to approve the Adjournment Proposal and the Compensation Proposal, both as defined below in the section entitled "—What are
the proposals on which the Ultratech stockholders are being asked to vote?"

Q: Why am I receiving this proxy statement/prospectus? 

A: This proxy statement/prospectus contains important information about the merger and the other proposals being voted on at the special meeting, and you should read it
carefully. It is a proxy statement because the Ultratech Board of Directors (the "Ultratech board") is soliciting proxies from its stockholders. It is a prospectus because
Veeco will issue shares of Veeco common stock to Ultratech's stockholders in connection with the merger. The enclosed materials allow you to have your shares voted by
proxy without attending the special meeting in person. Your vote is important. We encourage you to submit your proxy as soon as possible. 

Q: What will Ultratech stockholders receive for their shares of Ultratech common stock in the merger? 

A: If the merger is completed, Ultratech stockholders will be entitled to receive, in exchange for each share of Ultratech common stock they hold at the effective time (as
defined below) of the merger, (1) $21.75 in cash without interest (the "cash consideration"), (2) 0.2675 shares of Veeco common stock, subject to the conditions and
restrictions set forth in the merger agreement (the "stock consideration" and, together with the cash consideration, the "merger consideration"), and (3) cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Veeco common stock as contemplated by the merger agreement, subject to adjustment in certain cases as described in the merger agreement. See the
section entitled "The Merger Agreement—The Merger" beginning on page 100 of this proxy statement/prospectus.

Table of Contents

Q: What is the value of the merger consideration? 

A: The value of the cash consideration is fixed at $21.75. However, the value of the stock consideration will fluctuate as the market price of Veeco common stock fluctuates
before the completion of the merger. This price at closing will not be known at the time of the special meeting and may be more or less than the current price of Veeco
common stock or the price of Veeco common stock at the time of the special meeting. Based on the closing stock price of Veeco common stock on Nasdaq on February 1,
2017, the last trading day before the public announcement of the execution of the merger agreement, of $25.75, the value of the stock consideration was $6.89. Based on
the closing stock price of Veeco common stock on Nasdaq on April 21, 2017, the latest practicable date before the mailing of this proxy statement/prospectus, of $31.00,
the value of the stock consideration was $8.29. We urge you to obtain current market quotations for shares of Veeco common stock and Ultratech common stock. See the
sections entitled "The Merger Agreement—The Merger" beginning on page 100 of this proxy statement/prospectus. 

Q: When will I receive the merger consideration to which I am entitled? 

A: After the merger is completed, when you properly complete and return the letter of transmittal and any other documents reasonably required by the exchange agent, you
will receive the merger consideration and any fractional share cash amount into which the shares have been converted. More information may be found under the section
entitled "The Merger Agreement—Exchange Agent; Letter of Transmittal" beginning on page 103 of this proxy statement/prospectus. 

Q: Does my vote matter? 

A: Yes. The merger cannot be completed unless the merger agreement is approved by the Ultratech stockholders. If you fail to submit a proxy or vote in person at the special
meeting, or vote to abstain, or you do not provide your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee with voting instructions, as applicable, this will have the same effect as a
vote "against" the approval of the merger agreement. The Ultratech board unanimously recommends that stockholders vote "FOR" the proposal to adopt the merger
agreement. 

Q: After the Merger, how much of Veeco will Ultratech stockholders own? 

A: Based on the number of shares of Ultratech common stock outstanding as of April 17, 2017, and the number of shares of Veeco common stock outstanding as of April 17,
2017, it is expected that, immediately after completion of the merger, former Ultratech stockholders will own approximately 15% of the outstanding shares of Veeco
common stock. 

Q: Will Ultratech stockholders be able to trade the shares of Veeco common stock that they receive in the transaction? 

A: Yes. Shares of Veeco common stock are listed on Nasdaq under the symbol "VECO". Shares of Veeco common stock received in exchange for shares of Ultratech
common stock in the merger will be freely transferable under U.S. federal securities laws. 

Q: What will I receive in the merger in exchange for my equity awards? 

A: Stock Options.    At or immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, each outstanding option to purchase shares of Ultratech common stock (each, an "Ultratech
Option") will vest and be canceled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Ultratech common stock
subject to such Ultratech Option immediately prior to the effective time and (ii) the excess, if any, of (A) the Equity Award Merger

Consideration (as defined below) over (B) the exercise price per share subject to such canceled Ultratech Option. Ultratech Options that have an exercise price per share
that is greater than the Equity Award Merger Consideration will be canceled in exchange for no consideration. Veeco will cause the surviving corporation to pay the cash
payment described above to the holder of the applicable Ultratech Option at or reasonably promptly after the effective time of the merger (but in no event later than three
business days after the effective time).

Vested Restricted Stock Units.    At or immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, each award of restricted stock units with respect to shares of Ultratech
common stock that is outstanding and vested immediately prior to the effective time, including those restricted stock units that become vested by their terms immediately
prior to or as of the effective time (each, an "Ultratech Vested RSU") will be canceled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of
(i) the number of shares of Ultratech common stock subject to such Ultratech Vested RSU immediately prior to the effective time and (ii) the Equity Award Merger
Consideration. Veeco will cause the surviving corporation to pay the cash payment described above to the holder of the applicable Ultratech Vested RSU at or reasonably
promptly after the effective time of the merger (but in no event later than three business days after the effective time).

Unvested Restricted Stock Units.    At the effective time of the merger, each award of restricted stock units with respect to shares of Ultratech common stock that is
outstanding and unvested immediately prior to the effective time (each, an "Ultratech Unvested RSU") will be assumed by Veeco and converted into a number of
restricted stock units of Veeco common stock ("Converted RSUs"), rounded down to the nearest whole number, equal to the product of (i) the number of shares subject to
the Ultratech Unvested RSU and (ii) the Equity Conversion Ratio (as defined below). Any Converted RSUs so issued will be subject to the same terms and conditions as
were applicable under the Ultratech Unvested RSUs; provided, that all references to "Company" in Ultratech's equity incentive plan and award agreements will be
references to Veeco.

See the section entitled "The Merger Agreement—Treatment of Ultratech Options and Other Equity-Based Awards" beginning on page 101 of this proxy
statement/prospectus.

Q: Do any of Ultratech's directors or executive officers have interests in the merger that may differ from those of Ultratech stockholders? 

A: Ultratech's non-employee directors and executive officers have certain interests in the merger that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of Ultratech
stockholders generally. The Ultratech board was aware of and considered these interests, among other matters, in evaluating the merger agreement and the merger, and in
recommending that Ultratech stockholders adopt the merger agreement. For a description of these interests, refer to the section entitled "The Merger—Interests of
Ultratech's Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger" beginning on page 88 of this proxy statement/prospectus. 

Q: What is required to complete the merger? 

A: Each of Veeco's and Ultratech's obligation to consummate the merger is subject, as relevant, to a number of conditions specified in the Merger Agreement, including the
following: (1) adoption by Ultratech stockholders of the merger agreement; (2) the absence of any temporary restraining order, preliminary or permanent injunction or
other judgment issued by any court of competent jurisdiction pending or in effect that would enjoin or otherwise prohibit the consummation of the merger; (3) all
approvals and the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period necessary under the HSR Act having been obtained or having expired or been terminated, as
applicable; (4) the Form S-4 of which this proxy statement/prospectus forms a part having been declared effective by the SEC under the 1933 Act, no stop order

the Form S-4 having been issued by the SEC and no proceedings for that purpose having been initiated by the SEC; (5) authorization by Nasdaq for listing of the shares
of Veeco common stock to be issued in the merger; (6) accuracy of representations and warranties of the parties to the applicable standard provided by the merger
agreement (including a representation that Ultratech and its subsidiaries have, on a consolidated basis, at least $180,000,000 of available cash held in the United States at
closing); (7) no "Company Material Adverse Effect" or "Parent Material Adverse Effect" having occurred since the date of the merger agreement and (8) performance by
the parties with all of their obligations required to be performed by the merger agreement in all material respects. The consummation of the merger is not subject to a
financing condition. See the section entitled "The Merger Agreement—Conditions to Closing" beginning on page 119 of this proxy statement/prospectus.

Q: When do you expect the merger to be completed? 

A: Veeco and Ultratech expect the closing of the merger (the "closing") to occur in the second quarter of calendar year 2017. However, the merger is subject to various
regulatory approvals and the satisfaction or waiver of other conditions, and it is possible that factors outside the control of Veeco and Ultratech could result in the merger
being completed at an earlier time, a later time or not at all. The merger will become effective at such time as a certificate of merger is duly filed with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware on the date on which the closing occurs (the "closing date"), or at such subsequent date or time as may be specified in the certificate of
merger (the "effective time"). 

Q: Will I be subject to U.S. federal income tax upon the exchange of shares of Ultratech common stock for the merger consideration? 

A: If you are a U.S. Holder (as defined below), the exchange of your shares of Ultratech common stock for cash and shares of Veeco common stock in the merger will be a
taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes, which generally will require you to recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes in an amount
equal to the difference, if any, between the sum of the amount of cash and the fair market value of the shares of Veeco common stock you receive in the merger and your
tax basis in the shares of Ultratech common stock exchanged in the merger.

If you are a Non-U.S. Holder (as defined below), you generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax with respect to the exchange of shares of Ultratech common
stock for cash and shares of Veeco common stock in the merger, unless you have certain connections to the United States.

Because particular circumstances may differ, we recommend that you consult your own tax advisor to determine the U.S. federal income tax consequences to you relating
to the merger in light of your own particular circumstances and the consequences to you arising under U.S. federal non-income tax laws or the laws of any state, local or
non-U.S. taxing jurisdiction. A more complete description of material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger is provided in the section entitled "Material
U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences" beginning on page 126 of this proxy statement/prospectus.

Q: Are there any risks that I should consider in deciding whether to vote for the adoption of the merger agreement? 

A: Yes. You should read and carefully consider the risk factors set forth in the section entitled "Risk Factors Relating to the Merger" beginning on page 38 of this proxy
statement/prospectus. You should also read and carefully consider the risk factors of Veeco and Ultratech contained in the documents that are incorporated by reference
into this proxy statement/prospectus.

Q: What happens if the merger is not completed? 

A: If the merger agreement is not adopted by Ultratech's stockholders or if the merger is not completed for any other reason, Ultratech's stockholders will not receive the
merger consideration in exchange for their shares of Ultratech common stock. Instead, Ultratech will remain an independent public company and Ultratech common stock
will continue to be listed and traded on Nasdaq. Under specified circumstances, Ultratech may be required to pay Veeco a termination fee of $26.5 million, as described in
the section entitled "The Merger Agreement—Termination Fee Payable by Ultratech" beginning on page 123 of this proxy statement/prospectus.

Questions and Answers about the Special Meeting 

Q: When and where will the special meeting be held? 

A: The special meeting of Ultratech stockholders will be held on May 25, 2017 at 2:00 p.m., local time, at the offices of O'Melveny & Myers LLP, located at 2765 Sand Hill
Road, Menlo Park, California 94025. 

Q: Who is soliciting my proxy to vote at the special meeting? 

A: The Ultratech board is soliciting your proxy to vote at the special meeting. This proxy statement/prospectus summarizes the information you need to know to vote on the
proposals to be presented at the special meeting. 

Q: Who is entitled to vote? 

A: Only holders of record of Ultratech common stock at the close of business on April 20, 2017, the record date for the meeting (the "record date"), are entitled to notice of,
and to vote at, the special meeting and any postponements or adjournments of the meeting. On the record date, 27,242,013 shares of Ultratech common stock were issued
and outstanding and no shares of Ultratech's preferred stock were outstanding. 

Q: What are the proposals on which I am being asked to vote? 

A: There are three proposals that will be voted on at the special meeting: 

• Merger Proposal:  The proposal to adopt the merger agreement, which provides for the merger of Merger Subsidiary with and into Ultratech, with Ultratech
surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Veeco (the "Merger Proposal"). 

• Compensation Proposal:  The proposal to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation payments that will or may be made to Ultratech's named
executive officers in connection with the merger (the "Compensation Proposal"). 

• Adjournment Proposal:  The proposal to approve the adjournment of the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are not
sufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the Merger Proposal (the "Adjournment Proposal").

Approval by stockholders of Ultratech of the Merger Proposal (the "Ultratech stockholder approval") is required for completion of the merger. Approval by Ultratech's
stockholders of the Compensation Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal is not required for completion of the merger. No other matters are intended to be brought
before the special meeting by Ultratech.

Q: What vote is required for approval of the proposals in this proxy statement/prospectus, and what happens if I abstain? 

A: The following are the vote requirements: 

• Merger Proposal:  The affirmative vote, in person or by proxy, of holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Ultratech common stock entitled to vote as of
the record date is required to approve the Merger Proposal. If you abstain from voting, fail to vote at the special meeting, or fail to instruct your broker, bank or
other nominee how to vote on the Merger Proposal, it will have the same effect as a vote cast against the Merger Proposal. 

• Compensation Proposal:  The affirmative vote, in person or by proxy, of holders of a majority of the shares of Ultratech common stock present in person or
represented by proxy at the special meeting and entitled to vote thereon is required to approve the Compensation Proposal. If you abstain from voting or attend the
special meeting and fail to vote, it will have the same effect as a vote cast against the Compensation Proposal. If you do not attend the special meeting or fail to
instruct your broker, bank or other nominee how to vote on the Compensation Proposal, it will have no effect on the outcome of the vote on the Compensation
Proposal, assuming a quorum is present. 

• Adjournment Proposal:  The affirmative vote, in person or by proxy, of holders of a majority of the shares of Ultratech common stock present in person or
represented by proxy at the special meeting and entitled to vote thereon is required to approve the Adjournment Proposal. If you abstain from voting or attend the
special meeting and fail to vote, it will have the same effect as a vote cast against the Adjournment Proposal. If you do not attend the special meeting or fail to
instruct your broker, bank or other nominee how to vote on the Adjournment Proposal, it will have no effect on the outcome of the vote on the Adjournment
Proposal, assuming a quorum is present. 

Q: How does the Ultratech board recommend that I vote my shares of Ultratech common stock on the proposals? 

A: The Ultratech board unanimously recommends that stockholders vote their shares of Ultratech common stock: 

• "FOR" the Merger Proposal; 

• "FOR" the Compensation Proposal; and 

• "FOR" the Adjournment Proposal. 

Q: Why did the Ultratech board approve the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger? 

A: To review the Ultratech board's reasons for approving and recommending adoption of the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the
merger, see the section entitled "The Merger—Recommendation of the Ultratech Board; Ultratech's Reasons for the Merger" beginning on page 70 of this proxy
statement/prospectus.

• You may vote by completing, signing, dating and mailing the enclosed proxy card in the envelope provided, or by submitting a proxy by telephone or over the
Internet by following the instructions on the enclosed proxy card.

If your shares of Ultratech common stock are held in the name of your broker, bank or other nominee, you should submit voting instructions to your broker,
bank or other nominee. Please refer to the voting instruction card included in these proxy materials by your broker, bank or other nominee or contact your broker, bank
or other nominees to obtain instructions on how to instruct them with respect to the voting of your shares.

Q: If my shares are held in a stock brokerage account, or in "street name" by my broker, bank or nominee, will my broker, bank or nominee automatically vote my
shares for me? 

A: No. If your shares are held in the name of a broker, bank or other nominee, you are considered the "beneficial holder" of the shares held for you in what is known as
"street name". You are not the "record holder" of such shares. If this is the case, this proxy statement/prospectus has been forwarded to you by your broker, bank or other
nominee. As the beneficial holder, unless your broker, bank or other nominee has discretionary authority over your shares, you generally have the right to direct your
broker, bank or other nominee as to how to vote your shares. You can contact your broker, bank or other nominees to obtain instructions on how to instruct them with
respect to the voting of your shares. If you do not provide voting instructions, your shares will not be counted in determining whether a quorum is present at the special
meeting or be voted on any proposal on which your broker, bank or other nominee does not have discretionary authority. This is often called a "broker non-vote". In order
to avoid broker non-votes with respect to your shares of Ultratech common stock, you should provide your broker, bank or other nominee with instructions as to how to
vote your shares of Ultratech common stock.

Please note that you may not vote shares held in street name by returning a proxy card directly to Ultratech or by voting in person at the special meeting unless you first
obtain a proxy from your broker, bank or other nominee. Please follow the voting instructions provided by your broker, bank or other nominee so that it may vote your
shares on your behalf.

Q: How do proxies work? 

A: The Ultratech board is asking for your proxy. Giving us your proxy means that you authorize us to vote your shares at the annual meeting in the manner you direct.

You may vote for all, some, or none of the proposals above. However, a failure to vote on the Merger Proposal or an abstention on the Merger Proposal will have the same
effect as a vote against. You may also vote for or against the other items or abstain from voting on them.

If you sign and return the enclosed proxy card but do not specify how to vote, we will vote your shares "FOR" the Merger Proposal, "FOR" the Compensation Proposal
and "FOR" the Adjournment Proposal.

Q: How many votes do I have? 

A: Ultratech stockholders are entitled to cast one vote for each share of Ultratech common stock held as of the record date on all matters properly submitted for voting. On
the record date, 27,242,013 shares of Ultratech common stock were issued and outstanding and no shares of Ultratech's preferred stock were outstanding.

Q: What if I sell my shares of Ultratech common stock before the special meeting? 

A: If you transfer your shares of Ultratech common stock after the record date but before the special meeting, you will, unless you provide the transferee of your shares with
a proxy, retain your right to vote at the special meeting, but will have transferred the right to receive the merger consideration. In order to receive the merger
consideration, you must hold your shares through the effective time. 

Q: What does it mean if I get more than one proxy card to vote my shares of Ultratech common stock? 

A: You may receive more than one set of voting materials, including multiple copies of this proxy statement/prospectus and multiple paper proxy cards or voting instruction
cards. For example, if you hold your shares of Ultratech common stock in more than one brokerage account, you may receive a set of proxy materials for each brokerage
account in which you hold shares. If you are an Ultratech stockholder of record and your shares of Ultratech common stock are registered in more than one name, you
will receive more than one set of proxy materials. Please sign, date and return each proxy card and voting instruction card that you receive and follow the voting
instructions set forth in this proxy statement/prospectus to ensure that all your shares of Ultratech common stock are voted. 

Q: Can I change my vote? 

A: Yes, if you are a stockholder of record as of the record date, you may change your vote: (1) by delivering to Ultratech (Attention: Corporate Secretary, Ultratech, Inc.,
3050 Zanker Road, San Jose, California 95134), prior to your shares being voted at the special meeting, a later dated written notice of revocation or a later dated duly
executed proxy card; or (2) by attending the special meeting and voting in person (although attendance at the special meeting will not, by itself, revoke a proxy). A
stockholder of record who has voted on the Internet or by telephone may also change his or her vote by subsequently making a timely and valid Internet or telephone
vote.

If you are a beneficial owner of shares held in "street name" by a broker, bank or other nominee, you may revoke your proxy and vote your shares in person at the special
meeting only in accordance with applicable rules and procedures as employed by such broker, bank or other nominee. If your shares are held in an account at a broker,
bank or other nominee, you should contact your broker, bank or other nominee to change your vote.

Q: How many shares must be present to hold the special meeting? 

A: Holders of a majority in voting power of the issued and outstanding shares of Ultratech common stock entitled to vote at the special meeting must be present in person or
represented by proxy at the special meeting in order to have the required quorum for transacting business. Stockholders are counted as present at the meeting if they
(1) are present in person at the special meeting; or (2) have properly submitted a proxy card or submitted a proxy by telephone or over the Internet. Abstaining votes are
considered present and entitled to vote and, therefore, are included for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present at the special meeting. Broker non-votes are
not entitled to vote and, therefore, are not included for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present at the special meeting. 

Q: Are Ultratech stockholders entitled to appraisal rights? 

A: Record holders of Ultratech common stock who do not vote in favor of the Merger Proposal and otherwise comply with the requirements and procedures of Section 262
of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the "DGCL"), are entitled to exercise appraisal rights, which generally entitle

Table of Contents

stockholders to receive in lieu of the merger consideration a cash payment of an amount determined by the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (the "Court of
Chancery") to be the fair value of their Ultratech common stock. However, notwithstanding a stockholder's compliance with the DGCL in perfecting appraisal rights,
Section 262(g) of the DGCL provides that, because immediately prior to the effective time of the merger Ultratech common stock will be listed on a national securities
exchange, the Court of Chancery will dismiss the proceedings as to all holders of Ultratech common stock who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless (1) the
total number of shares entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of the class or series eligible for appraisal or (2) the value of the consideration provided
in the merger for such total number of shares exceeds $1 million. The fair value of Ultratech common stock could be less than, more than or the same as the merger
consideration. A detailed description of the procedures required to be followed in order to perfect appraisal rights by Ultratech stockholders if desired is included in the
section entitled "The Merger—Appraisal Rights" beginning on page 95 of this proxy statement/prospectus. The full text of Section 262 of the DGCL is attached as
Annex C to this proxy statement/prospectus. Due to the complexity of the procedures described above, Ultratech stockholders who are considering exercising such rights
are encouraged to seek the advice of legal counsel.

Q: Why am I being asked to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation payments that will or may be made to Ultratech's named executive
officers in connection with the merger? 

A: The SEC has adopted rules that require Ultratech to seek a non-binding, advisory vote on the compensation payments that will or may be made to Ultratech's named
executive officers in connection with the merger. Ultratech urges its stockholders to read the section entitled "The Merger—Interests of Ultratech's Directors and
Executive Officers in the Merger" beginning on page 88 of this proxy statement/prospectus, which describes in more detail how Ultratech's compensation policies and
procedures relating to its named executive officers operate and how they are designed to achieve Ultratech's compensation objectives. 

Q: What happens if the proposal to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation payments that will or may be made to Ultratech's named
executive officers in connection with the merger is not approved? 

A: Approval, on a non-binding, advisory basis, of the compensation payments that will or may be made by Ultratech to Ultratech's named executive officers in connection
with the merger is not a condition to completion of the merger. The vote is a non-binding, advisory vote and is therefore not binding on Ultratech, the Ultratech board, the
compensation committee of the Ultratech board, Veeco, Veeco's Board of Directors (the "Veeco board") or the compensation committee of the Veeco board. Since
compensation and benefits to be paid or provided in connection with the merger are based on contractual arrangements with the named executive officers, the outcome of
this advisory vote will not affect the obligation to make these payments and these payments may still be made even if the Ultratech stockholders do not approve, on a
non-binding, advisory basis, the Compensation Proposal. 

Q: Who pays for the solicitation of proxies to vote at the special meeting? 

A: Ultratech will bear the entire cost of proxy solicitation, including preparation, assembly, printing and mailing of the notice of special meeting, proxy card, this proxy
statement/prospectus and any additional materials furnished to Ultratech's stockholders. Copies of these materials will be furnished to brokerage houses, fiduciaries and
custodians holding shares in their names that are beneficially owned by others to forward to those beneficial owners. In addition, Ultratech may reimburse the costs of
forwarding these materials to those beneficial owners. Solicitation of proxies

by mail may be supplemented by one or more of telephone, email, facsimile or personal solicitation by Ultratech's directors, officers or employees. No additional
compensation will be paid for such services. Ultratech has engaged D.F. King & Co., Inc. to aid in the solicitation of proxies from brokers, bank nominees and other
institutional owners for approximately $10,000, plus reimbursement of related expenses.

Q: Should I send in my share certificate(s) now? 

A: No. Please do not send any share certificates with your proxy card. After the merger is completed, you will receive written instructions, including a letter of transmittal,
for exchanging your shares of Ultratech common stock for the cash payment and shares of Veeco common stock you are entitled to receive in connection with the merger.

Q: Where can I find the voting results of the special meeting? 

A: The preliminary voting results will be announced at the special meeting. In addition, within four business days following the vote at the special meeting, Ultratech intends
to file the final voting results with the SEC on a Current Report on Form 8-K. 

Q: Whom should I call if I have questions? 

A: If you have questions or if you need assistance submitting your proxy or voting your shares or need additional copies of this proxy statement/prospectus or the enclosed
proxy card, you should contact Ultratech's proxy solicitor at:

Comparative Market Price and Dividend Information (Unaudited)
(see page 36)

        Shares of Veeco's common stock are listed for trading on Nasdaq under the symbol "VECO" and shares of Ultratech common stock are listed for trading on Nasdaq
under the symbol "UTEK". The following table sets forth the closing sales prices of a share of Veeco common stock (as reported on Nasdaq) and of Ultratech common
stock (as reported on Nasdaq), each on February 1, 2017, the last trading day before the day on which Veeco and Ultratech announced the execution of the merger
agreement, and on April 21, 2017, the last practicable trading day before the date of this proxy statement/prospectus.

        The market prices of Veeco common stock and Ultratech common stock will fluctuate before the special meeting and before the merger is consummated. You should
obtain current stock price quotations from a newspaper, the Internet or your broker or banker.

        Veeco's Dividend Policy.    Veeco has never declared or paid any cash dividends on its common stock. The Veeco board will determine future dividend policy based
on Veeco's consolidated results of operations, financial condition, capital requirements, and other circumstances. The merger agreement prohibits Veeco from authorizing
or paying dividends or making distributions on its capital stock, so Veeco does not expect to pay dividends for as long as the merger agreement is in effect.

        Ultratech's Dividend Policy.    Ultratech has never declared or paid any cash dividends on its common stock. The merger agreement prohibits Ultratech from
authorizing or paying dividends or making distributions on its capital stock, so Ultratech does not expect to pay dividends for as long as the merger agreement is in effect.

The Ultratech Special Meeting
(see page 47)

Time, Place and Purpose of the Special Meeting (see page 47)

        The special meeting of Ultratech stockholders will be held on May 25, 2017 at 2:00 p.m., local time, at the offices of O'Melveny & Myers LLP, located at 2765 Sand
Hill Road, Menlo Park, California 94025.

        At the special meeting, holders of Ultratech common stock as of the record date will be asked to consider and approve the following proposals:

1. The Merger Proposal 

2. The Compensation Proposal 

3. The Adjournment Proposal

Record Date and Quorum (see page 47)

        Only Ultratech stockholders of record as of the record date are entitled to notice of and to vote at the special meeting. As of the close of business on the record date,
27,242,013 shares of Ultratech common stock were issued and outstanding and there were 166 holders of record of the common stock. Each Ultratech stockholder is
entitled to one vote for each share of Ultratech common stock held by such stockholder as of the record date.

        Holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Ultratech common stock entitled to vote as of the record date must be present in person or represented by proxy at
the special meeting in order to have the required quorum for transacting business. Abstentions are counted as present for purposes of determining the presence or absence
of a quorum for the transaction of business.

Required Vote (see page 48)

        The affirmative vote, in person or by proxy, of holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Ultratech common stock entitled to vote as of the record date is
required to approve the Merger Proposal. The affirmative vote, in person or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the shares of Ultratech common stock present in
person or represented by proxy at the special meeting and entitled to vote on the matter is required to approve each of the Compensation Proposal and the Adjournment
Proposal.

        If you abstain from voting, fail to vote at the special meeting, or fail to instruct your broker, bank or other nominee how to vote on the Merger Proposal, it will have
the same effect as a vote cast against the Merger Proposal.

        If you abstain from voting or attend the special meeting and fail to vote, it will have the same effect as a vote cast against the Compensation Proposal and the
Adjournment Proposal. If you do not attend the special meeting or fail to instruct your broker, bank or other nominee how to vote on the Compensation Proposal and the
Adjournment Proposal, it will have no effect on the outcome of the vote on the Compensation Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal, assuming a quorum is present.

Voting of Shares (see page 49)

        In addition to voting in person at the special meeting, if your shares of Ultratech common stock are held in your name by Ultratech's transfer agent as a stockholder of
record, you, as an Ultratech stockholder, may submit a proxy as follows:

• By Internet.  The web address and instructions for Internet proxy submission can be found on the enclosed proxy card. If you choose to submit your proxy
by Internet, then you do not need to

return the proxy card. To be valid, your Internet proxy must be received by 11:59 p.m. (U.S. Eastern Time) on the day preceding the special meeting.

• By Telephone.  The toll-free number for telephone proxy submission can be found on the enclosed proxy card. If you choose to submit your proxy by
telephone, then you do not need to return the proxy card. To be valid, your telephone proxy must be received by 11:59 p.m. (U.S. Eastern Time) on the day
preceding the special meeting. 

• By Mail.  Mark the enclosed proxy card, sign and date it, and return it in the pre-addressed postage-paid envelope provided with the enclosed proxy card, all
in accordance with the instructions on the enclosed proxy card. To be valid, your proxy by mail must be received prior to the special meeting.

        Beneficial Owner.    If your shares of Ultratech common stock are held in "street name" by a broker, bank or other nominee, you have the right to direct your broker,
bank or other nominee on how to vote your shares of Ultratech common stock. Your broker, bank or other nominee, as applicable, may establish an earlier deadline by
which you must provide instructions to it for how to vote your shares of Ultratech common stock. You should read carefully the materials provided to you by your broker,
bank or other nominee. Because a beneficial owner is not the stockholder of record, you may not vote these shares of Ultratech common stock at the special meeting unless
you obtain a "legal proxy" from the broker, bank or other nominee that holds your shares of Ultratech common stock giving you the right to vote such shares of Ultratech
common stock at the special meeting.

        If you satisfy the admission requirements to the special meeting, as described above under the heading "General Questions and Answers about the Special Meeting",
you may vote your shares in person at the meeting. Even if you plan to attend the special meeting, we encourage you to vote in advance by Internet, telephone or mail so
that your vote will be counted in the event you later decide not to attend the special meeting. Shares held through a benefit or compensation plan cannot be voted in person
at the special meeting.

Revocation of Proxies (see page 50)

        If you are a stockholder of record as of the record date, you may change your vote:

• by delivering to Ultratech (Attention: Corporate Secretary, 3050 Zanker Road, San Jose, California 95134), prior to your shares being voted at the special
meeting, a later dated written notice of revocation or a later dated duly executed proxy card, or 

• by attending the special meeting and voting in person (although attendance at the special meeting will not, by itself, revoke a proxy).

        A stockholder of record who has voted on the Internet or by telephone may also change his or her vote by subsequently making a timely and valid Internet or
telephone vote.

        If you are a beneficial owner of shares held in "street name" by a broker, bank or other nominee, you may revoke your proxy and vote your shares in person at the
special meeting only in accordance with applicable rules and procedures as employed by such broker, bank or other nominee. If your shares are held in an account at a
broker, bank or other nominee, you should contact your broker, bank or other nominee to change your vote.

The Merger 

Effects of the Merger (see page 56)

        Subject to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, Merger Subsidiary will be merged with and into Ultratech, and Ultratech will continue as the surviving

and bylaws of Ultratech as the surviving corporation in the merger, unless otherwise directed by Veeco prior to the effective time, will be the certificate of incorporation
and bylaws of Merger Subsidiary as in effect immediately prior to the effective time.

Recommendation of the Ultratech Board; Ultratech's Reasons for the Merger (see page 70)

        The Ultratech board unanimously recommends that Ultratech stockholders vote "FOR" the Merger Proposal, "FOR" the Compensation Proposal, and "FOR" the
Adjournment Proposal. For more information regarding the factors considered by the Ultratech board in reaching its decision to approve the merger agreement, the merger
and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, see the section entitled "The Merger—Recommendation of the Ultratech Board; Ultratech's Reasons for
the Merger" beginning on page 70 of this proxy statement/prospectus.

Opinion of Ultratech's Financial Advisor (see page 75)

        In connection with the merger, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated ("BofA Merrill Lynch"), Ultratech's financial advisor, delivered to Ultratech's
board of directors a written opinion, dated February 1, 2017, as to the fairness, from a financial point of view and as of the date of the opinion, of the merger consideration
to be received in the merger by holders of Ultratech common stock (other than Veeco, Merger Subsidiary and holders of dissenting shares). The full text of the written
opinion, dated February 1, 2017, of BofA Merrill Lynch, which describes, among other things, the assumptions made, procedures followed, factors considered and
limitations on the review undertaken, is attached as Annex B to this document and is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. BofA Merrill Lynch provided its
opinion to Ultratech's board of directors (in its capacity as such) for the benefit and use of Ultratech's board of directors in connection with and for purposes of
its evaluation of the merger consideration from a financial point of view. BofA Merrill Lynch's opinion does not address any other aspect of the merger and no
opinion or view was expressed as to the relative merits of the merger in comparison to other strategies or transactions that might be available to Ultratech or in
which Ultratech might engage or as to the underlying business decision of Ultratech to proceed with or effect the merger. BofA Merrill Lynch's opinion does not
address any other aspect of the merger and does not constitute an opinion or recommendation to any stockholder as to how to vote or act in connection with the
merger or any related matter.

Interests of Ultratech's Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger (see page 88)

        In considering the recommendation of the Ultratech board that the stockholders vote to approve the Merger Proposal, you should be aware that some of Ultratech's
directors and executive officers may have interests in the merger that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of the stockholders generally. Interests of the
directors and executive officers may be different from or in addition to the interests of our other stockholders for the following reasons, among others:

• At or immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, each outstanding Ultratech Option will vest and be canceled and converted into the right to
receive a cash payment equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Ultratech common stock underlying the Ultratech Option and (ii) the excess, if
any, of (A) the Equity Award Merger Consideration over (B) the exercise price per share subject to such canceled Ultratech Option. We estimate that the
aggregate amount that would be payable to Ultratech's executive officers as a group for their Ultratech Options, assuming that the merger was completed on
June 1, 2017 with a price per share of Ultratech common stock of $29.07, is approximately $4,921,856. Ultratech's non-employee directors hold no
outstanding Ultratech Options. The assumed value of a share of Ultratech common stock of $29.07 is the sum of the fixed cash consideration of $21.75 plus
an assumed value of $7.32 for the stock consideration (using 0.2675 of the closing stock price of Veeco common stock on Nasdaq on February 28, 2017 of
$27.35 per share).

• As of immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, each outstanding Ultratech Vested RSU will be canceled in exchange for the right to receive a
cash payment equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Ultratech common stock subject to such Ultratech Vested RSU and (ii) the Equity Award
Merger Consideration. We estimate that the aggregate amount that would be payable to Ultratech's executive officers as a group and Ultratech's non-
employee directors as a group for their Ultratech Vested RSUs, assuming that the merger was completed on June 1, 2017 with a price per share of Ultratech
common stock of $29.07, is approximately $2,834,906 and $654,075, respectively. 

• At the effective time of the merger, each outstanding Ultratech Unvested RSU will be assumed by Veeco and converted into a number of Converted RSUs,
rounded down to the nearest whole number, equal to the product of (i) the number of shares subject to the Ultratech Unvested RSU and (ii) the Equity
Conversion Ratio. We estimate that the aggregate number of Converted RSUs deliverable to Ultratech's executive officers as a group for their Ultratech
Unvested RSUs, assuming that the merger was completed on June 1, 2017 with a price per share of Ultratech common stock of $29.07 and a price per share
of Veeco common stock of $27.35, is approximately 205,350. This represents approximately 0.5% of Veeco's current outstanding shares of common stock.
Ultratech's non-employee directors hold no outstanding Ultratech Unvested RSUs. 

• Each of Ultratech's executive officers is party to either an employment agreement or change in control severance agreement that provides for severance
benefits in the event of certain qualifying terminations of employment. We estimate that the aggregate amount that would be payable to Ultratech's
executive officers as a group under their respective employment agreements and change in control severance agreements, assuming that the merger was
completed on June 1, 2017 and their employment was terminated on that date in circumstances entitling them to severance benefits under their
arrangements, is approximately $14,405,043 (not including the value of equity awards that accelerate at or immediately prior to the merger, which is
disclosed above). These amounts are determined using the assumptions set forth in footnotes (1) and (3) of the table under the section entitled "—
Quantification of Change in Control and Termination Payments and Benefits to Ultratech's Named Executive Officers" beginning on page 92 of this proxy
statement/prospectus. 

• Ultratech's directors and executive officers are entitled to continued indemnification, expense advancement and insurance coverage under the merger
agreement.

        These interests are discussed in more detail in the section entitled "The Merger—Interests of Ultratech's Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger" beginning on
page 88 of this proxy statement/prospectus. The members of the Ultratech Board were aware of the different or additional interests described in such section and
considered these interests, among other matters, in evaluating and negotiating the merger agreement and the merger, and in recommending to the stockholders that the
Merger Proposal be approved.

Share Ownership and Voting by Ultratech Directors and Executive Officers (see page 49)

        As of the record date, the directors and executive officers of Ultratech held and are entitled to vote, in the aggregate, approximately 3.4% of the aggregate voting
power of the outstanding shares of Ultratech's common stock. All shares held by Ultratech's directors and executive officers are subject to the Support Agreement (as
defined in the section entitled "The Support Agreement" beginning on page 125 of this proxy statement/prospectus). For more information on the Support Agreement, see
the section entitled "The Support Agreement" beginning on page 125 of this proxy statement/prospectus.

Listing of Shares of Veeco Common Stock; Delisting and Deregistration of Ultratech Common Stock (see page 95)

        Veeco is obligated to cause the shares of Veeco common stock to be issued to Ultratech stockholders pursuant to the merger to be authorized for listing on Nasdaq at
the effective time, subject to official notice of issuance. Upon completion of the merger, shares of Ultratech common stock will cease to be listed on Nasdaq and will
subsequently be deregistered under the Exchange Act.

        See the sections entitled "The Merger—Listing of Shares of Veeco Common Stock" beginning on page 95 of this proxy statement/prospectus and "The Merger—
Delisting and Deregistration of Ultratech Common Stock" beginning on page 95 of this proxy statement/prospectus for a further discussion of the listing of shares of Veeco
common stock and de-listing of Ultratech common stock in connection with the merger.

The Merger Agreement
(see page 100)

        The merger agreement is attached as Annex A to this proxy statement/prospectus. Veeco and Ultratech encourage you to read the entire merger agreement carefully
because it is the principal document governing the merger and the issuance of shares of Veeco common stock. Pursuant to the merger agreement, Merger Subsidiary will
merge with and into Ultratech, with Ultratech surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Veeco.

Merger Consideration (see page 100)

        Subject to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, at the effective time, each share of Ultratech common stock that is issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the effective time (other than (i) shares of Ultratech common stock owned by Veeco or Merger Subsidiary and shares of treasury stock held by Ultratech, which
will be canceled without consideration, (ii) shares of Ultratech stock held by any subsidiary of either Ultratech or Veeco, which will be converted into such number of
shares of common stock of the surviving corporation such that each subsidiary owns the same percentage of the surviving corporation immediately following the effective
time as such subsidiary owned of Ultratech immediately prior to the effective time (such shares, together with the shares described in clause (i) are referred to as "excluded
shares") and (iii) shares held by holders of Ultratech common stock, if any, who properly exercise their appraisal rights under the DGCL (which we refer to as "dissenting
shares")) will be automatically cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount equal to (1) $21.75 in cash without interest (which we refer to as the "cash
consideration"), (2) 0.2675 of a share of Veeco, par value $0.01 per share (which we refer to as the "stock consideration", and together with the cash consideration, the
"merger consideration") and (3) cash in lieu of fractional shares of Veeco common stock as contemplated by the merger agreement. See the section entitled "The Merger
Agreement—Merger Consideration" beginning on page 100 of this proxy/statement prospectus for more information.

        Based on the number of shares of Ultratech common stock outstanding as of April 17, 2017, and the number of shares of Veeco common stock outstanding as of
April 17, 2017, it is expected that, immediately after completion of the merger, former Ultratech stockholders will own approximately 15% of the outstanding shares of
Veeco common stock.

Treatment of Ultratech Options and Other Equity-Based Awards (see page 101)

        Stock Options.    At or immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, each outstanding Ultratech Option will vest and be canceled and converted into the right
to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Ultratech common stock subject to such Ultratech Option immediately prior to the effective
time and (ii) the excess, if any, of (A) the Equity Award Merger Consideration over (B) the exercise price per share subject to such canceled Ultratech Option.

Table of Contents

Ultratech Options that have an exercise price per share that is greater than the Equity Award Merger Consideration will be canceled in exchange for no consideration.
Veeco will cause the surviving corporation to pay the cash payment described above to the holder of the applicable Ultratech Option at or reasonably promptly after the
effective time of the merger (but in no event later than three business days after the effective time). As used herein, "Equity Award Merger Consideration" means the sum
of (i) the cash consideration and (ii) the amount obtained by multiplying the stock consideration by the volume weighted average trading price of Veeco's common stock
for the five consecutive trading days ending on the trading day immediately preceding the closing date (the "Parent Measurement Price").

        Vested Restricted Stock Units.    At or immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, each outstanding Ultratech Vested RSU will be canceled and converted
into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Ultratech common stock subject to such Ultratech Vested RSU immediately
prior to the effective time and (ii) the Equity Award Merger Consideration. Veeco will cause the surviving corporation to pay the cash payment described above to the
holder of the applicable Ultratech Vested RSU at or reasonably promptly after the effective time of the merger (but in no event later than three business days after the
effective time).

        Unvested Restricted Stock Units.    At the effective time of the merger, each outstanding Ultratech Unvested RSU will be assumed by Veeco and converted into a
number of Converted RSUs, rounded down to the nearest whole number, equal to the product of (i) the number of shares subject to the Ultratech Unvested RSU and
(ii) the Equity Conversion Ratio. Any Converted RSUs so issued will be subject to the same terms and conditions as were applicable under the Ultratech Unvested RSUs;
provided, that all references to "Company" in Ultratech's equity incentive plan and award agreements will be references to Veeco. As used herein, "Equity Conversion
Ratio" means the quotient obtained by dividing (i) the Equity Award Merger Consideration (as defined above) by (ii) the Parent Measurement Price.

        See the section entitled "The Merger Agreement—Treatment of Ultratech Options and Other Equity-Based Awards" beginning on page 101 of this proxy statement.

Effect of the Merger; Effective Time (see page 102)

        Veeco and Ultratech expect the closing to occur during the second quarter of calendar year 2017. However, the merger is subject to various regulatory approvals and
the satisfaction or waiver of other conditions, and it is possible that factors outside the control of Veeco and Ultratech could result in the merger being completed at an
earlier time, a later time or not at all. In the merger agreement, Veeco and Ultratech have agreed that the date on which the closing occurs shall be no later than the first
business day following the satisfaction or waiver of the last of the conditions to closing (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or, to the extent permissible, waiver of those conditions), or at such other date and time as Veeco and Ultratech may mutually agree consistent
with Delaware law.

Organizational Documents of the Surviving Corporation (see page 102)

        Unless otherwise determined by Veeco prior to the effective time, at the effective time, (1) the certificate of incorporation of Merger Subsidiary immediately prior to
the effective time will be the certificate of incorporation of the surviving corporation from and after the effective time and (2) the bylaws of Merger Subsidiary
immediately prior to the effective time will be the bylaws of the surviving corporation from and after the effective time.

Appraisal Rights (see page 103)

to exercise appraisal rights, which generally entitle stockholders to receive in lieu of the merger consideration a cash payment of an amount determined by the Court of
Chancery equal to the fair value of their Ultratech common stock. However, notwithstanding a stockholder's compliance with the DGCL in perfecting appraisal rights,
Section 262(g) of the DGCL provides that, because immediately prior to the effective time of the merger Ultratech common stock will be listed on a national securities
exchange, the Court of Chancery will dismiss the proceedings as to all holders of Ultratech common stock who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless (1) the total
number of shares entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of the class or series eligible for appraisal or (2) the value of the consideration provided in the
merger for such total number of shares exceeds $1 million. A summary description of the appraisal rights available to holders of Ultratech common stock under the DGCL
and the procedures required to exercise statutory appraisal rights are included under the section entitled "The Merger—Appraisal Rights" beginning on page 103 of this
proxy statement/prospectus. The full text of Section 262 of the DGCL is attached as Annex C to this proxy statement/prospectus. Due to the complexity of the procedures
described above, Ultratech stockholders who are considering exercising such rights are encouraged to seek the advice of legal counsel.

Conduct of Businesses of Ultratech and Veeco Prior to Completion of the Merger (see page 108)

        Ultratech has agreed, subject to certain exceptions set forth in the merger agreement, on behalf of itself and its subsidiaries that it will conduct its business in the
ordinary course of business prior to the effective time or earlier termination of the merger agreement, and has agreed to certain restrictions on its ability to take certain
actions prior to the effective time or earlier termination of the merger agreement. Veeco has also agreed, subject to certain exceptions set forth in the merger agreement, on
behalf of itself and its subsidiaries that it will conduct its business in the ordinary course of business prior to the effective time or earlier termination of the merger
agreement, and has agreed to certain restrictions on its ability to take certain actions prior to the effective time or earlier termination of the merger agreement. See the
section entitled "The Merger Agreement—Conduct of Businesses of Ultratech and Veeco Prior to Completion of the Merger" beginning on page 108 of this proxy
statement/prospectus for more information.

Ultratech's Agreement Not to Solicit Other Offers (see page 111)

        Subject to certain exceptions, the merger agreement provides that Ultratech will not, and will cause each of its subsidiaries and its and their respective officers,
directors, employees, and investment bankers, attorneys, accountants or other advisors retained by Ultratech or its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as "Ultratech
representatives") not to, directly or indirectly:

• solicit, initiate or knowingly facilitate or encourage the submission of any acquisition proposal; 

• enter into or participate in any discussions or negotiations with, or furnish any non-public information or access relating to Ultratech or any of its
subsidiaries to, any person with respect to an acquisition proposal or any inquiry or proposal that could reasonably be expected to lead to an acquisition
proposal; or 

• enter into any agreement in principle, letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, merger agreement, acquisition agreement or other similar agreement
relating to an acquisition proposal.

        Subject to certain exceptions, the merger agreement provides that the Ultratech board may not fail to make, and may not withdraw, withhold, qualify or modify or
resolve to or publicly propose to withdraw, withhold, qualify or modify in a manner adverse to Veeco, the recommendation of the Ultratech board with respect to the
merger agreement or approve, endorse, or recommend or publicly propose to approve, endorse or recommend, an acquisition proposal.

        Ultratech has agreed to (1) immediately cease any discussions or negotiations with any person with respect to any acquisition proposal, (2) promptly terminate access
of any third party to any electronic data room maintained by Ultratech and (3) request that any such third party promptly return or destroy all confidential information
concerning Ultratech to the extent permitted pursuant to any confidentiality agreement entered into with such third party.

        Prior to adoption of the merger agreement by Ultratech's stockholders (and subject to certain notice requirements to Veeco), however, Ultratech may or any of the
Ultratech representatives may, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the merger agreement, provide non-public information and access relating to
Ultratech and its subsidiaries pursuant to an acceptable confidentiality agreement to, and engage in discussions or negotiations with, a third party if such third party has
made an unsolicited written bona fide acquisition proposal that did not result from any breach of the restrictions on Ultratech set forth above, and the Ultratech board
determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that such acquisition proposal would reasonably be expected to result in a
superior proposal.

        See the section entitled "The Merger Agreement—Ultratech's Agreement Not to Solicit Other Offers" beginning on page 111 of this proxy statement/prospectus for
more information.

Ultratech's Agreement Not to Change the Ultratech Board Recommendation (see page 113)

        Prior to adoption of the merger agreement by Ultratech's stockholders, if the Ultratech board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel
and in response to an unsolicited, written bona fide acquisition proposal that did not result from a breach of the restrictions on Ultratech set forth above, that such
acquisition proposal is a superior proposal and the failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to result in a breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable law,
the Ultratech board may make an adverse recommendation change or cause Ultratech to terminate the merger agreement in order to accept the superior proposal
substantially concurrently with such termination, subject to complying with certain notice and other specified conditions set forth in the merger agreement, including
giving Veeco the opportunity to make adjustments to the terms of the merger agreement in response to the superior proposal so that such proposal no longer constitutes a
superior proposal. If the Ultratech board changes its recommendation with respect to the merger agreement, Veeco may terminate the merger agreement and collect a
termination fee of $26.5 million.

        Prior to adoption of the merger agreement by Ultratech's stockholders, if Ultratech and the Ultratech representatives are in material compliance with the obligations
described above and if the Ultratech board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and taking into account any discussions with Veeco
required pursuant to the merger agreement, that the failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to result in a breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable law,
the Ultratech board may make an adverse recommendation change in response to any fact, event, change, development or set of circumstances that materially affects the
business, financial condition or results of operations of Ultratech or its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, that does not involve or relate to an acquisition proposal, Veeco or
any of its affiliates or their respective representatives and was not known and was not reasonably discoverable or foreseeable by the Ultratech board or the consequences of
which were not reasonably discoverable or foreseeable to the Ultratech board, in each case, as of the date of the merger agreement, subject to complying with certain
notice and other specified conditions set forth in the merger agreement, including giving Veeco the opportunity to make adjustments to the terms of the merger agreement.
Additionally, any determination by the Ultratech board following the date of the merger agreement that the merger consideration payable in the merger is not sufficient will
not in and of itself constitute grounds to make a change of recommendation pursuant to this paragraph. In addition, a change in the trading price of Veeco common stock or
Ultratech common stock will not in and of itself constitute grounds to make a change of recommendation pursuant to this

statement/prospectus for more information.

Regulatory Filings (see page 115)

        Veeco and Ultratech have each agreed to take certain actions in order to obtain regulatory clearances required to consummate the merger (provided, that neither
Veeco, Ultratech nor any of their respective subsidiaries will be required to take any action that constitutes a "Detriment" (as defined in the Merger Agreement)). The
merger is subject to the HSR Act. Under this statute, Veeco and Ultratech are required to make pre-merger notification filings and await the expiration or early termination
of the statutory waiting period prior to completing the merger. Veeco and Ultratech completed the initial HSR Act filings on February 9, 2017. On February 17, 2017,
Veeco and Ultratech received notice from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission that it had granted early termination, effective immediately, of the applicable waiting period
under the HSR Act with respect to the merger. See the section entitled "The Merger Agreement—Reasonable Best Efforts to Consummate the Merger; Regulatory Filings"
beginning on page 115 of this proxy statement/prospectus for more information.

Financing (see page 119)

        In the merger agreement, Veeco and Merger Subsidiary have represented and warranted to Ultratech that (assuming the accuracy of Ultratech's representations related
to available cash of Ultratech in the United States at closing) they have available, and will have available at or promptly after the effective time, cash or other sources of
immediately available funds in an amount, together with the available cash of Ultratech in the United States at closing, sufficient to enable Veeco to satisfy all of Veeco's
and Merger Subsidiary's obligations under the merger agreement. Also in the merger agreement, Ultratech has represented and warranted to Veeco and Merger Subsidiary
that it and its subsidiaries will have, on a consolidated basis, at least $180,000,000 of available cash held in the United States at closing. The closing is not subject to a
financing condition. See the section entitled "The Merger Agreement—Financing" beginning on page 119 of this proxy statement/prospectus for more information.

Conditions to Closing (see page 119)

        The obligations of Ultratech, Veeco and Merger Subsidiary to effect the merger are subject to the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted by applicable law and
other than the first condition below with respect to stockholder approval and adoption of the merger agreement which may not be waived by any party) at or prior to the
effective time of each of the following conditions:

• adoption of the merger agreement the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of Ultratech common stock entitled to
vote at the special meeting; 

• the absence of any temporary restraining order, preliminary or permanent injunction or other judgment that has been issued by any court of competent
jurisdiction is pending or in effect that enjoins or otherwise prohibits the consummation of the merger;

The Support Agreement
(see page 125)

        Pursuant to a Support Agreement, dated as of February 2, 2017 (the "Support Agreement") among Veeco and the members of the Ultratech board and Ultratech's
executive officers (the "supporting stockholders"), during the period commencing on the date of the Support Agreement and continuing until the first to occur of (i) the
effective time, (ii) the date and time of termination of the merger agreement, and (iii) the date and time, if any, at which the Ultratech board makes a change in
recommendation, each supporting stockholder has agreed, among other things, to (A) appear at the special meeting (or any other meeting of Ultratech's stockholders called
in connection with the merger agreement) or cause such supporting stockholder's shares of Ultratech common stock, including any shares acquired by such supporting
stockholder after the date of the Support Agreement (collectively, the "subject shares"), to be counted as present at such meeting for purposes of establishing a quorum and
(B) to vote (or cause to be voted) the subject shares (1) in favor of granting the Ultratech stockholder approval, approving the merger, adopting the merger agreement, and
approving any other transaction document, any other transaction pursuant to or contemplated by the merger agreement, and any other matter that could reasonably be
expected to facilitate the consummation of the merger and (2) against any acquisition proposal (other than the merger agreement and the merger) and any other matter that
would reasonably be expected to impede, interfere with, delay, postpone or adversely affect the consummation of the merger or any of the transactions contemplated by the
merger agreement

        As of the close of business on April 20, 2017, the supporting stockholders owned in the aggregate 929,838 shares of Ultratech common stock (not including any
shares of Ultratech common stock subject to Ultratech stock options or Ultratech RSUs), all of which are subject to the Support Agreement, representing approximately
3.4% of the shares of Ultratech common stock outstanding as of such date.

        The Support Agreement will terminate on the earlier of (i) the effective time and (ii) the termination of the merger agreement. Each supporting stockholder has

Agreement solely in such supporting stockholder's capacity as stockholder of Ultratech and not in any other capacity.

        See the section entitled "The Support Agreement" beginning on page 125 of this proxy statement/prospectus for more information.

Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences
(see page 126)

        The merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, a U.S. Holder (as defined in the section entitled "Material U.S. Federal
Income Tax Consequences" beginning on page 126 of this proxy statement/prospectus) of shares of Ultratech common stock generally will recognize gain or loss for U.S.
federal income tax purposes equal to the difference between (1) the sum of the amount of cash and the fair market value of the shares of Veeco common stock received and
(2) the holder's tax basis in the shares of Ultratech common stock exchanged in the merger.

        Any such gain or loss generally will be capital gain or loss and generally will be long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. Holder's holding period in the Ultratech
common stock immediately prior to the merger is more than one year. For U.S. Holders that are individuals, estates or trusts, long-term capital gain generally is taxed at
preferential U.S. federal rates. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.

        A U.S. Holder will have a tax basis in the shares of Veeco common stock received in the merger equal to the fair market value of such shares. The holding period for
shares of Veeco common stock received in exchange for shares of Ultratech common stock in the merger will begin on the date immediately following the closing date.

        A Non-U.S. Holder (as defined in the section entitled "Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences" beginning on page 126 of this proxy statement/prospectus)
generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax with respect to the exchange of shares of Ultratech common stock for cash and shares of Veeco common stock in
the merger unless such Non-U.S. Holder has certain connections to the United States.

        The U.S. federal income tax consequences described above may not apply to all holders of Ultratech common stock, including certain holders specifically referred to
on page 128. Your tax consequences will depend on your own situation. You should consult your tax advisor to determine the particular tax consequences of the merger to
you.

Accounting Treatment
(see page 129)

        Veeco prepares its financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (referred to in this proxy
statement/prospectus as GAAP). The merger will be accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. Veeco will be treated as the acquiror for accounting
purposes.

Comparison of Stockholders' Rights
(see page 135)

        Ultratech stockholders, whose rights are currently governed by the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of Ultratech (the "Ultratech Charter") and the
Amended and Restated Bylaws of Ultratech (as amended, the "Ultratech Bylaws") will, upon receipt of Veeco common stock in the merger, upon completion of the
merger, become stockholders of Veeco and their rights will be governed by the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of Veeco (the "Veeco Charter") and the
Fifth Amended and Restated Bylaws of Veeco (the "Veeco Bylaws"). The differences between the Ultratech governing documents and the Veeco governing documents are

UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL INFORMATION 

Introduction 

        The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information is presented to illustrate the estimated effects of the pending merger of Merger
Subsidiary with and into Ultratech with Ultratech continuing as the surviving corporation and as a wholly owned subsidiary of Veeco and the related financing
transactions, which were announced on February 2, 2017.

        The merger has not yet closed. Under the terms of the merger agreement, Veeco is offering to acquire each outstanding share of Ultratech common stock (other than
(i) shares of Ultratech common stock owned by Veeco or Merger Subsidiary and shares of treasury stock held by Ultratech, which will be canceled without consideration,
(ii) shares of Ultratech stock held by any subsidiary of either Ultratech or Veeco, which will be converted into such number of shares of common stock of the surviving
corporation such that each subsidiary owns the same percentage of the surviving corporation immediately following the effective time as such subsidiary owned of
Ultratech immediately prior to the effective time (such shares, together with the shares described in clause (i) are referred to as "excluded shares") and (iii) shares held by
holders of Ultratech common stock, if any, who properly exercise their appraisal rights under the DGCL (which we refer to as "dissenting shares")) in exchange for $21.75
in cash and 0.2675 of a share of Veeco common stock, which is referred to in this proxy statement/prospectus as the merger consideration.

Pro Forma Information 

        The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2016 combine the historical consolidated statements of
operations of Veeco and Ultratech both for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as of December 31,
2016 combines the historical consolidated balance sheet of Veeco as of December 31, 2016 with Ultratech as of December 31, 2016, giving effect to the merger as if it had
occurred on December 31, 2016. The historical consolidated financial information has been adjusted in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information
to give effect to pro forma events that are (i) directly attributable to the merger, (ii) factually supportable and (iii) with respect to the statements of operations, expected to
have a continuing impact on the combined results. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information has been prepared by Veeco using the acquisition
method of accounting in accordance with GAAP.

        The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information should be read in conjunction with the accompanying notes to the unaudited pro forma
condensed combined financial information. In addition, the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information is based on and should be read in conjunction
with the following historical consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes, which are incorporated by reference in this proxy statement/prospectus:

• separate historical financial statements of Veeco as of and for the year ended December 31, 2016, and the related notes included in Veeco's Annual Report
for the year ended December 31, 2016 on Form 10-K and 

• separate historical financial statements of Ultratech as of and for the year ended December 31, 2016, and the related notes included in Ultratech's Annual
Report for the year ended December 31, 2016 on Form 10-K.

        The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information reflects the estimated aggregate consideration of approximately $820.4 million for the
acquisition, as calculated below (in thousands, except number of shares and price per share):

        In accordance with the acquisition method of accounting, the actual consolidated financial statements of Veeco will reflect the Ultratech acquisition only from and
after the date of the completion of the acquisition. Veeco has performed a preliminary valuation analysis of the fair value of Ultratech's assets to be acquired and liabilities
to be assumed. The assets and liabilities of Ultratech have been measured based on various preliminary estimates using assumptions that Veeco believes are reasonable
based on information that is currently available. Differences between these preliminary estimates and the final acquisition accounting will occur, and those differences
could have a material impact on the accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information and the combined company's future results of
operations and financial position. The pro forma adjustments are preliminary and have been made solely for the purpose of providing unaudited pro forma condensed
combined financial statements prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC.

        Veeco intends to commence the necessary valuation and other studies required to complete the acquisition accounting promptly upon consummation of the merger
and will finalize the acquisition accounting as soon as practicable within the required measurement period in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC")
Topic 805, but in no event later than one year following consummation of the merger.

        The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information has been presented for informational purposes only. The unaudited pro forma condensed
combined financial information does not purport to represent the actual results of operations that Veeco and Ultratech would have achieved had the companies been
combined during this period and is not intended to project the future results of operations that the combined company may achieve after the merger. The unaudited pro
forma condensed combined financial information does not reflect the realization of any cost savings following consummation of the merger and also does not reflect any
related restructuring and integration charges to achieve those cost savings or any charges that may be incurred as a result of double trigger change in control provisions that
may be met subsequent to the acquisition.

Cash consideration to be paid to Ultratech shareholders and equity award holders  $ 621,239 
Estimated replacement equity awards attributable to pre-acquisition service  $ 197

* The estimated merger consideration has been determined based on the closing price of Veeco common stock on February 28, 2017.
Pursuant to business combination accounting rules, the final consideration will be based on the number of shares of Ultratech common
stock outstanding and the price of Veeco common stock as of the closing date. The exchange ratio and cash consideration to be paid to
Ultratech shareholders and equity award holders assumes no adjustment to the exchange ratio. See "The Merger Agreement—Merger
Consideration" beginning as page 100 of this proxy statement/prospectus.

NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL INFORMATION 

Note 1. Basis of Pro Forma Presentation 

        The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information is based on Veeco's and Ultratech's historical consolidated financial statements as adjusted to
give effect to the acquisition of Ultratech and the debt issuance Veeco closed in January 2017, the proceeds from which Veeco will use toward satisfaction of the cash
portion of the merger consideration. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2016 give effect to the
Ultratech acquisition as if it had occurred on January 1, 2016. The unaudited condensed combined pro forma balance sheet as of December 31, 2016 gives effect to the
Ultratech acquisition as if it had occurred on December 31, 2016.

        The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information is prepared in accordance with Article 11 of Regulation S-X. The historical financial information
has been adjusted to give effect to transactions that are (i) directly attributable to the merger, (ii) factually supportable and (iii) with respect to the unaudited pro forma
condensed combined statement of operations, expected to have a continuing impact on the operating results of the combined company. The historical information of Veeco
and Ultratech is presented in accordance with GAAP. Veeco is not currently aware of any significant accounting policy differences between Veeco and Ultratech. Certain
reclassification adjustments have been made to conform Ultratech's presentation of financial information to Veeco's presentation (see below). Following the acquisition
and during the ASC Topic 805 measurement period, management will conduct a final review of Ultratech's accounting policies in an effort to determine if differences in
accounting policies require adjustment or reclassification of Ultratech's results of operations or reclassification of assets or liabilities to conform to Veeco's accounting
policies and classifications. As a result of this review, management may identify differences that, when conformed, could have a material impact on this unaudited pro
forma condensed combined financial information.

        The acquisition method of accounting is based on ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations, which uses the fair value concepts defined in ASC Topic 820, Fair Value
Measurements and Disclosures.

        ASC Topic 805 requires, among other things, that assets and liabilities acquired be recognized at their fair values as of the acquisition date. Financial statements of
Veeco issued after completion of the Ultratech acquisition will reflect such fair values, measured as of the acquisition date, which may be different than the estimated fair
values included in this unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information. In addition, ASC Topic 805 establishes that the consideration transferred be
measured at the closing date of the Ultratech acquisition at the then-current fair value, which will likely result in acquisition consideration that is different from the amount
assumed in this unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information.

        ASC Topic 820 defines the term "fair value" and sets forth the valuation requirements for any asset or liability measured at fair value, expands related disclosure
requirements and specifies a hierarchy of valuation techniques based on the nature of the inputs used to develop the fair value measures. Fair value is defined as "the price
that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date." This is an exit price
concept for the valuation of the asset or liability. In addition, market participants are assumed to be buyers and sellers unrelated to Veeco in the principal (or the most
advantageous) market for the asset or liability. Fair value measurements for an asset assume the highest and best use by these market participants. As a result of these
standards, Veeco may be required to record assets which are not intended to be used or sold and/or to value assets at fair value measures that do not reflect Veeco's
intended use of those assets. Many of these fair value measurements can be highly subjective and it is also possible that other professionals, applying reasonable judgment
to the same facts and circumstances, could develop and support a range of alternative estimated amounts.

Table of Contents

        Under ASC Topic 805, acquisition-related transaction costs (such as advisory, legal, valuation, other professional fees) are not included as a component of acquisition
consideration and are excluded from the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations. Such costs will be expensed in the historical statements of
operations in the periods incurred. Veeco expects to incur total acquisition-related transaction costs of approximately $9.9 million and Ultratech expects to incur total
acquisition-related transaction costs of approximately $14.7 million, of which approximately $0.4 million was incurred in 2016.

        The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information are presented solely for informational purposes and are not necessarily indicative of the
combined results of operations or financial position that might have been achieved for the periods or dates indicated, nor is the unaudited pro forma condensed combined
financial information necessarily indicative of the future results of the combined company.

        The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information does not reflect any cost savings from future operating synergies or integration activities, or any
revenue, tax, or other synergies that could result from the acquisition. In addition they do not reflect any related restructuring, severance and integration charges to achieve
those cost savings or any charges that may be incurred as a result of double trigger change in control provisions that may be met subsequent to the acquisition.

        Certain reclassification adjustments presented below have been made to Ultratech's historical balance sheet as of December 31, 2016 and consolidated results of
operations for the year ended December 31, 2016 to conform to Veeco's presentation (in thousands):

Table of Contents

        This preliminary purchase price allocation has been used to prepare pro forma adjustments in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet and
unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations. The final purchase price allocation will be determined when Veeco has completed the detailed
valuations and necessary calculations. The final allocation could differ materially from the preliminary allocation used in the pro forma adjustments. The final allocation
may include (1) changes in fair values of property, plant and equipment, (2) changes in allocations to intangible assets such as technology and customer relationships as
well as goodwill, (3) changes in deferred income taxes, and (4) other changes to assets and liabilities.

        Estimated goodwill represents the excess of the preliminary estimated purchase price over the estimated fair value of the underlying net assets acquired. Estimated
goodwill is not amortized but instead is reviewed for impairment at least annually, absent any indicators of impairment. Goodwill recognized in the merger is not expected
to be deductible for tax purposes.

        Estimated Purchase Consideration Sensitivity.    The table below illustrates the potential impact to the total estimated purchase price for Ultratech resulting from a
10% increase or decrease in the price of Veeco common stock of $27.35 on February 28, 2017. For the purpose of this calculation, the total number of shares and equity
awards (vested and unvested) has been assumed to be the same as in the table above (in thousands):

(a) For pro forma purposes, Veeco has assumed the cash portion of the transaction will be funded with a combination of available cash as well as a borrowing of
approximately $345.0 million under the public offering of Convertible Notes that Veeco completed in January 2017. For a more complete description of Veeco's
Convertible Notes financing for the merger, see Veeco's Current Report on Form 8-K filed on January 18, 2017.

Note 3. Pro Forma Adjustments 

        Balance Sheet Adjustments.    The unaudited pro forma adjustments related to Ultratech included in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet are as
follows (in thousands):

(a) Cash and cash equivalents

(b) Short-term Investments

        This adjustment represents the estimated proceeds from the sale of short-term investments that will be used to finance the acquisition in order to maintain sufficient
cash reserve balances.

(c) Inventory

        This adjustment represents the estimated adjustment to step up Ultratech inventory to a fair value of approximately $57.1 million, an increase of approximately
$6.6 million from the carrying value. The fair value estimate is preliminary and subject to change. The fair value was determined based on the estimated selling price of
the inventory, less the remaining manufacturing and selling costs and a normal profit margin on those manufacturing and selling efforts. After the acquisition, the step-up
in inventory fair value of approximately $6.6 million will increase cost of sales over approximately six months as the inventory is sold. This increase is not reflected in the
pro forma condensed combined statement of operations because it does not have a continuing impact.

(d) Deferred cost of sales

        This adjustment represents the estimated adjustment to Ultratech deferred cost of sales of approximately $0.2 million.

(e) Property, plant and equipment, net

        This adjustment represents the estimated adjustment to step up Ultratech's property and equipment to a fair value of approximately $21.6 million, an increase of
approximately $3.2 million from the carrying value. The fair value estimate is preliminary and subject to change.

Table of Contents

(f) Intangibles

        Identifiable intangible assets and liabilities acquired include developed technology, customer relationships, trademark and trade name, backlog and in-process
research and development. In-process research and development will be accounted for as an indefinite-lived intangible asset until the underlying projects are completed or
abandoned. The fair value of intangible assets is based on Veeco's preliminary valuation as of the deemed acquisition date of December 31, 2016. Estimated useful lives
(where relevant for the purposes of these unaudited pro forma financial statements) are based on the time periods during which the intangibles are expected to result in
incremental cash flows.

(g) Goodwill

        This adjustment represents the preliminary estimated goodwill associated with the acquisition of Ultratech of approximately $208.3 million. Goodwill was calculated
by taking total consideration transferred of $820.4 million less identifiable net assets acquired of $612.1 million.

(h) Accrued liabilities

(i) Customer deposits and deferred revenue

        After the acquisition, this adjustment will not have a continuing impact as the service contracts, extended warranties, and customer deposits are primarily provided
over 12 months and, accordingly, have been excluded from the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations.

COMPARATIVE HISTORICAL AND UNAUDITED PRO FORMA PER SHARE DATA 

        Presented below are Veeco's and Ultratech's historical per share data, unaudited pro forma combined per share data, and unaudited pro forma equivalent data for the
years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014. This information should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and related notes of Veeco and
Ultratech that are incorporated by reference into this proxy statement/prospectus and with the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial data included under the
section entitled "Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information." The pro forma information is presented for illustrative purposes only and is not
necessarily indicative of the operating results or financial position that would have occurred if the merger had been completed as of the beginning of the periods presented
or on the dates presented, nor is it necessarily indicative of the future operating results or financial position of the combined company. The pro forma net income per share
of the combined company is computed by dividing the pro forma net income by the pro forma weighted average number of basic or diluted shares outstanding. The
historical book value per share is computed by dividing total stockholders' equity by the number of diluted shares of common stock outstanding at the end of the period.
The pro forma book value per share of the combined company is computed by dividing total pro forma stockholders' equity by the pro forma number of shares of common
stock outstanding at the end of the period. The unaudited pro forma equivalent share data was calculated by multiplying the unaudited pro forma combined company
common share amounts by the exchange ratio of 0.2675.

Recent Closing Prices and Comparative Market Price Information 

        Shares of Veeco's common stock are listed for trading on Nasdaq under the symbol "VECO" and shares of Ultratech common stock are listed for trading on Nasdaq
under the symbol "UTEK". The following table sets forth the closing sales prices of a share of Veeco common stock (as reported on Nasdaq) and of Ultratech common
stock (as reported on Nasdaq), each on February 1, 2017, the last trading day before the day on which Veeco and Ultratech announced the execution of the merger
agreement, and on April 21, 2017, the last practicable trading day before the date of this proxy statement/prospectus.

        The market prices of Veeco common stock and Ultratech common stock will fluctuate before the special meeting and before the merger is consummated. The price of
Veeco common stock at the closing will not be known at the time of the special meeting and may be more or less than the current price of Veeco common stock or the price
of Veeco common stock at the time of the special meeting. Based on the closing stock price of Veeco common stock on Nasdaq on February 1, 2017 of $25.75, the value of
the stock consideration was $6.89. Based on the closing stock price of Veeco common stock on Nasdaq on April 21, 2017, the latest practicable date before the mailing of
this proxy statement/prospectus, of $31.00, the value of the stock consideration was $8.29. We urge you to obtain current market quotations for shares of Veeco common
stock and Ultratech common stock. You should obtain current stock price quotations from a newspaper, the Internet or your broker or banker.

Dividend Policy 

        Veeco's Dividend Policy.    Veeco has never declared or paid any cash dividends on its common stock. The Veeco board will determine future dividend policy based
on Veeco's consolidated results of operations, financial condition, capital requirements, and other circumstances. The merger agreement prohibits Veeco from authorizing
or paying dividends or making distributions on its capital stock, so Veeco does not expect to pay dividends for as long as the merger agreement is in effect.

        Ultratech's Dividend Policy.    Ultratech has never declared or paid any cash dividends on its common stock. The merger agreement prohibits Ultratech from
authorizing or paying dividends or making distributions on its capital stock, so Ultratech does not expect to pay dividends for as long as the merger agreement is in effect.

RISK FACTORS 

        In addition to the other information included and incorporated by reference in this proxy statement/prospectus, including the matters addressed in the section entitled
"Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" beginning on page 46 of this proxy statement/prospectus, you should carefully consider the following risks before
deciding whether to vote for the adoption of the merger agreement. In addition, you should read and consider the risks associated with each of the businesses of Veeco and
Ultratech because these risks will also affect Veeco after the merger. These risks can be found in the Annual Reports on Form 10-K for Veeco for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2016, and for Ultratech for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, and any amendments thereto, as such risks may be updated or supplemented in each
company's subsequently filed Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and Annual Reports on Form 10-K, which are, or will be, incorporated by
reference into this proxy statement/prospectus. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks and uncertainties the parties may face. Additional risks and
uncertainties not presently known to the parties, or that the parties currently consider immaterial, could also negatively affect the business, financial condition, results of
operations, prospects, profits and stock prices of Veeco (including after the merger) or Ultratech. You should also read and consider the other information in this proxy
statement/prospectus and the other documents incorporated by reference in this proxy statement/prospectus. See the section entitled "Where You Can Find More Information"
beginning on page 143 of this proxy statement/prospectus.

Risk Factors Relating to the Merger 

Because the stock consideration is based on a fixed exchange ratio and the market price of Veeco common stock will fluctuate, Ultratech stockholders cannot be sure of the
merger consideration they will receive at the time of the special meeting or at any time prior to the closing of the merger.

        Upon completion of the merger, each share of Ultratech common stock will be converted into the right to receive merger consideration consisting of shares of Veeco
common stock and cash pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement. As of April 21, 2017, the latest practicable date before the mailing of this proxy statement/prospectus, the
per share value of the merger consideration to be received by Ultratech stockholders was equal to approximately $30.04, which includes (i) $21.75 in cash, without interest, and
(ii) 0.2675 shares of Veeco common stock, subject to adjustment in certain cases as further discussed under the section entitled "The Merger Agreement—The Merger" beginning
on page 100 of this proxy statement/prospectus. The total value of the merger consideration that an Ultratech stockholder will receive upon completion of the merger will depend
on the price of Veeco common stock as of the effective time. This price may vary from the closing price of Veeco common stock on the date we announced the merger, on the
date that this proxy statement/prospectus was mailed to Ultratech stockholders, on the date of the special meeting and on the closing date. Any change in the market price of
Veeco common stock prior to completion of the merger will affect the total value of the merger consideration that an Ultratech stockholder will receive upon completion of the
merger. Accordingly, at the time of the special meeting, Ultratech stockholders will not necessarily know or be able to calculate the total value of the merger consideration they
would receive upon completion of the merger. Neither company is permitted to terminate the merger agreement or resolicit the vote of Ultratech's stockholders solely because of
changes in the market prices of either company's stock. Stock price changes may result from a variety of factors, including general market and economic conditions, changes in
our respective businesses, operations and prospects, and regulatory considerations. Many of these factors are beyond our control. You should obtain current market quotations for
shares of Veeco common stock and for shares of Ultratech common stock.

The market price of Veeco common stock after the merger will fluctuate and may be affected by factors different from those affecting shares of Ultratech stock or Veeco stock
currently.

        Upon completion of the merger, Ultratech stockholders will become Veeco stockholders. The market price of Veeco common stock may fluctuate significantly following
consummation of the merger and Ultratech stockholders could lose the value of their investment in Veeco common stock. In addition, the stock market has experienced
significant price and volume fluctuations in recent times which could have a material adverse effect on the market for, or liquidity of, the Veeco common stock, regardless of
Veeco's actual operating performance. In addition, the results of operations of the combined company and the market price of Veeco common stock after the completion of the
merger may be affected by factors different from those currently affecting the independent results of operations of each of Veeco and Ultratech. For a discussion of the businesses
of Veeco and Ultratech and of some important factors to consider in connection with those businesses, see the documents incorporated by reference into this proxy
statement/prospectus and referred to in the section entitled "Where You Can Find More Information" beginning on page 143 of this proxy statement/prospectus.

Sales of shares of Veeco common stock after the completion of the transaction may cause the market price of Veeco common stock to fall.

        Based on the number of outstanding shares of Ultratech common stock as of April 21, 2017, the latest practicable date before the mailing of this proxy statement/prospectus,
Veeco would issue approximately 7,288,094 shares of Veeco common stock in connection with the merger. Many Ultratech stockholders may decide not to hold the shares of
Veeco common stock they will receive in the merger. Other Ultratech stockholders may be required to sell the shares of Veeco common stock that they receive in the merger.
Such sales of Veeco common stock could have the effect of depressing the market price for Veeco common stock and may take place promptly following the merger.

The merger is subject to a number of conditions, some of which are outside of the parties' control, and, if these conditions are not satisfied, the merger agreement may be
terminated and the merger may not be completed.

        The merger agreement contains a number of conditions that must be fulfilled to complete the merger. These conditions include, among others, adoption by Ultratech
stockholders of the merger agreement; the absence of any temporary restraining order, preliminary or permanent injunction or other judgment issued by any court of competent
jurisdiction pending or in effect that would enjoin or otherwise prohibit the consummation of the merger; the Form S-4 of which this proxy statement/prospectus forms a part
having been declared effective by the SEC under the 1933 Act, no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Form S-4 having been issued by the SEC and no proceedings for
that purpose having been initiated by the SEC; authorization by Nasdaq for listing of the shares of Veeco common stock to be issued in the merger; accuracy of representations
and warranties of the parties to the applicable standard provided by the merger agreement; no "Company Material Adverse Effect" or "Parent Material Adverse Effect" (each as
defined in the merger agreement) having occurred since the date of the merger agreement and performance by the parties with all of their obligations required to be performed by
the merger agreement in all material respects.

        The required satisfaction of the foregoing conditions could delay the completion of the merger for a significant period of time or prevent it from occurring. Any delay in
completing the merger could cause Veeco not to realize some or all of the benefits that the parties expect Veeco to achieve following the merger. Further, there can be no
assurance that the conditions to closing will be satisfied or waived or that the merger will be completed.

        In addition, if the merger is not completed by October 30, 2017 (subject to a potential extension if Veeco or Ultratech brings a suit, action or proceeding to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions

of the merger agreement), either Veeco or Ultratech may choose to terminate the merger agreement. Veeco or Ultratech may also elect to terminate the merger agreement in
certain other circumstances, and the parties can mutually decide to terminate the merger agreement at any time prior to the effective time, before or after approval by Ultratech's
stockholders, as applicable. See the section entitled "The Merger Agreement—Termination of the Merger Agreement" beginning on page 121 of this proxy statement/prospectus
for a more detailed description of these circumstances.

Failure to complete the merger could negatively affect the share prices and the future business and financial results of either or both of Veeco and Ultratech.

        If the merger is not completed, the ongoing businesses of either or both of Veeco and Ultratech may be adversely affected. Additionally, if the merger is not completed and
the merger agreement is terminated, in certain circumstances Ultratech may be required to pay Veeco a termination fee of $26.5 million. See the sections entitled "The Merger
Agreement—Termination of the Merger Agreement" beginning on page 121 of this proxy statement/prospectus and "The Merger Agreement—Termination Fee Payable by
Ultratech" beginning on page 123 of this proxy statement/prospectus for a more detailed description of these circumstances. In addition, Veeco and Ultratech have incurred and
will continue to incur significant transaction expenses in connection with the merger regardless of whether the merger is completed. Furthermore, Veeco or Ultratech may
experience negative reactions from the financial markets, including negative impacts on their stock prices, or negative reactions from their customers, suppliers or other business
partners, should the merger not be completed.

        The foregoing risks, or other risks arising in connection with the failure to consummate the merger, including the diversion of management attention from conducting the
business of the respective companies and pursuing other opportunities during the pendency of the merger, may have a material adverse effect on the businesses, operations,
financial results and stock prices of Veeco and Ultratech. Either or both of Veeco or Ultratech could also be subject to litigation related to any failure to consummate the merger
or any related action that could be brought to enforce a party's obligations under the merger agreement.

Litigation against Veeco and Ultratech, or the members of the Ultratech board, could prevent or delay the completion of the merger or result in the payment of damages
following completion of the merger.

        As further discussed in the section entitled "Litigation Related to the Merger" beginning on page 99 of this proxy statement/prospectus, there have been two purported class
actions filed by Ultratech shareholders related to the merger. While Ultratech and Veeco believe that the claims asserted in these actions are without merit, the results of any such
potential legal proceedings are difficult to predict, and could delay or prevent the merger from becoming effective in a timely manner. The existence of litigation related to the
merger could affect the likelihood of obtaining the required approval from Ultratech stockholders. Moreover, any litigation could be time consuming and expensive, could divert
Veeco's and Ultratech's management's attention away from their regular business and, if any lawsuit is adversely resolved against either Veeco, Ultratech or members of the
Ultratech board (each of whom Ultratech is required to indemnify pursuant to indemnification agreements), could have a material adverse effect on Veeco's or Ultratech's
financial condition.

        One of the conditions to closing is that no temporary restraining order, preliminary or permanent injunction or other judgment issued by any court of competent jurisdiction
shall be pending or in effect that would enjoin or otherwise prohibit the consummation of the merger. Consequently, if a settlement or other resolution is not reached in any
lawsuit that is filed and a claimant secures injunctive or other relief prohibiting, delaying or otherwise adversely affecting Veeco's and/or Ultratech's ability to complete the
merger on the terms contemplated by the merger agreement, then such injunctive or other relief may prevent the merger from becoming effective in a timely manner or at all.

Table of Contents

The merger agreement contains provisions that limit Ultratech's ability to pursue alternatives to the merger, could discourage a potential competing acquiror of Ultratech
from making an alternative acquisition proposal and, in specified circumstances, could require Ultratech to pay a termination fee to Veeco.

        The merger agreement provides that Ultratech will not, and will cause each of its subsidiaries and its and their respective officers, directors, employees, and investment
bankers, attorneys, accounts and other advisors retained by Ultratech or its subsidiaries not to, directly or indirectly, subject to certain exceptions set forth in the merger
agreement related to certain unsolicited offers, (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly facilitate or encourage the submission of any proposals related to any alternative transaction,
(ii) enter into or participate in any discussions or negotiations with, or furnish any non-public information or access relating to Ultratech or any of its subsidiaries to, any person
with respect to an a proposal for an alternative transaction or any inquiry or proposal that could reasonably be expected to lead to a proposal for an alternative transaction or
(iii) enter into any agreement in principle, letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, merger agreement, acquisition agreement or other similar agreement relating to a
proposal for an alternative transaction. If the merger agreement is terminated by (i) Veeco prior to obtaining the Ultratech stockholder approval because the Ultratech board has
effected a change of its recommendation in favor of the merger or (ii) by Ultratech prior to the receipt of the Ultratech stockholder approval in order to enter into an alternative
acquisition agreement that meets certain requirements set forth in the agreement, then Ultratech will be required to pay a termination fee of $26.5 million to Veeco.

        These provisions could discourage a potential third-party acquiror or merger partner that might have an interest in acquiring all or a significant portion of Ultratech or
pursuing an alternative transaction from considering or proposing such a transaction, even if it were prepared to pay consideration with a higher per share cash or market value
than the consideration in the merger, or might result in a potential third-party acquiror or merger partner proposing to pay a lower price to Ultratech stockholders than it might
otherwise have proposed to pay because of the added expense of the termination fee that may become payable in certain circumstances.

        If the merger agreement is terminated and Ultratech determines to seek another business combination, Ultratech may not be able to negotiate a transaction with another party
on terms comparable to, or better than, the terms of the merger.

Until the completion of the merger or the termination of the merger agreement in accordance with its terms, in consideration of the agreements made by the parties in the
merger agreement, Ultratech is prohibited from entering into certain transactions and taking certain actions that might otherwise be beneficial to Ultratech and its
stockholders.

        Until the merger is completed, the merger agreement restricts Ultratech from taking specified actions without the consent of Veeco, and requires Ultratech to operate in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice. These restrictions may prevent Ultratech from making appropriate changes to its businesses, retaining or expanding its
workforces, paying dividends or pursuing attractive business opportunities that may arise prior to the completion of the merger. See the section entitled "The Merger Agreement
—Conduct of Businesses of Ultratech and Veeco Prior to Completion of the Merger" beginning on page 108 of this proxy statement/prospectus for a description of the restrictive
covenants applicable to Ultratech.

The opinion of Ultratech's financial advisor does not reflect changes in circumstances that may occur between the original signing of the merger agreement and the
completion of the merger.

        Consistent with market practices, the Ultratech board has not obtained an updated opinion from its financial advisor as of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus and
does not expect to receive an updated, revised or reaffirmed opinion prior to the completion of the merger. Changes in the

operations and prospects of Ultratech, general market and economic conditions and other factors that may be beyond the control of Ultratech, and on which Ultratech's financial
advisor's opinion was based, may significantly alter the value of Ultratech or the price of shares or Ultratech common stock by the time the merger is completed. The opinion
does not speak as of the time the merger will be completed or as of any date other than the date of such opinion. Because Ultratech's financial advisor will not be updating its
opinion, the opinion will not address the fairness of the merger consideration from a financial point of view at the time the merger is completed. The Ultratech board's
recommendation that Ultratech stockholders vote "FOR" the Merger Proposal, however, is made as of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus. For a description of the opinion
that the Ultratech board received from its financial advisor, see the section entitled "The Merger—Opinion of Ultratech's Financial Advisor" beginning on page 75 of this proxy
statement/prospectus.

The merger will involve substantial costs.

        Veeco and Ultratech have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, substantial non-recurring costs associated with the merger and combining the operations of the two
companies. The substantial majority of non-recurring expenses will be comprised of transaction costs related to the merger.

        Veeco also will incur transaction fees and costs related to formulating and implementing integration plans, including technology platforms, sourcing operations and supply
chain operations. Veeco continues to assess the magnitude of these costs, and additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the merger and the integration of the two
companies' businesses. Although Veeco expects that the elimination of duplicative costs, as well as the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses,
should allow Veeco to offset integration-related costs over time, this net benefit may not be achieved in the near term, or at all. See the risk factor entitled "If the merger is
consummated, Veeco may not be able to successfully integrate the business of Ultratech with its own or realize the anticipated benefits of the merger" below.

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements included in this document are preliminary and the actual financial condition and results of operations
after the merger may differ materially.

        The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements in this document are presented for illustrative purposes only and are not necessarily indicative of what
Veeco's actual financial condition or results of operations would have been had the merger been completed on the dates indicated. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined
financial statements reflect adjustments, which are based upon assumptions and preliminary estimates, to record the Ultratech's identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed
at fair value and the resulting goodwill recognized. The purchase price allocation reflected in this document is preliminary, and final allocation of the purchase price will be based
upon the actual purchase price and the fair value of the assets and liabilities of Ultratech as of the date of the completion of the merger. Accordingly, the final acquisition
accounting adjustments may differ materially from the pro forma adjustments reflected in this document. For more information, see the sections entitled "Summary Unaudited
Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements" and "Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements" of this proxy statement/prospectus.

Ultratech stockholders have appraisal rights under Delaware law.

        Under Delaware law holders of Ultratech common stock who (1) do not vote in favor of the Merger Proposal, (2) deliver to Ultratech a written demand for appraisal prior to
the date of the Ultratech special meeting, (3) continuously hold their shares of Ultratech common stock though the closing date and (4) otherwise comply with the requirements
and procedures of Section 262 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the "DGCL"), are entitled to exercise appraisal rights, which generally entitle stockholders to receive
in lieu of the merger consideration a cash payment of an

amount determined by the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (the "Court of Chancery") to be the fair value of their Ultratech common stock. The appraised value would
be determined by the Court of Chancery and could be less than, the same as or more than the merger consideration. Under Delaware law, stockholders are generally entitled to
statutory interest on an appraisal award at a rate equal to 5% above the Federal Reserve discount rate compounded quarterly from the closing date until the award is actually paid.
Stockholders who have properly demanded appraisal rights must file a petition for appraisal with the Court of Chancery within 120 days after the effective date of the merger.
Should a material number of Ultratech's stockholders exercise appraisal rights and should the Court determine that the fair value of such shares of Ultratech common stock is
materially greater than the merger consideration, it could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and results of operation of the surviving corporation. A
summary description of the appraisal rights available to holders of Ultratech common stock under the DGCL and the procedures required to exercise statutory appraisal rights are
included under the section entitled "The Merger—Appraisal Rights" beginning on page 95 of this proxy statement/prospectus. The full text of Section 262 of the DGCL is
attached as Annex C to this proxy statement/prospectus. Due to the complexity of the procedures described above, Ultratech stockholders who are considering exercising such
rights are encouraged to seek the advice of legal counsel.

After the merger, Ultratech stockholders will have a significantly lower ownership and voting interest in Veeco than they currently have in Ultratech, and will exercise less
influence over management.

        Based on the number of shares of Ultratech common stock outstanding as of April 17, 2017, and the number of shares of Veeco common stock outstanding as of April 17,
2017, it is expected that, immediately after completion of the merger, former Ultratech stockholders will own approximately 15% of the outstanding shares of Veeco common
stock. Consequently, Ultratech stockholders will have substantially less influence over the management and policies of Veeco than they currently have over Ultratech.

Some of the executive officers and directors of Ultratech have interests in seeing the merger completed that are different from, or in addition to, those of the other Ultratech
stockholders. Therefore, some of the executive officers and directors of Ultratech may have a conflict of interest in recommending the proposals being voted on at the special
meeting.

        Certain of the executive officers of Ultratech have arrangements that provide them with interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, those of stockholders
of Ultratech generally. These interests include, among others, the possible continued employment of certain executive officers, the acceleration of vesting of certain equity-based
awards (which awards might not otherwise ever vest), enhanced severance payments and/or benefits, and/or continuation of certain indemnification insurance in connection with
the merger. These interests may influence Ultratech's executive officers to support or approve the proposals to be presented at the special meeting.

        In addition, certain directors of Ultratech have interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, those of stockholders of Ultratech generally, including, the
acceleration of vesting of certain equity-based awards (which awards might not otherwise ever vest). These interests may influence the directors of Ultratech to support or
approve the proposals to be presented at the special meeting.

        See the section entitled "The Merger—Interests of Ultratech's Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger" beginning on page 88 of this proxy statement/prospectus for a
more detailed description of these interests.

The shares of Veeco common stock to be received by Ultratech stockholders as a result of the merger will have different rights from the shares of Ultratech common stock.

        Upon completion of the merger, Ultratech stockholders will become stockholders of Veeco and their rights as stockholders will be governed by the Veeco charter and the
Veeco bylaws. The rights associated with Ultratech common stock are different from the rights associated with shares of Veeco common stock. See the section entitled
"Comparison of Stockholders' Rights" beginning on page 135 of this proxy statement/prospectus.

Risk Factors Related to Veeco Following the Merger 

If the merger is consummated, Veeco may not be able to successfully integrate the business of Ultratech with its own or realize the anticipated benefits of the merger.

        The merger involves the combination of two companies that currently operate as independent public companies. The combined company will be required to devote
significant management attention and resources to integrating Veeco's business practices with those of Ultratech. Potential difficulties that the combined company may encounter
as part of the integration process include the following:

• the inability to successfully combine Veeco's business with Ultratech in a manner that permits the combined company to achieve the full revenue and cost
synergies and other benefits anticipated to result from the merger; 

• the loss of customers and strategic partners who may not wish to continue their relationships with the combined company; 

• required regulatory approvals from governmental entities may result in limitations, additional costs or placement of restrictions on the conduct of the combined
company, imposition of additional material costs on or materially limiting the revenues of the combined company following the merger; 

• complexities associated with managing the combined businesses, including difficulty addressing possible differences in corporate cultures and management
philosophies and the challenge of integrating complex systems, technology, networks and other assets of each of the companies in a seamless manner that
minimizes any adverse impact on customers, suppliers, employees and other business partners; and 

• potential unknown liabilities and unforeseen increased expenses or delays associated with the merger.

        In addition, Veeco has operated and, until the completion of the merger will continue to operate, independently. It is possible that the integration process could result in the
diversion of the attention of Veeco's management and the disruption of, or the loss of momentum in, its ongoing business. These and other factors could adversely affect Veeco's
ability to maintain relationships with customers, suppliers, employees and other partners, and its ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger.

The combined company's actual financial position and results of operations may differ materially from the unaudited pro forma financial information included in this proxy
statement/prospectus.

        The unaudited pro forma financial information contained in this proxy statement/prospectus is presented for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the
operating results or financial position that would have occurred if the transactions had been consummated at the beginning of the earliest period presented, nor is it necessarily
indicative of future operating results or financial position of the combined company. In particular, the unaudited pro forma financial information was prepared under one set of
assumptions, does not reflect the benefits of expected cost savings (or

associated costs to achieve such savings), opportunities to earn additional revenue, or other factors that may result as a consequence of the merger, and does not attempt to predict
or suggest future results. The unaudited pro forma financial information has been derived from the audited and unaudited historical financial statements of Veeco and Ultratech,
and certain adjustments, estimates and assumptions have been made regarding the combined company after giving effect to the merger.

        Furthermore, the process of preparing the unaudited pro forma financial information required management of Veeco and Ultratech to make certain assumptions and
estimates, which may prove to be incorrect as additional information becomes available and as additional analyses are performed, and other factors may affect the combined
company's financial condition or results of operations following the closing of the merger. Any material variances between the preliminary estimates used in the preparation of
the unaudited pro forma financial information and the final acquisition accounting could have a material adverse impact on the unaudited pro forma financial information and the
combined company's financial position and future results of operations, which could have a material adverse effect on the market price of the combined company's common
stock. See "Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information" beginning on page 21 of this proxy statement/prospectus.

Other Risk Factors of Veeco and Ultratech 

        Veeco's and Ultratech's businesses are and will be subject to the risks described above. In addition, Veeco and Ultratech are, and will continue to be, subject to the risks
described in Veeco's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, and Ultratech's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2016, as amended and as updated by subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K, all of which are, or will be, filed with the
SEC and incorporated by reference into this proxy statement/prospectus. See the section entitled "Where You Can Find More Information" beginning on page 143 of this proxy

and Veeco 's expected financial performance, as well as Ultratech's and Veeco's strategic and operational plans. Actual events or results may differ materially from those
described in this proxy statement/prospectus due to a number of risks and uncertainties. The potential risks and uncertainties include, among others, the possibility that Ultratech
may be unable to obtain required stockholder approval or that other conditions to closing the transaction may not be satisfied, such that the transaction will not close or that the
closing may be delayed; the reaction of customers to the transaction; general economic conditions; the transaction may involve unexpected costs, liabilities or delays; risks that
the transaction disrupts current plans and operations of the parties to the transaction; the ability to recognize the benefits of the transaction; the amount of the costs, fees, expenses
and charges related to the transaction and the actual terms of any financings that will be obtained for the transaction; the outcome of any legal proceedings related to the
transaction; the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could give rise to the termination of the transaction agreement. In addition, please refer to the
documents that Veeco and Ultratech file with the SEC on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K. The filings by Veeco and Ultratech identify and address other important factors that could
cause its financial and operational results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements set forth in this proxy statement/prospectus. All forward-
looking statements speak only as of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus or, in the case of any document incorporated by reference, the date of that document. Neither
Veeco nor Ultratech is under any duty to update any of the forward-looking statements after the date of this proxy statement/prospectus to conform to actual results.

THE ULTRATECH SPECIAL MEETING 

Date, Time and Location 

        The special meeting of Ultratech stockholders will be held on May 25, 2017 at 2:00 p.m., local time, at the offices of O'Melveny & Myers LLP, located at 2765 Sand Hill
Road, Menlo Park, California 94025.

Purpose 

        At the special meeting, holders of Ultratech common stock as of the record date will be asked to consider and approve the following proposals:

        1.    The Merger Proposal:    The proposal to adopt the merger agreement, which provides for the merger of Merger Subsidiary with and into Ultratech, with Ultratech
surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Veeco.

        2.    The Compensation Proposal:    The proposal to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation payments that will or may be made to Ultratech's named
executive officers in connection with the merger.

        3.    The Adjournment Proposal:    The proposal to approve the adjournment of the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are not
sufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the Merger Proposal.

        The approval of the Merger Proposal by Ultratech stockholders is a condition to the obligations of Veeco and Ultratech to complete the merger. The approval, on a non-
binding, advisory basis, of the Compensation Proposal is not a condition to the obligations of Veeco or Ultratech to complete the merger. The approval of the Adjournment
Proposal also is not a condition to the obligation of Veeco or Ultratech to complete the merger.

        Ultratech will transact no other business at the special meeting, except for business properly brought before the special meeting or any adjournment or postponement.

Recommendation of the Ultratech Board 

        The Ultratech board unanimously (1) determined that the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby are fair to and in the best interests of Ultratech's
stockholders, (2) approved and declared advisable the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, (3) resolved, subject to section 6.03 of the merger agreement,
to recommend adoption of the merger agreement by Ultratech's stockholders, all upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, and (4) resolved that, subject to
section 6.03 of the merger agreement, it will advise Ultratech's stockholders of its recommendation to adopt the merger agreement in accordance with the terms of the merger
agreement and to include such recommendation in this proxy statement/prospectus.

        Accordingly, the Ultratech board recommends that Ultratech stockholders vote:

1. "FOR" Proposal 1 to approve the Merger Proposal; 

2. "FOR" Proposal 2 to approve the Compensation Proposal; and 

3. "FOR" Proposal 3 to approve the Adjournment Proposal.

Record Date and Quorum 

        The Ultratech board has fixed the close of business on April 20, 2017 as the record date. Stockholders of record as of the record date are entitled to notice of and to vote at
the special meeting. As of the close of business on the record date, 27,242,013 shares of Ultratech common stock

were issued and outstanding and there were 166 holders of record of Ultratech common stock. Each stockholder is entitled to one vote for each share of Ultratech common stock
held by such stockholder as of the record date.

        Holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Ultratech common stock entitled to vote as of the record date must be present in person or represented by proxy at the
special meeting in order to have the required quorum for transacting business. Abstentions are counted as present for purposes of determining the presence or absence of a
quorum for the transaction of business. Broker non-votes are not entitled to vote and, therefore, are not included for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present at the
special meeting.

        If you sell or transfer your shares of Ultratech common stock after the record date but before the special meeting, you will retain your right to vote such shares of Ultratech
common stock at the special meeting unless you have transferred these rights via proxy to the acquirer of your shares. You are urged to vote by completing, signing, dating and
mailing the enclosed proxy card in the envelope provided, or by Internet or telephone by following the instructions on the enclosed proxy card. If your shares of Ultratech
common stock are held in the name of your broker, bank or other nominee, you should submit voting instructions to your broker, bank or other nominee. Please refer to the voting
instruction card included in these proxy materials by your broker, bank or other nominee.

Required Vote 

        The affirmative vote, in person or by proxy, of holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Ultratech common stock entitled to vote as of the record date is required to
approve the Merger Proposal (Proposal 1). The affirmative vote, in person or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the shares of Ultratech common stock present in person or
represented by proxy at the special meeting and entitled to vote on the matter is required to approve the Compensation Proposal (Proposal 2) and to approve the Adjournment
Proposal (Proposal 3).

        Votes may be cast in favor of, or against, each matter. You may also vote "ABSTAIN" with respect to any matter and such abstentions will be treated as shares present in
person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on that matter and thus will have the same effect as votes against the proposals.

        If your shares of Ultratech common stock are held by a broker, bank or other nominee, such broker, bank or other nominee is only entitled to vote your shares on routine
matters, such as the ratification of the appointment of an independent registered public accounting firm, without instructions from you, the beneficial owner of those shares. Your
broker, bank or other nominee is not entitled to vote shares held for a beneficial owner on non-routine matters, such as approval of the Merger Proposal, approval, on a non-
binding, advisory basis, of the Compensation Proposal, and approval of the Adjournment Proposal. Consequently, if you do not give your broker, bank or other nominee
specific instructions, your shares will not be voted at the special meeting. You are encouraged to provide instructions to your broker. This ensures your shares will be
voted at the special meeting.

        Failures to vote (whether by proxy or in person at the special meeting) and broker non-votes, if any, will have the same effect as a vote against the Merger Proposal. Failing
to vote (whether by proxy or in person at the special meeting, if you do not attend the special meeting) and broker non-votes, if any, will have no effect on the outcome of the
vote for the Compensation Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal, assuming a quorum is present. If you attend the special meeting and fail to vote, this will have the same effect
as a vote against the Compensation Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal.

Share Ownership and Voting by Ultratech Directors and Executive Officers 

        As of the record date, the directors and executive officers of Ultratech held and are entitled to vote, in the aggregate, approximately 3.4% of the aggregate voting power of
the outstanding shares of Ultratech common stock.

Voting of Shares 

For Stockholders of Record:

        In addition to voting in person at the special meeting, if your shares of Ultratech common stock are held in your name by Ultratech's transfer agent as a stockholder of
record, you, as an Ultratech stockholder, may submit a proxy as follows:

• By Internet.  The web address and instructions for Internet proxy submission can be found on the enclosed proxy card. You will be required to provide your
assigned control number located on the proxy card. Internet proxy submission via the web address indicated on the enclosed proxy card is available 24 hours a
day. If you choose to submit your proxy by Internet, then you do not need to return the proxy card. To be valid, your Internet proxy must be received by 11:59
p.m. (U.S. Eastern Time) on the day preceding the special meeting. 

• By Telephone.  The toll-free number for telephone proxy submission can be found on the enclosed proxy card. You will be required to provide your assigned
control number located on the proxy card. Telephone proxy submission is available 24 hours a day. If you choose to submit your proxy by telephone, then you do
not need to return the proxy card. To be valid, your telephone proxy must be received by 11:59 p.m. (U.S. Eastern Time) on the day preceding the special meeting.

• By Mail.  Mark the enclosed proxy card, sign and date it, and return it in the pre-addressed postage-paid envelope provided with the enclosed proxy card, all in
accordance with the instructions on the enclosed proxy card. To be valid, your proxy by mail must be received prior to the special meeting.

        Ultratech requests that Ultratech stockholders submit their proxies over the Internet, by telephone or by completing and signing the accompanying proxy and returning it to
Ultratech as soon as possible in the enclosed postage-paid envelope. When the accompanying proxy is returned properly executed (including proper proxy submission by Internet
or telephone), the shares of Ultratech common stock represented by it will be voted at the special meeting in accordance with the instructions contained on the proxy card.

        If you sign and return your proxy or voting instruction card without indicating how to vote on any particular proposal, the Ultratech common stock represented by your
proxy will be voted "FOR" each proposal in accordance with the recommendation of the Ultratech board. Unless you check the box on your proxy card to withhold discretionary
authority, the proxy holders may use their discretion to vote on the proposals relating to the special meeting.

        If your shares of Ultratech common stock are held in "street name" by a broker, bank or other nominee, you should check the voting form used by that firm to determine
whether you may give voting instructions by telephone or the Internet and you should read the information in the section entitled "—Voting of Shares—For Beneficial Owners"
below.

        EVERY ULTRATECH STOCKHOLDER'S VOTE IS IMPORTANT. ACCORDINGLY, EACH ULTRATECH STOCKHOLDER SHOULD SUBMIT ITS PROXY VIA
THE INTERNET OR BY TELEPHONE, OR SIGN, DATE AND RETURN THE ENCLOSED PROXY CARD, WHETHER OR NOT THE ULTRATECH STOCKHOLDER
PLANS TO ATTEND THE SPECIAL MEETING IN PERSON.

Table of Contents

For Beneficial Owners:

        If your shares of Ultratech common stock are held in "street name" by a broker, bank or other nominee, you have the right to direct your broker, bank or other nominee on
how to vote your shares of Ultratech common stock. Your broker, bank or other nominee, as applicable, may establish an earlier deadline by which you must provide instructions
to it for how to vote your shares of Ultratech common stock. You should read carefully the materials provided to you by your broker, bank or other nominee. Because a beneficial
owner is not the stockholder of record, you may not vote these shares of Ultratech common stock at the special meeting unless you obtain a "legal proxy" from the broker, bank
or other nominee that holds your shares of Ultratech common stock giving you the right to vote such shares of Ultratech common stock at the special meeting.

Revocation of Proxies 

        If you are a stockholder of record as of the record date, you may change your vote:

• by delivering to Ultratech (Attention: Corporate Secretary, 3050 Zanker Road, San Jose, California 95134), prior to your shares being voted at the special meeting,
a later dated written notice of revocation or a later dated duly executed proxy card, or 

• by attending the special meeting and voting in person (although attendance at the special meeting will not, by itself, revoke a proxy).

        A stockholder of record who has voted on the Internet or by telephone may also change his or her vote by subsequently making a timely and valid Internet or telephone vote.

        If you are a beneficial owner of shares held in "street name" by a broker, bank or other nominee, you may revoke your proxy and vote your shares in person at the special
meeting only in accordance with applicable rules and procedures as employed by such broker, bank or other nominee. If your shares are held in an account at a broker, bank or
other nominee, you should contact your broker, bank or other nominee to change your vote.

Solicitation of Proxies; Costs of Solicitation 

        Your proxy is being solicited by the Ultratech board on behalf of Ultratech. Ultratech will bear the entire cost of proxy solicitation, including preparation, assembly, printing
and mailing of the notice of special meeting, proxy card, this proxy statement/prospectus and any additional materials furnished to Ultratech stockholders. Copies of these
materials will be furnished to brokerage houses, fiduciaries, and custodians holding shares in their names that are beneficially owned by others to forward to those beneficial
owners. In addition, Ultratech may reimburse the costs of forwarding these materials to those beneficial owners.

        Solicitation of proxies by mail may be supplemented by one or more of telephone, email, facsimile, or personal solicitation by Ultratech's directors, officers, or regular
employees. No additional compensation will be paid for such services.

        Ultratech has engaged D.F. King & Co., Inc. to aid in the solicitation of proxies from brokers, bank nominees and other institutional owners for approximately $10,000, plus
reimbursement of related expenses.

Adjournments and Postponements 

        In addition to the Merger Proposal and the Compensation Proposal, Ultratech stockholders are being asked to approve the Adjournment Proposal, which will give the
Ultratech board authority to adjourn the special meeting one or more times, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes to approve the
Merger Proposal at the time of the special meeting.

        If this proposal is approved, the special meeting could be adjourned to any date. If the special meeting is adjourned, Ultratech stockholders who have already submitted their
proxies will be able to revoke them at any time prior to their use. If you sign and return a proxy and do not indicate how you wish to vote on any proposal, or if you indicate that
you wish to vote in favor of the Merger Proposal but do not indicate a choice on the Adjournment Proposal, your shares of Ultratech common stock will be voted "FOR" the
Adjournment Proposal.

        If a quorum is not present or represented at the special meeting, then either (1) the chairman of the meeting or (2) the Ultratech stockholders entitled to vote at the special
meeting, present in person or represented by proxy, shall have power to adjourn the meeting. Whether or not a quorum is present at the special meeting, the chairman of the
meeting shall have power to adjourn the special meeting from time to time to another time or place or means of remote communications, without notice other than announcement
at the special meeting of the time and place, if any, and the means of remote communications, if any, by which Ultratech stockholders and proxy holders may be deemed to be
present in person and vote at such adjourned meeting. When a special meeting is adjourned to another time and place, unless the Ultratech bylaws otherwise require, notice need
not be given of the adjourned meeting if the time and place, if any, and the means of remote communications, if any, are announced at the special meeting at which the
adjournment is taken. At the adjourned meeting, Ultratech may transact any business that might have been transacted at the original special meeting. If the adjournment is for
more than 30 days, or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each Ultratech stockholder
of record entitled to vote at the meeting.

        The chairman of the special meeting may adjourn the special meeting to, among other things, solicit additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes at the time of the
special meeting to approve the Merger Proposal, allow reasonable additional time for the filing and distribution of any supplemental or amended disclosure to be disseminated to
and reviewed by Ultratech stockholders prior to the special meeting, or otherwise with the consent, or upon the request, of Veeco.

        The chairman of the special meeting may determine to adjourn the special meeting even if the Adjournment Proposal is not approved by Ultratech stockholders.

        Additionally, the Ultratech board, acting pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of the total number of authorized directors, whether or not there exist any vacancies
in previously authorized directorships, has the right to cancel, postpone or reschedule a special meeting of the stockholders at any time, before or after the notice for such meeting
has been sent to the stockholders.

Attending the Special Meeting 

        Only Ultratech stockholders of record as of the close of business on the record date or their duly appointed proxies may attend the special meeting, or if your shares of
Ultratech common stock are held in "street name" by a broker, bank or other nominee and you bring evidence of beneficial ownership of those shares on the record date, such as a
copy of your most recent account statement or similar evidence of ownership of Ultratech common stock as of the record date, you may attend the special meeting. If your shares
of Ultratech common stock are held in "street name" by a broker, bank or other nominee and you wish to vote at the special meeting, you must also bring a proxy from the record
holder (your broker, bank or other nominee) of the shares of Ultratech common stock

PROPOSAL 1: THE MERGER PROPOSAL 

        As discussed throughout this proxy statement/prospectus, Ultratech is asking its stockholders to adopt the merger agreement. Pursuant to the merger agreement, Veeco will
acquire Ultratech through a merger of Merger Subsidiary with and into Ultratech, with Ultratech as the surviving corporation. As a result of the merger, Ultratech will be a wholly
owned subsidiary of Veeco and the Ultratech common stock will be delisted from Nasdaq, deregistered under the Exchange Act and cease to be publicly traded.

        As described in further detail in the sections entitled "Questions and Answers" beginning on page v of this proxy statement/prospectus, "Summary" beginning on page 1 of
this proxy statement/prospectus, "The Merger" beginning on page 56 of this proxy statement/prospectus and "The Merger Agreement" beginning on page 100 of this proxy
statement/prospectus, the Ultratech board has adopted a resolution determining that the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby are fair to and in the best
interests of Ultratech's stockholders, approving and declaring advisable the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby and recommending that (subject to
Section 6.03 of the merger agreement) Ultratech's stockholders adopt the merger agreement. The merger is subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in the merger
agreement, including the adoption of the merger agreement by the stockholders of Ultratech at the special meeting. Accordingly, the approval of the Merger Proposal by
Ultratech stockholders is a condition to the obligations of Veeco and Ultratech to complete the merger.

Required Vote

        The affirmative vote, in person or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Ultratech common stock entitled to vote as of the record date on the
Merger Proposal at the special meeting is required to approve the Merger Proposal.

Recommendation of the Ultratech Board

        The Ultratech board recommends that Ultratech stockholders vote "FOR" the Merger Proposal.

PROPOSAL 2: THE COMPENSATION PROPOSAL 

        Ultratech is providing its stockholders with the opportunity to cast a vote, on a non-binding, advisory basis, to approve the compensation payments that will or may be made
to Ultratech's named executive officers in connection with the merger as disclosed in the table (and related narrative disclosure) under the section entitled "The Merger—Interests
of Ultratech's Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—Quantification of Change in Control and Termination Payments and Benefits to Ultratech's Named Executive
Officers" beginning on page 92 of this proxy statement, as required by Section 14A of the Exchange Act. The plans and arrangements under which these compensation payments
may be made are part of Ultratech's compensation program for its named executive officers or are required by the merger agreement.

        You should review carefully the information under the section entitled "The Merger—Interests of Ultratech's Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—
Quantification of Change in Control and Termination Payments and Benefits to Ultratech's Named Executive Officers" beginning on page 92 of this proxy statement.

        The Ultratech board recommends that Ultratech stockholders approve the following resolution:

        "RESOLVED, that the stockholders of Ultratech approve, solely on an advisory, non-binding basis, the compensation payments which will or may be made to Ultratech's
named executive officers in connection with the merger, as disclosed pursuant to Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K in the section titled "The Merger—Interests of Ultratech's
Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—Quantification of Change in Control and Termination Payments and Benefits to Ultratech's Named Executive Officers"
beginning on page 92 of Ultratech's proxy statement for the special meeting."

        The vote on the Compensation Proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote on the Merger Proposal. Accordingly, you may vote to approve the Merger Proposal and
abstain or vote not to approve the Compensation Proposal. Because the vote on the Compensation Proposal is advisory only, it will not be binding on either Ultratech or Veeco.
Accordingly, if the Merger Proposal is approved and the merger is completed, the compensation payments that are contractually required to be made to Ultratech's named
executive officers will be made, subject only to the conditions applicable thereto, regardless of the outcome of the non-binding, advisory vote of Ultratech's stockholders.

Required Vote 

        The affirmative vote, in person or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the shares of Ultratech common stock present in person or represented by proxy at the special
meeting and entitled to vote at the special meeting is required to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the Compensation Proposal.

Recommendation of the Ultratech Board 

        The Ultratech board recommends that Ultratech stockholders vote "FOR" the Compensation Proposal.

PROPOSAL 3: THE ADJOURNMENT PROPOSAL 

        Ultratech stockholders are being asked to approve a proposal that will give the Ultratech board authority to adjourn the special meeting one or more times, if necessary or
appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes to approve the Merger Proposal at the time of the special meeting.

        If this proposal is approved, the special meeting could be adjourned to any date. If the special meeting is adjourned, Ultratech stockholders who have already submitted their
proxies will be able to revoke them at any time prior to their use. If you sign and return a proxy and do not indicate how you wish to vote on any proposal, or if you indicate that
you wish to vote in favor of the Merger Proposal but do not indicate a choice on the Adjournment Proposal, your shares of Ultratech common stock will be voted "FOR" the
Adjournment Proposal.

        If a quorum is not present or represented at the special meeting, then either (1) the chairman of the meeting or (2) by majority vote, the Ultratech stockholders entitled to
vote at the special meeting, present in person or represented by proxy, shall have power to adjourn the meeting. Whether or not a quorum is present at the special meeting, the
chairman of the meeting shall have power to adjourn the special meeting from time to time to another time or place or means of remote communications, without notice other
than announcement at the special meeting of the time and place, if any, and the means of remote communications, if any, by which Ultratech stockholders and proxy holders may
be deemed to be present in person and vote at such adjourned meeting. When a special meeting is adjourned to another time and place, unless the Amended and Restated Bylaws
of Ultratech otherwise require, notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the time and place, if any, and the means of remote communications, if any, by which
stockholders and proxy holders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such adjourned meeting are announced at the special meeting at which the adjournment is
taken. At the adjourned meeting, Ultratech may transact any business that might have been transacted at the original special meeting. If the adjournment is for more than 30 days,
or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each Ultratech stockholder of record entitled
to vote at the meeting.

        The chairman of the special meeting may adjourn the special meeting to, among other things, solicit additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes at the time of the
special meeting to approve the Merger Proposal, allow reasonable additional time for the filing and distribution of any supplemental or amended disclosure to be disseminated to
and reviewed by Ultratech stockholders prior to the special meeting, or otherwise with the consent, or upon the request, of Veeco.

        The chairman of the special meeting may determine to adjourn the special meeting even if the Adjournment Proposal is not approved by Ultratech stockholders.

        Additionally, the Ultratech board, acting pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of the total number of authorized directors, whether or not there exist any vacancies
in previously authorized directorships, has the right to cancel, postpone or reschedule a special meeting of the stockholders at any time, before or after the notice for such meeting
has been sent to the stockholders.

Required Vote 

        The affirmative vote, in person or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the shares of Ultratech common stock present in person or represented by proxy at the special
meeting and entitled to vote on the Adjournment Proposal at the special meeting is required to approve the adjournment of the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to
solicit additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the Merger Proposal.

Recommendation of the Ultratech Board

THE MERGER 

        The following is a discussion of the merger and the material terms of the merger agreement between Veeco and Ultratech. You are urged to read the merger agreement
carefully and in its entirety, a copy of which is attached as Annex A to this proxy statement/prospectus and incorporated by reference herein.

Effects of the Merger 

        Subject to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, at the effective time, Merger Subsidiary will be merged with and into Ultratech, with Ultratech surviving the
merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Veeco.

        In the merger, each outstanding share of Ultratech common stock (other than (i) shares of Ultratech common stock owned by Veeco or Merger Subsidiary and shares of
treasury stock held by Ultratech, which will be canceled without consideration, (ii) shares of Ultratech stock held by any subsidiary of either Ultratech or Veeco, which will be
converted into such number of shares of common stock of the surviving corporation such that each subsidiary owns the same percentage of the surviving corporation immediately
following the effective time as such subsidiary owned of Ultratech immediately prior to the effective time such shares, together with the shares described in clause (i) are referred
to as "excluded shares") and (iii) shares held by holders of Ultratech common stock, if any, who properly exercise their appraisal rights under the DGCL (which we refer to as
"dissenting shares")) will be converted into the right to receive the merger consideration consisting of $21.75 in cash, without interest, and 0.2675 of a share of Veeco common
stock. If the aggregate consideration to be paid to any holder of Ultratech common stock would result in such holder receiving a fractional share of Veeco common stock, cash
will be paid in lieu of such fractional share. Veeco stockholders will continue to hold their existing shares of Veeco common stock.

        Based on 27,241,449 shares of Ultratech common stock issued and outstanding as of April 17, 2017, and 40,568,473 shares of Veeco common stock issued and outstanding
as of April 17, 2017, it is expected that, immediately after completion of the merger, former Ultratech stockholders will own approximately 15% of the outstanding shares of
Veeco common stock.

Background of the Merger 

        In pursuing Ultratech's objective of enhancing stockholder value, and as part of its ongoing review of strategic opportunities available to it, the Ultratech board periodically
considers opportunities for a variety of strategic transactions that might enhance stockholder value, including potential acquisitions, business combinations and other strategic
alliances.

        On July 20, 2015, the Ultratech business development committee of the Ultratech board (which we refer to in this proxy statement/prospectus as the Ultratech business
development committee), a standing committee of the Ultratech board, met with representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch and representatives of Ultratech's legal counsel,
O'Melveny & Myers LLP ("O'Melveny & Myers"). At the request of the Ultratech business development committee, representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch reviewed merger and
acquisition trends in the technology sector in general and in Ultratech's industry sector. The Ultratech business development committee then discussed with management
developments in Ultratech's industry sector, the landscape of potential acquisition targets, and whether there were possible strategic transactions that Ultratech could pursue to
benefit its stockholders. At that time, the members of the Ultratech business development committee were Michael Child, Dennis Raney and Henri Richard.

        On August 4, 2015, Neuberger Berman Group LLC, a stockholder of Ultratech, on behalf of itself and other affiliated parties ("Neuberger"), sent Ultratech a letter stating,
among other things, that it was disappointed with Ultratech's long-term stockholder value creation, and asked to engage Ultratech

in a discussion that would include a review of the tenure of current Ultratech board members and establish a timeline for value creation and management succession. On
August 11, 2015, Neuberger filed a Schedule 13D attaching the August 4, 2015 letter and disclosing a 6.68% beneficial ownership of the outstanding common stock of Ultratech.
Neuberger and representatives of Ultratech communicated and met in the ensuing weeks and several months thereafter.

        On September 28, 2015, Neuberger sent a second letter to Ultratech reiterating certain views from the August 4, 2015 letter and reserving its right to put forward candidates
for the Ultratech board or stockholder proposals if progress on its demands was not made to its satisfaction.

        On October 8, 2015, Arthur Zafiropoulo, Chairman and CEO of Ultratech, met with the Chairman of a potential strategic business combination partner (which we refer to as
"Company A"), who suggested that Ultratech and Company A explore the possibility of a strategic business combination transaction, possibly involving another potential
strategic business combination partner (which we refer to as "Company B"). Mr. Zafiropoulo periodically communicated with the Chairman of Company A through August of
2016.

        On October 17, 2015, John Peeler, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Veeco, sent Mr. Zafiropoulo an e-mail to inform Mr. Zafiropoulo that Mr. Peeler would be
in Northern California during the week of November 8, 2015 and would be interested in meeting with Mr. Zafiropoulo.

        On October 18, 2015, the Ultratech board met to review, among other things, industry developments and Ultratech's performance, including its financial and operating
performance. Representatives of O'Melveny & Myers were present at the meeting. At that meeting, the Ultratech board discussed various strategic opportunities potentially
available to Ultratech, including remaining independent, as well as Ultratech's short and long-term strategies for increasing stockholder value. Mr. Zafiropoulo discussed with the
Ultratech board his meeting with the Chairman of Company A and the suggestion made by the Chairman of Company A regarding the exploration of a possible strategic business
combination. The Ultratech board referred Mr. Zafiropoulo to the business development committee for further consideration of a possible strategic business combination with
Company A.

        On October 19, 2015, at a regularly scheduled meeting, the Ultratech business development committee considered whether Ultratech should explore a strategic business
combination transaction with Company A. A representative of O'Melveny & Myers attended the meeting. Later that day and the following day, the Ultratech board continued its
discussion of strategic opportunities after which the Ultratech board agreed to retain an investment bank to provide financial and valuation advice.

        Throughout Ultratech's initial discussions with Company A and the later, broader strategic review process, the Ultratech business development committee held many
meetings and also engaged in many informal conversations about Ultratech's strategic alternatives.

        On or about October 20, 2015, Mr. Zafiropoulo made separate telephone calls to the President and CEO of Company A and to the Chairman and CEO of Company B to
solicit interest in a possible three-way business combination transaction involving each of these companies. Both the President and CEO of Company A and the Chairman and
CEO of Company B expressed that such a transaction would be difficult to achieve.

        On or about November 7, 2015, Mr. Zafiropoulo, Bruce Wright, Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President, Finance of Ultratech, and the Chairman and the President
and CEO of Company A met to discuss a possible business combination and shared information about their respective companies. At this meeting, the Chairman and the
President and CEO of Company A suggested a merger of equals involving a premium of 10 to 15 percent on the common stock of Company A.

        On November 9, 2015, Mr. Zafiropoulo had a telephone conference with a member of the board of directors of Company B who expressed that Company B was not
interested in pursuing the business combination transaction being suggested by Ultratech at that time.

        On or about November 10, 2015, in response to the e-mail sent by Mr. Peeler to Mr. Zafiropoulo on October 17, 2015, Mr. Zafiropoulo met with Mr. Peeler in San Jose, CA.
At the meeting, Messrs. Zafiropoulo and Peeler exchanged views about their respective companies and the semiconductor capital equipment industry generally.

        On November 17, 2015, the Ultratech board held a special telephonic meeting. The meeting was attended by a financial advisory firm (which was not BofA Merrill Lynch).
Representatives of the financial advisory firm provided a comprehensive report on industry trends, Wall Street perspectives on Ultratech and preliminary perspectives on
Ultratech's valuation (including, without limitation, on a stand-alone basis remaining independent and on a change of control basis). Representatives of O'Melveny & Myers also
attended the meeting. After the financial advisory firm's presentation, and departure from the meeting, the Ultratech board discussed various strategic alternatives, and
Mr. Zafiropoulo provided an update on recent preliminary conversations with potential strategic partners and discussed the terms of a possible engagement with the financial
advisory firm.

        On November 23, 2015, the Ultratech board held a special telephonic meeting to discuss various strategic matters, including a potential business combination with respect to
Company A. A representative of O'Melveny & Myers attended the meeting. The Ultratech board authorized the retention of a financial advisory firm to assist in evaluating a
potential strategic transaction involving Company A and delegated the review and approval of the terms of the engagement with the financial advisory firm that had attended the
November 17, 2015 meeting of the Ultratech board, including the investment banking fee agreement, to the Ultratech business development committee.

        On December 7, 2015, Ultratech and Company A entered into a mutual non-disclosure agreement. The non-disclosure agreement contained a customary standstill provision
that would terminate automatically upon certain events, including in the event that Ultratech entered into a definitive agreement for the acquisition of 50% or more of its
outstanding voting securities.

        On December 17, 2015, the Ultratech business development committee held a meeting and reviewed and approved the engagement letter with the financial advisory firm for
the limited purpose of the proposed strategic combination with Company A and authorized Messrs. Zafiropoulo and Wright to execute such letter agreement. Mr. Zafiropoulo
provided the Ultratech business development committee with an update on the status of the potential transaction. Representatives from O'Melveny & Myers then provided the
Ultratech business development committee with a presentation on directors' fiduciary duties under applicable law, including applicable legal standards in connection with a
potential strategic transaction, and also reviewed with the committee certain high level structures and terms for transactions in the sector. The members of the Ultratech business
development committee discussed with management their views on a potential strategic business combination transaction with Company A as well as next steps. Ultratech
entered into the engagement letter with the financial advisory firm with respect to a potential strategic business combination with Company A, which subsequently terminated in
December 2016 in accordance with its terms (with a tail fee payable to the financial advisory firm under certain circumstances if Ultratech were to complete an acquisition of
Company A pursuant to an agreement entered into within 12 months of such termination).

        On December 22, 2015, Messrs. Zafiropoulo and Wright met with the Chairman, the President and CEO and the CFO of Company A to discuss the respective businesses of
Ultratech and Company A and a potential transaction. The representatives of Company A provided the representatives of Ultratech with certain prospective financial information
and forecasts regarding Company A. The representatives of Ultratech provided the representatives of Company A with certain prospective financial information regarding
Ultratech.

        On December 23, 2015, certain members of the Ultratech board held a conference call to discuss the status of discussions with Company A.

        Between the end of December 2015 and early March 2016, representatives of Ultratech, Company A and their respective financial advisors had periodic conversations and
exchanged information about their respective companies.

        On January 19, 2016, Mr. Child shared the financial advisory firm's written report, including its preliminary analysis of the proposed transaction with Company A, with the
Ultratech business development committee.

        On February 1, 2016, the Ultratech business development committee held a regular quarterly meeting and invited representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch, which had not
previously been involved in the discussions among Ultratech, Company A and Company B, to attend. Representatives of O'Melveny & Myers also attended the meeting. At the
request of the Ultratech business development committee, representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch reviewed merger and acquisition activity in the semiconductor industry and the

        On February 4, 2016, Ultratech issued a press release announcing its results for fiscal year 2015. The press release included a statement that, as part of Ultratech's continued

        On April 18, 2016, the Ultratech business development committee held a regular meeting, at which it discussed possible strategic opportunities, including the status of

Mr. Zafiropoulo contact representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch and instruct them to begin an initial outreach to potential strategic acquirers and financial sponsors in Asia. The
Ultratech board determined to start its outreach with prospects in Asia, then move on to prospects in Europe and the Middle East before finally moving on to prospects in the
United States, because of the amount of time it was expected that potential bidders in each region would be expected to take to submit bids and a desire to be able to run
simultaneous bidding processes to the extent possible with the goal of achieving competition among bidders.

        On April 21, 2016, Neuberger submitted a notice to Ultratech nominating Dr. Black and Ms. Infante for election to the Ultratech board at Ultratech's 2016 annual meeting of
stockholders. The next day, Ultratech issued a press release responding to Neuberger's nomination. The press release also stated that, as part of Ultratech's continuing focus on
increasing stockholder value, Ultratech was in the final stages of selecting a director candidate with relevant experience in the semiconductor capital equipment industry and
related industries and/or operational experience with Ultratech's key customers.

        On April 22, 2016, Neuberger filed with the SEC an amendment to its previously filed Schedule 13D attaching its nomination notice and disclosing beneficial ownership of
7.68% of the outstanding Ultratech common stock.

(including a potential strategic acquirer that we refer to as "Company C") and five of which were financial sponsors (including potential financial sponsors that we refer to as
"Sponsor A," "Sponsor B," and "Sponsor C"). Messrs. Zafiropoulo and Timmins discussed the status of the Asia meetings as well as representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch's
review of a potential strategic transaction with companies in Asia.

        On May 27, 2016, Neuberger filed a preliminary proxy statement with the SEC (which it filed in final form on June 13, 2016) related to its nomination of Dr. Black and

in pursuing an acquisition of, or a strategic partnership with, Ultratech. At the direction of representatives of Ultratech, representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch requested that each

        Beginning on August 22, 2016, at the direction of representatives of Ultratech, representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch sent non-disclosure agreements to those four potential
strategic acquirers in Europe and the Middle East. None of the four parties chose to enter into a non-disclosure agreement or continue in the process. One of these parties

Ultratech with respect to fiscal years 2016 through 2018. As compared to the Ultratech management projections that were provided to representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch in
August 2016, the Ultratech management projections that were provided to representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch in November 2016, among other changes, adjusted fiscal
year 2016 to reflect the results of the most recent quarter and reduced forecasts with respect to fiscal year 2017 based on management's judgment and the results of the most

to each of Veeco and Company D and requested that each company submit a revised proposal for the acquisition of Ultratech by January 13, 2017.

        During the first half of January 2017, Veeco continued its diligence review of Ultratech, and representatives of Ultratech and Veeco engaged in a series of business and legal
diligence meetings for that purpose.

        On January 4, 2017, representatives of Ultratech provided financial projections for Ultratech for fiscal years 2019 through 2021 to representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch.

        On January 10, 2017, the Ultratech board held a special telephonic meeting, with representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch in attendance. At the request of the Ultratech board,
representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch provided an update concerning the strategic review process, its preliminary financial analysis of Ultratech, the status of discussions with
potential bidders and the status of Veeco's bid and Company D's bid. The Ultratech board met with management and a representative of O'Melveny & Myers to discuss the
information reviewed by representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch. The Ultratech board discussed the process of conducting a reverse due diligence review of Veeco. The Ultratech
board also discussed strategic alternatives available to it, including remaining independent.

        Also on January 10, 2017, representatives of Barclays contacted representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch and held a telephonic meeting in which representatives of Barclays
informed the representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch that Veeco would not be able to meet the deadline of January 13, 2017, which representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch
communicated to the Ultratech board. Following this discussion, Ultratech agreed to extend the deadline for Veeco to January 20, 2017.

        On January 13, 2017, Company D informed representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch that it would not be providing another proposal for the acquisition of Ultratech and that it
was withdrawing its original proposal, which representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch communicated to the Ultratech board. Upon learning of Company D's withdrawal, Ultratech
decided not to continue discussions with Company D. In addition, the virtual data room was closed to Company D. During the weeks of January 16 and January 23, 2017, at the
direction of the Ultratech board, Ultratech provided due diligence materials to, received reverse due diligence materials from, and held due diligence and reverse due diligence
discussions with Veeco, each with the assistance of its respective legal and financial advisors.

        On January 16, 2017, members of the Ultratech business development committee held a meeting by telephone to discuss the strategic review process and the status of
discussions with Veeco and Company D.

        On January 17, 2017, Veeco provided Veeco's preliminary results for fiscal year 2016 and financial projections for fiscal years 2017 and 2018 to representatives of BofA
Merrill Lynch, who then provided such projections to representatives of Ultratech. On January 23, 2017, Veeco provided an updated forecast of the first quarter of 2017 with
respect to Veeco to representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch, who then provided such updated forecast to representatives of Ultratech.

        On January 20, 2017, Ultratech received a revised, non-binding indication of interest of Veeco to acquire Ultratech. Veeco offered $21.34 in cash and 0.2620 shares of Veeco
common stock per Ultratech share. Based on Veeco's closing share price on January 19, 2017, this represented a total per share value of $28.45, consisting of $21.34 in cash and
$7.11 in Veeco common stock, a 13% premium to Ultratech's closing price as of January 19, 2017. In addition, Veeco submitted preliminary comments on the draft merger
agreement prepared by Morrison & Foerster. Mr. Zafiropoulo promptly communicated the revised offer to the Ultratech board. Included in such preliminary comments on the
draft merger agreement, among other comments, was a request that Ultratech's directors and officers sign support agreements in favor of the merger and a request that Ultratech
enter into a 30-day exclusivity agreement with Veeco.

        On January 22, 2017, members of the Ultratech board held a conference call to discuss the new proposal from Veeco. Representatives of O'Melveny & Myers and
representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch participated in the conference call. At the request of the Ultratech board, representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch provided an update
concerning the strategic review process, the status of discussions with potential bidders and the status of Veeco's bid. Following a discussion, the Ultratech board decided to
request that Veeco increase its bid to $29.00 per share. Representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch, at the direction of the Ultratech board, contacted Veeco and requested that Veeco
increase its bid to $29.00 per share. Also on January 22, 2017, at the direction of the Ultratech board, representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch contacted Company D and
Company E to reassess their interest at $29.00 per share.

        On January 23, 2017, both Company D and Company E indicated they were not interested in pursuing a potential acquisition at $29.00 per share.

        On January 23, 2017, Ultratech received a revised offer letter from Veeco including a revised, non-binding indication of interest from Veeco to acquire Ultratech for $21.75
in cash and 0.2675 shares of Veeco common stock per Ultratech share. Based on Veeco's closing share price on January 20, 2017, this represented a total per share value of
$29.00, consisting of $21.75 in cash and $7.25 in Veeco common stock, a 14% premium to Ultratech's closing price as of January 20, 2017. In addition, Veeco's revised offer
letter included proposals that Veeco approve certain compensation arrangements entered into by Ultratech between January 23, 2017 and the execution of a definitive merger
agreement, and that unvested Ultratech stock options and other stock based awards not accelerate. The revised offer letter also included a request that Ultratech enter into a
separate exclusivity agreement and countersign the offer letter.

        Also on January 23, 2017, representatives of O'Melveny & Myers provided the Ultratech board with a list of issues raised by Morrison & Foerster's mark-up of the merger
agreement, and a proposed revised draft merger agreement to be provided to Veeco and Morrison & Foerster.

        On January 24, 2017, the Ultratech board held a special meeting to consider the revised offer and exclusivity agreement from Veeco, with representatives of BofA Merrill
Lynch in attendance. At the request of the Ultratech board, representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch reviewed with the Ultratech board a summary of the strategic review process
and proposals received to date, its preliminary financial analysis of Veeco's revised offer and the reverse due diligence information provided by Veeco to Ultratech. After a
discussion with representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch, the Ultratech board then met with management and a representative of O'Melveny & Myers to review and discuss further
the information reviewed by representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch, Veeco's revised January 23, 2017 offer,

the results of the reverse due diligence exercise conducted to date and strategic alternatives, including the possibility of remaining independent. In addition, representatives of
O'Melveny & Myers reviewed the terms of the revised offer letter received from Veeco on January 23, 2017, and the proposed exclusivity agreement and the current status of
negotiations on the merger agreement. The Ultratech board approved the exclusivity agreement and offer letter, subject to certain revisions being negotiated.

        On January 25, 2017, at the direction of the Ultratech board, representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch provided Veeco with Ultratech's and O'Melveny & Myers' comments to
Veeco's revised offer letter and the exclusivity agreement provided by Veeco. Veeco did not respond to those comments.

        Also on January 25, 2017, O'Melveny & Myers provided Morrison & Foerster with a revised draft of the merger agreement.

        Between January 24, 2017 and February 1, 2017, Veeco and Ultratech negotiated the definitive merger agreement and ancillary documents, including the support agreement,
and engaged in numerous due diligence meetings, including due diligence with respect to Veeco performed by Ultratech's management, each with the assistance of its respective
legal and financial advisors. Among the issues that were discussed by Ultratech and Veeco during negotiations with respect to the merger agreement were the interim operating
covenants applicable to Ultratech during the period between signing the merger agreement and closing the transaction (including restrictions on Ultratech's ability to pursue
alternative transactions or operate outside the ordinary course of business), the closing conditions to the merger (including the closing condition proposed by Veeco, on
January 30, 2017, that Ultratech and its subsidiaries maintain a specified amount of cash on hand in the United States), termination rights and termination fee provisions.

        On or about January 27, 2017, Ultratech provided representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch with actual financial results for Ultratech with respect to fiscal year 2016.

        On January 27, 2017, representatives of Ultratech provided representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch with updated financial information for Ultratech with respect to
Ultratech's most recently completed quarter.

        Also on January 27, 2017, Veeco and Ultratech provided each other with updates regarding Veeco's due diligence and Ultratech's reverse due diligence processes, each with
the assistance of its respective financial advisors.

        From January 27 to January 30, 2017, Messrs. Peeler, Zafiropoulo and Child discussed the terms of change in control severance agreements that Ultratech was considering
approving for certain of its executives as well as the terms and conditions of equity awards that the compensation committee of the Ultratech board had been contemplating
pursuant to the Ultratech 1993 Stock Option/Stock Issuance Plan. These requests were resolved to the satisfaction of Ultratech and Veeco.

        On January 29, 2017, representatives of O'Melveny & Myers provided the Ultratech board with an update on the status of negotiations concerning the definitive merger
agreement, including a list of open issues, the current draft of the agreement and proposals for addressing various issues.

        Also on January 29, 2017, representatives of O'Melveny & Myers provided Morrison & Foerster with a draft of the support agreement. From January 29, 2017 to
February 1, 2017, representatives of O'Melveny & Myers and Morrison & Foerster negotiated and exchanged drafts of the support agreement.

        On January 30, 2017, members of the Ultratech board and a representative of O'Melveny & Myers met to discuss the status of discussions with Veeco and open issues
related to the potential transaction.

        Also on January 30, 2017, Veeco and Ultratech entered into an additional non-disclosure agreement regarding information provided by Veeco to Ultratech as part of
Ultratech's reverse due diligence process. Veeco then provided Ultratech with additional due diligence materials.

        On January 31, 2017, the Ultratech board held its regular meeting. At that meeting, a representative of O'Melveny & Myers provided a detailed report on the current status
of negotiations and a list of all open matters and points on the proposed transaction with Veeco. In addition, the board discussed the status of the strategic review process and the
availability of strategic alternatives, including remaining independent.

        Also on January 31, 2017, the compensation committee of the Ultratech board approved certain change in control severance agreements for certain executives of Ultratech,
other than for Messrs. Zafiropoulo and Wright who were already parties to employment agreements with Ultratech. The compensation committee of the Ultratech board also
approved the grant of restricted stock unit awards under Ultratech's 1993 Stock Option/Stock Issuance Plan to certain employees, including Ultratech's executive officers, that
cover, in the aggregate, 338,000 shares of Ultratech common stock. The January 31, 2017 restricted stock unit awards are scheduled to vest over a period of fifty months
following the grant date of the awards, do not fully accelerate on the merger, and are subject to certain accelerated vesting in the event the award recipient's employment
terminates in circumstances that entitle the award recipient to severance benefits under his or her employment or change in control severance agreement with Ultratech. Each
Ultratech executive officer filed a Form 4 with respect to his or her January 31, 2017 award with the SEC on February 3, 2017.

        Also on January 31, 2017, representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch provided to O'Melveny & Myers an updated disclosure letter to the Ultratech board, dated January 31,
2017, describing certain of BofA Merrill Lynch's material relationships with Ultratech and Veeco.

        Also on January 31, 2017, Mr. Peeler telephoned Mr. Zafiropoulo to discuss several open issues in the merger agreement, including a new closing condition requested the
day before regarding that Ultratech and its subsidiaries maintain a specified amount of cash on hand in the United States. Upon reaching agreement on the resolution of the open
issues, Messrs. Peeler and Zafiropoulo instructed Morrison & Foerster and O'Melveny & Myers, respectively, to finalize the merger agreement.

        On February 1, 2017, the Ultratech board held a special telephonic meeting to review the terms and conditions of the proposed transaction with Veeco with representatives
of O'Melveny & Myers and representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch in attendance. Prior to that meeting, the Ultratech board was provided with copies of the latest drafts of the
merger agreement and the support agreement and presentations from representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch and O'Melveny & Myers. At this meeting, Messrs. Zafiropoulo and
Wright gave reports concerning Ultratech management's financial and other due diligence with respect to Veeco and their views with respect to the value of Veeco's common
stock. Also at this meeting, representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch presented a summary of the strategic review process and proposals received to date. Also at this meeting,
representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch reviewed with Ultratech's board BofA Merrill Lynch's financial analysis of the merger consideration and delivered to Ultratech's board an
oral opinion, which was confirmed by the delivery of a written opinion on February 1, 2017, to the effect that, as of that date and based on and subject to various assumptions and
limitations described in its opinion, the merger consideration to be received in the merger by holders of Ultratech common stock (other than Veeco, Merger Subsidiary and
holders of dissenting shares), was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. Also at this meeting, representatives of O'Melveny & Myers then provided the Ultratech
board with a review of the board's fiduciary duties and a detailed review of the draft merger agreement and the form of support agreement as well as the disclosure letter, dated
January 31, 2017, provided by representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch disclosing certain of BofA Merrill Lynch's material relationships with Ultratech and Veeco. The Ultratech
board then evaluated and discussed the terms of the draft merger agreement and

the transactions contemplated thereby with Ultratech management, representatives of O'Melveny & Myers and representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch. After further discussion
and consideration of the financial and other information presented, the Ultratech board unanimously, (1) determined that the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated
thereby were fair to and in the best interests of Ultratech's stockholders, (2) approved and declared advisable the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby,
(3) resolved, subject to section 6.03 of the merger agreement, to unanimously recommend adoption of the merger agreement by Ultratech's stockholders, all upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth therein, and (4) resolved that, subject to section 6.03 of the merger agreement, it would advise Ultratech's stockholders of its unanimous
recommendation to adopt the merger agreement in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement and to include such recommendation in this proxy statement/prospectus.

        On February 2, 2017, Ultratech and Veeco executed and delivered the Merger Agreement and Ultratech and Veeco issued a joint press release announcing the execution of
the Merger Agreement.

Recommendation of the Ultratech Board; Ultratech's Reasons for the Merger 

        At its February 1, 2017 meeting held to evaluate the proposed merger, the Ultratech board, by a unanimous vote, (1) determined that the merger agreement and the
transactions contemplated thereby were fair to and in the best interests of Ultratech's stockholders, (2) approved and declared advisable the merger agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby, (3) resolved, subject to section 6.03 of the merger agreement, to recommend adoption of the merger agreement by Ultratech's stockholders, all upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, and (4) resolved that, subject to section 6.03 of the merger agreement, it would advise Ultratech's stockholders of its
recommendation to adopt the merger agreement in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement and to include such recommendation in this proxy statement/prospectus.
The Ultratech board therefore recommends that Ultratech stockholders vote:

        1.     "FOR" the Merger Proposal;

        2.     "FOR" the Compensation Proposal; and

        3.     "FOR" the Ultratech Adjournment Proposal.

        In evaluating the merger and the merger agreement and arriving at its determination, the Ultratech board consulted with Ultratech's senior management, representatives of
Ultratech's financial advisor, BofA Merrill Lynch and Ultratech's outside legal counsel, O'Melveny & Myers. The factors referenced below were discussed during meetings of the
Ultratech board, with each individual member of the Ultratech board placing more or less emphasis or weight on particular factors, as described below. The emphasis and
weighting of those factors led each member of the Ultratech board to exercise his or her judgment in the manner reflected in the voting of the Ultratech board.

        In determining that the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby are fair to and in the best interests of Ultratech's stockholders, approving and declaring
advisable the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby and resolving to recommend adoption of the merger agreement by Ultratech stockholders, the
Ultratech board considered a number of factors. The various factors the Ultratech board considered that weighed positively in favor of the merger agreement, the merger and the
other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement included, among others and not necessarily in order of relative importance:

• historical information regarding (i) Ultratech's business, financial performance, results of operations, (ii) market prices, volatility and trading activity with respect
to Ultratech common stock, and (iii) market prices with respect to other industry participants and general market indices;

Table of Contents

• current information regarding (i) Ultratech's business, prospects, financial condition, operations, technology, products, services, management, competitive position
and strategic business goals and objectives, (ii) general economic, industry and financial market conditions, and (iii) opportunities and competitive factors within
Ultratech's industry; 

• historical information regarding (i) Veeco's business, financial performance and results of operations, (ii) market prices, volatility and trading activity with respect
to Veeco common stock, and (iii) market prices with respect to other industry participants and general market indices; 

• current information regarding (i) Veeco's business, prospects, financial condition, operations, technology, products, services, management and competitive
position and (ii) opportunities and competitive factors within Veeco's industry; 

• the prospects and likelihood of realizing superior benefits through remaining an independent company, risks associated with remaining an independent company,
and possible alternative business strategies and/or transactions; 

• the prospect that as a result of the merger, the combined company would be able to realize cost synergies; 

• the potential for other third parties to enter into strategic relationships with or to seek to acquire Ultratech, including a review of management's dealings with other
possible buyers in the past and assessment of the likelihood that a third party would have offered a higher price than the price per share offered by Veeco and the
likelihood that any stock consideration offered by another bidder would have been as attractive as the stock consideration being offered by Veeco; 

• the timing of the merger and the risk that if Ultratech did not accept Veeco's offer (as provided for in the merger agreement), it may not have had another
opportunity to do so or a comparable opportunity; 

• the fact that, during the course of its negotiations with Veeco, Veeco raised the value of the total consideration from $26.50 to $28.64 (based the closing price of
Veeco common stock of $25.75 on February 1, 2017, the last trading day before the announcement of the merger); 

• the fact that the implied value of the merger consideration of $28.64, based on a per share price of Veeco common stock of $25.75 (the closing price on
February 1, 2017, the last trading day before the announcement of the merger), represented: (i) a premium of approximately 10.5% to $25.92 (the closing price of
Ultratech common stock on January 31, 2017); (ii) a premium of 14.1% to the one-month average closing price per share of Ultratech's common stock of $25.10;
(iii) a premium of 21.5% to the three-month average closing price per share of Ultratech's common stock of $23.57; (iv) a premium of 20.8% to the six-month
average closing price per share of Ultratech's common stock of $23.72; and (v) a premium of 26.4% to the one-year average closing price per share of Ultratech's
common stock of $22.66; 

• the fact that (i) the stock portion of the per share merger consideration will provide Ultratech's stockholders with the opportunity for meaningful participation in
the upside potential of the combined company through the ownership of the shares of Veeco common stock they receive as merger consideration should they
choose to continue to hold such shares and (ii) based on the fixed exchange ratio of 0.2675 shares of Veeco common stock for each share of Ultratech common
stock, the Ultratech stockholders would benefit from any increase in the trading price of Veeco common stock prior to completion of the merger; 

• the belief, based on the analyses of Ultratech's management presented to and discussed by the Ultratech board, that the Veeco common stock was reasonably
valued at current trading prices;

• the fact that the cash portion of the per share merger consideration, which represented approximately 76% of the per share merger consideration as of February 1,
2017, will provide liquidity and certainty of value upon the consummation of the merger; 

• the fact that Ultratech's board was subject to a successful proxy contest in 2016 and the possibility that future proxy contests, if any, might be disruptive to
Ultratech's management and directors and impose direct and indirect costs on Ultratech; 

• the judgment of the Ultratech board that continuing with the strategic process was unlikely to result in a transaction at a more attractive price than offered by
Veeco in the merger and that a "failed" attempt to sell Ultratech would have been detrimental to Ultratech; 

• the solicitation of potential acquirers that included, in total, across all geographies, discussions with 26 potential acquirers, 16 of which were strategic acquirers
and 10 of which were financial sponsors. Of these, two prospective acquirers (Veeco and Company D) submitted written indications of interest for a purchase of
Ultratech (one of which was subsequently withdrawn), two (including Company E) expressed an interest in purchasing limited, selected assets of Ultratech, four
potential financial sponsors (including Sponsor A and Sponsor E) expressed a willingness to provide financing for a strategic acquirer, and 18 prospective
acquirers indicated they were not interested in a potential transaction; 

• the fact that Ultratech is permitted, under circumstances described in the merger agreement and subject to certain conditions, to (i) to respond to and negotiate
unsolicited takeover proposals prior to the time Ultratech's stockholders approve the merger, (ii) terminate the merger agreement in order to enter into an
agreement with respect to an unsolicited takeover proposal that the Ultratech board of directors determines is superior to the Veeco merger after giving Veeco the
opportunity to match the superior proposal and upon payment of a termination fee equal to $26.5 million and (iii) withdraw, withhold, qualify or modify its
recommendation to Ultratech stockholders that they adopt the merger agreement if it would be reasonably likely to result in a breach of the Ultratech board's
fiduciary duties to fail to do so; 

• the fact that, under the terms of the merger agreement, Veeco has agreed to use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all things necessary, proper
or advisable under applicable law (including making filings pursuant to antitrust laws and, if necessary, taking certain limited divestitures and other actions in
order to obtain approvals under applicable law) to consummate the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby as promptly as practicable; 

• the belief of the Ultratech board that an acquisition by Veeco would have a reasonable likelihood of closing without potential issues under applicable antitrust laws
or potential issues from any governmental authorities; 

• the fact that Veeco's obligations pursuant to the merger agreement are not subject to any financing condition or similar contingency based on Veeco's ability to
obtain financing; 

• the fact that the merger is subject to the approval of the stockholders of Ultratech, who will be free to approve or reject the merger, while the merger is not subject
to the conditionality and execution risk of any required approval by Veeco's stockholders; 

• the fact that the financial and other terms and conditions of the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the commitments to obtain
antitrust clearance provided by Veeco, the absence of a financing condition and the ability to respond to and negotiate unsolicited takeover proposals and to
terminate the merger agreement for a superior proposal, were the product of arm's length negotiations between the parties and provided reasonable assurances that
the merger would ultimately be consummated on a timely basis;

• the financial analyses presented by representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch to the Ultratech board; 

• the opinion of BofA Merrill Lynch, dated February 1, 2017, to Ultratech's board of directors as to the fairness, from a financial point of view and as of the date of
the opinion, of the merger consideration to be received in the merger by holders of Ultratech common stock (other than Veeco, Merger Subsidiary and holders of
dissenting shares), as more fully described below in the section entitled "Opinion of Ultratech's Financial Advisor;" and 

• the availability of appraisal rights to stockholders of Ultratech in connection with the merger, subject to the terms and conditions of Section 262 of the DGCL.

        In addition, the Ultratech board considered a variety of risks and other potentially negative factors concerning the merger. These factors included the following, which are
not necessarily listed in order of relative importance:

• the fact that Ultratech will no longer exist as an independent public company and Ultratech's stockholders will forego any future increase in its value as an
independent public company that might result from its possible growth (together with the possibility of near and long term fluctuations in the value of Veeco
common stock to be issued in the merger); 

• the fact that because Ultratech's stockholders will be receiving primarily cash for their shares of Ultratech common stock, they will receive only limited
compensation for any increase in the value of Ultratech's or Veeco's shares of common stock during the pre-closing period or following the closing of the merger; 

• the fact that the merger agreement does not contain a floor for the value of Veeco common stock and that the total value of the merger consideration payable in
connection with the merger could rise or fall based on the value of Veeco's common stock;

Ultratech's relationships with customers, suppliers, other business partners, management and employees; 

• the possible negative effect of the merger and public announcement of the merger on Veeco's financial performance, operating results and stock price and Veeco's
relationships with customers, suppliers, other business partners, management and employees; 

• the fact that forecasts of future results of operations and synergies are necessarily estimates based on assumptions, and that for these and other reasons there is a
risk of not realizing anticipated performance or capturing anticipated operational synergies and cost savings between Ultratech and Veeco and the risk that other
anticipated benefits might not be fully realized; 

• the challenges generally inherent in combining the businesses, operations and workforces of two companies, including the interaction of product and service lines,
sales teams, service delivery processes, cash management processes, operating and business support systems and other critical business functions; 

• the fact that, because a portion of the per share merger consideration is payable in shares of Veeco common stock in accordance with a fixed exchange ratio,
Ultratech stockholders will be adversely affected by any decrease in the trading price of Veeco common stock prior to completion of the merger, and may receive
less value for their shares of Veeco common stock upon completion of the merger than calculated based on the price of the Veeco common stock at the time the
Ultratech board approved the merger agreement, taking into account, however, that a portion of the merger consideration is payable in cash and will not be
affected by a decrease in the stock price of shares of Veeco common stock;

• the fact that the merger agreement (i) precludes Ultratech from actively soliciting competing acquisition proposals and (ii) obligates Ultratech (or its successor) to
pay Veeco a termination fee equal to $26.5 million under specified circumstances, which could discourage the making of a competing acquisition proposal or
adversely impact the price offered in such a proposal; 

• the fact that, if the transaction is not completed as a result of regulatory impediments or other reasons, Veeco will not be obligated to pay any "reverse termination
fee;" 

• the fact that the merger agreement imposes restrictions on the conduct of Ultratech's business in the pre-closing period, which may adversely affect Ultratech's
business in the event the merger is not completed (including by delaying or preventing Ultratech from pursuing business opportunities that may arise or
precluding actions that would be advisable if Ultratech were to remain an independent company); 

• the fact that Veeco is financing the merger in part using Ultratech's cash and that the merger agreement provides that as a condition to closing Ultratech's
representation and warranty that it have at least $180 million available in the United States to use for this purpose must be true and correct at closing and the
possibility that Ultratech may have to repatriate cash in order to satisfy this closing condition; 

• the fact that the merger agreement provisions referenced in the above two bullets may significantly restrict the operation of Ultratech's business; 

• the risk that governmental entities would not approve the merger, or may impose conditions on Ultratech or Veeco in order to gain approval for the merger that
may adversely impact the ability of the combined company to realize the synergies that are projected to occur in connection with the merger; 

• the risks involved with the merger and the likelihood that Ultratech and Veeco will be able to complete the merger, the possibility that the merger might not be
consummated or that consummation of the merger may be unduly delayed for reasons beyond the control of Ultratech and/or Veeco, and Ultratech's prospects
going forward without the combination with Veeco; 

• the risks and costs to Ultratech if the merger is not completed, including uncertainty about the effect of the proposed merger on Ultratech's employees, customers,
suppliers and other parties, which may impair Ultratech's ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel and could cause customers, suppliers and others to
seek to change or not enter into business relationships with Ultratech; 

• the substantial transaction expenses to be incurred in connection with the merger and the negative impact of such expenses on Ultratech's cash reserves and
operating results should the merger not be completed;

Ultratech or the interests of Ultratech's other stockholders generally;

• the various other risks associated with the merger and the business of Ultratech, Veeco and the combined company described in the section entitled "Risk Factors".

        This discussion of the information and factors considered by the Ultratech board includes specific factors to which each member of the Ultratech board gave more or less
emphasis or weight and other factors, both positive and negative, considered by the Ultratech board during its deliberations. The discussion of these matters is not intended to be
exhaustive and may not include all of the factors considered by the Ultratech board. In view of the wide variety of factors considered in connection with its evaluation of the
merger, and the complexity of these matters, the Ultratech board did not attempt to quantify the various factors that it considered in determining that the merger agreement and
the transactions contemplated thereby are fair and in the best interests of Ultratech stockholders, approving and declaring advisable the merger agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby and resolving to recommend adoption of the merger agreement by Ultratech's stockholders. Rather, the Ultratech board viewed its decisions as being based
on the totality of the information presented to it and the factors it considered. The explanation of the Ultratech board's reasons for the proposed transactions and all other
information in this Section may be forward-looking in nature and therefore should be read in light of the factors discussed under the section entitled "Special Note Regarding
Forward-Looking Statements" beginning on page 46 of this proxy statement/prospectus.

Opinion of Ultratech's Financial Advisor 

        Ultratech has retained BofA Merrill Lynch to act as Ultratech's financial advisor in connection with the merger. BofA Merrill Lynch is an internationally recognized
investment banking firm which is regularly engaged in the valuation of businesses and securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions, negotiated underwritings,
secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements and valuations for corporate and other purposes. Ultratech selected BofA Merrill Lynch to act as
Ultratech's financial advisor in connection with the merger on the basis of BofA Merrill Lynch's experience in transactions similar to the merger, its reputation in the investment
community and its familiarity with Ultratech and its business.

        On February 1, 2017, at a meeting of Ultratech's board of directors held to evaluate the merger, BofA Merrill Lynch delivered to Ultratech's board of directors an oral
opinion, which was confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated February 1, 2017, to the effect that, as of the date of the opinion and based on and subject to various
assumptions and limitations described in its opinion, the merger consideration to be received in the merger by holders of Ultratech common stock (other than Veeco, Merger
Subsidiary and holders of dissenting shares) was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.

        The full text of BofA Merrill Lynch's written opinion to Ultratech's board of directors, which describes, among other things, the assumptions made, procedures
followed, factors considered and limitations on the review undertaken, is attached as Annex B to this document and is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.
The following summary of BofA Merrill Lynch's opinion is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the opinion. BofA Merrill Lynch delivered its opinion
to Ultratech's board of directors for the benefit and use of Ultratech's board of directors (in its capacity as such) in connection with and for purposes of its evaluation
of the merger consideration from a financial point of view. BofA Merrill Lynch's opinion does not address any other aspect of the merger and no opinion or view was
expressed as to the relative merits of the merger in comparison to other strategies or transactions that might be available to Ultratech or in which Ultratech might
engage or as to the underlying business decision of Ultratech to proceed with or effect the merger. BofA Merrill Lynch's opinion does not address any other aspect of
the merger and does not constitute an opinion or recommendation to any stockholder as to how to vote or act in connection with the merger or any related matter.

        In connection with rendering its opinion, BofA Merrill Lynch:

(i) reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information relating to Ultratech and Veeco; 

(ii) reviewed certain internal financial and operating information with respect to the business, operations and prospects of Ultratech furnished to or discussed with
BofA Merrill Lynch by the management of Ultratech, including certain financial forecasts relating to Ultratech prepared by the management of Ultratech; 

(iii) reviewed certain internal financial and operating information with respect to the business, operations and prospects of Veeco furnished to or discussed with BofA
Merrill Lynch by the management of Veeco, including certain financial forecasts relating to Veeco prepared by the management of Veeco (the "Veeco
Management Projections"); 

(iv) discussed the past and current business, operations, financial condition and prospects of Ultratech with members of senior management of Ultratech, and
discussed the past and current business, operations, financial condition and prospects of Veeco with members of senior managements of Ultratech and Veeco; 

(v) reviewed the potential pro forma financial impact of the merger on the future financial performance of Veeco, including the potential effect on Veeco's estimated
earnings per share; 

(vi) reviewed the trading histories for Ultratech common stock and Veeco common stock and a comparison of such trading histories with each other and with the
trading histories of other companies BofA Merrill Lynch deemed relevant; 

(vii) compared certain financial and stock market information of Ultratech and Veeco with similar information of other companies BofA Merrill Lynch deemed
relevant; 

(viii) compared certain financial terms of the merger to financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of other transactions BofA Merrill Lynch deemed relevant; 

(ix) considered the results of BofA Merrill Lynch's efforts on behalf of Ultratech to solicit, at the direction of Ultratech, indications of interest and definitive proposals
from third parties with respect to a possible acquisition of Ultratech; 

(x) reviewed a draft, dated January 31, 2017, of the merger agreement (the "Draft Agreement"); and 

(xi) performed such other analyses and studies and considered such other information and factors as BofA Merrill Lynch deemed appropriate.

        In arriving at its opinion, BofA Merrill Lynch assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the accuracy and completeness of the financial and other
information and data publicly available or provided to or otherwise reviewed by or discussed with it and relied upon the assurances of the managements of Ultratech and Veeco
that they were not aware of any facts or circumstances that would make such information or data inaccurate or misleading in any material respect. With respect to the Ultratech
Management Projections, BofA Merrill Lynch was advised by Ultratech, and assumed, that they were reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available
estimates and good faith judgments of the management of Ultratech as to the future financial performance of Ultratech. With respect to the Veeco Management Projections, BofA
Merrill Lynch was advised by Veeco that they were reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and good faith judgments of the management of
Veeco as to the future financial performance of Veeco and other matters covered thereby. BofA Merrill Lynch was not provided with, and it did not have access to, financial
forecasts relating to Veeco or estimates of cost savings anticipated to result from the merger, in each case, prepared by, or approved for BofA Merrill Lynch's use by, the
management of Ultratech. Accordingly, BofA Merrill Lynch did not perform any financial analysis on Veeco on a standalone basis

or pro forma for the consummation of the merger, except that it utilized Wall Street research analyst estimates to perform an illustrative analysis of Veeco pro forma for the
consummation of the merger. BofA Merrill Lynch was not provided with any independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of Ultratech
or Veeco, nor did it make any physical inspection of the properties or assets of Ultratech or Veeco. BofA Merrill Lynch did not evaluate the solvency or fair value of Ultratech or
Veeco under any state, federal or other laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. BofA Merrill Lynch assumed, at the direction of Ultratech, that the merger
would be consummated in accordance with its terms, without waiver, modification or amendment of any material term, condition or agreement and that, in the course of
obtaining the necessary governmental, regulatory and other approvals, consents, releases and waivers for the merger, no delay, limitation, restriction or condition, including any
divestiture requirements or amendments or modifications, would be imposed that would have an adverse effect on Ultratech, Veeco or the contemplated benefits of the merger.
BofA Merrill Lynch also assumed, at the direction of Ultratech, that the final executed merger agreement would not differ in any material respect from the Draft Agreement
reviewed by BofA Merrill Lynch.

        BofA Merrill Lynch expressed no view or opinion as to any terms or other aspects or implications of the merger (other than the merger consideration to the extent expressly
specified in its opinion), including, without limitation, the form or structure of the merger consideration or the merger or any terms, aspects or implications of any other
agreement, arrangement or understanding entered into in connection with or related to the merger or otherwise. BofA Merrill Lynch's opinion was limited to the fairness, from a
financial point of view, of the merger consideration to be received in the merger by holders of Ultratech common stock (other than Veeco, Merger Subsidiary and the holders of
dissenting shares) and no opinion or view was expressed with respect to any consideration received in connection with the merger by the holders of any class of securities,
creditors or other constituencies of any party. In addition, no opinion or view was expressed with respect to the fairness (financial or otherwise) of the amount, nature or any other
aspect of any compensation to any of the officers, directors or employees of any party to the merger, or class of such persons, relative to the merger consideration or otherwise.
Furthermore, no opinion or view was expressed as to the relative merits of the merger in comparison to other strategies or transactions that might be available to Ultratech or in
which Ultratech might engage or as to the underlying business decision of Ultratech to proceed with or effect the merger. In addition, BofA Merrill Lynch did not express any
view or opinion with respect to, and relied, at the direction of Ultratech, upon the assessments of representatives of Ultratech regarding, legal, regulatory, accounting, tax and
similar matters relating to Ultratech, Veeco and the merger (including the contemplated benefits of the merger) as to which BofA Merrill Lynch understood that Ultratech
obtained such advice as it deemed necessary from qualified professionals. BofA Merrill Lynch also did not express any opinion as to what the value of Veeco common stock
actually would be when issued or the prices at which Ultratech common stock or Veeco common stock would trade at any time, including following announcement or
consummation of the merger. In addition, BofA Merrill Lynch expressed no opinion or recommendation as to how any stockholder should vote or act in connection with the
merger or any related matter. Except as described above, Ultratech imposed no other limitations on the investigations made or procedures followed by BofA Merrill Lynch in
rendering its opinion.

        BofA Merrill Lynch's opinion was necessarily based on financial, economic, monetary, market and other conditions and circumstances as in effect on, and the information
made available to BofA Merrill Lynch as of, the date of its opinion. It should be understood that subsequent developments may affect its opinion, and BofA Merrill Lynch does
not have any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm its opinion. The issuance of BofA Merrill Lynch's opinion was approved by a fairness opinion review committee of BofA
Merrill Lynch.

        The discussion set forth below in the section entitled "Ultratech Financial Analyses" represents a summary of the material financial analyses presented by BofA Merrill
Lynch to Ultratech's board of directors in connection with its opinion. The financial analyses summarized below include information

Ultratech Financial Analyses.

        Selected Publicly Traded Companies Analysis.    BofA Merrill Lynch reviewed publicly available financial and stock market information for Ultratech and the following 15
publicly traded companies in the semiconductor equipment industry:

Large Cap Companies

• ASML Holding N.V. 

• KLA-Tencor Corporation 

• Applied Materials, Inc. 

• Lam Research Corporation 

• Tokyo Electron Limited

Mid / Small Cap Companies

• ASM International 

• BE Semiconductor Industries N.V.

• Nanometrics Incorporated 

• Orbotech Ltd. 

• Nova Measuring Instruments Ltd. 

• Photronics, Inc. 

• Kulicke & Soffa Industries, Inc. 

• AIXTRON SE 

• SÜSS MicroTec AG

        BofA Merrill Lynch reviewed, among other things, per share equity values, based on closing stock prices on January 31, 2017, of the selected publicly traded companies as a
multiple of calendar year 2017 non-GAAP estimated earnings per share, commonly referred to as non-GAAP EPS. BofA Merrill Lynch also reviewed enterprise values ("EV") of
the selected publicly traded companies, calculated as equity values based on closing stock prices on January 31, 2017, plus debt, plus minority interest, less cash, as a multiple of
calendar year 2017 estimated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciations and amortization, commonly referred to as EBITDA. This analysis indicated the following multiples
for the selected publicly traded companies:(1)

        BofA Merrill Lynch then applied calendar year 2017 non-GAAP EPS multiples of 12.0x to 21.5x derived from the selected publicly traded companies to Ultratech's
calendar year 2017 estimated non-GAAP EPS and applied calendar year 2017 EBITDA multiples of 8.0x to 12.0x derived from the selected publicly traded companies to
Ultratech's calendar year 2017 estimated EBITDA. Estimated financial data of the selected publicly traded companies were based on publicly available research analysts'
estimates, and estimated financial data of Ultratech were based on the Ultratech Management Projections. This analysis indicated the following approximate implied per share
equity value reference ranges for Ultratech, as compared to the merger consideration:

        No company used in this analysis is identical or directly comparable to Ultratech. Accordingly, an evaluation of the results of this analysis is not entirely mathematical.
Rather, this analysis involves complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and operating characteristics and other factors that could affect the public
trading or other values of the companies to which Ultratech was compared.

        BofA Merrill Lynch then applied NTM EBITDA multiples of 8.5x to 11.5x, derived from the selected transactions to Ultratech's NTM estimated EBITDA. Estimated
financial data of the selected transactions were based on publicly available information at the time of announcement of the relevant transaction. Estimated financial data of
Ultratech were based on the Ultratech Management Projections. This analysis indicated the following approximate implied per share equity value reference range for Ultratech,
as compared to the merger consideration:

        No company, business or transaction used in this analysis is identical or directly comparable to Ultratech or the merger. Accordingly, an evaluation of the results of this
analysis is not entirely mathematical. Rather, this analysis involves complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and operating characteristics and
other factors that could affect the acquisition or other values of the companies, business segments or transactions to which Ultratech and the merger were compared.

        Discounted Cash Flow Analysis.    BofA Merrill Lynch performed a discounted cash flow analysis of Ultratech to calculate the estimated present value of the standalone
unlevered, after-tax free cash flows that Ultratech was forecasted to generate during Ultratech's fiscal years 2017 through 2021 based on the Ultratech Management Projections.
BofA Merrill Lynch calculated terminal values for Ultratech by applying an illustrative range of perpetuity growth rates of 1.0% to 3.0% to Ultratech's calendar year 2021 free
cash flow. The free cash flows and terminal values were then discounted to present value as of December 31, 2016 using discount rates ranging from 12.0% to 15.0%, which
were based on an estimate of Ultratech's weighted average cost of capital derived by using the capital asset pricing model and taking into account the risk free rate, the levered
beta of Ultratech, the historical equity market risk premium, the estimated cost of debt of Ultratech, and a size premium based on the market capitalization of Ultratech. This
analysis indicated the following approximate implied per share equity value reference range for Ultratech as compared to the merger consideration:

Miscellaneous

        As noted above, the discussion set forth above in the section entitled "Ultratech Financial Analyses" is a summary of the material financial analyses presented by BofA
Merrill Lynch to Ultratech's board of directors in connection with its opinion and is not a comprehensive description of all analyses undertaken by BofA Merrill Lynch in
connection with its opinion. The preparation of a financial opinion is a complex analytical process involving various determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant
methods of financial analysis and the application of those methods to the particular circumstances and, therefore, a financial opinion is not readily susceptible to partial analysis
or summary description. BofA Merrill Lynch believes that its analyses summarized above must be considered as a whole. BofA Merrill Lynch further believes that selecting
portions of its analyses and the factors considered or focusing on information presented in tabular format, without considering all analyses and factors or the narrative description
of the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the processes underlying BofA Merrill Lynch's analyses and opinion. The fact that any specific analysis has been
referred to in the summary above is not meant to indicate that such analysis was given greater weight than any other analysis referred to in the summary.

        In performing its analyses, BofA Merrill Lynch considered industry performance, general business and economic conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond
the control of Ultratech and Veeco. The estimates of the future performance of Ultratech and Veeco in or underlying BofA Merrill Lynch's analyses are not necessarily indicative
of actual values or actual future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than those estimates or those suggested by BofA Merrill Lynch's analyses. These
analyses were prepared solely as part of BofA Merrill Lynch's analysis of the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the merger consideration and were provided to
Ultratech's board of directors in connection with the delivery of BofA Merrill Lynch's opinion. The analyses do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which a
company might actually be sold or the prices at which any securities have traded or may trade at any time in the future. Accordingly, the estimates used in, and the ranges of
valuations resulting from, any particular analysis described above are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty and should not be taken to be BofA Merrill Lynch's view of the
actual values of Ultratech or Veeco.

        The type and amount of consideration payable in the merger was determined through negotiations between Ultratech and Veeco, rather than by any financial advisor, and
was approved by Ultratech's board of directors. The decision to enter into the merger agreement was solely that of Ultratech's board of directors. As described above, BofA
Merrill Lynch's opinion and analyses were only one of

directors or management with respect to the merger or the merger consideration.

        Ultratech has agreed to pay BofA Merrill Lynch for its services in connection with the merger an aggregate fee currently estimated to be approximately $12 million,
$1 million of which was payable upon the delivery of its opinion and the remaining portion of which is contingent upon the completion of the merger. Ultratech also has agreed
to reimburse BofA Merrill Lynch for its expenses incurred in connection with BofA Merrill Lynch's engagement and to indemnify BofA Merrill Lynch, any controlling person of
BofA Merrill Lynch and each of their respective directors, officers, employees, agents and affiliates against specified liabilities, including liabilities under the federal securities
laws.

        BofA Merrill Lynch and its affiliates comprise a full service securities firm and commercial bank engaged in securities, commodities and derivatives trading, foreign
exchange and other brokerage activities, and principal investing as well as providing investment, corporate and private banking, asset and investment management, financing and
financial advisory services and other commercial services and products to a wide range of companies, governments and individuals. In the ordinary course of their businesses,
BofA Merrill Lynch and its affiliates may invest on a principal basis or on behalf of customers or manage funds that invest, make or hold long or short positions, finance
positions or trade or otherwise effect transactions in the equity, debt or other securities or financial instruments (including derivatives, bank loans or other obligations) of
Ultratech, Veeco and certain of their respective affiliates.

        BofA Merrill Lynch and its affiliates in the past have provided, currently are providing, and in the future may provide, investment banking, commercial banking and other
financial services to Ultratech and certain of its affiliates and have received or in the future may receive compensation for the rendering of these services, including (i) having
acted or acting as a manager for a share repurchase program of Ultratech and (ii) having provided or providing certain treasury management products and services to Ultratech
and/or certain of its affiliates. From February 1, 2015 through January 31, 2017, BofA Merrill Lynch and its affiliates derived aggregate revenues from Ultratech and its affiliates
of less than $1 million for investment and corporate banking services.

Certain Unaudited Prospective Ultratech and Veeco Financial Information 

Projections with respect to Ultratech

        Ultratech generally does not disclose projections of its expected future financial performance or position because of, among other things, the inherent difficulty of accurately
predicting financial performance for future periods and the possibility that the underlying assumptions and estimates may prove incorrect. While Ultratech has not generally
published financial projections, it has, from time to time, in its earnings conference calls, disclosed estimated ranges for its revenue and earnings per share for the immediately
succeeding calendar quarter.

        In connection with the strategic review process conducted by the Ultratech board, Ultratech management prepared non-public financial projections and operating data for
Ultratech as a stand-alone company, without giving effect to the merger, in late 2016 with respect to fiscal years 2017 and 2018 (which we refer to as the "Near Term Ultratech
Management Projections") and with respect to fiscal years 2019 through 2021 (which we refer to as the "Extended Ultratech Management Projections" and together with the Near
Term Ultratech Management Projections, the "Ultratech Management Projections"). The Ultratech Management Projections reflected Ultratech management's view of Ultratech's
future financial prospects as of late 2016. The Ultratech Management Projections assumed that Ultratech's business would achieve revenue growth over the forecast period,
supporting a compound annual growth rate ("CAGR") of 20.1% from 2016 to 2018 and of 3.8% from 2018 to 2021 for overall Ultratech revenue. Ultratech management did not
update such projections to take into account a variety of detailed assumptions or other matters that have changed since the preparation of the projections, such as Ultratech's
actual 2017 financial performance, further consolidation within the semiconductor industry, changes to general economic or sector conditions, geopolitical matters, the effects
that the strategic review process may have had on Ultratech's business, or the restrictions on the conduct of Ultratech's business imposed by the terms of the merger agreement.
The Ultratech Management Projections were based solely upon information available to Ultratech management at the time of their preparation. The Ultratech Management
Projections were provided to the Ultratech board and to Ultratech's financial advisor. Ultratech also provided the Near Term Ultratech Management Projections to Veeco.

        The summary set forth below includes the unaudited prospective Ultratech financial information which is referred to as "Ultratech Management Projections." The Ultratech
Management Projections were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure, and the inclusion of the summary Ultratech Management Projections below should not be
regarded as an indication that any of Ultratech, Veeco or any other recipient of this information considered, or now considers, it to be necessarily predictive of actual future
results. The Ultratech Management Projections were developed based solely upon information available at the time of their preparation.

        In addition, the Ultratech Management Projections were not prepared on a basis designed to comply with the guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified
Public Accountants with respect to the preparation and presentation of projections. Neither of Ultratech's nor Veeco's independent registered public accounting firms, which are
listed as experts in the section entitled "Experts" beginning on page 141 of this proxy statement/prospectus, nor any other independent accountants, has compiled, examined or
performed any procedures with respect to the Ultratech Management Projections summarized below, nor expressed any opinion or any other form of assurance on this
information or its achievability, and assumes no responsibility for, and disclaims any association with, the Ultratech Management Projections. The reports of the independent
registered public accounting firms included or incorporated by reference in this proxy statement/prospectus relate to historical financial statements. They do not extend to any
prospective financial information and should not be seen to do so.

        Although presented with numerical specificity, the Ultratech Management Projections were developed in accordance with variables, estimates and assumptions that are
inherently uncertain,

susceptible to multiple interpretations and may be beyond the control of Ultratech, and which may prove not to have been, or to no longer be, accurate. While in the view of
Ultratech's management, the Ultratech Management Projections were developed on bases that were reasonable at the time of their preparation, the Ultratech Management
Projections are subject to many risks and uncertainties. Important factors that may affect actual results and cause actual results to differ materially from the Ultratech
Management Projections include risks and uncertainties relating to Ultratech's businesses (including the effects that the pending merger may have on Ultratech's business),
industry performance, the regulatory environment, general business and economic conditions, market and financial conditions, transactions or events that were not anticipated at
the time the Ultratech Management Projections were prepared, various risks set forth in Ultratech's reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and other factors
described or referenced in the section entitled "Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" beginning on page 46 of this proxy statement/prospectus.

        The Ultratech Management Projections also do not take into account any circumstances, transactions or events occurring after the date the Ultratech Management
Projections were prepared. Accordingly, actual results have differed and will likely continue to differ, and may differ materially, from those contained in the Ultratech
Management Projections. Neither Ultratech nor Veeco can assure you that the financial results in the Ultratech Management Projections will be realized, or that future financial
results of Ultratech will not materially vary from those in the Ultratech Management Projections.

        None of Ultratech, Veeco or their respective affiliates, officers, directors, or other representatives gives any Ultratech stockholder, or any other person, any assurance that
actual results will not differ materially from the Ultratech Management Projections, and, except as otherwise required by law, none of them undertakes any obligation to update
or otherwise revise or reconcile the Ultratech Management Projections to reflect circumstances after the date the Ultratech Management Projections were generated, or to reflect
the occurrence of future events, even in the event that any or all of the assumptions and estimates underlying the Ultratech Management Projections are shown to be in error.

        No one has made or makes any representation to any Ultratech stockholder, or anyone else regarding, nor assumes any responsibility for the validity, reasonableness,
accuracy or completeness of the Ultratech Management Projections. You are cautioned not to rely on the Ultratech Management Projections. The inclusion of this information
should not be regarded as an indication that Ultratech, Veeco or any other recipient of this information considered, or now considers, it to be material or to be a reliable prediction
of actual future results. The Ultratech Management Projections have not been included to influence Ultratech stockholders' decision to vote for the adoption of the merger
agreement.

        The Ultratech Management Projections included below cover multiple years, and this information by its nature becomes subject to greater uncertainty with each successive
year. The Ultratech Management Projections should be evaluated, if at all, in conjunction with the historical financial statements and other information contained in this proxy
statement/prospectus and Ultratech's public filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission incorporated by reference herein.

        For the purposes of performing an illustrative analysis of Veeco pro forma for the merger, Ultratech's financial advisor used estimates of Veeco's financial performance for
the calendar year ending December 31, 2017 based on publicly available research analysts' consensus estimates which we refer to as the "Veeco Street Case." Research analysts
do not have access to non-public information affecting Veeco and projections were only available through 2018. The views of research analysts are not necessarily predictive of
future performance and may change from time to time. The inclusion of the Veeco Street Case below should not be regarded as an indication that any of Veeco, Ultratech or any

Interests of Ultratech's Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger 

        In considering the recommendation of the Ultratech Board with respect to the merger, you should be aware that some of Ultratech's directors and executive officers have
interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of Ultratech's stockholders generally. As described in more detail below, these interests include
payments and benefits that are expected to be provided to the directors and executive officers upon consummation of the merger or in connection with termination of their
employment under certain circumstances following the merger.

Consideration for Shares at the Effective Time of the Merger

        At the effective time of the merger, shares of Ultratech common stock beneficially owned by the executive officers and directors of Ultratech will be converted into the right

        As of February 28, 2017, Ultratech's directors and executive officers beneficially owned, in the aggregate, 926,674 shares of Ultratech common stock, excluding vested and
unvested equity awards, which are discussed below under "—Treatment of Equity Awards Held by Ultratech's Directors and Executive Officers." Assuming the merger was
consummated on June 1, 2017 and Ultratech's directors and executive officers continue to beneficially own, in the aggregate, 926,674 shares of Ultratech common stock until
such time, Ultratech's executive officers and directors will be entitled to receive an aggregate of $20,155,160 in cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes,
and 247,885 shares of Veeco common stock (which is valued at $6,779,655 using the closing stock price of Veeco common stock on Nasdaq on February 28, 2017 of $27.35 per
share), in the merger in exchange for those shares of Ultratech common stock.

Treatment of Equity Awards Held by Ultratech's Directors and Executive Officers

        The equity compensation held by directors and executive officers of Ultratech will generally be treated in the merger in the same manner as similar awards held by other
employees of Ultratech. See the section entitled "The Merger Agreement—Treatment of Ultratech Options and Other Equity-Based Awards" beginning on page 101 of this proxy
statement/prospectus. For the estimated amounts that would be payable to Ultratech's executive officers as a group and Ultratech's non-employee directors as a group for their
Ultratech Options and their Ultratech Vested RSUs, as well as the aggregate number of Converted RSUs deliverable to Ultratech's executive officers as a group and Ultratech's
non-employee directors as a group for their Ultratech Unvested RSUs, please see the section titled "Interests of Ultratech's Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger"
beginning on page 88 of this proxy statement/prospectus.

        In addition, pursuant to the employment agreements and change in control severance agreements described below, the unvested equity awards held by the named executive
officers may accelerate in full upon the merger, or, in certain circumstances, the executive's termination of employment following the merger. For information on the acceleration
provisions of these agreements, please see "Employment Agreements, Incentive Awards and Change in Control Severance Agreements with Ultratech's Executive Officers"
below. For an estimate of the amounts that would be payable to each of Ultratech's named executive officers in connection with any acceleration of their Ultratech equity awards,

proxy statement/prospectus.

Employment Agreements, Incentive Awards and Change in Control Severance Agreements with Ultratech's Executive Officers

Employment Agreements

        Ultratech has entered into employment agreements with each of Arthur W. Zafiropoulo and Bruce R. Wright (each, an "Employment Agreement"), which provide for a base
salary, target annual incentive compensation, lifetime retiree health care coverage, and severance benefits in the event such executive officer experiences certain qualifying
terminations, either outside a change in control or in connection with a change in control.

        Under Mr. Zafiropoulo's Employment Agreement, if Mr. Zafiropoulo's employment terminates for any reason in connection with a change of control, then he will receive
(i) the outstanding unvested balance of the bonuses earned for prior years, (ii) 24 months of continued base salary at the rate then in effect (or, if greater, in effect immediately
prior to the change of control) and (iii) continued use of a company car for 24 months. In addition, regardless of whether Mr. Zafiropoulo's employment is terminated in
connection with a change of control, all of Mr. Zafiropoulo's outstanding stock options and restricted stock unit awards (except the restricted stock unit award granted to
Mr. Zafiropoulo in 2017) will automatically vest in full upon a change of control, and the time for exercising his

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909791/000104746917002861/a2231953zdefm14a.htm 108/238

Table of Contents

outstanding options will be extended for a period of up to one year and 90 days measured from the termination date of his employment following the change in control. The
merger constitutes a "change in control" under Mr. Zafiropoulo's Employment Agreement.

        Should Mr. Zafiropoulo incur an excise tax under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code with respect to any payments he receives that constitute a parachute payment
under applicable federal tax laws, then he will receive a full tax gross-up payment to cover such excise tax and any income and employment taxes that apply to the gross-up
payment.

        In addition, Mr. Zafiropoulo is also entitled to reimbursement from Ultratech for the costs incurred to obtain lifetime retiree health care coverage (medical and dental) for
himself and his spouse. To the extent such reimbursements become taxable to Mr. Zafiropoulo or his spouse, he will be entitled to a full tax gross-up to cover the taxes
attributable to such reimbursements and any taxes that apply to the gross-up payment.

        Under Mr. Wright's Employment Agreement, if Mr. Wright's employment terminates for any reason in connection with a change of control, then he will receive (i) the
outstanding unvested balance of the bonuses earned for prior years, (ii) 24 months of continued base salary at the rate then in effect (or, if greater, in effect immediately prior to
the change of control) and (iii) reimbursement of the costs incurred by him to obtain lifetime retiree health care coverage for himself and his spouse to the extent those costs
exceed the amount charged an active employee of Ultratech for comparable health care coverage. In addition, regardless of whether Mr. Wright's employment is terminated in
connection with a change of control, all of Mr. Wright's outstanding stock options and restricted stock unit awards (except the restricted stock unit award granted to Mr. Wright in
2017) will automatically vest in full upon a change of control, and the time for exercising his outstanding vested options will be extended for a period of up to one year and
90 days measured from the termination date of his employment following the change in control. The merger constitutes a "change in control" under Mr. Wright's Employment
Agreement.

        With respect to the restricted stock unit awards granted to Mr. Zafiropoulo and Mr. Wright on January 31, 2017, if a change in control occurs and the awards are assumed by
the successor or acquirer of Ultratech, the awards' vesting schedules will change from cliff vesting fifty months after the grant date to monthly vesting over the same fifty months,
with the portion of the awards that would have vested on or before the change in control vesting on the change in control date. The remaining portion of the awards will not
accelerate upon the change in control. However, if the award is assumed and the executive's employment is terminated by Ultratech without cause or by the executive for good
reason (as those terms are defined in the Employment Agreement), the award will fully vest upon such termination of employment. The merger constitutes a "change in control"
under the award agreements for these grants.

        For an estimate of the amounts that would be payable to each of Mr. Zafiropoulo and Mr. Wright pursuant to their respective Employment Agreements if their employment
terminates in the circumstances described above, see the section entitled "—Quantification of Change in Control and Termination Payments and Benefits to Ultratech's Named
Executive Officers" beginning on page 92 of this proxy statement/prospectus.

Incentive Awards

        Each named executive officer has unvested bonuses under Ultratech's Management Incentive Program for each of 2014, 2015 and 2016. All unvested bonuses that have been
awarded under Ultratech's Management Incentive Program will become fully vested upon the closing of the merger.

        Ultratech entered into long-term cash award agreements with each of Mr. Zafiropoulo and Mr. Wright in March 2015 (each, a "Long-Term Award Agreement"). One-half of
the executive's target award amount would be eligible to vest if, for a period of 15 consecutive trading days ending on or before December 31, 2017, the closing price of the
Company's common stock exceeded $22.80, and the

remaining one-half of the target award amount would be eligible to vest if, for a period of 15 consecutive trading days ending on or before December 31, 2017, the closing price
of the Company's common stock exceeded $28.05. The award will generally be eligible to vest only if the executive's employment with Ultratech continues through the date the
applicable stock price target is achieved. If a stock price goal is met, twenty-five percent of the amount awarded to the executive and eligible to vest with respect to that goal will
immediately vest and be paid, while the remaining seventy-five percent of that amount will vest over a three-year period thereafter, subject to the executive's continued service
with the Company through the applicable vesting date. However, if the executive's employment terminates due to his death or disability or in circumstances that would trigger the
severance benefits provided in his Employment Agreement, any portion of the award that is subject only to time-based vesting will fully vest and be paid on his termination of
employment. Mr. Zafiropoulo's target award amount was $2,800,000, and Mr. Wright's target award amount was $1,000.000.

        The Long-Term Award Agreements also provide that, if a change in control occurs on or before December 31, 2019 and the executive's employment with Ultratech
continues through the change in control (or his employment is involuntarily terminated in connection with the change in control) then: (1) any portion of the award that is subject
only to time-based vesting will fully vest and be paid; and (2) if the consideration paid for a share of Ultratech's common stock in the transaction is $22.80 or more and the
executive had not yet earned the full amount of his target award opportunity based on stock price, the executive will be entitled to payment of an additional portion of such target
award (determined by applying such per share consideration to the $22.80 and $28.05 goals above, and pro-rating the target award opportunity if such per share consideration
falls between those goals) less any portion of the target award amount that had been earned based on stock price performance prior to the change in control. In no event will the
amount paid under an award exceed the executive's target award amount set forth above. The merger constitutes a "change in control" under the Long-Term Award Agreements.

        The stock price goal of $22.80 was achieved on July 29, 2016 and the stock price goal of $28.05 was achieved on February 23, 2017. Accordingly, upon the closing of the
merger, the remaining portion of each executive's target award allocated to these goals that is subject to time-based vesting will fully vest and be payable.

        For an estimate of the amounts that would be payable to each of Mr. Zafiropoulo and Mr. Wright pursuant to the Management Incentive Program and the Long-Term Cash
Award Agreements, see the section entitled "—Quantification of Change in Control and Termination Payments and Benefits to Ultratech's Named Executive Officers" beginning
on page 92 of this proxy statement/prospectus.

        Stock options and restricted stock units granted by Ultratech prior to January 31, 2017 generally provide that they will become fully vested upon an Ultratech "corporate
transaction." The merger constitutes such a "corporate transaction" under the award agreements for these grants. The restricted stock unit awards granted by Ultratech on
January 31, 2017 will not fully accelerate on the merger. Ultratech's January 31, 2017 awards provide that they will vest fifty months after the date of grant of the awards and, on
the merger, the vesting schedule will become a monthly vesting schedule over this same period of fifty months with any portion of the award that would have vested on or prior
to the merger under the monthly vesting schedule becoming vested on the merger. The January 31, 2017 awards also provided that, if the award recipient's employment is
terminated after the merger in circumstances that entitle the award recipient to severance benefits under his or her employment or change in control severance agreement with
Ultratech, the award will fully vest if the termination of employment is without "cause" and, in the event the termination of employment is by the award recipient for "good
reason", the award will vest to the extent it would have otherwise vested in the twelve months following the termination (except that the grants to Messrs. Zafiropoulo and Wright
will fully vest in the event the award recipient resigns for "good reason").

Change in Control Severance Agreements

        Ultratech has entered into change in control severance agreements with each of Dave Ghosh and Tammy D. Landon (each, a "Change in Control Severance Agreement").
Pursuant to the Change in Control Severance Agreements, Mr. Ghosh and Ms. Landon will be entitled to receive, in the event of a termination of employment without "cause" or
a resignation for "good reason" (as the terms are defined in the Change in Control Severance Agreements), in each case within 12 months after a change in control that occurs on
or before June 30, 2018:

• A lump sum payment in cash equal to the executive's highest annualized rate of base salary from Ultratech in effect at any time in the one year period preceding
the termination of employment with Ultratech ("Base Salary Rate"); 

• A lump sum payment in cash equal to 25% of the executive's Base Salary Rate in lieu of any additional cash bonus; 

• 100% acceleration of unvested equity awards outstanding immediately prior to the executive's termination of employment with Ultratech (unless the terms and
conditions of the applicable award agreement expressly supersede the Change in Control Severance Agreement); 

• The amount of any deferred bonus with respect to any completed fiscal year of Ultratech that remains outstanding and unpaid (including any such bonus that
remains subject to vesting based on the passage of time and continued service).

        In each case, the executive's right to receive these benefits is contingent on the executive signing and not revoking a general release agreement containing a release of claims
in favor of Ultratech, The merger constitutes a change of control as defined in the Change in Control Severance Agreement. For an estimate of the amounts that would be payable
to each of Mr. Ghosh and Ms. Landon pursuant to their respective Change in Control Severance Agreement if their employment terminates in the circumstances described above,
see the section entitled "—Quantification of Change in Control and Termination Payments and Benefits to Ultratech's Named Executive Officers" beginning on page 92 of this
proxy statement/prospectus.

Director and Officer Indemnification and Insurance

        Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, Veeco has agreed to indemnify and hold harmless the directors and officers of Ultratech for a period of six years following
the effective time of the merger. The directors and officers of Ultratech will also be entitled to certain ongoing indemnification and coverage under directors' and officers' liability
insurance policies following the effective time of the merger. Such indemnification and insurance coverage is further described in the section entitled "The Merger Agreement—
Directors' and Officers' Indemnification and Insurance" beginning on page 117 of this proxy statement/prospectus.

Quantification of Change in Control and Termination Payments and Benefits to Ultratech's Named Executive Officers

        In accordance with Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K, the table below sets forth the amount of payments and benefits that each of Ultratech's named executive officers may
receive in connection with the merger, assuming that the merger was consummated on June 1, 2017 and such named executive officer experienced a termination of employment
on that date in circumstances entitling the executive officer to severance benefits under the executive's employment or change in control severance agreement, as the case may be,
with the Company. The amounts below are determined using an assumed price per share of Ultratech common stock of $29.07. As a result of the foregoing assumptions, the
actual amounts, if any, to be received by a named executive officer may materially differ from the amounts set forth below.

entitled to full accelerated vesting of their then outstanding equity awards upon a change in control, regardless of whether their employment with
Ultratech is terminated, except that the restricted stock unit awards granted to each executive in 2017 will fully accelerate only if the award is not
assumed by the successor or acquirer of Ultratech or, if the award is assumed, in the case of the awards granted to Messrs. Zafiropoulo and Wright the
executive's employment is terminated after the change in control by Ultratech without cause or by the executive for good reason. In addition, pursuant to

Regulatory Clearances Required for the Merger 

        Veeco and Ultratech have each agreed to take certain actions in order to obtain regulatory clearance required to consummate the merger. The merger is subject to the HSR
Act. Under this

94

executive's Ultratech Options and Ultratech Vested RSUs will be settled in accordance with the merger agreement.

For purposes of this table, the value of the accelerated Ultratech Options is equal to $29.07 less the exercise price multiplied by the number of shares
subject to such awards as of February 28, 2017 that are not otherwise scheduled to vest before June 1, 2017. The value of the accelerated Ultratech
restricted stock units is equal to $29.07 multiplied by the number of shares subject to such awards as of February 28, 2017 that are not otherwise
scheduled to vest before June 1, 2017.

The following table illustrates the allocation of the aggregate total reported in the column for each named executive officer's (i) Ultratech Options,
(ii) Ultratech RSUs that automatically accelerate on a change in control ("single-trigger) and (iii) Ultratech RSUs that accelerate only if a change in
control occurs and the executive's employment terminates in circumstances that trigger accelerated vesting under the arrangements described above or
the award is not assumed by the successor or acquirer in the change in control ("double-trigger"), in each case based on the number of shares subject to
the award as of February 28, 2017, assuming a termination of employment without "cause" and, in the case of Ultratech Options and Ultratech RSUs, to
the extent the award is not otherwise scheduled to vest before June 1, 2017.

The value of the Ultratech Options held by each named executive officer that are already scheduled to be vested on June 1, 2017 (without regard to the
merger) that would be cashed out in the merger, calculated as $29.07 less the exercise price multiplied by the number of shares subject to such options
as of February 28, 2017, is $1,923,560 for Mr. Zafiropoulo, $1,999,486 for Mr. Wright, $356,103 for Mr. Ghosh, and $253,963 for Ms. Landon. 

(3) Perquisites/Benefits. This column includes the estimated cost to provide lifetime retiree medical coverage for Messrs. Zafiropoulo and Wright pursuant
to their respective Employment Agreements. This column also includes $152,400 attributable to the costs of a company car provided to Mr. Zafiropoulo
pursuant to the terms of his Employment Agreement as described above. As noted above, Mr. Zafiropoulo would also be entitled to tax gross-up
payments for his taxes incurred in connection with the retiree medical coverage provided in his Employment Agreement. No value has been included in
the table above as to this provision of Mr. Zafiropoulo's employment agreement as future tax rates, and the extent to which such benefits would be
taxable, are uncertain. 

(4) As noted above, Mr. Zafiropoulo would be entitled to a tax gross-up payment under his Employment Agreement if any payments he receives in
connection with the merger would trigger an excise tax under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code. Based on the assumptions noted above,
Ultratech estimates that Mr. Zafiropoulo's payments in connection with the merger will not result in any excise tax under Section 4999 and, accordingly,
that no gross-up payment will be made to Mr. Zafiropoulo pursuant to this provision of his Employment Agreement.

statute, Veeco and Ultratech are required to make pre-merger notification filings and await the expiration or early termination of the statutory waiting period prior to completing
the merger. Veeco and Ultratech completed the initial HSR Act filings on February 9, 2017. On February 17, 2017, Veeco and Ultratech received notice from the U.S. Federal
Trade Commission that it had granted early termination, effective immediately, of the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act with respect to the merger.

        During or after the statutory waiting periods and clearance of the merger, and even after completion of the merger, the Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Justice,
or other governmental authorities, including any attorney general of any state of the United States, could challenge or seek to block the merger under relevant antitrust laws. In
addition, in some jurisdictions, a competitor, customer or other third party could initiate a private action under the antitrust laws challenging or seeking to enjoin the merger,
before or after it is completed. Veeco and Ultratech cannot be sure that a challenge to the merger will not be made or that, if a challenge is made, Veeco and/or Ultratech will
prevail.

Dividends and Distributions 

        The merger agreement provides that Ultratech may not pay dividends or other distributions to its stockholders.

Listing of Shares of Veeco Common Stock 

        It is a condition to the completion of the merger that the shares of Veeco common stock to be issued to Ultratech stockholders in connection with the merger be approved for
listing on Nasdaq at or prior to the effective time, subject to official notice of issuance.

Delisting and Deregistration of Ultratech Common Stock 

        Upon completion of the merger, shares of Ultratech common stock currently listed on Nasdaq will cease to be listed on Nasdaq and will subsequently be deregistered under
the Exchange Act.

Appraisal Rights 

        Holders of shares of Ultratech common stock who do not vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement and who properly demand appraisal of their shares will be
entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the merger under Section 262 of the DGCL.

        The following discussion is not a complete statement of the law pertaining to appraisal rights under the DGCL and is qualified in its entirety by the full text of
Section 262 of the DGCL which is attached to this proxy statement/prospectus as Annex C. The following summary does not constitute any legal or other advice nor
does it constitute a recommendation that stockholders exercise their appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL.

        Under Section 262 of the DGCL, subject to the terms and conditions of Section 262 of the DGCL including Section 262(g) of the DGCL described below, holders of shares
of Ultratech common stock who do not vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement and who otherwise follow the requirements of and procedures set forth in
Section 262 of the DGCL will be entitled to have their shares appraised by the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (the "Court of Chancery") and to receive payment in
cash of the "fair value" of the shares, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, as determined by the Court of Chancery,
together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value.

        Under Section 262 of the DGCL, where a merger agreement is to be submitted for adoption at a meeting of stockholders, the corporation, not less than 20 days
prior to the meeting, must notify each of its stockholders entitled to appraisal rights that appraisal rights are available and include in the notice a copy of Section 262 of
the DGCL. This proxy statement/prospectus constitutes that notice, and

the full text of Section 262 of the DGCL is attached to this proxy statement/prospectus as Annex C. Any holder of Ultratech common stock who wishes to exercise
appraisal rights, or who wishes to preserve such holder's right to do so, should review the following discussion and Annex C carefully because failure to timely and properly
comply with the procedures specified will result in the loss of appraisal rights. Moreover, because of the complexity of the procedures for exercising the right to seek appraisal of
shares of common stock, Ultratech believes that if a stockholder considers exercising such rights, such stockholder should seek the advice of legal counsel.

        Filing Written Demand.    Any holder of Ultratech common stock wishing to exercise appraisal rights must deliver to Ultratech, before the vote on the adoption of the
merger agreement at the special meeting at which the proposal to adopt the merger agreement will be submitted to the Ultratech stockholders, a written demand for the appraisal
of the stockholder's shares. A holder of shares of Ultratech common stock wishing to exercise appraisal rights must hold of record the shares on the date the written demand for
appraisal is made and must continue to hold the shares of record through the effective date of the merger, since appraisal rights will be lost if the shares are transferred prior to the
effective date of the merger. The holder must not vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement. A proxy that is submitted and does not contain voting instructions will,
unless revoked, be voted in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement, and it will constitute a waiver of the stockholder's right of appraisal and will nullify any previously
delivered written demand for appraisal. Therefore, a stockholder who submits a proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights must submit a proxy containing instructions to
vote against the adoption of the merger agreement or abstain from voting on the adoption of the merger agreement. Neither voting against the adoption of the merger agreement,
nor abstaining from voting or failing to vote on the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, will in and of itself constitute a written demand for appraisal satisfying the
requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL. The written demand for appraisal must be in addition to and separate from any proxy or vote on the adoption of the merger agreement.
The demand must reasonably inform Ultratech of the identity of the holder as well as the intention of the holder to demand an appraisal of the "fair value" of the shares held by
the holder. A stockholder's failure to make the written demand prior to the taking of the vote on the adoption of the merger agreement at the special meeting will constitute a
waiver of appraisal rights.

        Only a holder of record of shares of Ultratech common stock is entitled to demand an appraisal of the shares registered in that holder's name. A demand for appraisal in
respect of shares of Ultratech common stock should be executed by or on behalf of the holder of record, fully and correctly, as the holder's name appears on the holder's stock
certificates, should specify the holder's name and mailing address and the number of shares registered in the holder's name and must state that the person intends thereby to
demand appraisal of the holder's shares in connection with the merger. If the shares are owned of record in a fiduciary capacity, such as by a trustee, guardian or custodian,
execution of the demand should be made in that capacity, and if the shares are owned of record by more than one person, as in a joint tenancy and tenancy in common, the
demand should be executed by or on behalf of all joint owners. An authorized agent, including an agent for two or more joint owners, may execute a demand for appraisal on
behalf of a holder of record; however, the agent must identify the record owner or owners and expressly disclose that, in executing the demand, the agent is acting as agent for the
record owner or owners. If the shares are held in "street name" by a broker, bank or nominee, the broker, bank or nominee may exercise appraisal rights with respect to the shares
held for one or more beneficial owners while not exercising the rights with respect to the shares held for other beneficial owners; in such case, however, the written demand
should set forth the number of shares as to which appraisal is sought and where no number of shares is expressly mentioned the demand will be presumed to cover all shares of
Ultratech common stock held in the name of the record owner. Stockholders who hold their shares in brokerage accounts or other nominee forms and who wish to exercise
appraisal rights are urged to consult with their brokers to determine the appropriate procedures for the making of a demand for appraisal by such a nominee.

Table of Contents

        All written demands for appraisal pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL should be sent or delivered to: Ultratech, Inc., 3050 Zanker Road, San Jose, California
95134 Attn: Bruce Wright.

        At any time within 60 days after the effective time, any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party may
withdraw his, her or its demand for appraisal and accept the merger consideration by delivering to Ultratech, as the surviving corporation, a written withdrawal of the demand for
appraisal. Any such attempt to withdraw the demand made more than 60 days after the effective time will require written approval of Ultratech. No appraisal proceeding in the
Court of Chancery will be dismissed as to any stockholder without the approval of the Court of Chancery, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Court of
Chancery deems just; provided, however, that any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party may withdraw his, her
or its demand for appraisal and accept the merger consideration within 60 days after the effective date of the merger. Any stockholder who withdraws his, her or its demand will
be deemed to have accepted the terms of the merger agreement, which are summarized in this proxy statement/prospectus and is attached in its entirety as Annex A. If the
surviving corporation does not approve a request to withdraw a demand for appraisal when that approval is required, or if the Court of Chancery does not approve the dismissal
of an appraisal proceeding, the stockholder will be entitled to receive only the appraised value determined in any such appraisal proceeding, which value could be less than, equal
to or more than the consideration being offered pursuant to the merger agreement.

        Notice by the Surviving Corporation.    Within ten days after the effective time, Ultratech, as the surviving corporation must notify each former holder of Ultratech common
stock who has made a written demand for appraisal pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL, and who has not voted in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement, of the date on
which the merger became effective.

        Filing a Petition for Appraisal.    Within 120 days after the effective time, but not thereafter, the surviving corporation or any holder of Ultratech common stock who has
complied with Section 262 of the DGCL and is entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the
Court of Chancery demanding a determination of the fair value of the shares held by all dissenting holders. The surviving corporation is under no obligation to and has no present
intention to file a petition and holders should not assume that the surviving corporation will file a petition or initiate any negotiations with respect to the fair value of the
dissenting holders' shares. Accordingly, it is the obligation of the former holders of Ultratech common stock to initiate all necessary action to perfect their appraisal rights in
respect of shares of Ultratech common stock within the time prescribed in Section 262 of the DGCL. Within 120 days after the effective time, any holder of Ultratech common
stock who has complied with the requirements for exercise of appraisal rights will be entitled, upon written request, to receive from the surviving corporation a statement setting
forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement and with respect to which demands for appraisal have been received and the
aggregate number of holders of such shares. The statement must be mailed within ten days after a written request therefor has been received by the surviving corporation or
within ten days after the expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal, whichever is later. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a person who is the beneficial owner of
shares of Ultratech common stock held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person may, in such person's own name, file a petition or request from Ultratech
the statement described in this paragraph.

        If a petition for an appraisal is timely filed by a holder of shares of Ultratech common stock and a copy thereof is served upon the surviving corporation, the surviving
corporation will then be obligated within 20 days to file with the Delaware Register in Chancery a duly verified list containing the names and addresses of all stockholders who
have demanded an appraisal of their shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares have not been reached. After notice to the stockholders as required by the
court, the Court of Chancery is empowered to conduct a hearing on the petition to determine those stockholders who have complied with Section 262 of the DGCL and who have
become

entitled to appraisal rights thereunder. The Court of Chancery may require the stockholders who demanded payment for their shares to submit their stock certificates to the
Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceeding; and if any stockholder fails to comply with the direction, the Court of Chancery may
dismiss the proceedings as to the stockholder. Notwithstanding a stockholder's compliance with the foregoing requirements, Section 262(g) of the DGCL provides that, because
immediately prior to the effective time of the merger Ultratech common stock will be listed on a national securities exchange, the Court of Chancery will dismiss the proceedings
as to all holders of Ultratech common stock who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless (1) the total number of shares entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the outstanding
shares of the class or series eligible for appraisal or (2) the value of the consideration provided in the merger for such total number of shares exceeds $1 million.

        Determination of Fair Value.    After the Court of Chancery determines the former holders of Ultratech common stock entitled to appraisal, the appraisal proceeding shall be
conducted in accordance with the rules of the Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings. Through such proceeding, the Court of
Chancery shall determine the "fair value" of the shares, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, together with interest, if
any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. Unless the Court of Chancery in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest from the
effective date of the merger through the date of payment of the judgment shall be compounded quarterly and shall accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including
any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the effective date of the merger and the date of payment of the judgment.

        In determining fair value, the Court of Chancery will take into account all relevant factors. In Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the Supreme Court of Delaware discussed the factors
that could be considered in determining fair value in an appraisal proceeding, stating that "proof of value by any techniques or methods that are generally considered acceptable
in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court" should be considered, and that "[f]air price obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the
value of a company". The Delaware Supreme Court stated that, in making this determination of fair value, the court must consider market value, asset value, dividends, earnings
prospects, the nature of the enterprise and any other facts that could be ascertained as of the date of the merger that throw any light on future prospects of the merged corporation.
Section 262 of the DGCL provides that fair value is to be "exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger". In Cede & Co. v.
Technicolor,  Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court stated that such exclusion is a "narrow exclusion [that] does not encompass known elements of value," but which rather applies
only to the speculative elements of value arising from such accomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger, the Supreme Court of Delaware also stated that "elements of future
value, including the nature of the enterprise, which are known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the merger and not the product of speculation, may be considered".

        Stockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as so determined could be less than, the same as or more than the merger
consideration and that an investment banking opinion as to fairness from a financial point of view is not an opinion as to fair value under Section 262 of the DGCL.

        Although Ultratech believes that the merger consideration is fair, no representation is made as to the outcome of the appraisal of fair value as determined by the Court of
Chancery, and stockholders should recognize that such an appraisal could result in a determination of a value lower or higher than, or the same as, the merger consideration.
Neither Veeco nor Ultratech anticipate offering more than the merger consideration to any stockholder of Ultratech exercising appraisal rights, and reserve the right to assert, in
any appraisal proceeding, that for purposes of Section 262 of the DGCL, the "fair value" of a share of Ultratech common stock is less than the merger consideration.

        If a petition for appraisal is not timely filed, then the right to an appraisal will cease. The costs of the action may be determined by the Court of Chancery and taxed upon the
parties as the Court of Chancery deems equitable under the circumstances. Upon application of a stockholder, the Court of Chancery may order all or a portion of the expenses
incurred by a stockholder in connection with an appraisal proceeding, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and the fees and expenses of experts utilized in the
appraisal proceeding, to be charged pro rata against the value of all the shares entitled to be appraised.

        If any stockholder who demands appraisal of shares of Ultratech common stock under Section 262 of the DGCL fails to perfect, successfully withdraws or loses such
holder's right to appraisal, the stockholder's shares of Ultratech common stock will be deemed to have been converted at the effective time into the right to receive the merger
consideration. A stockholder will fail to perfect, or effectively lose, the holder's right to appraisal if no petition for appraisal is filed within 120 days after the effective time.

        THE PROCESS OF DEMANDING AND EXERCISING APPRAISAL RIGHTS REQUIRES STRICT COMPLIANCE WITH TECHNICAL PREREQUISITES.
FAILURE TO COMPLY STRICTLY WITH ALL OF THE PROCEDURES SET FORTH IN SECTION 262 OF THE DGCL WILL RESULT IN THE LOSS OF A
STOCKHOLDER'S STATUTORY APPRAISAL RIGHTS. IF YOU WISH TO EXERCISE YOUR APPRAISAL RIGHTS, YOU SHOULD CONSULT WITH YOUR
OWN LEGAL COUNSEL. TO THE EXTENT THERE ARE ANY INCONSISTENCIES BETWEEN THE FOREGOING SUMMARY AND SECTION 262 OF THE
DGCL, THE DGCL WILL GOVERN.

Litigation Related to the Merger 

        On March 17, 2017, an Ultratech shareholder filed a purported class action complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, captioned The
Vladimir Gusinsky Rev. Trust v. Ultratech, Inc., et al., Case No. 4:17-cv-01468-PJH, on behalf of itself and all other Ultratech shareholders against Ultratech, its directors at the
time the acquisition was announced, Veeco, and Merger Sub. The complaint alleges, among other things, that in connection with Veeco's proposed acquisition of Ultratech, the
defendants purportedly agreed to a supposedly inadequate price for the Ultratech shares, agreed to unreasonable deal-protection measures, and potentially engaged in supposed
self-dealing. The complaint seeks to recover under Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 for alleged misstatements and omissions in the preliminary
proxy statement filed on March 13, 2017. The complaint seeks declaratory and injunctive relief, including enjoining or rescinding the transaction and rescissory damages to the
extent already implemented, an order directing the dissemination of a proxy statement that is not false or misleading, and an award of attorneys' and experts' fees.

        On March 22, 2017, two other Ultratech shareholders filed a purported class action complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, captioned De
Letter et al. v. Ultratech, Inc., et al., Case No. 3:17-cv-01542-WHA, on behalf of themselves and all other Ultratech shareholders against Ultratech and its directors at the time
the acquisition was announced. The complaint alleges, among other things, that in connection with Veeco's proposed acquisition of Ultratech, the defendants purportedly agreed
to a supposedly inadequate price for the Ultratech shares and potentially engaged in supposed self-dealing. The complaint further alleges that the sale process was flawed and
tainted by the self-interest of certain directors. The complaint seeks to recover under Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 for alleged misstatements
and omissions in the preliminary proxy statement filed on March 13, 2017. The complaint seeks injunctive relief, including enjoining or rescinding the transaction and rescissory
damages to the extent already implemented, compensatory damages, and an award of attorneys' and experts' fees.

        The defendants have not yet responded to either complaint. While it is too early to predict the outcome of litigation or a reasonable range of potential losses, Ultratech
believes these lawsuits are without merit. Additional lawsuits arising out of or relating to the merger agreement or the merger may be filed in the future.

THE MERGER AGREEMENT 

        The following discussion summarizes material provisions of the merger agreement entered into by Veeco, Merger Subsidiary and Ultratech. This summary does not propose
to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete copies of the merger agreement, which is attached as Annex A to this proxy statement/prospectus. The
rights and obligations of the parties are governed by the express terms and conditions of the merger agreement and not by this summary. The merger agreement should not be
read alone, but should instead be read in conjunction with the other information provided elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus, including the annexes and the documents
incorporated by reference into this proxy statement/prospectus, before making any decisions regarding the merger.

        The merger agreement is described in this proxy statement/prospectus only to provide you with information regarding its terms and conditions and is not intended to provide
any factual information about Veeco, Ultratech or their respective businesses. The representations, warranties and covenants contained in the merger agreement have been made
solely for the benefit of the parties to the merger agreement. In addition, such representations, warranties and covenants: (1) have been made only for purposes of the merger
agreement; (2) have been qualified by certain disclosures made by the parties to one another not reflected in the text of the merger agreement; (3) may be subject to materiality
qualifications contained in the merger agreement which may differ from what may be viewed as material by you; (4) were made only as of February 2, 2017 or other specific
dates; and (5) have been included in the merger agreement for the purpose of allocating risk between the contracting parties rather than establishing matters as facts.
Accordingly, the summary of the merger agreement is included in this proxy statement/prospectus only to provide you with information regarding the terms of the merger and not
to provide you with any other factual information regarding Veeco, Ultratech or their respective businesses. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the
representations, warranties and covenants may change after February 2, 2017, which subsequent information may or may not be fully reflected in Veeco's or Ultratech's public
disclosures.

The Merger 

        On February 2, 2017, Veeco, Ultratech and Merger Subsidiary entered into the merger agreement, pursuant to which Veeco agreed to acquire Ultratech by way of a merger
of Merger Subsidiary with and into Ultratech, with Ultratech, as the surviving corporation, becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Veeco

Merger Consideration 

        Each of the Veeco board and the Ultratech board has approved the merger agreement, which provides for the merger of Merger Subsidiary with and into Ultratech. Upon the
effective time, Ultratech will be the surviving corporation and will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Veeco. Each share of Ultratech common stock that is issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the effective time (other than (i) shares of Ultratech common stock owned by Veeco or Merger Subsidiary and shares of treasury stock held by
Ultratech, which will be canceled without consideration, (ii) shares of Ultratech stock held by any subsidiary of either Ultratech or Veeco, which will be converted into such
number of shares of common stock of the surviving corporation such that each subsidiary owns the same percentage of the surviving corporation immediately following the
effective time as such subsidiary owned of Ultratech immediately prior to the effective time (such shares, together with the shares described in clause (i) are referred to as
"excluded shares") and (iii) shares held by holders of Ultratech common stock, if any, who properly exercise their appraisal rights under the DGCL (which we refer to as
"dissenting shares")) will be automatically cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount equal to (1) $21.75 in cash without interest (which we refer to as the "cash
consideration"), (2) 0.2675 of a share of Veeco, par value $0.01 per share (which we refer to as the "stock consideration", and together with the cash consideration, the "merger
consideration") and

(3) cash in lieu of fractional shares of Veeco common stock as contemplated by the merger agreement. If, prior to the effective time, any change in the outstanding shares of
capital stock of Ultratech occurs, including by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock
dividend with a record date during such period (other than any change that results from any exercise of options or the vesting of restricted share units outstanding as of the date of
the merger agreement to purchase shares of Ultratech common stock granted under Ultratech's stock option or compensation plans or arrangements), then the merger
consideration and other amounts payable pursuant to the merger agreement will be appropriately adjusted. If, prior to the effective time, the outstanding shares of common stock
of Veeco have been changed into a different number of shares or a different class as the result of a reclassification, recapitalization, stock split or combination, exchange or
readjustment, or stock dividend or other similar change in capitalization, then an appropriate and proportionate adjustment will be made to the stock consideration.

        Veeco will not issue any fractional shares of Veeco common stock in the merger. Instead, Ultratech stockholders will receive cash (rounded to the nearest whole cent),
without interest, for any fractional entitlements to a share of Veeco common stock that they might otherwise receive in the merger in an amount equal to the product of the
fraction of a share of Veeco common stock to which such holder would otherwise have been entitled multiplied by the volume weighted average trading price of Veeco common
stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market (or, if the Nasdaq Global Select Market is not then the principal U.S. trading market for Veeco common stock, the principal U.S.
national securities exchange on which Veeco common stock is traded) for the five consecutive trading days ending on the trading day immediately preceding the date on which
the closing occurs.

Treatment of Ultratech Options and Other Equity-Based Awards 

        Under the merger agreement, the equity awards as of the effective time of the merger will be treated as follows:

        Stock Options.    At or immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, each outstanding Ultratech Option, will vest and be canceled and converted into the right to
receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Ultratech common stock subject to such Ultratech Option immediately prior to the effective time and
(ii) the excess, if any, of (A) the Equity Award Merger Consideration, over (B) the exercise price per share subject to such canceled Ultratech Option. Ultratech Options that have
an exercise price per share that is greater than the Equity Award Merger Consideration will be canceled in exchange for no consideration. Veeco will cause the surviving
corporation to pay the cash payment described above to the holder of the applicable Ultratech Option at or reasonably promptly after the effective time of the merger (but in no
event later than three business days after the effective time).

        Vested Restricted Stock Units.    At or immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, each outstanding Ultratech Vested RSU will be canceled and converted into the
right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Ultratech common stock subject to such Ultratech Vested RSU immediately prior to the
effective time and (ii) the Equity Award Merger Consideration. Veeco will cause the surviving corporation to pay the cash payment described above to the holder of the
applicable Ultratech Vested RSU at or reasonably promptly after the effective time of the merger (but in no event later than three business days after the effective time).

        Unvested Restricted Stock Units.    At the effective time of the merger, each outstanding Ultratech Unvested RSU will be assumed by Veeco and converted into a number of
Converted RSUs, rounded down to the nearest whole number, equal to the product of (i) the number of shares subject to the Ultratech Unvested RSU and (ii) the Equity
Conversion Ratio. Any Converted RSUs so issued will be subject to the same terms and conditions as were applicable under the Ultratech Unvested RSUs;

Effect of the Merger; Effective Time; Organizational Documents of the Surviving Corporation 

Effect of the Merger

        The merger agreement provides for the merger of Merger Subsidiary with and into Ultratech, with Ultratech surviving the merger as the surviving corporation and a wholly
owned subsidiary of Veeco.

        As a result of the merger, there will no longer be any publicly held shares of Ultratech common stock. Ultratech stockholders will only participate in the surviving
corporation's future earnings and potential growth through their ownership of Veeco common stock. All of the other incidents of direct ownership of Ultratech common stock,
such as the right to vote on certain corporate decisions, to elect directors and to receive dividends and distributions from Ultratech, will be extinguished upon completion of the
merger. All of the properties, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of Ultratech shall vest in the surviving corporation, and all debts, duties and liabilities of Ultratech shall
become the debts, liabilities and duties of the surviving corporation.

Closing and Effective Time

        The parties are obligated to effect the merger only if all of the conditions to closing under the merger agreement are either satisfied or waived at or prior to the effective time.
Veeco and Ultratech expect the closing to occur during the second quarter of calendar year 2017. However, the merger is subject to various regulatory approvals and the
satisfaction or waiver of other conditions, and it is possible that factors outside the control of Veeco and Ultratech could result in the merger being completed at an earlier time, a
later time or not at all.

        The merger will become effective at such time as a certificate of merger is duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on the date on which the closing
occurs, or at such subsequent date or time as may be specified in the certificate of merger.

        In the merger agreement, Veeco and Ultratech have agreed that the date on which the closing occurs shall be no later than the first business day following the satisfaction or
waiver of the last of the conditions to closing (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at closing, but subject to the satisfaction or, to the extent
permissible, waiver of those conditions), or at such other date and time as Veeco and Ultratech may mutually agree consistent with Delaware law.

Organizational Documents of the Surviving Corporation

        Unless otherwise determined by Veeco prior to the effective time, at the effective time, (1) the certificate of incorporation of Merger Subsidiary immediately prior to the
effective time will be the certificate of incorporation of the surviving corporation from and after the effective time and (2) the bylaws of Merger Subsidiary immediately prior to
the effective time will be the bylaws of the surviving corporation from and after the effective time.

Conversion of Shares 

        The conversion of each share of Ultratech common stock (other excluded shares and dissenting shares (if any)) into the right to receive the merger consideration will occur
automatically at the effective time.

Exchange Agent; Letter of Transmittal 

        Prior to the effective time, Veeco will appoint an agent reasonably acceptable to Ultratech to act as the exchange agent of Veeco for purposes of, among other things,
exchanging for the merger consideration certificates representing shares of Ultratech common stock and uncertificated shares of Veeco common stock. Promptly after the
effective time (but in no event later than two business days after the effective time), Veeco shall (1) send, or cause the exchange agent to send, to each holder of shares of
Ultratech common stock (whether in certificate or book-entry form) at the effective time a letter of transmittal (in a form that was reasonably acceptable to Ultratech prior to the
effective time) and instructions, which will contain instructions on how to surrender Ultratech common stock, whether in certificate or book-entry form, in exchange for the
merger consideration.

        On the date of the closing, at or promptly following the effective time (or, in the case of any payments made with respect to dissenting shares, when ascertained), Veeco will
deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the exchange agent, for the benefit of the holders of Ultratech common stock, cash and shares of Veeco common stock in an amount
sufficient to pay the merger consideration.

        After the effective time, when an Ultratech stockholder delivers a properly executed letter of transmittal and any other documents as may reasonably be required by the
exchange agent, the holder of shares of Ultratech common stock will be entitled to receive the merger consideration in the form of (1) the number of whole shares of Veeco
common stock and an amount in cash that such holder is entitled to receive as a result of the merger (after taking into account all of the shares of Ultratech common stock held
immediately prior to the merger by such holder other than excluded shares and dissenting shares) and (2) any cash in lieu of fractional shares and in respect of dividends or other
distributions to which such holder is entitled, in each case less any required withholding taxes.

        No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon cancellation of shares of Ultratech common stock. The shares of Veeco common stock issued and paid and
cash amount paid in accordance with the merger agreement upon conversion of the shares of Ultratech common stock (including any cash paid in lieu of fractional shares) will be
deemed to have been issued and paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Ultratech common stock.

        If any portion of the merger consideration is to be delivered to a person or entity other than the holder in whose name any surrendered certificate or transferred uncertificated
share is registered, it will be a condition of to such payment that (1) either the certificate surrendered must be properly endorsed or must be otherwise in proper form for transfer
or such uncertificated share must be properly transferred and (2) the person or entity requesting such payment pays to the exchange agent any transfer or other similar taxes
required by reason of the payment of the merger consideration to a person or entity other than the registered holder of the certificate or uncertificated share or establishes to the
satisfaction of the exchange agent that such tax has been paid or is not required to be paid.

        The shares of Veeco common stock constituting the equity portion of the merger consideration may be in uncertificated book-entry form, unless a physical certificate is
otherwise required by any applicable law.

Appraisal Rights 

        If a holder of shares of Ultratech common stock does not vote in favor of, nor consent in writing to, the adoption of the merger agreement Merger Proposal, properly
demands appraisal and otherwise complies with applicable Delaware law and does not effectively withdraw his, her or its demand for, or lose the right to, appraisal of such
Ultratech common stock in compliance with Section 262 of the DGCL, such shares will not be converted into the right to receive the merger consideration as described under the
section entitled "—Merger Consideration" beginning on page 100 of this proxy statement/prospectus, but instead, at the effective time, will become entitled only to payment of

value of such shares determined in accordance with applicable Delaware law. However, if any such holder votes in favor of, or consents in writing to, the adoption of the merger
agreement Merger Proposal, fails to properly demand appraisal, fails to comply with applicable Delaware law, or otherwise waives, withdraws or loses the right to payment of the
fair value of such dissenting shares under applicable Delaware law, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such holder's dissenting shares will cease and such
dissenting shares will be deemed to have been converted as of the effective time into, and to have become exchangeable solely for the right to receive, without interest or
duplication, the merger consideration with respect to such shares.

        For additional information about appraisal rights upon completion of the merger, see the section entitled "The Merger—Appraisal Rights" beginning on page 95 of this

Withholding 

        Each of Veeco, Merger Subsidiary, the surviving corporation and the exchange agent will be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable under
the merger agreement the amounts they are required to deduct and withhold under any applicable tax law. If Veeco, Merger Subsidiary, the surviving corporation or the Exchange
Agent withholds and properly pays any such amounts to the appropriate taxing authority, these amounts will be treated for all purposes of the merger agreement as having been
paid to the persons from whom they were withheld.

agreement and the effective time.

        Certain of the representations and warranties made by each of Veeco, Merger Subsidiary and Ultratech are qualified by a "material adverse effect" standard (that is, they will
not be deemed untrue or incorrect unless their failure to be true or correct, individually or in the aggregate, has had or would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse
effect). Certain of the representations and warranties are qualified by a general materiality standard or by a knowledge standard. For the purpose of the merger agreement, a
"material adverse effect" has the meaning set forth below under the section entitled "—Material Adverse Effect".

Material Adverse Effect 

        The merger agreement provides that a "Company Material Adverse Effect" means any fact, change, circumstance, event, occurrence, condition, development or combination
of the foregoing which has a materially adverse effect on the financial condition, business, assets or results of operations of Ultratech and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole. The
merger agreement provides that a "Parent Material Adverse Effect" means (1) any fact, change, circumstance, event, occurrence, condition, development or combination of the
foregoing which has a materially adverse effect on the financial condition, business, assets or results of operations of Veeco and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole or (2) any
change, effect, event or occurrence that prevents or materially impedes, materially interferes with, materially hinders or materially delays (or would reasonably be expected to
prevent or materially impede, materially interfere with, materially hinder or materially delay) (A) the consummation of the merger by Veeco or Merger Subsidiary of the merger
or any of the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement or (B) the material compliance by Veeco or Merger Subsidiary with its obligations under the merger
agreement. When determining whether a fact, change, circumstance, event, occurrence, condition, development or combination thereof, would reasonably be expected to have a
materially adverse effect on the financial condition, business, assets or results of operation of Veeco or Ultratech and their respective subsidiaries, taken as a whole, none of the
following, either alone or in combination, may be taken into account in determining whether there has been or will be either a "Company Material Adverse Effect" or a "Parent
Material Adverse Effect":

• changes after the date of the merger agreement in the financial, securities, credit or other capital markets or general economic or regulatory, legislative or political
conditions; 

• changes after the date of the merger agreement generally affecting the industry in which Ultratech, Veeco and their respective Subsidiaries operate or to the
industries to which either Ultratech and its Subsidiaries or Veeco and its Subsidiaries sell their products, solutions and services, including changes in interest and
exchange rates, in the United States or any other jurisdiction in which such entity operates; 

• changes after the date of the merger agreement as to geopolitical conditions, any outbreak or escalation of hostilities, acts of war (whether or not declared), acts of
armed hostility, sabotage, terrorism or national or international calamity; 

• any hurricane, tornado, tsunami, flood, volcanic eruption, earthquake, nuclear incident, pandemic, quarantine restrictions, weather conditions or other natural or
man-made disaster or other force majeure event; 

• changes in any applicable laws or GAAP; 

• the failure, in and of itself, of Veeco or Ultratech, as applicable, to meet any internal or published projections, forecasts, guidance, estimates or predictions in
respect of revenues,

promptly return or destroy all confidential information concerning Ultratech and its subsidiaries to the extent permitted pursuant to the confidentiality agreement entered with
such third party. In addition, Ultratech agreed that it and its subsidiaries will not release any third party from, or waive, amend or modify any provision of, or grant any
permission under, (x) any standstill provision in any agreement to which Ultratech or any of its subsidiaries is a party or (y) any confidentiality provision in any agreement to
which Ultratech or any of its subsidiaries is a party other than, with respect to clause (x), to the extent the Ultratech board concludes in good faith, after consultation with its
financial advisors and outside legal counsel, the failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to result in a breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable law or to the
extent that any standstill provision in any agreement to which Ultratech or any of its subsidiaries is a party includes a "fallaway" or other similar provision that causes such
standstill provision to be released, waived, modified or amended as a result of Ultratech entering into the merger agreement in and of itself.

        Notwithstanding the restrictions described above, and subject to certain limitations discussed below, if at any time prior to obtaining the approval of Ultratech's stockholders,
Ultratech or any of its representatives receives an unsolicited written, bona fide acquisition proposal from any third party that did not result from any breach of the non-
solicitation covenant and the Ultratech board determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that such acquisition proposal would
reasonably be expected to result in a superior proposal (as defined in the merger agreement and described below), then Ultratech or its representatives may, in accordance with
the terms of the merger agreement:

• engage in negotiations or discussions with such third party and its representatives related to such written acquisition proposal; and 

• furnish to such third party or its representatives non-public information and access relating to Ultratech or any of its subsidiaries pursuant to a confidentiality
agreement that contains provisions that are no less favorable in the aggregate to Ultratech than those contained in the confidentiality agreement that Ultratech
entered into with Veeco (except that such confidentiality agreement may contain a less restrictive or no standstill restriction); provided, that, prior to or
concurrently with the furnishing of such information, Ultratech will make available to Veeco (including by notifying Veeco that such information has been posted
to an electronic data room to which Veeco and its representatives have access) any information relating to Ultratech or its subsidiaries that is made available to
such third party.

Table of Contents

        Ultratech has agreed to promptly, and in no event later than forty-eight hours after receipt of any acquisition proposal, notify Veeco orally and in writing of the receipt of any
acquisition proposal and identify the third party making, and the material terms and conditions of, any such acquisition proposal. Ultratech has agreed to keep Veeco reasonably
informed promptly, and in no event later than forty-eight hours, after any material developments, discussions or negotiations regarding any acquisition proposal and will provide
to Veeco promptly, and in no event later than forty-eight hours, after receipt thereof of copies of all proposed transaction agreements or proposal letters or similar materials (and
any attachments, annexes, exhibits, schedules and other similar materials in connection therewith) sent or provided to Ultratech or any of its subsidiaries that describe any
material terms or conditions of any acquisition proposal.

        For purposes of the merger agreement, "acquisition proposal" means, other than the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, any offer or proposal of any third
party relating to (i) any acquisition or purchase, direct or indirect, of assets (including securities of any subsidiaries of Ultratech) equal to 20% or more of the consolidated assets
of Ultratech and its subsidiaries or to which 20% or more of the consolidated revenues or earnings of Ultratech are attributable or 20% or more of any class of equity or voting
securities of Ultratech or any of its subsidiaries, (ii) any tender offer or exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in such third party beneficially owning 20% or more of
any class of equity or voting securities of Ultratech, or (iii) a merger, consolidation, statutory share exchange, business combination, sale of all or substantially all of the assets,
liquidation, dissolution or other similar extraordinary transaction involving Ultratech, or any of its subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute a 20% or
more of the consolidated assets of Ultratech or to which 20% or more of the consolidated revenues or earnings of Ultratech and its subsidiaries are attributable.

        For purposes of the merger agreement, "superior proposal" means a bona fide, written acquisition proposal for at least a majority of the outstanding shares of Ultratech
common stock or at least a majority of the consolidated assets of Ultratech and its subsidiaries that Ultratech board has determined in good faith, after consultation with its
financial advisor and outside legal counsel, and taking into account all relevant terms and conditions of such acquisition proposal (including the timing and likelihood of
consummation of such proposal, taking into account all legal, regulatory and other aspects of the proposal), would reasonably be likely to be consummated in accordance with its
terms and that, if consummated, would result in a transaction more favorable to Ultratech's stockholders (solely in their capacity as stockholders) from a financial point of view
than the merger (taking into account any written proposal by Ultratech to amend the terms of the merger agreement pursuant to the terms thereof).

Ultratech's Agreement Not to Change the Ultratech Board Recommendation 

        Except as provided in the paragraphs below, under the terms of the merger agreement, the Ultratech board has agreed not to (i) fail to make or withdraw, withhold, qualify or
modify, or resolve to or publicly propose to withdraw, withhold, qualify or modify in a manner adverse to Veeco, the recommendation that the stockholders of Ultratech adopt the
merger agreement (the "recommendation") or (ii) or approve, endorse or recommend, or publicly propose to approve, endorse or recommend, an acquisition proposal (the actions
described in clauses (i) and (ii) above being referred to as a "change of recommendation").

        Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to obtaining the approval of the merger agreement by Ultratech's stockholders, if the Ultratech board determines in good faith, after
consultation with outside legal counsel and in response to an unsolicited, written, bona fide acquisition proposal that did not result from a breach of the obligations described in
the section entitled "—Ultratech's Agreement Not to Solicit Other Offers" beginning on page 111 of this proxy statement/prospectus, that (i) such acquisition proposal constitutes
a superior proposal and (ii) the failure to take such action would be

reasonably likely to result in a breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable law, then the Ultratech board may:

• make a change of recommendation; and/or 

• cause Ultratech to terminate the merger agreement and substantially concurrently with such termination enter into a definitive agreement with respect such
superior proposal;

provided that prior to taking any such action:

• Ultratech promptly notifies Veeco in writing, at least three business days before taking such action, of the determination of the Ultratech board that such
acquisition proposal constitutes a superior proposal and of its intention to take such action, attaching the most current version of the proposed agreement under
which such superior proposal is proposed to be consummated and the identity of the third party making such superior proposal; provided that each time any
material revision or material amendment to the terms of the acquisition proposal determined to be a superior proposal is made (including any change to the
financial or other material terms of the superior proposal), Ultratech must extend the three business day period for an additional two business days after
notification of such material revision or material amendment to Veeco; 

• during the applicable period described in the previous bullet (the "takeover notice period"), the Ultratech board considers in good faith and discusses with Veeco
(if Veeco desires to discuss) any adjustments or modifications to the terms of the merger agreement proposed by Veeco; and 

• at the end of the takeover notice period, the Veeco board makes the determination in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial
advisor, that the acquisition proposal continues to be a superior proposal if any adjustments or modifications to the terms of the merger agreement proposed in
writing by Veeco were to be given effect.

        Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to obtaining the approval of the merger agreement by the Ultratech stockholders, if (1) Ultratech and the Ultratech representatives are
in material compliance with the obligations described in the section entitled "—Ultratech's Agreement Not to Solicit Other Offers" beginning on page 111 of this proxy
statement/prospectus and (2) if the Veeco board determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel and taking into account the discussions with Veeco
outlined below, that the failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to result in a breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable law, the Veeco board may make a
change of recommendation in response to any fact, event, change, development or set of circumstances that materially affects the business, financial condition or results of
operations of Ultratech and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole that (A) does not involve or relate to an acquisition proposal or to Veeco or any of its affiliates or its or their
respective representatives and (B) (i) is not known and was not reasonably discoverable or foreseeable to the Veeco board as of the date of the merger agreement or (ii) the
consequences of which were not reasonably discoverable or foreseeable to the Veeco board as of the date of the merger agreement, if, in either case:

• Ultratech provides Veeco three business days' prior written notice of its intention to take such action, which notice includes reasonable detail with respect to any
such facts, events, changes, developments or set of circumstances underlying such action; 

• during such three business day period described in the above bullet, Ultratech considers in good faith and discusses with Veeco and its representatives (if Veeco
desires to discuss) any adjustments or modifications to the terms of the merger agreement; and 

• at the end of the three business day period described in the first bullet, the Veeco board determines in good faith after consultation with its financial advisors and
outside legal counsel (after taking into account any adjustments or modifications to the terms of the merger agreement proposed in writing by Veeco during the
period described in the first bullet) that the

failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to result in a breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable law.

        Any determination by the Ultratech board following the date of the merger agreement that the merger consideration payable in the merger is not sufficient will not in and of
itself constitute grounds to make a change of recommendation pursuant to the preceding paragraph. In addition, a change in the trading price of Veeco common stock or Ultratech
common stock will not constitute grounds to make a change of recommendation pursuant to the preceding paragraph (though the underlying facts giving rise or contributing to
the change in the trading price of Ultratech common stock may be taken into account).

Reasonable Best Efforts to Consummate the Merger; Regulatory Filings 

        Subject to certain exceptions described below, Veeco and Ultratech have agreed to, and agreed to cause their respective affiliates to, cooperate with each other and use their
respective reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable law to
consummate the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement as promptly as practicable, including (i) obtaining all necessary consents, approvals or
waivers from third parties, (ii) preparing and filing as promptly as practicable after the date of the merger agreement with any governmental authority all documentation to effect
all necessary filings, notices, petitions, statements, registrations, submissions of information, financial statements, records, applications and other documents (in each case, to the
extent applicable), (iii) obtaining and maintaining all approvals, consents, registrations, permits, authorizations, licenses, waivers and other confirmations required to be obtained
from any governmental authority that are necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, (iv) defending or contesting any action, suit or
proceeding challenging the merger agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby, and (v) executing and delivering any additional instruments necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

        Each of Veeco and Ultratech has further agreed to, and to cause their respective affiliates to, cooperate with each other and use their reasonable best efforts to take, or cause
to be taken, all actions and use reasonable best efforts to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under any applicable law to consummate the merger and
the other transactions contemplated by the merger as promptly as practicable, including:

• selling or otherwise disposing of, or holding separate and agreeing to sell or otherwise dispose of, assets, categories of assets or businesses of Ultratech or Veeco
or their respective subsidiaries; 

• terminating existing relationships, contractual rights or obligations of Ultratech or Veeco or their respective subsidiaries; 

• terminating any venture or other arrangement; 

• creating any relationship, contractual rights or obligations of Ultratech or Veeco or their respective subsidiaries; 

• effectuating any other change or restructuring of Ultratech or Veeco or their respective subsidiaries;

and in each case, to enter into agreements or stipulate to the entry of an order or decree or file appropriate applications with the Federal Trade Commission, the Department of
Justice or any attorney general of any state of the United States. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (1) neither Ultratech nor any of its subsidiaries may propose, consent to or take
any of the above actions without Veeco's consent, (2) in no event will Veeco be required to license any of the intellectual property of Veeco, Ultratech or

any of their respective subsidiaries and (3) neither Veeco, Ultratech nor any of their respective affiliates is required to consent to or commit any of the above actions unless:

• the parties are informed by the Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Justice or any attorney general of any state of the United States that such actions are
demanded and required as a condition to providing approval or resolving proceedings under any antitrust law; and 

• such actions, considered individually or in the aggregate with all other actions so demanded and required by a governmental authority, would not be deemed to
have an adverse impact that is material to: 

• the reasonably anticipated benefits to Veeco of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement; 

• the business of Veeco and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole; or 

• the business of Ultratech and its subsidiaries.

        In addition, Veeco and Ultratech agree to not take, and to not permit their respective affiliates to take, any action (including the acquisition by it or its affiliates of any
interest in any person that derives revenues from products, services or lines of business similar to Ultratech's products, services or lines of business) if such action would make it
materially more likely that there would arise any impediments under any antitrust law that may be asserted by any governmental authority to the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement as promptly as practicable.

        In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants described above, Ultratech and Veeco have agreed to:

• as promptly as practicable, and in any event within five business days of the date of the merger agreement, make their respective filings and thereafter make any
other required submissions under the HSR Act and as promptly as practicable, and in any event within fifteen business days of the date of the merger agreement,
make their respective filings required pursuant to foreign antitrust laws in any specified foreign jurisdictions (collectively with the HSR Act, the "antitrust laws"); 

• comply at the earliest practicable date with any request under any of the antitrust laws for additional information, documents, or other materials received by each
of them or any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates from any governmental authority in respect of such filings or such transactions; 

• cooperate with each other in connection with any such filing (including, to the extent permitted by applicable law, providing copies of all such documents to the
non-filing parties prior to filing and considering all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested in connection therewith) and in connection with resolving
any investigation or other inquiry of any governmental authority under any of the antitrust laws with respect to any such filing or any such transaction; 

• use its reasonable best efforts to furnish to each other all information required for any application or other filing to be made pursuant to any applicable law in
connection with the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

Employee Matters 

        The merger agreement provides that Veeco will provide, or will cause the surviving corporation to provide, to each employee of Ultratech and its subsidiaries who continues
to be employed by Veeco or one of its subsidiaries (including, following the closing of the merger, the surviving corporation) ("Ultratech Employees"): (i) for a period of twelve
(12) months following the closing of the merger (or, if earlier, the termination of the applicable Ultratech Employee's employment with Veeco, the

surviving corporation and their affiliates), base salaries or base wage levels at least equal to what the Ultratech Employees were receiving from Ultratech or its subsidiaries
immediately before the closing of the merger, and (ii) for a period from and after the effective time of the merger until December 31, 2017 (or, if earlier, the termination of the
applicable Ultratech Employee's employment with Veeco, the surviving corporation and their affiliates), health and welfare benefits that, taken as a whole, are substantially
comparable in the aggregate to the health and welfare benefits provided by Ultratech or its subsidiaries to the Ultratech Employees immediately prior to the effective time of the
merger (or, if more favorable to the Ultratech Employees, substantially comparable in the aggregate to the health and welfare benefits provided to similarly situated employees of
Veeco and its affiliates).

        Each Ultratech Employee will be given credit for his or her years of service with Ultratech before the effective time of the merger for purposes of determining eligibility to
participate, level of benefits, vesting and benefit accruals; provided, however, that such service need not be recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in any
duplication of benefits or for purposes of benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension plan (whether or not tax-qualified), supplemental retirement plan or similar plan or
arrangement. In addition, from and after the effective time of the merger, Veeco will, or will cause the surviving corporation, to assume, honor and continue until December 31,
2017, or, if sooner, until all obligations thereunder have been satisfied, all of Ultratech's employment, severance, bonus, incentive compensation, commission, change in control,
retention and termination plans and agreements, in each case, as in effect at the effective time of the merger, including with respect to any payments, benefits or rights arising as a
result of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement (either alone or in combination with any other event), without any amendment or modification, other than any
amendment or modification required to comply with applicable law or with the consent of the applicable Ultratech Employee.

        Veeco will use commercially reasonable efforts to waive, or will cause to be waived, all limitations as to preexisting condition limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work
requirements and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements under any Ultratech employee benefit plan in which the continuing employees may be
eligible to participate after the effective time and provide each continuing employee with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid during the plan year in which the
effective time occurs in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under any Ultratech welfare benefit plan in which the continuing employees may be
eligible to participate after the effective time.

        Veeco has also agreed to terminate the Ultratech Retirement Savings Plan (the "Ultratech 401(k) Plan"), effective as of no later than the day immediately preceding the
closing of the merger. However, Veeco may, in its sole and absolute discretion, make an election to sponsor and maintain the Ultratech 401(k) Plan by providing Ultratech with
written notice three business days before the effective time of the merger.

Directors' and Officers' Indemnification and Insurance 

        Veeco has agreed, and has agreed to cause the surviving corporation to agree, that all rights to exculpation and indemnification from liabilities for acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the effective time and rights to advancement of expenses relating thereto now existing in favor of any person who is or has been at any time prior to the
date of the effective time, a present or former director, officer, employee or agent (including as a fiduciary with respect to an employee benefit plan) of Ultratech, any of its
subsidiaries or any of their respective predecessors (each, an "indemnified person") as provided in their respective articles of incorporation or bylaws or other organizational
documents or in any other written agreement between Ultratech and an indemnified person containing any express indemnification provisions, between such indemnified persons
and Ultratech or any of its subsidiaries that will survive the merger. Additionally, for a period of six years from the effective time, Veeco has agreed not to, and has agreed to
cause the surviving corporation not to amend, repeal or

otherwise modify such rights as provided in Ultratech's or any if its subsidiaries' articles of incorporation, bylaws, similar organizational documents or written agreement
containing any express indemnification provisions between such indemnified persons and Ultratech or any of its subsidiaries in effect immediately prior to the effective time in
any manner that would adversely affect any right thereunder of any such indemnified person.

        For six years after the effective time, Veeco has agreed to, and has agreed to cause the surviving corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless all indemnified persons to the
fullest extent permitted by the DGCL and any other applicable law in the event of any threatened or actual claim, suit, action, proceeding or investigation (a "claim"), whether
civil, criminal or administrative, based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to (i) the fact that the indemnified person is or was a director
(including in a capacity as a member of any board committee), officer, employee or agent of Ultratech, any of its subsidiaries or any of their respective predecessors or (ii) the
merger agreement or any of the transactions contemplated thereby, whether in any case asserted or arising before, on or after the effective time, against any losses, claims,
damages, liabilities, costs, expenses (including reasonable attorney's fees and expenses in advance of the final disposition of any claim, suit, proceeding or investigation to each
indemnified person to the fullest extent permitted by law upon receipt of any undertaking required by applicable law), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement of or in
connection with any such threatened or actual claim. Neither Veeco nor the surviving corporation will settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any
threatened or actual claim for which indemnification could be sought by an indemnified person hereunder, unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an
unconditional release of such indemnified person from all liability arising out of such claim or such indemnified person otherwise consents in writing to such settlement,
compromise or consent. Veeco and the surviving corporation agree to cooperate with an indemnified person in the defense of any matter for which such indemnified person could
seek indemnification hereunder.

        Prior to the effective time, Ultratech has agreed to, or if Ultratech is unable to, Veeco will cause the surviving corporation as of the effective time to, obtain and fully pay the
premium for the non-cancellable extension of the directors' and officers' liability coverage of Ultratech's existing directors' and officers' insurance policies and Ultratech's existing
fiduciary liability insurance policies, in each case for a claims reporting or discovery period of at least six years from and after the effective time with respect to any claim related
to any period of time at or prior to the effective time (including claims with respect to the adoption of the merger agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated thereby) with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are no less favorable than the coverage provided under Ultratech's existing policies; provided
that Ultratech will give Veeco a reasonable opportunity to participate in the selection of such "tail" insurance policy and must in good faith consider any comments by Veeco with
respect thereto; and provided that the premium per annum payable for such "tail" insurance policy does not exceed 300% of the amount per annum Ultratech paid in its last full
fiscal year and if the cost for such "tail" insurance policy exceeds such amount, then Ultratech will obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding
such amount.

Litigation Related to the Transaction 

        Prior to the effective time or the termination of the merger agreement, Ultratech has agreed (subject to certain exceptions) not to settle any stockholder litigation against
Ultratech and/or its directors and/or officers relating to the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the merger, without Veeco's prior written consent (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

Stock Exchange Listing and Delisting 

        The merger agreement provides that Ultratech will cooperate with Veeco and use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or cause to be
done all things, reasonably necessary on its part under any applicable law and the rules and policies of Nasdaq to enable the delisting by the surviving corporation of Ultratech's
common stock from Nasdaq and the termination of the registration of Ultratech's common stock under the Exchange Act as promptly as possible after the effective time.
Additionally, the merger agreement provides that prior to the effective time, Veeco will file a notification of listing of additional shares (or such other form as may be required)
with Nasdaq with respect to the shares of Veeco common stock to be issued in the merger, and will cause the shares of Veeco common stock to be issued in the merger to be
reserved for issuance in connection with the merger to be approved for listing on the Nasdaq, subject to official notice of issuance.

Financing 

        Veeco and Merger Subsidiary have represented and warranted that (assuming the accuracy of Ultratech's representations related to available cash of Ultratech in the United
States at closing) they have available, and will have available at or promptly after the effective time, cash or other sources of immediately available funds in an amount, together
with the available cash of Ultratech in the United States at closing, sufficient to enable Veeco to satisfy all of Veeco's and Merger Subsidiary's obligations under the merger
agreement. The closing is not subject to a financing condition.

of each of the following conditions:

• adoption of the merger agreement the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of Ultratech common stock entitled to vote at

comply with its obligations under the merger agreement.

Termination of the Merger Agreement 

Mutual Termination Right

        The merger agreement may be terminated and abandoned at any time prior to the effective time by the mutual written agreement of the Ultratech and Veeco.

Termination Rights Exercisable by Either Ultratech or Veeco

        The merger agreement may also be terminated by either Ultratech or Veeco upon written notice to the other party if:

• the merger has not been consummated on or before the date that is 270 days after the date of the merger agreement (such date, as it may be extended pursuant to
the merger agreement, the "end date"); provided that this termination right will not be available to any party whose breach of any provision of the merger
agreement has been the primary cause of, or primarily resulted in, the failure of the merger to be consummated on by the end date;

section entitles "The Support Agreement" beginning on page 125 of this proxy statement/prospectus by any party thereto other than Veeco.

Termination Rights of Veeco

        Veeco may also terminate the merger agreement upon written notice to Ultratech if:

• prior to obtaining the Ultratech stockholder approval, the Ultratech board has failed to make its recommendation in favor of the merger in the preliminary version
of this proxy statement/prospectus, failed to include its recommendation of the merger in this proxy statement/prospectus at all times after the filing of the
preliminary proxy statement/prospectus, failed to publicly reaffirm its recommendation in favor of the merger in accordance with the merger agreement or
effected a change of its recommendation in favor of the merger, whether or not permitted by the terms of the merger agreement; or 

• Ultratech has breached or failed to perform any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements under the merger agreement, which breach or
failure would result in a failure of certain of the conditions to the consummation of the merger and such breach cannot be cured, or if capable of cure, has not been
cured, by the date that is two business days before the end date; provided that this termination right will not be available to Veeco if Veeco's breach of provision of
the merger agreement would cause certain of the conditions to the merger set forth in the merger agreement not to be satisfied.

Termination Rights of Ultratech

        Ultratech may also terminate the merger agreement upon written notice to Veeco if:

• prior to receipt of the Ultratech stockholder approval if, concurrently with such termination, Ultratech (i) enters into an alternative acquisition agreement that
constitutes a superior proposal in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement and (ii) pays to Veeco a termination fee of $26.5 million; or 

• Ultratech has breached or failed to perform any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements under the merger agreement, which breach or
failure would result in a failure of certain of the conditions to the consummation of the merger and such breach cannot be cured, or if capable of cure, has not been
cured, by the date that is two business days before the end date; provided that this termination right will not be available to Ultratech if Ultratech's breach of
provision of the merger agreement would cause certain of the conditions to the merger set forth in the merger agreement not to be satisfied.

Effect of Termination 

        In the event of a termination as described above under the section entitled "—Termination of the Merger Agreement" beginning on page 121 of this proxy
statement/prospectus, the Merger Agreement will become void and of no effect without liability of any party (or any stockholder, director, officer, employee, agent, consultant or
representative of such party) to the other party to the merger agreement except for certain sections of the merger agreement, including provisions regarding termination, notices,
termination fees and expenses, governing law, consent to jurisdiction, waiver of jury trials and specific performance. In addition, the confidentiality agreement entered into
between Veeco and Ultratech will survive any termination of the merger agreement. Termination of the merger agreement will not relieve or release Ultratech or Veeco from any
liabilities or damages arising out of such party's fraud or willful breach of any provision of the merger agreement.

Termination Fee Payable by Ultratech 

        Ultratech will be required to pay Veeco a termination fee of $26.5 million in cash in the following circumstances:

• in the event the merger agreement is terminated by Veeco prior to obtaining the Ultratech stockholder approval because the Ultratech board has failed to make its
recommendation in favor of the merger in the preliminary version of this proxy statement/prospectus, failed to include its recommendation of the merger in this
proxy statement/prospectus at all times after the filing of the preliminary proxy statement/prospectus, failed to publicly reaffirm its recommendation in favor of
the merger in accordance with the merger agreement or effected a change of its recommendation in favor of the merger, whether or not permitted by the terms of
the merger agreement; 

• in the event the merger agreement is terminated by Ultratech prior to receipt of the Ultratech stockholder approval in order for Ultratech to enter into an
alternative acquisition agreement that constitutes a superior proposal; or 

• if after the date of the merger agreement, (1) any "qualifying transaction" (which is an acquisition proposal, measured at a 50% threshold rather than a 20%
threshold) is publicly made or announced and not withdrawn on or prior to the date that is five business days before the date of the special meeting and
(2) thereafter (a) Ultratech or Veeco terminates the merger agreement because the Ultratech stockholder approval has not been obtained, (b) Veeco terminates the
merger agreement because the merger has not been consummated on or before the end date or (c) Veeco terminates the merger agreement because Ultratech has
breached or failed to perform any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements under the merger agreement, which breach or failure would
result in a failure of certain of the conditions to the consummation of the merger and such breach cannot be cured, or if capable of cure, has not been cured, by the
date that is two business days before the end date, and (3) within twelve months of the termination of the merger agreement, Ultratech consummates a transaction
regarding, or executes a definitive agreement with respect to, an qualifying transaction (whether or not it is the same qualifying transaction originally made or
publicly announced prior to the special meeting).

        In no event will Ultratech be obligated to pay such $26.5 million termination fee on more than one occasion.

Fees and Expenses 

        Other than as described above in connection with the termination fee that may be payable by Ultratech, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with the merger
agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement will be paid by the party incurring those costs or expenses.

Amendments; Waivers 

        At any time prior to the effective time, the parties may amend or waive any provision of the merger agreement if such amendment or waiver is in writing and signed, in the
case of an amendment, by each party to the merger agreement or, in the case of a waiver, by each party against whom the waiver is to be effective, except that after the Ultratech
stockholder approval has been obtained, the merger agreement does not permit any amendment or waiver that by applicable law requires further approval by the stockholders of
Ultratech without such approval having been obtained.

Governing Law and Venue; Waiver of Jury Trial 

        The parties agreed that the merger agreement will be governed by Delaware law, without regard to the conflicts of law rules of the State of Delaware. Each party agreed to
irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and the United States District Court in Wilmington, Delaware for purposes of
any suit, action or other proceeding arising out of the merger agreement, the other agreements contemplated by the merger agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby.

irrevocably waived any right such party may have to a trial by jury with respect to any action, suit or proceeding arising out of or relating to the merger agreement or the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

Specific Performance; Exclusive Remedy 

        The merger agreement provides that the parties have agreed that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy would
occur in the event that the parties hereto do not perform their obligations under the provisions of the merger agreement (including failing to take such actions as are required of
them hereunder to consummate the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement) in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such
provisions. The merger agreement further provides that Ultratech and Veeco are entitled to seek to compel the other party to specifically perform its obligations under the merger
agreement in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.

        The merger agreement also provides that upon the any termination of the merger agreement under circumstances in which the termination fee is payable and such
termination fee is paid in full, Veeco will be precluded from any other remedy against Ultratech, and neither Veeco nor Merger Subsidiary may seek to obtain any other recovery
or damages of any kind in connection with the merger agreement or the merger.

THE SUPPORT AGREEMENT 

        The following is a summary of the material terms and conditions of the Support Agreement. This summary does not purport to be complete and may not contain all of the
information about the Support Agreement that is important to you.

        In connection with the merger, the supporting stockholders entered into the Support Agreement on February 2, 2017 with Veeco, pursuant to which at all times during the
period commencing on the date of the Support Agreement and continuing until the first to occur of (i) the effective time, (ii) the date and time of termination of the merger
agreement, and (iii) the date and time, if any, at which the Ultratech board makes a change in recommendation (such time, the "support period"), each supporting stockholder
agreed to, among other things, at every meeting of the stockholders of Ultratech (and at every adjournment or postponement thereof) called to seek, and in every other
circumstance in which a vote, action, written consent resolution or other approval of the Ultratech stockholders is proposed seeking, the Ultratech stockholder approval, approval
of the merger, adoption of the merger agreement, or approval or any other transaction document related to the merger or any other transaction pursuant to or contemplated by the
merger agreement, and any matter that would reasonable be expected to facilitate the consummation of the merger, (A) if a meeting is held, appear at such meeting or otherwise
cause such supporting stockholder's shares of Ultratech common stock, including any shares acquired by such supporting stockholder after the date of the Support Agreement
(collectively, the "subject shares") to be counted as present at such meeting for purposes of establishing a quorum and (B) vote (or cause to be voted) the subject shares (1) in
favor of granting the Ultratech stockholder approval, approving the merger, adopting the merger agreement, and approving any other transaction document, any other transaction
pursuant to or contemplated by the merger agreement, and any other matter that could reasonably be expected to facilitate the consummation of the merger and (2) against any
acquisition proposal (other than the merger agreement and the merger) and any other matter that would reasonably be expected to impede, interfere with, delay, postpone or
adversely affect the consummation of the merger or any of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

        The supporting stockholders also agreed, from the date of the Support Agreement until the earlier of the expiration of the support period and obtaining the Ultratech
stockholder approval, subject to certain exceptions, not to (i) sell, transfer, exchange, pledge or otherwise dispose of any of the subject shares other than pursuant to the merger,
(ii) enter into any voting arrangement, whether by proxy, power of attorney, voting agreement, voting trust or otherwise, with respect to the subject shares, (iii) enter into any
swap or similar arrangement that transfers the economic consequences of ownership of the subject shares or (iv) make any offer or enter into any agreement providing for any of
the foregoing actions. Further, during the support period, each supporting stockholder has agreed to grant to Veeco (and any designee of Veeco) an irrevocable proxy under the
DGCL under certain circumstances to vote and to exercise all voting and consent rights of such supporting stockholder with respect to, the subject shares owned beneficially or
of record by such supporting stockholder.

        As of the close of business on April 20, 2017, the supporting stockholders owned in the aggregate 929,838 shares of Ultratech common stock (not including any shares of
Ultratech common stock subject to Ultratech stock options or Ultratech RSUs), all of which are subject to the Support Agreement, representing approximately 3.4% of the shares
of Ultratech common stock outstanding as of such date.

        The Support Agreement will terminate on the earlier of (i) the effective time and (ii) the termination of the merger agreement.

        Each supporting stockholder has entered into the Support Agreement solely in such supporting stockholder's capacity as stockholder of Ultratech and not in any other
capacity.

MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES 

        The following is a general discussion of certain U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger to U.S. Holders and Non-U.S. Holders (each as defined below) of
Ultratech common stock who exchange shares of Ultratech common stock for the transaction consideration pursuant to the merger. This discussion is for general information
only and is not tax advice. It does not purport to address all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to particular holders of Ultratech common stock in light
of their particular facts and circumstances. This discussion is based on current provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), the Treasury
regulations promulgated thereunder, judicial interpretations thereof and administrative rulings and published positions of the IRS, each as in effect as of the date hereof, and all of
which are subject to change or differing interpretations, possibly with retroactive effect, and any such change could affect the accuracy of the statements and conclusions set forth
herein.

        This discussion is limited to such holders who hold their Ultratech common stock as a "capital asset" within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property
held for investment), only and does not purport to address or consider all of the U.S. federal income tax consequences that may be relevant or applicable to holders of Ultratech
common stock in light of their particular facts and circumstances. For instance, this discussion does not apply to holders of Ultratech common stock that are subject to special
rules under the U.S. federal income tax laws (including, for example, banks or other financial institutions, dealers in securities or currencies, traders in securities that elect to
apply a mark-to-market method of accounting, insurance companies, tax-exempt entities, entities or arrangements treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes or
other flow-through entities (and investors therein), subchapter S corporations, retirement plans, individual retirement accounts or other tax-deferred accounts, real estate
investment trusts, regulated investment companies, holders liable for the alternative minimum tax, certain former citizens or former long-term residents of the United States, U.S.
holders having a "functional currency" other than the U.S. dollar, holders who hold shares of Ultratech common stock as part of a hedge, straddle, constructive sale, conversion
transaction or other integrated transaction, "controlled foreign corporations," "passive foreign investment companies," holders who exercise dissenters' rights, except to the extent
described below, holders that hold (or that held, directly or constructively, at any time during the five year period ending on the date of the disposition of such holder's Ultratech
common stock pursuant to the merger) 5% or more of the Ultratech common stock, and holders who acquired their shares of Ultratech common stock through the exercise of an
employee stock option or otherwise as compensation or through a tax-qualified retirement plan). This discussion also does not address the tax consequences of the merger for
holders of stock options and other equity-based awards with respect to Ultratech common stock. This discussion does not address any considerations under U.S. federal tax laws
other than those pertaining to the income tax, nor does it address any considerations under any state, local or non-U.S. tax laws or under the unearned income Medicare
contribution tax that may be relevant or applicable to a particular holder in connection with the merger.

        If an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds shares of Ultratech common stock, the tax treatment of a person treated as a
partner in such partnership generally will depend on the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. Persons that for U.S. federal income tax purposes are treated as
a partner in a partnership holding shares of Ultratech common stock should consult their tax advisors regarding the tax consequences of the merger to them.

        For purposes of this discussion, the term "U.S. Holder" means a beneficial owner of shares of Ultratech common stock that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes:

• an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;

• a corporation (or any other entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) created or organized under the laws of the United States, any state
thereof, or the District of Columbia; 

• an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of its source; or 

• a trust (a) if a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the trust's administration and one or more U.S. persons have the authority
to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (b) that has a valid election in effect under applicable Treasury regulations to be treated as a U.S. person for U.S.
federal income tax purposes.

        For purposes of this discussion, the term "Non-U.S. Holder" means a beneficial owner of shares of Ultratech common stock that is neither a U.S. Holder nor a partnership
for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

        THIS DISCUSSION IS INTENDED ONLY AS A GENERAL SUMMARY OF THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES TO A BENEFICIAL OWNER
OF SHARES OF ULTRATECH COMMON STOCK. WE URGE BENEFICIAL OWNERS OF SHARES OF ULTRATECH COMMON STOCK TO CONSULT THEIR TAX
ADVISORS WITH RESPECT TO THE SPECIFIC TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER IN LIGHT OF THEIR PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES, INCLUDING
FEDERAL ESTATE, GIFT AND OTHER NON-INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES, AND TAX CONSEQUENCES UNDER STATE, LOCAL OR FOREIGN TAX LAWS,
INCLUDING POSSIBLE CHANGES IN SUCH LAWS.

U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger to U.S. Holders 

        A U.S. Holder's receipt of shares of Veeco common stock and cash for shares of Ultratech common stock pursuant to the merger will generally be a taxable transaction for
U.S. federal income tax purposes, and a U.S. Holder who receives shares of Veeco common stock and cash in exchange for shares of Ultratech common stock in the merger will
recognize gain or loss equal to the difference, if any, between (a) the sum of (i) the fair market value of the shares of Veeco common stock (determined at the time the merger is
effective) and (ii) the amount of cash received, and (b) the holder's adjusted tax basis in the Ultratech shares exchanged for the right to receive the shares of Veeco common stock
and cash in the merger. A U.S. Holder's adjusted tax basis will generally equal the price the U.S. Holder paid for such shares. Gain or loss will be determined separately for each
block of shares of Ultratech common stock (that is, shares acquired at the same cost in a single transaction). Such gain or loss will be capital gain or loss, and will be long-term
capital gain or loss if the U.S. Holder's holding period for the shares is more than one year at the effective time of the merger. Long-term capital gain recognized by a non-
corporate holder generally is subject to tax at a reduced rate. There are limitations on the deductibility of capital losses.

        A U.S. Holder's holding period in the shares of Veeco common stock received begins the day after the date on which the Merger becomes effective. The U.S. Holder's basis
in the Veeco common stock received will be equal to its fair market value at the time the merger is effective.

        THE FOREGOING SUMMARY DOES NOT DISCUSS ALL ASPECTS OF U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAXATION THAT MAY BE RELEVANT TO PARTICULAR
BENEFICIAL OWNERS OF SHARES OF ULTRATECH COMMON STOCK. BENEFICIAL OWNERS OF SHARES OF ULTRATECH COMMON STOCK ARE URGED
TO CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS AS TO THE PARTICULAR TAX CONSEQUENCES TO THEM OF THE RECEIPT OF VEECO COMMON STOCK AND CASH
FOR THEIR SHARES ULTRATECH COMMON STOCK PURSUANT TO THE MERGER UNDER ANY U.S. FEDERAL, STATE, FOREIGN, LOCAL OR OTHER TAX
LAWS.

U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger to Non-U.S. Holders 

        In general, the merger to Non-U.S. Holders that receive a combination of shares of Veeco common stock and cash in exchange for shares of Ultratech common stock
pursuant to the merger will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax or withholding tax on any gain realized in connection with the merger unless:

• such gain is effectively connected with the Non-U.S. Holder's conduct of a trade or business within the United States (and, if required by an applicable income tax
treaty, is attributable to a permanent establishment of the Non-U.S. Holder in the United States); 

• the Non-U.S. Holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year in which the gain is realized and certain other
conditions are met; or 

• Ultratech was a "United States real property holding corporation" ("USRPHC") within the meaning of Section 897(c)(2) of the Code for U.S. federal income tax
purposes within the five years preceding the merger and the Non-U.S. Holder owned, actually or constructively, more than 5% of the Ultratech common stock at
any time during the five year period preceding the merger. In general, the company would be a USRPHC if interests in U.S. real estate comprised most of its
assets. Although there can be no assurances in this regard, Ultratech does not believe it is, or has been during the five years preceding the merger, a USRPHC for
U.S. federal income tax purposes.

        Gain described in the first bullet point above generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net income basis at the regular graduated U.S. federal income tax rates
in the same manner as if such Non-U.S. Holder were a U.S. person. A Non-U.S. Holder that is a corporation also may be subject to an additional branch profits tax at a rate of
30% (or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable income tax treaty) on its "effectively connected earnings and profits" for the taxable year, subject to certain
adjustments.

        Gain described in the second bullet point above will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a 30% rate (or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable income tax
treaty), but may be offset by U.S. source capital losses, if any, of the Non-U.S. Holder.

        Non-U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the tax consequences to them of the merger.

Information Reporting and Backup Withholding 

        Payments to a U.S. Holder of Ultratech common stock may, under certain circumstances, be subject to information reporting and backup withholding, unless the U.S. Holder
provides proof of an applicable exemption or furnishes its taxpayer identification number and otherwise complies with all applicable requirements of the backup withholding
rules. Certain holders (such as corporations and Non-U.S. Holders) are exempt from backup withholding. Non-U.S. Holders may be required to comply with certification
requirements and identification procedures in order to establish an exemption from information reporting and backup withholding. Any amount paid as backup withholding does
not constitute an additional tax and will be creditable against a holder's U.S. federal income tax liability, provided the required information is given to the IRS in a timely manner.
If backup withholding results in an overpayment of tax, a holder may obtain a refund by filing a U.S. federal income tax return in a timely manner. Holders are urged to consult
their tax advisors as to qualifications for exemption from backup withholding and the procedure for obtaining the exemption.

        THE PRECEDING DISCUSSION IS INTENDED ONLY AS A SUMMARY OF U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER. IT IS
NOT A COMPLETE ANALYSIS OR DISCUSSION OF ALL POTENTIAL TAX EFFECTS THAT MAY BE IMPORTANT TO A PARTICULAR HOLDER. ALL
HOLDERS OF ULTRATECH COMMON STOCK SHOULD CONSULT THEIR OWN TAX ADVISORS AS TO THE SPECIFIC TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE
MERGER TO THEM, INCLUDING TAX REPORTING REQUIREMENTS, AND THE APPLICABILITY AND EFFECT OF ANY FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL
AND NON-U.S. TAX LAWS.

ACCOUNTING TREATMENT 

        Veeco prepares its financial statements in accordance with GAAP. The merger will be accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. Veeco will be treated as the
acquiror for accounting purposes. Veeco will record assets acquired, including identifiable intangible assets, and liabilities assumed from Ultratech at their respective fair values
at the date of completion of the merger. Any excess of the purchase price (as described under Note 1—"Basis of Pro Forma Presentation" under "Unaudited Pro Forma
Condensed Combined Financial Information—Notes to Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information" beginning on page 25) over the net fair value of such
assets and liabilities will be recorded as goodwill.

        The financial condition and results of operations of Veeco after completion of the merger will reflect Ultratech after completion of the merger, but will not be restated
retroactively to reflect the historical financial condition or results of operations of Ultratech. The earnings of Veeco following completion of the merger will reflect acquisition
accounting adjustments, including the effect of changes in the carrying value for assets and liabilities on depreciation expense, amortization expense and interest expense.
Indefinite-lived intangible assets, including certain trademarks, and goodwill will not be amortized but will be tested for impairment at least annually, and all tangible and
intangible assets including goodwill will be tested for impairment when certain indicators are present. If, in the future, Veeco determines that tangible or intangible assets
(including goodwill) are impaired, Veeco would record an impairment charge at that time.

DESCRIPTION OF VEECO CAPITAL STOCK 

        The following summary of Veeco's capital stock and certain provisions of Delaware law are qualified in their entirety by reference to the Veeco charter and the Veeco
bylaws, which are incorporated herein by reference into this proxy statement/prospectus, and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. See "Where You Can Find
More Information" for more information about the documents incorporated by reference into this proxy statement/prospectus.

General 

        Veeco is authorized to issue 120,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of which approximately 40,568,473 shares were outstanding on April 17, 2017.
Veeco's common stock trades on The NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol "VECO."

Voting and Other Rights 

        Holders of Veeco's common stock are entitled to one vote per share on all matters to be voted upon by the stockholders. Holders of Veeco's common stock are not entitled to
cumulate votes for the election of directors. In general, a majority of votes cast on a matter is sufficient to take action upon routine matters; however, the election of directors
requires a plurality of votes cast.

        In the event of Veeco's liquidation, dissolution or winding up, holders of Veeco's common stock will be entitled to share ratably in all assets remaining after payment of
liabilities, subject to prior distribution rights of any preferred stock then outstanding.

        Veeco's common stock does not have any preemptive rights, redemption privileges, sinking fund privileges, or conversion rights and is not subject to further calls or
assessments by Veeco. All the outstanding shares of Veeco's common stock are validly issued, fully paid, and nonassessable.

Anti-Takeover Provisions 

        Provisions of Delaware law, the Veeco charter and Veeco bylaws may have the effect of delaying, deferring or discouraging another party from acquiring control of us.
These provisions include:

• "blank check" preferred stock, 

• a classified board of directors, and 

• certain certificate of incorporation and bylaw provisions.

        The Veeco board has the authority to issue up to 500,000 shares of preferred stock and to fix the rights (including voting rights), preferences and privileges of these shares
("blank check" preferred). Such preferred stock may have rights, including economic rights, senior to Veeco's common stock. As a result, the issuance of the preferred stock
could have a material adverse effect on the price of Veeco's common stock and could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of Veeco's outstanding common
stock.

        The Veeco board is divided into three classes with each class serving a staggered three-year term. The existence of a classified board will make it more difficult for Veeco's
shareholders to change the composition (and therefore the policies) of the Veeco board in a relatively short period of time.

        Veeco has adopted certain certificate of incorporation and bylaw provisions which may have anti-takeover effects. These include: (a) requiring certain actions to be taken at
a meeting of shareholders rather than by written consent, (b) limiting the maximum number of directors, and (c) providing that directors may be removed only for "cause." These
measures and those described above may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a takeover or other change in control of Veeco that a holder of Veeco's common
stock might consider in its best interest.

Table of Contents

        In addition, Veeco is subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, which prohibits a Delaware corporation from
engaging in any business combination, including mergers and asset sales, with an interested stockholder (generally, a 15% or greater stockholder) for a period of three years after
the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner. The operation of
Section 203 may have anti-takeover effects, which could delay, defer or prevent a takeover attempt that a holder of Veeco's common stock might consider in its best interest.

Dividends 

        Veeco has not paid dividends on Veeco's common stock. Veeco intends to retain future earnings for the development of Veeco's business and, therefore, does not anticipate
that the Veeco board will declare or pay any dividends on the common stock in the foreseeable future. The Veeco board will determine future dividend policy, in its sole
discretion, based on Veeco's consolidated results of operations, financial condition, capital requirements and other circumstances.

Transfer Agent 

        American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC acts as the transfer agent and registrar for Veeco's common stock.

COMPARISON OF STOCKHOLDERS' RIGHTS 

        Veeco and Ultratech are both incorporated under Delaware law. Differences, therefore, between the rights of Veeco stockholders and the rights of Ultratech stockholders
result from differences in the companies' respective certificates of incorporation and bylaws. Upon completion of the Merger, the rights of Ultratech stockholders who become
holders of Veeco common stock in the Merger will be governed by Delaware law, the Veeco Charter and the Veeco Bylaws.

        The following is a summary of the material differences between the rights of holders of Veeco common stock and the rights of holders of Ultratech common stock, but does
not purport to be a complete description of those differences, or a complete description of the specific provisions referred to in this summary. The identification of specific
differences is not intended to indicate that other equally significant or more significant differences do not exist. The Veeco Charter, the Veeco Bylaws, the Ultratech Charter and
the Ultratech Bylaws are subject to amendment in accordance with their terms. Copies of these governing corporate instruments as currently in effect are available, without
charge, to any person, including any beneficial owner to whom this proxy statement/prospectus is delivered, by following the instructions listed under "Where You Can Find
More Information" beginning on page 143 of this proxy statement/prospectus.

        Requirements for Stockholder Business or Nominations to Be Brought Before Ultratech's Annual Meetings. Under the bylaws of Ultratech, Ultratech has an advance notice
procedure for stockholders who wish to present certain proposals at one of Ultratech's annual meetings of stockholders, including nominations of persons for election to the
Ultratech board and stockholder proposals not otherwise included in Ultratech proxy statement.

        Stockholder proposals, including the nomination of a person for election to the Ultratech board, may not be brought before an annual meeting unless, among other things:
(1) written notice of such proposal is delivered to the Corporate Secretary of Ultratech at 3050 Zanker Road, San Jose, California 95134 no earlier than March 21, 2017 and no
later than April 20, 2017 (provided, however, that if the 2017 annual meeting of stockholders is held earlier than June 19, 2017 or later than September 27, 2017, proposals must

certain other information set forth in the bylaws of Ultratech, to the Chair of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, Ultratech, Inc., 3050 Zanker Road, San Jose,

HOUSEHOLDING OF PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS 

        The SEC has adopted rules that permit companies and intermediaries such as brokers to satisfy delivery requirements for proxy statements and annual reports with respect to
two or more stockholders sharing the same address by delivering a single proxy statement or annual report, as applicable, addressed to those stockholders. As permitted by the
Exchange Act, only one copy of this proxy statement/prospectus is being delivered to stockholders residing at the same address, unless stockholders of Ultratech have notified
Ultratech of their desire to receive multiple copies of the proxy statement/prospectus. This process, which is commonly referred to as "householding," potentially provides extra
convenience for stockholders and cost savings for companies.

        If, at any time, you no longer wish to participate in householding and would prefer to receive a separate proxy statement/prospectus, or if you are receiving multiple copies
of this proxy statement/prospectus and wish to receive only one, please contact Ultratech at the address identified below. Ultratech will promptly deliver, upon oral or written
request, a separate copy of this proxy statement/prospectus to any shareholder residing at an address to which only one copy was mailed. Requests for additional copies should be
directed to: Attention: Corporate Secretary, Ultratech, Inc., 3050 Zanker Road, San Jose, California 95134.

THE MERGER 

        Section 2.01.    The Merger.    

        (a)   On the terms and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with Delaware Law, Merger Subsidiary shall be
merged with and into the Company in the Merger, whereupon, the separate existence of Merger Subsidiary shall cease and the Company shall be the surviving corporation (the
"Surviving Corporation") and shall continue its corporate existence under the laws of the State of Delaware as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent.

        (b)   Subject to the provisions of Article 9, the closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take place at the offices of O'Melveny & Myers LLP, 2765 Sand Hill Road, Menlo
Park, California 94025 at 6:00 a.m. Menlo Park, California time, as soon as possible, but in any event no later than one Business Day after the date the conditions set forth in
Article 9 (other than conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or, to the extent permissible, waiver of those conditions at the
Closing) have been satisfied or, to the extent permissible, waived by the party or parties entitled to the benefit of such conditions, or at such other place, at such other time or on
such other date as Parent and the Company may mutually agree consistent with Delaware Law (the date on which the Closing occurs, the "Closing Date").

        (c)   At the Closing, the Company and Merger Subsidiary shall file a certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and make all other filings or
recordings required by Delaware Law in connection with the Merger. The Merger shall become effective at such time (the "Effective Time") as the certificate of merger is duly
filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (or at such later time as may be specified in the certificate of merger).

        (d)   From and after the Effective Time, the Merger shall have the effects set forth in Section 259 of the DGCL.

        Section 2.02.    Conversion of Shares.    At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders thereof:

        (a)   except as otherwise provided in Section 2.02(b), Section 2.02(c) or Section 2.04, each share of Company Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be cancelled and converted into the right to receive (x) $21.75 in cash, without interest (the "Cash Consideration") and (y) 0.2675 of a share of Parent Common Stock (the
"Stock Consideration" and, together with the Cash Consideration the "Merger Consideration"). As of the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Stock shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each share shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration to
be paid in accordance with Section 2.03, without interest.

        (b)   each share of Company Stock held by the Company as treasury stock or owned by Parent or Merger Subsidiary immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
canceled, and no payment shall be made with respect thereto;

        (c)   each share of Company Stock held by any Subsidiary of either the Company or Parent (other than Merger Subsidiary) immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into such number of shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Surviving Corporation such that each such Subsidiary owns the same percentage of the
Surviving Corporation immediately following the Effective Time as such Subsidiary owned of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time; and

        (d)   each share of common stock of Merger Subsidiary outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one share of common stock,
par value $0.001 per share, of the Surviving Corporation with the same rights, powers and privileges as the shares so converted and, together with the shares described in
Section 2.02(c), shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

        Section 2.03.    Surrender and Payment.    

        (a)   Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint an agent reasonably acceptable to the Company (the "Exchange Agent") for the purpose of exchanging for the Merger
Consideration (A) certificates representing shares of Company Stock (the "Certificates") or (B) uncertificated shares of Company Stock (the "Uncertificated Shares"). Promptly
after the Effective Time (but in no event later than two Business Days after the Effective Time), Parent shall send, or shall cause the Exchange Agent to send, to each holder of
shares of Company Stock at the Effective Time a letter of transmittal (in a form that was reasonably acceptable to the Company prior to the Effective Time) and instructions
(which shall specify that the delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates or transfer of the Uncertificated Shares to
the Exchange Agent) for use in such exchange.

        (b)   Each holder of shares of Company Stock that have been converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to receive, upon (i) surrender to
the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with a properly completed letter of transmittal, or (ii) receipt of an "agent's message" by the Exchange Agent (or such other
evidence, if any, of transfer as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares, the Merger Consideration in respect of
the Company Stock represented by a Certificate or Uncertificated Share. Until so surrendered or transferred, as the case may be, each such Certificate or Uncertificated Share
shall represent after the Effective Time for all purposes only the right to receive such Merger Consideration. On the Closing Date, at or promptly following the Effective Time or
in the case of payments pursuant to Section 2.04, when ascertained, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders of
Company Stock, cash and shares of Parent Common Stock in an amount sufficient to pay the Merger Consideration (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the "Payment
Fund"). The cash in the Payment Fund shall, pending its disbursement to the holders of Company Stock, be invested by the Exchange Agent as directed by Parent or, after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation in (i) short-term direct obligations of the United States of America, (ii) short-term obligations for which the full faith and credit of the
United States of America is pledged to provide for the payment of principal and interest, (iii) short-term commercial paper rated the highest quality by either Moody's Investors
Service, Inc. or Standard and Poor's Ratings Services, or (iv) certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or banker's acceptances of commercial banks reasonably
acceptable to the Company; provided that no such investment or losses shall affect the amounts payable to such holders of Company Stock and Parent shall promptly replace or
cause to be replaced any funds deposited with the Exchange Agent that are lost through any investment so as to ensure that the Payment Fund is at all times maintained at a level
sufficient for the Exchange Agent to pay the Merger Consideration. Earnings from investments, subject to the immediately preceding

proviso, shall be paid to and shall be the sole and exclusive property of Parent and the Surviving Corporation. Except as contemplated by Section 2.03(e) hereof, the Payment
Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.

        (c)   If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the transferred Uncertificated
Share is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer or such
Uncertificated Share shall be properly transferred and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other Taxes required as a result of
such payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or Uncertificated Share or establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been
paid or is not payable.

        (d)   After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of Company Stock. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Uncertificated Shares
are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration provided for, and in accordance with the
procedures set forth, in this Article 2.

        (e)   Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 2.03(a) that remains unclaimed by the holders of shares of
Company Stock two years after the Effective Time shall be returned to Parent, upon demand, and any such holder who has not exchanged shares of Company Stock for the
Merger Consideration in accordance with this Section 2.03 prior to that time shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of the Merger Consideration, in respect of such
shares without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall not be liable to any holder of shares of Company Stock for any amounts paid to a public official
pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of Company Stock immediately prior to such time
when such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority shall become, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, the property of
Parent free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

        (f)    Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 2.04 in respect of any Appraisal Shares shall be returned to Parent,
upon demand.

        (g)   The shares of Parent Common Stock constituting part of the Merger Consideration shall be in uncertificated book-entry form, unless a physical certificate is otherwise
required under Applicable Law. No interest shall be paid or accrued on the Merger Consideration.

        (h)   No dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
share of Company Stock with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock that such holder would be entitled to receive upon surrender of such share of Company Stock until such
holder shall surrender such share of Company Stock in accordance with this Article 2. After the surrender of any such share of Company Stock in accordance with this Article 2,
such holder thereof entitled to receive shares of Parent Common Stock shall be entitled to receive any such dividends or other distributions, without interest thereon, with a
record date after the Effective Time and which theretofore had become payable with respect to whole shares of Parent Common Stock issuable to such holder in respect of such
share of Company Stock.

        Section 2.04.    Appraisal Shares.    Notwithstanding Section 2.02, shares of Company Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
shares of Company Stock canceled in accordance with Section 2.02(b)) and held by a holder who has not voted in favor of adoption of this Agreement or consented thereto in
writing and who has properly exercised appraisal rights in respect of such shares in accordance with the DGCL (such shares being referred to collectively as the "Appraisal
Shares" until such time as such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses such

holder's appraisal rights under the DGCL with respect to such shares) shall not be converted into a right to receive the Merger Consideration but instead the holders thereof shall
be entitled to payment of the appraised value of such shares in accordance with the DGCL; provided that if, after the Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or
otherwise loses such holder's right to appraisal pursuant to the DGCL, such shares of Company Stock shall be treated as if they had been converted as of the Effective Time into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 2.02(a), without interest thereon, upon surrender of such Certificate formerly representing such share or
transfer of such Uncertificated Share, as the case may be. The Company shall provide Parent prompt written notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of
shares of Company Stock, any withdrawal of any such demand and any other demand, notice or instrument delivered to the Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant to the
DGCL that relates to such demand, and Parent shall have the opportunity and right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands under the
DGCL consistent with the obligations of the Company thereunder. Except with the prior written consent of Parent, the Company shall not voluntarily make any payment with
respect to, or voluntarily offer to settle or settle, any such demands.

        Section 2.05.    Company Equity Awards.    

        (a)   At or immediately prior to the Effective Time, each option to purchase shares of Company Stock outstanding under any Company Stock Plan (a "Company Stock
Option") shall be fully vested and, at the Effective Time, canceled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of
Company Stock subject to such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the excess, if any, of (A) the Equity Award Merger Consideration, over
(B) the exercise price per Share subject to such cancelled Company Stock Option, without interest (such amounts payable hereunder, the "Option Payments"). Any such
Company Stock Option with respect to which the exercise price per Share subject thereto is greater than the Equity Award Merger Consideration shall be cancelled in exchange
for no consideration. Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay the Option Payments to the holder of the applicable Company Stock Option at or reasonably promptly
after the Effective Time (but in no event later than three Business Days after the Effective Time).

        (b)   At or immediately prior to the Effective Time, each award of restricted stock units with respect to shares of Company Stock granted under a Company Stock Plan (each,
a "Company RSU") that is outstanding and vested immediately prior to the Effective Time (including those Company RSUs that become vested by their terms immediately prior
to or as of the Effective Time) (each, a "Company Vested RSU") shall be canceled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to (i) the number of shares of
Company Stock subject to such Company Vested RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (ii) the Equity Award Merger Consideration (such amount, the
"Company Vested RSU Merger Consideration"). Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay the Company Vested RSU Merger Consideration to the holder of the
applicable Company Vested RSU at or reasonably promptly after the Effective Time (but in no event later than three Business Days after the Effective Time).

        (c)   Effective as of the Effective Time, each Company RSU that is not a Company Vested RSU (each, a "Company Unvested RSU") shall be assumed by Parent and
converted into that number of restricted stock units of Parent Common Stock, rounded down to the nearest whole share ("Converted RSUs"), equal to the product of (x) the
number of shares of Company Stock subject to such Company Unvested RSU and (y) the Equity Conversion Ratio. Any Converted RSUs issued pursuant to this Section 2.05(c)
shall otherwise be subject to the same terms and conditions (modified as appropriate to reflect the assumption) as were applicable under such Company Unvested RSU; provided,
that all references to the "Company" in the applicable Company Stock Plans and award agreements will be references to Parent.

        (d)   Prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of the Company (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof administering any Company Stock Plan) shall adopt such
resolutions or take action by written consent in lieu of a meeting, providing for the transactions contemplated by this Section 2.05. The Company shall provide that, following the
Effective Time, no holder of any Company Stock Option or Company RSU shall have the right to acquire any equity interest in the Company or the Surviving Corporation in
respect thereof.

        (e)   As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall deliver to the holder of each Converted RSU appropriate notices setting forth the number of shares of
Parent Common Stock subject to such award then held by each such holder, as adjusted pursuant to this Section 2.05.

        Section 2.06.    Withholding Rights.    Each of the Exchange Agent, Merger Subsidiary, the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
the consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Article 2 such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under any provision of federal, state, local or foreign Tax law. If the Exchange Agent, Merger Subsidiary, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, withholds any
such amounts and properly pays such amounts over to the appropriate Taxing Authority, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to
Person in respect of which such withholding was made.

        Section 2.07.    Lost Certificates.    If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as the Surviving
Corporation may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue, in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of Company Stock represented by such Certificate, as contemplated by this Article 2.

        Section 2.08.    Adjustments.    If, during the period between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of capital stock of the
Company shall occur, including by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend thereon
with a record date during such period, but excluding any change that results from any exercise of options or the vesting of restricted share units outstanding as of the date hereof
to purchase shares of Company Stock granted under the Company's stock option or compensation plans or arrangements, the Merger Consideration and any other amounts
payable pursuant to this Agreement shall be appropriately adjusted. If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Parent Common
Stock shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a different class as a result of a reclassification, recapitalization, stock split or combination, exchange or
readjustment, or stock dividend or other similar change in capitalization, an appropriate and proportionate adjustment shall be made to the Stock Consideration to be delivered
pursuant to Section 2.02.

        Section 2.09.    No Fractional Share.    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, neither certificates nor scrip for a fractional share of Parent Common Stock
shall be issued in the Merger or pursuant to Section 2.05. Each holder of shares of Company Stock who otherwise would have been entitled to a fraction of a share of Parent
Common Stock (after taking into account all shares of Company Stock owned by such holder at the Effective Time to be converted into Parent Common Stock pursuant to this
Article 2) shall be entitled to receive, from the Exchange Agent in accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.09, in lieu of such fractional share, an amount of cash
(rounded to the nearest whole cent), without interest, equal to the product of: (i) such fraction, multiplied by (ii) the Parent Measurement Price. The parties acknowledge that
payment of cash in lieu of issuing certificates or scrip for a fractional share was not separately bargained-for consideration but merely represents a mechanical rounding off for
purposes of avoiding the expense and inconvenience to

Time shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with the applicable provisions of Delaware Law.

currently conducted, except in the case of clause (ii) where failure to have those licenses, authorizations, Permits, consents and approvals, individually and in the aggregate,
would reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company is duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation and (where applicable and
recognized) is in good standing in each jurisdiction where such qualification is necessary, except for those jurisdictions where failure to be so qualified would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

        (o)   agree, authorize or commit to do any of the foregoing;

provided, however, that Parent may not unreasonably withhold, condition or delay its consent to any of the actions described in Sections 6.01(d), 6.01(g), 6.01(h), 6.01(l),
6.01(m) or 6.01(n). Nothing contained in this Agreement shall give the Parent, directly or indirectly, rights to control or direct the Company's operations prior to the Effective
Time. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall exercise, consistent with the terms of this Agreement, complete control and supervision of its and its Subsidiaries'
operations.

        Section 6.02.    Company Stockholder Meeting.    The Company shall cause a meeting of its stockholders (the "Company Stockholder Meeting") to be duly called and held
as soon as reasonably practicable following clearance of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus by the SEC for the purpose of voting on the approval and adoption of this Agreement,
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, the Company may adjourn or postpone the Company
Stockholder Meeting (i) after consultation with Parent, to the extent necessary to ensure that any required supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus is
provided to the Company's stockholders within a reasonable amount of time in advance of the Company Stockholder Meeting, (ii) as otherwise required by Applicable Law or
(iii) if as of the time for which the Company Stockholder Meeting is scheduled as set forth in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, there are insufficient shares of Company Stock
represented (in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Company Stockholder Meeting. Subject to Section 6.03, the Board of
Directors of the Company shall (A) recommend approval and adoption of this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby by the Company's
stockholders, (B) use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval and (C) otherwise comply with all legal requirements applicable to such meeting.

        Section 6.03.    Company Acquisition Proposals.    

        (a)   Subject to Section 6.03(b), Section 6.03(c) Section 6.03(d) and Section 6.03(f), (i) the Company shall not, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries and its and their
respective officers, directors, employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants or other advisors retained by the Company or its Subsidiaries (collectively, "Company
Representatives") not to, directly or indirectly, (A) solicit, initiate or knowingly facilitate or encourage the submission of any Acquisition Proposal, (B) enter into or participate
in any discussions or negotiations with, or furnish any non-public information or access relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to, any Third Party with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry or proposal that could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal or (C) enter into any agreement in principle, letter of intent,
memorandum of understanding, merger agreement, acquisition agreement or other similar agreement relating to an Acquisition Proposal and (ii) except as otherwise provided in

withhold, qualify or modify in a manner adverse to Parent, the Company Board Recommendation, or approve, endorse or recommend or publicly propose to approve, endorse or

(1) actions contemplated by Section 6.03(a) or 6.03(b), (2) the determination by the Board of Directors in accordance with this Section 6.03 that an Acquisition Proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal or (3) the delivery by the Company of the notices to Parent required by this Section 6.03 shall, in and of itself, constitute an Adverse
Recommendation Change). The Company will be liable for any breach of this Section 6.03 by any Company Representatives as if such breach had been committed by the

respect to an Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry or proposal that could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal and promptly after the date hereof terminate
access to any Third Party or its Representatives to any electronic data room maintained by the Company or its Subsidiaries with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and request that any such person promptly return or destroy all confidential information concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries to the extent permitted pursuant
to a confidentiality agreement with such person. The Company and its Subsidiaries shall not release any Third Party from, or waive, amend or modify any provision of, or grant
permission under, (x) any standstill provision in any agreement to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or (y) any confidentiality provision in any agreement to
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party except, with respect to clause (x), (A) to the extent that prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval the
Board of Directors of the Company concludes in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, the failure to take such action would be
reasonably likely to result in a breach of its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law or (B) to the extent that any standstill provision in any agreement to which the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries is a party includes a "fallaway" or other similar provision that causes such standstill provision to be released, waived, modified or amended as a result of
the Company entering into this Agreement in and of itself.

        (b)   Notwithstanding Section 6.03(a), if at any time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company or any of the Company Representatives has
received an unsolicited written, bona fide Acquisition Proposal from any Third Party that did not result from a breach of this Section 6.03 and that the Board of Directors of the
Company determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, would reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal, then the
Company, directly or indirectly through the Company Representatives, may, on the terms provided in this Section 6.03, (i) engage in negotiations or discussions with such Third
Party and its Representatives related to such written Acquisition Proposal, and (ii) furnish to such Third Party or its Representatives non-public information and access relating to
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement; provided, that, prior to or concurrently with the time it is made available to such
Third Party, the Company shall make available to Parent (including by notifying Parent that such information has been posted to an electronic data room to which Parent and its
Representatives have access) any information relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries that is made available to such Third Party.

        (c)   Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at any time prior to receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, if the Company and the Company
Representatives are in material compliance with Section 6.03, and if the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal
counsel and taking into account the discussions with Parent outlined below, that the failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to result in a breach of its fiduciary
duties under Applicable Law, the Board of Directors of the Company may, at any time prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, make an Adverse
Recommendation Change in response to any fact, event, change, development or set of circumstances that materially affects the business, financial condition or results of
operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole that (A) does not involve or relate to an Acquisition Proposal or to Parent or any of its Affiliates or its or their
respective Representatives and (B) (i) is not known and was not reasonably discoverable or foreseeable to the Board of Directors of the Company as of the date hereof or (ii) the
consequences of which were not reasonably discoverable or foreseeable to the Board of Directors of the Company as of the date hereof (an "Intervening Event"); provided that
in each case: (x) the Company provides Parent three (3) Business Days' prior written notice of its intention to take such action, which notice shall include reasonable detail with
respect to any such facts, events, changes, developments or set of circumstances underlying such action; (y) during such three (3) Business Day period described in clause (x), the
Company considers in good faith and discusses with Parent and its Representatives (if Parent desires to discuss) any adjustments or modifications to the terms of this

Agreement; and (z) at the end of the three (3) Business Day period described in clause (x), the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith after consultation
with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel (after taking into account any adjustments or modifications to the terms of this Agreement proposed in writing by Parent
during the period described in clause (x)) that the failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to result in a breach of its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law,
provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, any determination by the Company Board of Directors after the date of this Agreement that the per share Merger Consideration payable
in the Merger is not sufficient shall not in and of itself constitute an Intervening Event and in no event shall such Intervening Event result from a change in the trading price of the
Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock (it being understood that the underlying facts giving rise or contributing to such change in the trading price of Company
Common Stock may be taken into account in determining whether there has been an Intervening Event). The Company shall notify Parent in writing within one (1) Business Day
after any Adverse Recommendation Change.

        (d)   In addition, nothing contained herein shall prevent the Board of Directors of the Company from (i) complying with Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of
Regulation M-A promulgated under the 1934 Act with regard to an Acquisition Proposal; or (ii) making any disclosure to the stockholders of the Company if the Board of
Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to result in a
breach of its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law; provided, that in the case of the foregoing clauses (i) or (ii), any such action taken or statement made that contains an
Adverse Recommendation Change shall be subject to the provisions of this Section 6.03.

        (e)   The Company shall (i) notify Parent orally and in writing promptly (but in no event later than forty-eight (48) hours) after receipt by the Company of any Acquisition
Proposal, which notice shall identify the Third Party making, and the material terms and conditions of, any such Acquisition Proposal and (ii) keep Parent reasonably informed
promptly (but in no event later than forty-eight (48) hours) after any material developments, discussions or negotiations regarding any Acquisition Proposal and shall provide to
Parent promptly (but in no event later than forty-eight (48) hours) after receipt thereof of copies of all proposed transaction agreements or proposal letters or similar materials
(and any attachments, annexes, exhibits, schedules and other similar materials in connection therewith) sent or provided to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that describe
any material terms or conditions of any Acquisition Proposal.

        (f)    Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, at any time prior to receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, if the Board of Directors of
the Company determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel and in response to an unsolicited, written, bona fide Acquisition Proposal that did not result
from a breach of Section 6.03, that (i) such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and (ii) the failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to result in a
breach of its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law, then the Board of Directors of the Company may make an Adverse Recommendation Change or cause the Company to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.01(d)(i) (provided that, substantially concurrently with such termination the Company enters into a definitive agreement with
respect to such Superior Proposal (a "Company Acquisition Agreement")); provided, that, prior to taking any such action the Company has complied in all material respects
with this Section 6.03(f). Further, the Board of Directors of the Company shall not make an Adverse Recommendation Change (or terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 10.01(d)(i)) pursuant to this Section 6.03(f) in response to an Acquisition Proposal, unless (i) the Company promptly notifies Parent in writing, at least three Business
Days before taking such action, of the determination of the Board of Directors of the Company that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and of its intention
to take such action, attaching the most current version of the proposed agreement under which such Superior Proposal is proposed to be consummated and the identity of the
Third Party making such Superior Proposal (it being understood

that each time any material revision or material amendment to the terms of the Acquisition Proposal determined to be a Superior Proposal is made, the initial three (3) Business
Day period shall be extended for an additional two (2) Business Days after notification of such material revision or material amendment in accordance with Section 6.03(e) and
this Section 6.03(f) to Parent) and (ii) the Board of Directors of the Company (A) shall have considered in good faith and discussed with Parent (if Parent desires to discuss) any
adjustments or modifications to this Agreement proposed by Parent and (B) shall have determined in good faith, at the end of the period set forth in clause (i) and after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor, that such Acquisition Proposal would continue to constitute a Superior Proposal if any adjustments or
modifications to the terms of this Agreement proposed in writing by Parent were to be given effect. For the avoidance of doubt, any change to the financial or other material
terms of a Superior Proposal shall require a new notice to Parent and a new two (2) Business Day period and discussions process under this Section 6.03(f).

        (g)   The Board of Directors of the Company shall reaffirm publicly the Company Board Recommendation to the Company's stockholders within ten (10) Business Days of
Parent's written request to do so, made at any time that an Acquisition Proposal has been made to the Company, has been publicly announced and is pending; provided that Parent
shall be entitled to make such a written request for reaffirmation, and the Board of Directors of the Company shall only be required to make such reaffirmation, on only one
occasion with respect to any one Acquisition Proposal (with each material revision or material amendment to the price or terms of such Acquisition Proposal triggering one
additional Parent right to request reaffirmation).

        (h)   As used in this Agreement:

        (i)    "Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement" means a confidentiality agreement that contains provisions that are no less favorable in the aggregate to the
Company than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement; provided that such confidentiality agreement may contain a less restrictive or no standstill restriction, in
which case the Confidentiality Agreement shall be deemed to be amended to contain only such less restrictive provision, or to omit such provision, as applicable.

         (ii)  "Superior Proposal" means a bona fide, written Acquisition Proposal for at least a majority of the outstanding shares of Company Stock or at least a majority
of the consolidated assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries and that the Board of Directors of the Company has determined in good faith, after consultation with its
financial advisor and outside legal counsel, and taking into account all relevant terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal (including the timing and likelihood of
consummation of such proposal, taking into account all legal, regulatory and other aspects of the proposal), would be reasonably likely to be consummated in accordance
with its terms and that, if consummated, would result in a transaction more favorable to the Company's stockholders (solely in their capacity as such) from a financial
point of view than the Merger (taking into account any irrevocable written proposal by Parent to amend the terms of this Agreement pursuant to Section 6.03(f)).

        Section 6.04.    Access to Information.    From the date hereof until the Effective Time and subject to Applicable Law and the Confidentiality Agreement, the Company shall
during normal business hours (a) give to Parent, its counsel, financial advisors, auditors and other authorized Representatives reasonable access during normal business hours to
the offices, properties, books and records of such party and (b) instruct its employees, counsel, financial advisors, auditors and other authorized Representatives to reasonably
cooperate with Parent in such access; provided, however, that Parent will not be permitted to conduct any environmental sampling or analysis without the Company's prior
written consent. Any access pursuant to this Section 6.04 shall be conducted under supervision of appropriate personnel of the Company and in such manner as not to
unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the business of the Company.

Subsidiaries of Parent);

        (e)   make any change in any financial accounting principles, methods or practices, in each case except for any such change required by GAAP or Applicable Law, including

        Section 7.04.    Indemnification and Insurance.    Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation, and the Surviving Corporation hereby agrees, as follows:

        (a)   All rights to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, and rights to advancement of expenses
relating thereto now existing in favor of any Person who is or prior to the Effective Time becomes, or has been at any time prior to the date of this Agreement, a present or former
director, officer, employee or agent (including as a fiduciary with respect to an employee benefit plan) of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
predecessors (each, an "Indemnified Person") as provided in the Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company, the Amended and Restated Bylaws of the Company, the
organizational documents of any Subsidiary of the Company or any indemnification agreement, or other written agreement between the Company and an Indemnified Person
containing any express indemnification provisions, between such Indemnified Person and the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall survive the Merger and, for a period of six
(6) years, shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect any right thereunder of any such Indemnified Person.

        (b)   For six years after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation (jointly and severally) shall indemnify and hold harmless all Indemnified Persons to the
fullest extent permitted by Delaware Law and any other Applicable Law in the event of any threatened or actual claim, suit, action, proceeding or investigation (a "Claim"),
whether civil, criminal or administrative, based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to (i) the fact that the Indemnified Person is or was a
director (including in a capacity as a member of any board committee), officer, employee or agent of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective predecessors
or (ii) this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, whether in any case asserted or arising before, on or after the Effective Time, against any losses, claims,
damages, liabilities, costs, expenses (including reasonable attorney's fees and expenses in advance of the final disposition of any claim, suit, proceeding or investigation to each
Indemnified Person to the fullest extent permitted by Law upon receipt of any undertaking required by Applicable Law), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement of or in
connection with any such threatened or actual Claim. Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any
threatened or actual Claim for which indemnification could be sought by an Indemnified Person hereunder, unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an

unconditional release of such Indemnified Person from all liability arising out of such Claim or such Indemnified Person otherwise consents in writing to such settlement,
compromise or consent. Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall cooperate with an Indemnified Person in the defense of any matter for which such Indemnified Person could
seek indemnification hereunder.

        (c)   Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall, or if the Company is unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective Time to, obtain and
fully pay the premium for the non-cancellable extension of the directors' and officers' liability coverage of the Company's existing directors' and officers' insurance policies and
the Company's existing fiduciary liability insurance policies, in each case for a claims reporting or discovery period of at least six years from and after the Effective Time with
respect to any claim related to any period of time at or prior to the Effective Time (including claims with respect to the adoption of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby) with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are no less favorable than the coverage provided under the Company's existing
policies; provided that the Company shall give Parent a reasonable opportunity to participate in the selection of such "tail" insurance policy and the Company shall give good
faith consideration to any comments made by Parent with respect thereto; and provided that the premium per annum payable for such "tail" insurance policy shall not exceed
300% of the amount per annum the Company paid in its last full fiscal year (such maximum amount, the "Maximum Tail Premium") and if the cost for such "tail" insurance
policy exceeds the Maximum Tail Premium, then the Company shall obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding the Maximum Tail Premium.

        (d)   If Parent or the Surviving Corporation (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys of all or substantially all of its property and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made
so that the applicable successor, assign or transferee shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 7.04 (including this Section 7.04(d)).

        (e)   The rights of each Indemnified Person under this Section 7.04 shall be in addition to any rights such Person may have under the certificate of incorporation and bylaws
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, under Delaware Law or any other Applicable Law, under any agreement of any Indemnified Person with the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or otherwise. These rights shall survive consummation of the Merger and are intended to benefit, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Person. The
obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this Section 7.04 shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect the rights of any
Indemnified Person without the consent of such Indemnified Person.

        (f)    Parent shall pay all reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnified Person in enforcing the indemnity and other
obligations provided in this Section 7.04.

        Section 7.05.    Employee Matters.    

        (a)   With respect to employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries immediately before the Effective Time who continue in employment with Parent or one of its Subsidiaries
(including, following the Closing, the Surviving Corporation) ("Company Employees"), Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to (i) for a period of twelve
(12) months following the Closing (or, if earlier, the termination of the applicable Company Employee's employment with Parent, the Surviving Corporation and their Affiliates),
provide base salaries or base wage levels at least equal to what the Company Employees were receiving from the Company or its Subsidiaries immediately before the Closing,
and (ii) for a period from and after the Effective Time until December 31, 2017 (or, if earlier, the termination of the applicable Company Employee's employment with Parent, the
Surviving Corporation and their Affiliates), provide health and welfare benefits that, taken as a whole, are substantially comparable in the aggregate to the health and welfare
benefits provided by the Company or its

Table of Contents

Subsidiaries to the Company Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time (or, if more favorable to the Company Employee, substantially comparable in the aggregate to
the health and welfare benefits provided to similarly situated employees of Parent and its Affiliates).

        (b)   Without limiting the generality of Section 7.05(a), from and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, assume, honor and
continue until December 31, 2017, or, if sooner, until all obligations thereunder have been satisfied, all of the Company's employment, severance, bonus, incentive compensation,
commission, change in control, retention and termination plans and agreements, in each case, as in effect at the Effective Time, including with respect to any payments, benefits
or rights arising as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (either alone or in combination with any other event), without any amendment or modification,
other than any amendment or modification required to comply with Applicable Law or with the consent of the applicable Company Employee.

        (c)   With respect to any employee benefit plan maintained by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates with respect to any Company Employee (including
any vacation, paid time-off and severance plans), for purposes of determining eligibility to participate, level of benefits, vesting and benefit accruals, such Company Employee's
service with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time (as well as service with any predecessor employer of the Company or any such Subsidiary, to the
extent service with the predecessor employer is recognized by the Company or such Subsidiary under the comparable Company Employee Plans) shall be treated as service with
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or their Affiliates to the extent such service was recognized under the corresponding Company Employee Plan in which such Company
Employee participated prior to the Closing; provided, however, that such service need not be recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in any duplication of
benefits or for purposes of benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension plan (whether or not tax-qualified), supplemental retirement plan or similar plan or arrangement.

        (d)   Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to waive, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or any of its Affiliates to waive, any pre-existing condition
limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting periods under any welfare benefit plan maintained by the Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
Affiliates in which any Company Employee (or the dependents of any eligible employee) will be eligible to participate from and after the Effective Time. Parent shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to recognize, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or any of its Affiliates to recognize, the dollar amount of all payments incurred by each
Company Employee (and his or her eligible dependents) under any applicable Company Employee Plan during the calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs for purposes
of satisfying such year's deductible, co-payment limitations and out-of-pocket maximums under the relevant welfare benefit plans in which such Company Employee will be
eligible to participate from and after the Effective Time.

        (e)   The Company shall take (or cause to be taken) all actions necessary and appropriate to terminate: (a) all Company Employee Plans that contain a cash or deferred
arrangement intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code (the "401(k) Plans"), with such termination of the 401(k) Plans to be effective no later than the day
immediately preceding the Closing Date; (b) all Company Employee Plans set forth on Schedule 7.05(d); provided, however, that Parent may, in its sole and absolute discretion,
make an election to sponsor and maintain any 401(k) Plan by providing the Company with written notice of such election at least three Business Days before the Effective Time.
With respect to each Company Employee Plan to be terminated as described in this Section 7.05(e), the Company shall deliver to Parent, no later than the day immediately
preceding the Closing Date, evidence that the Company's board of directors has validly adopted resolutions to terminate such Company Employee Plan (the form and substance
of which shall be subject to review and approval of Parent). If the distributions of assets from the trust of a 401(k) Plan that is terminated are reasonably

anticipated to trigger liquidation charges, surrender charges or other fees to be imposed upon the account of any participant or beneficiary of such terminated plan or upon the
Company or plan sponsor, then the Company shall take such actions as are necessary to reasonably estimate the amount of such charges and fees and provide such estimate in
writing to Parent at least three Business Days prior to the Effective Time.

        (f)    Nothing in this Section 7.05 shall, or shall be construed so as to, (i) create any right in any Person, including any employees, former employees, any participant in any
Company Employee Plan or any dependent or beneficiary thereof, (ii) create any right to continued employment or other service with Parent, Company, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their Affiliates, (iii) modify or amend the provisions of a Company Employee Plan or require Parent or any of its Affiliates to adopt or maintain, or restrict
Parent or any of its Affiliates from terminating, employee benefit plan or arrangement of Parent or any of its Affiliates, (iv) prevent or restrict in any way the right of Parent to
terminate, reassign, promote or demote any employee or other service provider of the Company or any Subsidiary thereof at any time following the Closing, or to change any
terms and conditions of the employment or other service of such service providers at any time following the Closing, or (v) create any third party rights in any such current or
former service provider of the Company or any Subsidiary thereof (or any beneficiary or dependent thereof). For purposes of clarity, however, nothing in this section is intended
to adversely affect any independent contractual right of a Company Employee without his/her consent thereto.

        Section 7.06.    No Impeding Actions.    Each of Parent and Merger Subsidiary agrees that, from the date hereof to the Effective Time, it shall not, and it shall cause its
Subsidiaries not to: (a) take any action that is intended to or would reasonably be likely to result in any of the conditions to consummating the Merger becoming incapable of
being satisfied or (b) take any action or fail to take any action which would, or would be reasonably likely to, individually or in the aggregate, prevent, materially delay or
materially impede the ability of Parent or Merger Subsidiary to consummate the Merger or the other transactions contemplated under this Agreement.

        Section 7.07.    Filing of Form S-8.    Parent agrees to file no later than ten (10) Business Days after the Effective Time a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any
successor form) with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable with respect to Converted RSUs and shall use all reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of
such registration statement or registration statements (and maintain the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so long as the Converted RSUs
assumed or granted in accordance with this Agreement remain outstanding. Parent shall at times ensure that there will remain a sufficient number of unissued shares of Parent
Common Stock to meet its share issuance obligations in connection with the Company Unvested RSUs. Parent shall also use its reasonable best efforts to take any action required
to be taken by it under any applicable state securities laws in connection with the conversion of the Company Unvested RSUs into Converted RSUs, and the Company shall
furnish to Parent any information concerning the Company and holders of the Company RSUs as may be reasonably requested by Parent in connection with any such action.
Parent shall take all action necessary to cause the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issuable upon the vesting of the Company Unvested RSUs, to be approved for listing on
Nasdaq at or prior to the Effective Time.

advisable under Applicable Law to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practicable, including (i) obtaining all
necessary consents, approvals or waivers from Third Parties, (ii) preparing and filing as promptly as practicable after the date hereof with any Governmental Authority all
documentation to effect all necessary filings, notices, petitions, statements, registrations, submissions of information, financial statements, records, applications and other

of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act as promptly as practicable (and in any event within 5 Business Days after the date hereof), (ii) each other appropriate
filing required pursuant to any Foreign Antitrust Law (collectively with the HSR Act, the "Antitrust Laws") as promptly as practicable (and in any event within 15 Business
Days after the date hereof), (iii) comply at the earliest practicable date with any request under any of the Antitrust Laws for additional information, documents, or other materials
received by each of them or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates from any Governmental Authority in respect of such filings or such transactions and (iv) cooperate
with each other in connection with any such filing (including, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, providing copies of all such documents to the non-filing parties prior to
filing and considering all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested in connection therewith), and in connection with resolving any investigation or other inquiry of
any Governmental Authority under any of the Antitrust Laws with respect to any such filing or any such transaction. Each such party shall use its reasonable best efforts to
furnish to each other all information required for any application or other filing to be made pursuant to any Applicable Law in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. Each such party shall as promptly as practicable inform the other parties hereto of any oral communication with, and provide copies of written communications
with, any Governmental Authority regarding any such filings or any such transaction. No party hereto shall independently participate in any formal meeting with any
Governmental Authority in respect of any such filings, investigation, or other inquiry without giving the other parties hereto prior notice of the meeting and, to the extent
permitted by such Governmental Authority, the opportunity to attend and/or participate. Subject to Applicable Law, the parties hereto will consult and cooperate with one another
in connection with any analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any party hereto
relating to proceedings under any of the Antitrust Laws. Any party may, as it deems advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any competitively sensitive material provided
to the other parties under this Section 8.01 as "outside counsel only". Such materials and the information contained therein shall be given only to the outside legal counsel of the
recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to employees, officers, or directors of the recipient, unless express written permission is obtained in advance from the
source of the materials. The parties shall take reasonable efforts to share information protected from disclosure under the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine, joint
defense privilege or any other privilege pursuant to this section so as to preserve any applicable privilege.

categories of assets or businesses of the Company or Parent or their respective Subsidiaries; (ii) terminating existing relationships, contractual rights or obligations of the
Company or Parent or their respective Subsidiaries; (iii) terminating any venture or other arrangement; (iv) creating any relationship, contractual rights or obligations of the
Company or Parent or their respective Subsidiaries or (v) effectuating any other change or restructuring of the Company or Parent or their respective Subsidiaries (and, in each
case, to enter into agreements or stipulate to the entry of an order or decree or file appropriate applications with the Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Justice, or any
attorney general of any state of the United States in connection with any of the foregoing) (each a "Divestiture Action"). In the event Parent agrees to effect a Divestiture Action,
the Company and its Subsidiaries shall, upon request by Parent, consent and/or agree as needed in order to effectuate a Divestiture Action to the extent such action relates to the
Company or its Subsidiaries or its or their businesses or assets. Further Parent and the Company shall not take, and shall not permit their respective Affiliates to take any action
(including the acquisition by it or its Affiliates of any interest in any Person that derives revenues from products, services or lines of business similar to the Company's products,
services or lines of business) if such action would make it materially more likely that there would arise any impediments under any Antitrust Law that may be asserted by any
Governmental Authority to the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable. In the event that any action is threatened or instituted
challenging the Merger as violative of any Antitrust Law, Parent shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, defend and contest or otherwise resolve the action (with the Company's
cooperation). In the event that any permanent or preliminary injunction or other order is entered or becomes reasonably foreseeable to be entered in any proceeding that would
make consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby in accordance with the terms of this Agreement unlawful or that would restrain, enjoin or otherwise prevent or
materially delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to vacate, modify or suspend such injunction
or order so as to permit such consummation prior to the End Date. The Company shall cooperate with Parent and shall use its reasonable best efforts to assist Parent in resisting
and reducing any Divestiture Action. Parent shall, in a manner consistent with the terms and the objective of this Agreement, control and lead all actions, strategy and
communications, and make all determinations as to the appropriate course of action and the timing of all actions and communications, with respect to Antitrust Laws,
Governmental Authorities and all other related matters, including dealings with Governmental Authorities and any Divestiture Actions or litigation under Antitrust Laws;
provided, however, that Parent shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law and Governmental Authority, (i) without causing undue delay or
materially impeding Parent's ability to satisfy its obligations in this Section 8.01(c), consult with the Company in advance of any meeting, teleconference or other communication
with such Governmental Authority and provide the Company with an opportunity to attend or participate in such meeting, teleconference or other communication, (ii) afford the
Company an opportunity to review any written advocacy materials to be submitted to such Governmental Authority in advance of the submission thereof, and (iii) furnish the
Company with copies of all written materials received by or on behalf of such party from such Governmental Authority, in each case to the extent permitted by Applicable Law.
The Company shall not, without Parent's prior written consent or request, communicate, offer, negotiate, or agree or bind itself or Parent, with any Governmental Authority or
other third party regarding any Divestiture Action. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, however, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall
propose, consent to, or take any Divestiture Action without prior written consent of Parent, and neither Parent, nor the Company, nor any of their respective Affiliates shall be
obligated to consent or commit to any Divestiture Action unless (A) the parties are informed by the Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Justice, or any attorney general
of any state of the United States that such actions are demanded and required as a condition to providing approval or resolving proceedings under any Antitrust Law and (B) such
actions, considered individually or in the aggregate, would not result in a Detriment. For the purposes of this Section 8.01(c), an action so demanded and required by a
Governmental Authority would be deemed

to result in a "Detriment" if such action, considered individually or in the aggregate with all other actions so demanded and required by a Governmental Authority would have an
adverse impact that is material to (a) the reasonably anticipated benefits to Parent of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (b) the business of the Parent and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (c) the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries, provided, further that in no event shall Parent be required to license any of the Intellectual
Property of Parent, the Company or any of their Subsidiaries.

        Section 8.02.    Form S-4; Proxy Statement/Prospectus.    

        (a)   As promptly as practicable after the execution of this Agreement, (i) Parent shall prepare and cause to be filed with the SEC, the Form S-4 with respect to the shares of
Parent Common Stock issuable in the Merger and (ii) Parent and the Company shall cooperate in preparing and cause to be filed with the SEC the Proxy Statement/Prospectus.
Each of Parent and the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to (A) have the Form S-4 declared effective under the 1933 Act as promptly as practicable after such filing and
(B) to keep the Form S-4 effective as long as is necessary to consummate the Merger and other transactions contemplated hereby. Each of Parent and the Company shall furnish
all information concerning itself, its Affiliates and the holders of its shares to the other and provide such other assistance as may be reasonably requested by the other in
connection with any such action and the preparation, filing and distribution of the Form S-4 and the Proxy Statement/Prospectus. Each of the Company and Parent shall promptly
notify the other upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC or any request from the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Form S-4 or Proxy Statement/Prospectus,
and shall, as promptly as practicable after receipt thereof, provide the other with copies of all correspondence between it and its Representatives, on one hand, and the SEC, on
the other hand, and all written comments with respect to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Form S-4 received from the SEC and advise the other party on any oral comments
with respect to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Form S-4 received from the SEC. Each of the Company and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to respond as
promptly as practicable to any comments from the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus. Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as
practicable to any comment from the SEC with respect to the Form S-4. Prior to filing the Form S-4 (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or mailing the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto, each of the Company and Parent shall
cooperate and provide the other a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such documents or response in advance (including the proposed final version of such
document or response). If required by Applicable Law, the Company shall disseminate to its stockholders, as promptly as reasonably practicable, any amendment of or
supplement to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus required as a result of such comments.

        (b)   If, at any time prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, any information relating to the Company or Parent, or any of their respective Affiliates,
should be discovered by the Company or Parent which, in the reasonable judgment of the Company or Parent, should be set forth in an amendment of, or a supplement to, any of
the Form S-4 or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, so that any of such documents would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party which discovers such information shall promptly notify the
other parties, and the Company and Parent shall cooperate in the prompt filing with the SEC of any necessary amendment of, or supplement to, the Proxy Statement/Prospectus
or the Form S-4 and, to the extent required by Law, in disseminating the information contained in such amendment or supplement to stockholders of the Company.

        (c)   The Company shall take, in accordance with applicable Law and the Company Organizational Documents, all action necessary to mail the Proxy Statement/Prospectus
to the Company's stockholders as promptly as reasonably practicable after the Form S-4 is declared effective by the SEC and to convene the Company Stockholder Meeting as
promptly as reasonably practicable after the date of

Change has occurred in accordance with Section 6.03, the Company shall, through the Company Board of Directors, make the Company Board Recommendation, include such
Company Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and solicit and use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval, and shall not
submit any other proposal to such holders in connection with the Company Stockholder Meeting without the prior written consent of Parent.

        Section 8.03.    Public Announcements.    Subject to Section 6.03, and unless and until an Adverse Recommendation Change has occurred, Parent and the Company shall
consult with each other before issuing any press release, having any communication with the press (whether or not for attribution), making any other public statement or
scheduling any press conference or conference call with investors or analysts with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and, except in respect of any
such press release, communication, other public statement, press conference or conference call as may be required by Applicable Law or any listing agreement with or rule of any
national securities exchange or association, shall not issue any such press release, have any such communication, make any such other public statement or schedule any such
press conference or conference call prior to such consultation.

or proceeding against it arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby which is instituted in any such court. The parties agree that a final
trial court judgment in any such suit, action or other proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner
provided by Applicable Law; provided, however, that nothing in the foregoing shall restrict any party's rights to seek any post-judgment relief regarding, or any appeal from, such
final trial court judgment. Each of the parties hereto agrees that service of process, summons, notice or document by registered mail addressed to it at the addresses set forth in
Section 11.01 shall be effective service of process for any suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court. The parties agree that service of process may also be effected by

        Section 11.11.    Entire Agreement; No Other Representations and Warranties.    

        (a)   This Agreement, including the Company Disclosure Letter, together with the Confidentiality Agreement, constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with
respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both oral and written, between the parties with respect to the subject
matter of this Agreement.

        (b)   Except for the representations and warranties contained in Article 4, each of Parent and Merger Subsidiary acknowledges that neither the Company nor any Person on

        Section 11.12.    Severability.    If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other Governmental Authority
to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way
be affected, impaired or invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any
party. Upon such a determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

failing to take such actions as are required of them hereunder to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement) in accordance with its
specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. The parties acknowledge and agree that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, specific performance or
other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in the courts described in Section 11.08 without proof of
damages or otherwise, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled under this Agreement at law or in equity, and the right of specific enforcement is an
integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and without that right, neither the Company nor Parent would have entered into this Agreement. Each of the
parties hereto agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief on the basis that the other parties hereto have an adequate
remedy at law or an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or in equity. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that any party
seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in accordance with this
Section 11.13 shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such order or injunction. If, prior to the End Date, any party brings any suit,

ANNEX B

February 1, 2017

The Board of Directors
Ultratech, Inc.
3050 Zanker Road
San Jose, CA 95134

Members of the Board of Directors:

        We understand that Ultratech, Inc. ("Ultratech") proposes to enter into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Agreement"), among Ultratech, Veeco Instruments Inc.
("Veeco") and Ulysses Acquisition Subsidiary Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of Veeco ("Merger Sub"), pursuant to which, among other things, Merger Sub will merge with
and into Ultratech (the "Merger") and each outstanding share of the common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Ultratech ("Ultratech Common Stock"), other than Appraisal
Shares (as defined in the Agreement) and shares held by Veeco and Merger Sub, will be converted into the right to receive (i) $21.75 in cash (the "Cash Consideration") and
(ii) 0.2675 of a share (such number of shares, the "Stock Consideration" and, together with the Cash Consideration, the "Consideration") of the common stock, par value $0.01
per share, of Veeco ("Veeco Common Stock"). The terms and conditions of the Merger are more fully set forth in the Agreement.

        You have requested our opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Ultratech Common Stock (other than Veeco, Merger Sub and holders of
Appraisal Shares) of the Consideration to be received by such holders in the Merger.

        In connection with this opinion, we have, among other things:

(i) reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information relating to Ultratech and Veeco; 

(ii) reviewed certain internal financial and operating information with respect to the business, operations and prospects of Ultratech furnished to or discussed with us
by the management of Ultratech, including certain financial forecasts relating to Ultratech prepared by the management of Ultratech (such forecasts, "Ultratech
Forecasts"); 

(iii) reviewed certain internal financial and operating information with respect to the business, operations and prospects of Veeco furnished to or discussed with us by
the management of Veeco, including certain financial forecasts relating to Veeco prepared by the management of Veeco (such forecasts, "Veeco Forecasts"); 

(iv) discussed the past and current business, operations, financial condition and prospects of Ultratech with members of senior management of Ultratech, and
discussed the past and current business, operations, financial condition and prospects of Veeco with members of senior managements of Ultratech and Veeco;

(v) reviewed the potential pro forma financial impact of the Merger on the future financial performance of Veeco, including the potential effect on Veeco's estimated
earnings per share; 

(vi) reviewed the trading histories for Ultratech Common Stock and Veeco Common Stock and a comparison of such trading histories with each other and with the
trading histories of other companies we deemed relevant; 

(vii) compared certain financial and stock market information of Ultratech and Veeco with similar information of other companies we deemed relevant; 

(viii) compared certain financial terms of the Merger to financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of other transactions we deemed relevant; 

(ix) considered the results of our efforts on behalf of Ultratech to solicit, at the direction of Ultratech, indications of interest and definitive proposals from third parties
with respect to a possible acquisition of Ultratech; 

(x) reviewed a draft, dated January 31, 2017, of the Agreement (the "Draft Agreement"); and 

(xi) performed such other analyses and studies and considered such other information and factors as we deemed appropriate.

        In arriving at our opinion, we have assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the accuracy and completeness of the financial and other information and
data publicly available or provided to or otherwise reviewed by or discussed with us and have relied upon the assurances of the managements of Ultratech and Veeco that they are
not aware of any facts or circumstances that would make such information or data inaccurate or misleading in any material respect. With respect to the Ultratech Forecasts, we
have been advised by Ultratech, and have assumed, that they have been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and good faith judgments of
the management of Ultratech as to the future financial performance of Ultratech. With respect to the Veeco Forecasts, we have been advised by Veeco that they have been
reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and good faith judgments of the management of Veeco as to the future financial performance of
Veeco and other matters covered thereby. As you are aware, we have not been provided with, and we did not have access to, financial forecasts relating to Veeco or estimates of
cost savings anticipated to result from the Merger, in each case, prepared by, or approved for our use by, the management of Ultratech. Accordingly, we have not performed any
financial analysis on Veeco on a standalone basis or pro forma for the consummation of the Merger, except that we have utilized Wall Street research analyst estimates to perform
an illustrative analysis of Veeco pro forma for the consummation of the Merger. We have not made or been provided with any independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets or
liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of Ultratech or Veeco, nor have we made any physical inspection of the properties or assets of Ultratech or Veeco. We have not evaluated the
solvency or fair value of Ultratech or Veeco under any state, federal or other laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. We have assumed, at the direction of
Ultratech, that the Merger will be consummated in accordance with its terms, without waiver, modification or amendment of any material term, condition or agreement and that,
in the course of obtaining the necessary governmental, regulatory and other approvals, consents, releases and waivers for the Merger, no delay, limitation, restriction or condition,
including any divestiture requirements or amendments or modifications, will be imposed that would have an adverse effect on Ultratech, Veeco or the contemplated benefits of
the Merger. We also have assumed, at the direction of Ultratech, that the final executed Agreement will not differ in any material respect from the Draft Agreement reviewed by
us.

        We express no view or opinion as to any terms or other aspects or implications of the Merger (other than the Consideration to the extent expressly specified herein),
including, without limitation, the form or structure of the Consideration or the Merger or any terms, aspects or implications of any other agreement, arrangement or understanding

Merger, or class of such persons, relative to the Consideration or otherwise. Furthermore, no opinion or view is expressed as to the relative merits of the Merger in comparison to
other strategies or transactions that might be available to Ultratech or in which Ultratech might engage or as to the underlying business decision of Ultratech to proceed with or
effect the Merger. In addition, we are not expressing any view or opinion with respect to, and have relied, at the direction of Ultratech, upon the assessments of representatives of
Ultratech regarding, legal, regulatory, accounting, tax and similar matters relating to Ultratech, Veeco and the Merger (including the contemplated benefits of the Merger) as to
which we understand that Ultratech obtained such advice as it deemed necessary from qualified professionals. We are also not expressing any opinion as to what the value of
Veeco Common Stock actually will be when issued or the prices at which Ultratech Common Stock or Veeco Common Stock will trade at any time, including following
announcement or consummation of the Merger. In addition, we express no opinion or recommendation as to how any stockholder should vote or act in connection with the
Merger or any related matter.

        We have acted as financial advisor to Ultratech in connection with the Merger and will receive a fee for our services, a portion of which is payable upon the delivery of this

certain liabilities arising out of our engagement.

affiliates.

        We and our affiliates in the past have provided, currently are providing, and in the future may provide, investment banking, commercial banking and other financial services
to Ultratech and certain of its affiliates and have received or in the future may receive compensation for the rendering of these services, including (i) having acted or acting as a

ANNEX C

SECTION 262 OF THE DELAWARE GENERAL CORPORATION LAW

        (a)   Any stockholder of a corporation of this State who holds shares of stock on the date of the making of a demand pursuant to subsection (d) of this section with respect to
such shares, who continuously holds such shares through the effective date of the merger or consolidation, who has otherwise complied with subsection (d) of this section and
who has neither voted in favor of the merger or consolidation nor consented thereto in writing pursuant to § 228 of this title shall be entitled to an appraisal by the Court of
Chancery of the fair value of the stockholder's shares of stock under the circumstances described in subsections (b) and (c) of this section. As used in this section, the word
"stockholder" means a holder of record of stock in a corporation; the words "stock" and "share" mean and include what is ordinarily meant by those words; and the words
"depository receipt" mean a receipt or other instrument issued by a depository representing an interest in 1 or more shares, or fractions thereof, solely of stock of a corporation,
which stock is deposited with the depository.

        (b)   Appraisal rights shall be available for the shares of any class or series of stock of a constituent corporation in a merger or consolidation to be effected pursuant to § 251
(other than a merger effected pursuant to § 251(g) of this title and, subject to paragraph (b)(3) of this section, § 251(h) of this title), § 252, § 254, § 255, § 256, § 257, § 258,
§ 263 or § 264 of this title:

        (1)   Provided, however, that, except as expressly provided in § 363(b) of this title, no appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the shares of any class
or series of stock, which stock, or depository receipts in respect thereof, at the record date fixed to determine the stockholders entitled to receive notice of the meeting of
stockholders to act upon the agreement of merger or consolidation, were either: (i) listed on a national securities exchange or (ii) held of record by more than 2,000
holders; and further provided that no appraisal rights shall be available for any shares of stock of the constituent corporation surviving a merger if the merger did not
require for its approval the vote of the stockholders of the surviving corporation as provided in § 251(f) of this title.

        (2)   Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1) of this section, appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the shares of any class or series of stock of a
constituent corporation if the holders thereof are required by the terms of an agreement of merger or consolidation pursuant to §§ 251, 252, 254, 255, 256, 257, 258, 263
and 264 of this title to accept for such stock anything except:

        a.     Shares of stock of the corporation surviving or resulting from such merger or consolidation, or depository receipts in respect thereof;

        b.     Shares of stock of any other corporation, or depository receipts in respect thereof, which shares of stock (or depository receipts in respect thereof) or
depository receipts at the effective date of the merger or consolidation will be either listed on a national securities exchange or held of record by more than 2,000
holders;

        c.     Cash in lieu of fractional shares or fractional depository receipts described in the foregoing paragraphs (b)(2)a. and b. of this section; or

        d.     Any combination of the shares of stock, depository receipts and cash in lieu of fractional shares or fractional depository receipts described in the
foregoing paragraphs (b)(2)a., b. and c. of this section.

        (3)   In the event all of the stock of a subsidiary Delaware corporation party to a merger effected under § 251(h), § 253 or § 267 of this title is not owned by the
parent immediately prior to the merger, appraisal rights shall be available for the shares of the subsidiary Delaware corporation.

        (4)   In the event of an amendment to a corporation's certificate of incorporation contemplated by § 363(a) of this title, appraisal rights shall be available as
contemplated by § 363(b) of this title, and the procedures of this section, including those set forth in subsections (d) and (e) of this section, shall apply as nearly as
practicable, with the word "amendment" substituted for the words "merger or consolidation," and the word "corporation" substituted for the words "constituent
corporation" and/or "surviving or resulting corporation."

        (c)   Any corporation may provide in its certificate of incorporation that appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the shares of any class or series of its stock
as a result of an amendment to its certificate of incorporation, any merger or consolidation in which the corporation is a constituent corporation or the sale of all or substantially
all of the assets of the corporation. If the certificate of incorporation contains such a provision, the provisions of this section, including those set forth in subsections (d), (e), and
(g) of this section, shall apply as nearly as is practicable.

        (d)   Appraisal rights shall be perfected as follows:

        (1)   If a proposed merger or consolidation for which appraisal rights are provided under this section is to be submitted for approval at a meeting of stockholders, the
corporation, not less than 20 days prior to the meeting, shall notify each of its stockholders who was such on the record date for notice of such meeting (or such members
who received notice in accordance with § 255(c) of this title) with respect to shares for which appraisal rights are available pursuant to subsection (b) or (c) of this section
that appraisal rights are available for any or all of the shares of the constituent corporations, and shall include in such notice a copy of this section and, if 1 of the
constituent corporations is a nonstock corporation, a copy of § 114 of this title. Each stockholder electing to demand the appraisal of such stockholder's shares shall
deliver to the corporation, before the taking of the vote on the merger or consolidation, a written demand for appraisal of such stockholder's shares. Such demand will be
sufficient if it reasonably informs the corporation of the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to demand the appraisal of such stockholder's
shares. A proxy or vote against the merger or consolidation shall not constitute such a demand. A stockholder electing to take such action must do so by a separate written
demand as herein provided. Within 10 days after the effective date of such merger or consolidation, the surviving or resulting corporation shall notify each stockholder of
each constituent corporation who has complied with this subsection and has not voted in favor of or consented to the merger or consolidation of the date that the merger
or consolidation has become effective; or

        (2)   If the merger or consolidation was approved pursuant to § 228, § 251(h), § 253, or § 267 of this title, then either a constituent corporation before the effective
date of the merger or consolidation or the surviving or resulting corporation within 10 days thereafter shall notify each of the holders of any class or series of stock of
such constituent corporation who are entitled to appraisal rights of the approval of the merger or consolidation and that appraisal rights are available for any or all shares
of such class or series of stock of such constituent corporation, and shall include in such notice a copy of this section and, if 1 of the constituent corporations is a nonstock
corporation, a copy of § 114 of this title. Such notice may, and, if given on or after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, shall, also notify such stockholders of
the effective date of the merger or consolidation. Any stockholder entitled to appraisal rights may, within 20 days after the date of mailing of such notice or, in the case of
a merger approved pursuant to § 251(h) of this title, within the later of the consummation of the offer contemplated by § 251(h) of this title and 20 days after the date of
mailing of such notice, demand in writing from the surviving or resulting corporation the appraisal of such holder's shares. Such demand will be sufficient if it reasonably
informs the corporation of the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to demand the appraisal of such holder's shares. If such notice did not
notify stockholders of the effective date of the merger or consolidation, either (i) each such

constituent corporation shall send a second notice before the effective date of the merger or consolidation notifying each of the holders of any class or series of stock of
such constituent corporation that are entitled to appraisal rights of the effective date of the merger or consolidation or (ii) the surviving or resulting corporation shall send
such a second notice to all such holders on or within 10 days after such effective date; provided, however, that if such second notice is sent more than 20 days following
the sending of the first notice or, in the case of a merger approved pursuant to § 251(h) of this title, later than the later of the consummation of the offer contemplated by
§ 251(h) of this title and 20 days following the sending of the first notice, such second notice need only be sent to each stockholder who is entitled to appraisal rights and
who has demanded appraisal of such holder's shares in accordance with this subsection. An affidavit of the secretary or assistant secretary or of the transfer agent of the
corporation that is required to give either notice that such notice has been given shall, in the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein. For
purposes of determining the stockholders entitled to receive either notice, each constituent corporation may fix, in advance, a record date that shall be not more than
10 days prior to the date the notice is given, provided, that if the notice is given on or after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, the record date shall be such
effective date. If no record date is fixed and the notice is given prior to the effective date, the record date shall be the close of business on the day next preceding the day
on which the notice is given.

        (e)   Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, the surviving or resulting corporation or any stockholder who has complied with subsections (a)
and (d) of this section hereof and who is otherwise entitled to appraisal rights, may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Court of Chancery demanding a
determination of the value of the stock of all such stockholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation,
any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party shall have the right to withdraw such stockholder's demand for
appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the merger or consolidation. Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, any stockholder who has
complied with the requirements of subsections (a) and (d) of this section hereof, upon written request, shall be entitled to receive from the corporation surviving the merger or
resulting from the consolidation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the merger or consolidation and with respect to which demands for
appraisal have been received and the aggregate number of holders of such shares. Such written statement shall be mailed to the stockholder within 10 days after such
stockholder's written request for such a statement is received by the surviving or resulting corporation or within 10 days after expiration of the period for delivery of demands for
appraisal under subsection (d) of this section hereof, whichever is later. Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, a person who is the beneficial owner of shares of such
stock held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person may, in such person's own name, file a petition or request from the corporation the statement
described in this subsection.

        (f)    Upon the filing of any such petition by a stockholder, service of a copy thereof shall be made upon the surviving or resulting corporation, which shall within 20 days
after such service file in the office of the Register in Chancery in which the petition was filed a duly verified list containing the names and addresses of all stockholders who have
demanded payment for their shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares have not been reached by the surviving or resulting corporation. If the petition shall
be filed by the surviving or resulting corporation, the petition shall be accompanied by such a duly verified list. The Register in Chancery, if so ordered by the Court, shall give
notice of the time and place fixed for the hearing of such petition by registered or certified mail to the surviving or resulting corporation and to the stockholders shown on the list
at the addresses therein stated. Such notice shall also be given by 1 or more publications at least 1 week before the day of the hearing, in a newspaper of general circulation
published in the City of Wilmington, Delaware or such

publication as the Court deems advisable. The forms of the notices by mail and by publication shall be approved by the Court, and the costs thereof shall be borne by the
surviving or resulting corporation.

        (g)   At the hearing on such petition, the Court shall determine the stockholders who have complied with this section and who have become entitled to appraisal rights. The
Court may require the stockholders who have demanded an appraisal for their shares and who hold stock represented by certificates to submit their certificates of stock to the
Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings; and if any stockholder fails to comply with such direction, the Court may dismiss the
proceedings as to such stockholder. If immediately before the merger or consolidation the shares of the class or series of stock of the constituent corporation as to which appraisal
rights are available were listed on a national securities exchange, the Court shall dismiss the proceedings as to all holders of such shares who are otherwise entitled to appraisal
rights unless (1) the total number of shares entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of the class or series eligible for appraisal, (2) the value of the consideration
provided in the merger or consolidation for such total number of shares exceeds $1 million, or (3) the merger was approved pursuant to § 253 or § 267 of this title.

        (h)   After the Court determines the stockholders entitled to an appraisal, the appraisal proceeding shall be conducted in accordance with the rules of the Court of Chancery,
including any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings. Through such proceeding the Court shall determine the fair value of the shares exclusive of any element of
value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger or consolidation, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. In
determining such fair value, the Court shall take into account all relevant factors. Unless the Court in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, and except as
provided in this subsection, interest from the effective date of the merger through the date of payment of the judgment shall be compounded quarterly and shall accrue at 5% over
the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the effective date of the merger and the date of payment of
the judgment. At any time before the entry of judgment in the proceedings, the surviving corporation may pay to each stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in
which case interest shall accrue thereafter as provided herein only upon the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair value of the shares as
determined by the Court, and (2) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time. Upon application by the surviving or resulting corporation or by any stockholder entitled to
participate in the appraisal proceeding, the Court may, in its discretion, proceed to trial upon the appraisal prior to the final determination of the stockholders entitled to an
appraisal. Any stockholder whose name appears on the list filed by the surviving or resulting corporation pursuant to subsection (f) of this section and who has submitted such
stockholder's certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery, if such is required, may participate fully in all proceedings until it is finally determined that such stockholder is not
entitled to appraisal rights under this section.

        (i)    The Court shall direct the payment of the fair value of the shares, together with interest, if any, by the surviving or resulting corporation to the stockholders entitled
thereto. Payment shall be so made to each such stockholder, in the case of holders of uncertificated stock forthwith, and the case of holders of shares represented by certificates
upon the surrender to the corporation of the certificates representing such stock. The Court's decree may be enforced as other decrees in the Court of Chancery may be enforced,
whether such surviving or resulting corporation be a corporation of this State or of any state.

        (j)    The costs of the proceeding may be determined by the Court and taxed upon the parties as the Court deems equitable in the circumstances. Upon application of a
stockholder, the Court may order all or a portion of the expenses incurred by any stockholder in connection with the appraisal proceeding, including, without limitation,
reasonable attorney's fees and the fees and expenses of experts, to be charged pro rata against the value of all the shares entitled to an appraisal.

        (k)   From and after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, no stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights as provided in subsection (d) of this section shall be
entitled to vote such stock for any purpose or to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on the stock (except dividends or other distributions payable to stockholders
of record at a date which is prior to the effective date of the merger or consolidation); provided, however, that if no petition for an appraisal shall be filed within the time provided
in subsection (e) of this section, or if such stockholder shall deliver to the surviving or resulting corporation a written withdrawal of such stockholder's demand for an appraisal
and an acceptance of the merger or consolidation, either within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation as provided in subsection (e) of this section or
thereafter with the written approval of the corporation, then the right of such stockholder to an appraisal shall cease. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no appraisal proceeding in
the Court of Chancery shall be dismissed as to any stockholder without the approval of the Court, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Court deems
just; provided, however that this provision shall not affect the right of any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named
party to withdraw such stockholder's demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the merger or consolidation within 60 days after the effective date of the merger
or consolidation, as set forth in subsection (e) of this section.

        (l)    The shares of the surviving or resulting corporation to which the shares of such objecting stockholders would have been converted had they assented to the merger or
consolidation shall have the status of authorized and unissued shares of the surviving or resulting corporation.
