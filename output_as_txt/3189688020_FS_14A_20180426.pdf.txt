MERGER PROPOSED—YOUR VOTE IS VERY IMPORTANT
 
Dear Stockholder:   April 26, 2018

The board of directors of Fairmount Santrol Holdings Inc. (the “Fairmount Board”) cordially invites you to attend a special meeting of Fairmount Santrol Holdings
Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Fairmount Santrol”), stockholders to be held at Jones Day located at 901 Lakeside Avenue, Cleveland, Ohio 44114 on May 25, 2018, at
1:30 p.m., Eastern Time (such meeting, including any adjournment or postponement thereof, the “special meeting”). As previously announced, on December 11, 2017,
Fairmount Santrol entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, by and among SCR-Sibelco NV, a privately-owned Belgian company (“Sibelco”), Unimin
Corporation, a Delaware corporation (“Unimin”), Bison Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and direct wholly owned subsidiary of Unimin (“Merger Sub”), and
Bison Merger Sub I, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and direct wholly owned subsidiary of Unimin (as it may be amended from time to time, the “Merger
Agreement”), providing for, among other things, the merger (the “Merger”) of Merger Sub into Fairmount Santrol with Fairmount Santrol continuing as the surviving
corporation and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Unimin.

At the special meeting, you will be asked to consider and vote on:
 
 (i) a proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement (the “Fairmount Santrol Merger proposal”);
 

 

(ii) a non-binding, advisory proposal to approve the compensation that may become payable to Fairmount Santrol’s named executive officers in connection with
the closing of the Merger, which compensation is summarized in the table in the section entitled “Advisory Vote on Merger-Related Compensation for
Fairmount Santrol’s Named Executive Officers” beginning on page 367 of the accompanying proxy statement/prospectus (the “Fairmount Santrol
compensation proposal”); and

 

 (iii) a proposal to adjourn the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, including to solicit additional proxies, if there are not sufficient votes to approve the
Fairmount Santrol Merger proposal (the “Fairmount Santrol adjournment proposal”).

The Fairmount Board has determined that entering into the Merger Agreement and consummating the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement, including the Merger, are advisable, fair to and in the best interests of, Fairmount Santrol and Fairmount Santrol stockholders and recommends
that Fairmount Santrol stockholders vote (1) “FOR” the Fairmount Santrol Merger proposal, (2) “FOR” the Fairmount Santrol compensation proposal and (3)
“FOR” the Fairmount Santrol adjournment proposal.

Upon the closing of the Merger, Unimin will become the parent holding company for the combined group (referred to herein as the “combined company”) and will
operate under a new name that will be selected by Unimin and Fairmount Santrol prior to the closing of the Merger. Each Fairmount Santrol stockholder will be entitled
to receive (i) the number of shares of combined company common stock that will result in Fairmount Santrol stockholders, together with the holders of certain Fairmount
Santrol equity awards, owning approximately 35% of the combined company common stock, (ii) an amount in cash equal to the result of (x) $170,000,000, divided by
(y) the fully diluted Fairmount Santrol share number, without interest (which is estimated to result in cash consideration of approximately $0.74 per fully diluted share of
Fairmount Santrol common stock), and (iii) cash paid in lieu of fractional shares, if any, without interest. The total number of shares of Unimin common stock that we
estimate will be issued to Fairmount Santrol stockholders in connection with the Merger is 48,275,651 (which includes 44,990,934 shares to be issued to existing
Fairmount Santrol stockholders and 3,284,717 shares to be reserved for issuance to holders of certain Fairmount Santrol equity awards), based on the number of
Fairmount Santrol shares outstanding on April 2, 2018, with each Fairmount Santrol stockholder entitled to one whole share of Unimin common stock for every five
whole shares of Fairmount Santrol common stock owned at the effective time. At the time of the special meeting, you will not know or be able to determine the value
of the combined company stock you would receive upon the closing of the Merger for reasons further described in this proxy statement/prospectus. Immediately
following the effective time of the Merger (the “effective time”), Sibelco will own, directly or indirectly, approximately 65% of the shares of combined company
common stock and Fairmount Santrol stockholders, including holders of certain Fairmount Santrol equity awards, immediately prior to the effective time will own the
remaining approximately 35% of the outstanding shares. Each outstanding Fairmount Santrol Stock Option, Fairmount Santrol RSU and Fairmount Santrol PSU will
automatically convert into stock options and RSUs with respect to combined company common stock,
on the same terms and conditions under the applicable plans and award agreements in effect immediately prior to the

effective time after giving effect to the Exchange Ratio (as defined below under “The Merger Agreement—Effects of the Merger; Merger Consideration”) and
appropriate adjustments to reflect the closing of the Merger. Following the closing of the Merger, the combined company expects to become a publicly-traded company
with its common stock listed on the New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”) under a trading symbol to be mutually selected by Unimin and Fairmount Santrol. Unimin
and Fairmount Santrol are unable to determine with reasonable certainty the anticipated time period between the special meeting and the effective time due to their
inability to reasonably anticipate when foreign regulatory approval will be obtained.

As described in this proxy statement/prospectus, certain Fairmount Santrol stockholders who in the aggregate own approximately 26% of the outstanding shares of
Fairmount Santrol common stock entered into a voting and support agreement with Unimin and Merger Sub, dated December 11, 2017, whereby such stockholders
agreed to vote in favor of the Fairmount Santrol Merger proposal and against actions that could adversely affect the closing of the Merger.

Your vote is very important, regardless of the number of shares you own. The Merger cannot be completed unless stockholders holding at least a majority
of the shares of Fairmount Santrol common stock outstanding as of the close of business on April 20, 2018, the record date for the special meeting, vote in favor
of the Fairmount Santrol Merger proposal. A failure to vote or an abstention will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Fairmount Santrol Merger
proposal.

Whether or not you plan to attend the special meeting, I urge you to vote your shares before the special meeting over the Internet or via the toll-free telephone
number, as described in the accompanying materials. You may also vote by mail by completing, signing and dating the enclosed proxy card and returning it in the
pre-addressed, postage-prepaid envelope accompanying the proxy card. YOUR PROXY IS BEING SOLICITED BY THE FAIRMOUNT BOARD. AFTER
CAREFUL CONSIDERATION, THE FAIRMOUNT BOARD HAS (I) APPROVED THE MERGER AGREEMENT, (II) DETERMINED THAT ENTERING
INTO THE MERGER AGREEMENT AND CONSUMMATING THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THE MERGER AGREEMENT,
INCLUDING THE MERGER, ARE ADVISABLE, FAIR TO AND IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF FAIRMOUNT SANTROL AND FAIRMOUNT
SANTROL STOCKHOLDERS AND AUTHORIZED AND APPROVED THE EXECUTION, DELIVERY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE MERGER
AGREEMENT AND (III) DIRECTED THAT THE MERGER AGREEMENT BE SUBMITTED FOR CONSIDERATION BY FAIRMOUNT SANTROL
STOCKHOLDERS. THE FAIRMOUNT BOARD RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE (1) “FOR” THE FAIRMOUNT SANTROL MERGER PROPOSAL,
(2) “FOR” THE FAIRMOUNT SANTROL COMPENSATION PROPOSAL AND (3) “FOR” THE FAIRMOUNT SANTROL ADJOURNMENT PROPOSAL.
In considering the recommendation of the Fairmount Board, you should be aware that certain directors and executive officers of Fairmount Santrol may have interests in
the Merger that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of Fairmount Santrol stockholders generally. See the section entitled “Interests of Fairmount Santrol’s
Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger” beginning on page 171 of the accompanying proxy statement/prospectus.

I urge you to read carefully and in its entirety the accompanying proxy statement/prospectus, including the annexes and the documents incorporated by
reference. In particular, I urge you to read carefully the section entitled “Risk Factors” beginning on page 46 of the accompanying proxy statement/prospectus.
If you have any questions regarding the accompanying proxy statement/prospectus, you may call Georgeson LLC, Fairmount Santrol’s proxy solicitor, toll-free

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS

The following are some questions that you, as a stockholder of Fairmount Santrol, may have regarding the Merger and the other matters being
considered at the special meeting, as well as the answers to those questions. Fairmount Santrol urges you to read carefully the section entitled
“Summary” beginning on page 16 of this proxy statement/prospectus and the remainder of this proxy statement/prospectus because the information in
this section does not provide all the information that might be important to you with respect to the Merger and the other matters being considered at the
special meeting. Additional important information is also contained in the annexes to and the documents incorporated by reference into this proxy
statement/prospectus.

You may obtain the information incorporated by reference into this proxy statement/prospectus without charge by following the instructions under
the section entitled “Where You Can Find Additional Information” beginning on page 372 of this proxy statement/prospectus.

About the Merger

Q: Why am I receiving this proxy statement/prospectus and proxy card?

A: Fairmount Santrol has agreed to combine with Unimin under the terms of the Merger Agreement, as further described in this proxy
statement/prospectus. If the Merger Agreement is approved by Fairmount Santrol stockholders and the other conditions to closing under the Merger
Agreement are satisfied or waived, Bison Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Unimin (“Merger Sub”),
will be merged with and into Fairmount Santrol, with Fairmount Santrol continuing as the surviving corporation (the “Merger”), followed immediately
by the merger of Fairmount Santrol with and into Bison Merger Sub I, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a direct wholly owned subsidiary
of Unimin (“Merger Sub LLC”), with Merger Sub LLC continuing as the surviving entity and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Unimin (the “Second
Merger” and, together with the Merger, the “Mergers”).

Fairmount Santrol is holding the special meeting to ask its stockholders to consider and vote upon (i) a proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement
(the “Fairmount Santrol Merger proposal”), (ii) a non-binding, advisory proposal to approve the compensation that may become payable to Fairmount
Santrol’s named executive officers in connection with the closing of the Merger, which compensation is summarized in the table below in the section
entitled “Advisory Vote on Merger-Related Compensation for Fairmount Santrol’s Named Executive Officers” beginning on page 367 of this proxy
statement/prospectus (the “Fairmount Santrol compensation proposal”), and (iii) a proposal to adjourn the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate,
including to solicit additional proxies, if there are not sufficient votes to approve the Fairmount Santrol Merger proposal (the “Fairmount Santrol
adjournment proposal”).

This proxy statement/prospectus contains important information about the Merger, the Merger Agreement, a copy of which is attached as Annex A
to this proxy statement/prospectus, the special meeting and the proposals to be voted on at the special meeting. Fairmount Santrol stockholders should
read this information carefully and in its entirety. The enclosed voting materials allow stockholders to vote their shares without attending the special
meeting in person.

Q: What is the proposed merger on which I am being asked to vote?

A: Fairmount Santrol and Unimin have agreed to the strategic combination of Fairmount Santrol and Unimin under the terms of the Merger
Agreement that is described in this proxy statement/prospectus. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will be
merged with and into Fairmount Santrol, with Fairmount Santrol continuing as the surviving corporation, followed immediately by the merger of
Fairmount Santrol with and into Merger Sub LLC, with Merger Sub LLC continuing as the surviving entity and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of
Unimin. As a result of the Merger, each issued and outstanding share of Fairmount Santrol common stock will be converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration, consisting of the Stock Consideration, the Cash Consideration (each as defined in the Merger Agreement) and cash paid in lieu of
fractional shares, if any, without interest.

Upon the closing of the Merger, Unimin will be the parent holding company for the combined group (referred to herein as the “combined
company”) and will operate under a new name that will be selected by

Unimin and Fairmount Santrol prior to the closing of the Merger. As a result of the Merger, Fairmount Santrol will no longer be a publicly held
company. Following the Merger, Fairmount Santrol common stock will be delisted from the NYSE and deregistered under the Exchange Act, and
Fairmount Santrol will no longer be required under Sections 13 or 14 of the Exchange Act to file periodic reports and proxy statements and other
information with the SEC in respect of Fairmount Santrol common stock. Following the Merger, the combined company will become a publicly traded
company with its common stock listed on the NYSE and registered under the Exchange Act. The combined company will be subject to the reporting
requirements of Sections 13 and 14 of the Exchange Act and will file periodic reports and proxy statements and other information with the SEC in
respect of the combined company common stock.

Q: Why is stockholder approval necessary and who is entitled to vote?

A: This proxy statement/prospectus serves as the proxy statement through which Fairmount Santrol will solicit proxies to obtain the necessary
stockholder approval for the Merger. It also serves as the prospectus by which Unimin will issue its common stock as consideration in the Merger.
Fairmount Santrol is holding the special meeting in order to obtain the stockholder approval necessary to adopt the Merger Agreement. Fairmount
Santrol will be unable to complete the Merger unless, among other things, the Fairmount Santrol stockholders vote in favor of the Fairmount Santrol
Merger proposal.

You are receiving this proxy statement/prospectus because you were a holder of record of Fairmount Santrol common stock as of the close of
business on April 20, 2018, the record date for the special meeting (the “record date”). This proxy statement/prospectus contains important information
about the Merger, the Merger Agreement (which is summarized below in the section entitled “The Merger Agreement” and a copy of which is attached
as Annex A), the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of Unimin and the Amended and Restated Bylaws of Unimin (which are
summarized below in the sections entitled “Description of Combined Company Capital Stock” and “Comparison of Stockholder Rights Before and
After the Merger” and forms of which are attached as Annexes C and D) and the special meeting. You should read this information carefully and in its
entirety. The enclosed voting materials also allow you to vote your shares of Fairmount Santrol common stock without attending the special meeting.
Your vote is very important and we encourage you to submit your proxy as soon as possible.

Q: What will Fairmount Santrol stockholders receive if the Merger is completed?

A: If the Merger is completed, each share of Fairmount Santrol common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the closing of the
Merger (other than (1) shares owned by Fairmount Santrol or any wholly owned subsidiary of Fairmount Santrol (or held in the treasury of Fairmount
Santrol), (2) shares owned by SCR-Sibelco NV, a privately-owned Belgian company (“Sibelco”) or any of its subsidiaries and (3) shares held by a
stockholder who is entitled to appraisal rights and has properly exercised and perfected (and not effectively withdrawn or lost) such stockholder’s
demand for appraisal rights under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the “DGCL”)) will be converted into the right to receive:
 

 
(a) a number of shares of combined company common stock equal to the Exchange Ratio (the “Stock Consideration”) (as defined under “The

Merger Agreement—Effects of the Merger; Merger Consideration”);
 

 
(b) an amount in cash equal to the result of (x) $170,000,000, divided by (y) the fully diluted Fairmount Santrol share number (as defined under

“The Merger Agreement—Effects of the Merger; Merger Consideration”), without interest (which is estimated to result in cash
consideration of approximately $0.74 per fully diluted share of Fairmount Santrol common stock) (the “Cash Consideration”); and

 

 (c) cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any, without interest.

The Exchange Ratio is equal to 0.20. For purposes of estimating the Stock Consideration to which each Fairmount Santrol stockholder will be
entitled at the effective time of the Merger (the “effective time”), for every five whole shares of Fairmount Santrol common stock owned as of the
effective time, such stockholder would receive one whole share of combined company common stock. At the effective time, the combined company
estimates that it will have outstanding or reserved for issuance approximately 134,252,401 shares of common

stock, of which approximately 35% will be issued to Fairmount Santrol stockholders (or reserved for issuance for holders of Fairmount Santrol equity
awards) as the Stock Consideration, and no shares of preferred stock. The total number of shares that the combined company expects to have
outstanding or reserved for issuance as of the effective time is based on the number of shares of Fairmount Santrol common stock, Fairmount Santrol
RSUs, Fairmount Santrol PSUs and Fairmount Santrol Stock Options outstanding as of December 8, 2017 plus an estimated number of shares of
Fairmount Santrol common stock, Fairmount Santrol RSUs and Fairmount Santrol PSUs issued or to be issued (or cancelled) between December 8,
2017 and the effective time.

The Exchange Ratio has been agreed by Unimin and Fairmount Santrol in order to derive a market-appropriate number of shares of combined
company common stock outstanding following the effective time. The Exchange Ratio, in combination with the number of shares of combined company
common stock to be held by Sibelco following the effective time, will result in the Fairmount Santrol stockholders and equity award holders receiving
approximately 35% of the issued and outstanding shares of combined company common stock, as required by the Merger Agreement. The 65% : 35%
split between Sibelco and Fairmount Santrol stockholders was agreed in the Merger Agreement based on the fully diluted Fairmount Santrol share count
as of December 8, 2017, where the Fairmount Santrol Stock Options included in such share count were calculated in accordance with the treasury
method of accounting. The Fairmount Santrol stockholders will own approximately 35% of the shares of combined company common stock issued and
outstanding, regardless of the aggregate combined company share count as of the effective time.

For purposes of estimating the Cash Consideration to which each Fairmount Santrol stockholder will be entitled at the effective time, the fully
diluted Fairmount Santrol share number calculated as of April 2, 2018 was 230,992,325. The fully diluted Fairmount Santrol share number is not
expected to be materially different at the effective time.

The Stock Consideration, the Cash Consideration and the right to receive cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any, are collectively referred to in this
proxy statement/prospectus as the “Merger Consideration.” For more information about the Merger Consideration, see the section entitled “The Merger
Agreement—Effects of the Merger; Merger Consideration” beginning on page 186 of this proxy statement/prospectus.

Q: What equity stake will Fairmount Santrol stockholders hold in the combined company immediately following the Merger?

A: Holders of shares of Fairmount Santrol common stock as of immediately prior to the effective time will hold, in the aggregate, together with
holders of certain Fairmount Santrol equity awards, approximately 35% of the issued and outstanding shares of combined company common stock
immediately following the closing of the Merger. Approximately 65% of the combined company common stock will be owned, directly or indirectly, by
Sibelco, which is currently Unimin’s parent company and owns, directly or indirectly, 100% of Unimin common stock. The combined company will be
a “controlled company” within the meaning of the rules of the NYSE and intends to rely on exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements
available to controlled companies. As a result of their reduced ownership percentage, former Fairmount Santrol stockholders will have less voting power
in the combined company than they now have with respect to Fairmount Santrol and will not have the ability to control the outcome of matters voted
upon by all of the combined company stockholders.

Q: How will I receive the Merger Consideration to which I am entitled?

A: After receiving the proper documentation from you, following the closing of the Merger, the exchange agent will forward to you the shares of
combined company common stock, the Cash Consideration and cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any, to which you are entitled. If you own Fairmount
Santrol common stock in book-entry form or through a bank, brokerage firm or other holder of record, you will not need to obtain share certificates to
submit for exchange to the exchange agent, nor will you receive certificated shares of the combined company common stock. However, you or your
bank, brokerage firm or other nominee will need to follow the instructions provided by the exchange agent in order to properly surrender your
Fairmount Santrol common stock. More information on the documentation you are required to deliver to the exchange agent may be found in the section
entitled “The Merger Agreement—Exchange of Fairmount Santrol Shares” beginning on page 187 of this proxy statement/prospectus.

Table of Contents

Q: Who is the exchange agent for the Merger?

A: American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC is the exchange agent.

Q: Where will the shares of combined company common stock that I receive in the Merger be publicly traded?

A: Unimin has applied to the NYSE to list its shares of common stock, which will become shares of the combined company common stock, under
a trading symbol to be mutually selected by Unimin and Fairmount Santrol. The listing of the combined company common stock on the NYSE is one of
the closing conditions under the Merger Agreement. See the section entitled “The Merger Agreement—Conditions to Closing of the Merger” beginning
on page 203 of this proxy statement/prospectus.

Q: Will my shares of combined company common stock acquired in the Merger receive dividends?

A: The combined company does not currently expect to pay dividends following the closing of the Merger. Any future determination of the
combined company to issue dividends will remain subject to consideration and approval by the board of directors of the combined company (the
“Combined Company Board”). The Combined Company Board will have sole discretion to determine whether any dividends will be declared, the
amount of such dividends and when any dividend will be paid. Any determination to declare and pay dividends will be subject to a number of
considerations, including, but not limited to, the combined company’s results of operations, the combined company’s liquidity and financing plans, the
market price of the combined company common stock and the combined company’s access to capital markets, as well as legal requirements, industry
practice and other factors deemed relevant by the Combined Company Board.

After the closing of the Merger, if any dividends are declared or paid by the combined company after the effective time, as a holder of shares of
combined company common stock, you will be entitled to receive the same dividends on shares of combined company common stock that all other
holders of combined company common stock will receive for any dividend record date that occurs after the Merger is consummated, subject to the
following.

If any dividends are declared or paid by the combined company after the effective time, stockholders who held Fairmount Santrol common stock
immediately prior to the closing of the Merger will not be entitled to be paid dividends otherwise payable on the shares of combined company common
stock into which their shares of Fairmount Santrol common stock are exchangeable until such stockholder completes the appropriate documentation
provided by the exchange agent and surrenders his or her Fairmount Santrol share certificates, if applicable, according to the instructions provided to
him or her. Any such dividends will be accrued for these stockholders and they will receive the accrued dividends when they surrender their Fairmount
Santrol share certificates, if applicable, subject to abandoned property laws. Former Fairmount Santrol stockholders will also receive any dividends with
a record date prior to the closing of the Merger that have been declared by Fairmount Santrol with respect to the shares of Fairmount Santrol common
stock but that have not been paid on those shares of Fairmount Santrol common stock that they hold.

Q: Who will serve as the directors and senior officers of the combined company?

A: Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, at the effective time, the Combined Company Board will consist initially of 11 directors. Six of the
11 directors will be selected by Unimin (one of whom will be the chairman of the Combined Company Board) and four of the 11 directors will be
selected by Fairmount Santrol. The eleventh director will be the Chief Executive Officer of the combined company. At least three of the directors
selected by Fairmount Santrol must be independent in accordance with the standards of the NYSE.

Jenniffer D. Deckard, currently the Chief Executive Officer of Fairmount Santrol, will be the Chief Executive Officer of the combined company,
and, as such, Ms. Deckard will be a director on the Combined Company Board. The broader executive leadership team of the combined company will
include a combination of existing leaders from both Unimin and Fairmount Santrol.

Q: When do you expect the Merger to be completed?

A: Subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the closing conditions described under the section entitled “The Merger Agreement—Conditions to
Closing of the Merger” beginning on page 203 of this proxy statement/prospectus, including approval of the Fairmount Santrol Merger proposal by
Fairmount Santrol stockholders at

the special meeting and subject to receipt of applicable regulatory approvals, Fairmount Santrol and Unimin intend to complete the Merger as soon as
reasonably practicable. Subject to the foregoing, Fairmount Santrol and Unimin currently expect to consummate the Merger in mid-2018. However, it is
possible that factors outside the control of both companies could result in the Merger being completed at a different time or not at all. In addition, there
may be a substantial amount of time between the special meeting and the closing of the Merger. For additional information on the regulatory approvals
required to complete the Merger, see the section entitled “The Merger Agreement—Regulatory Approvals” beginning on page 199 of this proxy
statement/prospectus.

Q: What effects will the Merger have on Fairmount Santrol?

A: Upon the closing of the Merger, Fairmount Santrol will cease to have its common stock traded publicly. Merger Sub will be merged with and
into Fairmount Santrol, with Fairmount Santrol continuing as the surviving corporation, followed immediately by the merger of Fairmount Santrol with
and into Merger Sub LLC, with Merger Sub LLC continuing as the surviving entity and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of the combined company.
Following the closing of the Merger, the registration of Fairmount Santrol common stock and the reporting obligations of Fairmount Santrol with respect
to its common stock under the Exchange Act will be terminated. In addition, following the closing of the Merger, shares of Fairmount Santrol common
stock will no longer be listed on the NYSE or any other stock exchange or quotation system. Although current Fairmount Santrol stockholders will no
longer be stockholders of Fairmount Santrol, they will have an indirect interest in Fairmount Santrol (or its successor) through their ownership of
combined company common stock, which will be listed on the NYSE.

Q: What are the conditions to the closing of the Merger?

A: In addition to obtaining Fairmount Santrol stockholder approval (as defined herein), the obligations of Fairmount Santrol, Unimin and the other
parties to the Merger Agreement to close the Merger are subject to the satisfaction or waiver of a number of other conditions, including, among others:
 

 
•  the waiting period (and any extension thereof) applicable to the Merger under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as

amended (the “HSR Act”), having been terminated or having expired;
 

 
•  all applicable waiting periods (or extensions thereof) or necessary approvals relating to the Merger under the applicable laws of the

jurisdictions or governmental entities specified in the Merger Agreement having expired, been terminated or been received;
 

 

•  there being no order, statute, law, ordinance, rule or regulation of any court or other governmental entity of competent jurisdiction or other
legal restraint or prohibition in effect, in the United States or in any jurisdiction specified in the Merger Agreement, that prevents, makes
illegal or prohibits the closing of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements;

 

 
•  the SEC having declared effective the registration statement of which this proxy statement/prospectus forms a part and no stop order or

proceedings seeking a stop order shall be threatened by the SEC or shall have been initiated by the SEC; and
 

 
•  the approval for listing by the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance, of the shares of Unimin common stock issuable to the holders of

Fairmount Santrol common stock in connection with the Merger.

In addition, conditions to the obligations of Sibelco, Unimin, Merger Sub and Merger Sub LLC to close the Merger include, among others:
 

 
•  the representations and warranties of Fairmount Santrol contained in the Merger Agreement being true and correct as of the closing date of

the Merger (in some cases in all material respects or subject to the absence of a material adverse effect (as defined herein));

A: If the Fairmount Santrol Merger proposal is not approved by Fairmount Santrol stockholders or if the Merger is not completed for any other
reason, Fairmount Santrol stockholders will not receive any consideration for their shares of Fairmount Santrol common stock. Instead, Fairmount
Santrol will remain an independent public company, Fairmount Santrol common stock will continue to be listed and traded on the NYSE and registered
under the Exchange Act, and Fairmount Santrol will continue to file periodic reports with the SEC. Under certain circumstances, Fairmount Santrol may
be required to pay Unimin a termination fee of $52 million. In other circumstances, Unimin may be required to pay Fairmount Santrol a termination fee
of $52 million. See the sections entitled “The Merger Agreement—Termination,” “The Merger Agreement—Effect of Termination” and “The Merger
Agreement—Termination Fees” beginning on pages 205, 207 and 208, respectively, of this proxy statement/prospectus.

Q: What will happen to outstanding Fairmount Santrol equity awards in the Merger?

A: The Merger Agreement generally provides for the conversion of Fairmount Santrol Stock Options, Fairmount Santrol RSU awards and
Fairmount Santrol PSU awards into corresponding awards for a number of shares of combined company common stock determined by multiplying the
number of shares of Fairmount Santrol common stock subject to each Fairmount Santrol equity award by the Exchange Ratio. The exercise price of the
Fairmount Santrol Stock Options following the conversion will be determined by dividing the per-share exercise price of the Fairmount Santrol Stock
Options by the Exchange Ratio. The converted Fairmount Santrol equity awards will be subject to the same terms and conditions as the original
Fairmount Santrol equity awards, subject to certain exceptions. Holders of Fairmount Santrol RSU awards, Fairmount Santrol PSU awards and
in-the-money Fairmount Santrol Stock Options will also be entitled to receive a portion of the Cash

Consideration. For additional information on the treatment of Fairmount Santrol equity awards, see the section entitled “The Merger Agreement—
Treatment of Fairmount Santrol Equity Awards” beginning on page 188 of this proxy statement/prospectus.

Q: Are there any risks related to the Merger or the combined business that I should consider?

A: Yes. There are risks associated with all mergers. These risks are discussed in more detail in the section entitled “Risk Factors” beginning on
page 46 of this proxy statement/prospectus and you should also refer to the section entitled “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking
Statements” beginning on page 94 of this proxy statement/prospectus. You also should read and carefully consider the risk factors contained in the
documents filed by Fairmount Santrol with the SEC that are incorporated by reference into this proxy statement/prospectus.

Q: Are Fairmount Santrol stockholders entitled to appraisal rights?

A: Yes, subject to compliance with the DGCL. Subject to the closing of the Merger, record holders of Fairmount Santrol common stock who do
not vote in favor of the Fairmount Santrol Merger proposal and who otherwise properly exercise and perfect their appraisal rights in accordance with
Section 262 of the DGCL (“Section 262”) will be entitled to seek appraisal for, and obtain payment in cash for the judicially determined fair value of,
their shares of Fairmount Santrol common stock, in lieu of receiving the Merger Consideration. The “fair value” could be higher or lower than, or the
same as, the Merger Consideration. For more information regarding appraisal rights, see the section entitled “Appraisal Rights of Fairmount Santrol
Stockholders” beginning on page 361 of this proxy statement/prospectus. Failure to strictly comply with Section 262 may result in a waiver of, or
inability to exercise, appraisal rights. The full text of Section 262 is attached as Annex E to this proxy statement/prospectus.

Q: Will Fairmount Santrol still have an annual stockholders’ meeting in 2018?

A: Fairmount Santrol does not expect to hold an annual stockholders’ meeting in 2018 while the Merger is pending, and it currently plans to delay
its 2018 annual stockholders’ meeting and only hold an annual meeting in 2018 if the Merger is terminated or if the annual meeting is required by law.

Q: What are the material United States federal income tax consequences of the Mergers to Fairmount Santrol stockholders?

A: Assuming the Mergers, taken together as an integrated transaction, qualify as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), a U.S. holder exchanging its shares of Fairmount Santrol common stock for a combination of
combined company common stock and cash (including cash received in lieu of fractional shares, if any) pursuant to the Merger Agreement will
generally recognize gain (but not loss) in an amount equal to the lesser of (i) the excess of such U.S. holder’s “amount realized” in the transaction (i.e.,
the fair market value of the shares of combined company common stock at the effective time plus the amount of cash (including cash received in lieu of
fractional shares, if any) received by such U.S. holder in exchange for its shares of Fairmount Santrol common stock in the Merger) over such U.S.
holder’s tax basis in its surrendered shares of Fairmount Santrol common stock and (ii) the amount of cash (including cash received in lieu of fractional
shares, if any) received by such U.S. holder in exchange for its shares of Fairmount Santrol common stock in the Merger. Assuming the Mergers qualify
as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, non-U.S. holders are generally not expected to be subject to U.S. federal income
tax in respect of the Mergers, subject to certain exceptions, including those relating to tax imposed under the Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax
Act (“FIRPTA”). For a more complete description of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Mergers, see the section entitled “Material United
States Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Transaction” beginning on page 178 of this proxy statement/prospectus.

A: All holders of record of shares of Fairmount Santrol common stock as of the close of business on the record date are entitled to receive notice
of, and to vote at, the special meeting. Each holder of shares of Fairmount Santrol common stock is entitled to cast one vote on each matter properly
brought before the special meeting for each share of Fairmount Santrol common stock that such holder owned of record as of the close of business on
the record date.

Q: How can I attend the special meeting?

other business at the special meeting except such business as may properly be brought before the special meeting or any adjournment or postponement
thereof.

Q: Does my vote matter?

A: Yes. Your vote is important. You are encouraged to submit your proxy as promptly as possible. The Merger cannot be completed unless the
Fairmount Santrol Merger proposal is approved by the Fairmount Santrol stockholders. If you fail to submit a proxy or vote in person at the special
meeting, abstain from voting or do not provide your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee with instructions, as applicable, this will have the same
effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Fairmount Santrol Merger proposal. The board of directors of Fairmount Santrol (the “Fairmount Board”) recommends
that Fairmount Santrol stockholders vote (1) “FOR” the Fairmount Santrol Merger proposal, (2) “FOR” the Fairmount Santrol compensation proposal
and (3) “FOR” the Fairmount Santrol adjournment proposal.

 •  “FOR” the Fairmount Santrol Merger proposal;
 

 •  “FOR” the Fairmount Santrol compensation proposal; and

See the sections entitled “The Merger—Fairmount Santrol’s Reasons for the Merger” and “The Merger—Recommendation of the Fairmount
Board” beginning on page 143 and page 147, respectively, of this proxy statement/prospectus.

Q: How do I vote?

A: You can vote your shares of Fairmount Santrol common stock in the following ways, depending on whether you are a stockholder of record or
a beneficial owner:

Stockholder of Record. If you are a stockholder of record, you may vote your shares of Fairmount Santrol common stock on matters presented at
the special meeting in any of the following ways:
 

 
•  by telephone or over the Internet, by accessing the telephone number or Internet website specified on the enclosed proxy card. Proxies

delivered over the Internet or by telephone must be submitted by 11:59 p.m. Eastern time on May 24, 2018. Please be aware that if you vote
by telephone or over the Internet, you may incur costs such as telephone and Internet access charges for which you will be responsible;

 

 
•  by completing, signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy card in the pre-addressed, postage-prepaid envelope accompanying the

proxy card; or
 

 •  in person—you may attend the special meeting and cast your vote there.

Beneficial Owner. If you are a beneficial owner, please refer to the instructions provided by your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee to see
which of the above choices are available to you. Please note that if you are a beneficial owner and wish to vote in person at the special meeting, you
must obtain a legal proxy from your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee.

Q: If a stockholder gives a proxy, how are the shares of Fairmount Santrol common stock voted?

A: Regardless of the method you choose to vote, the individuals named on the enclosed proxy card will vote your shares of Fairmount Santrol
common stock in the way that you indicate. When completing the Internet or telephone processes or the proxy card, you may specify whether your
shares of Fairmount Santrol common stock should be voted “FOR” or “AGAINST” or to “ABSTAIN” from voting on all, some or none of the specific
items of business to come before the special meeting.

If you properly sign your proxy card but do not mark the boxes showing how your shares should be voted on a matter, the shares represented by
your properly signed proxy will be voted “FOR” the Fairmount Santrol Merger proposal, “FOR” the Fairmount Santrol compensation proposal and
“FOR” the Fairmount Santrol adjournment proposal.

Q: Should I send in my share certificates now?

A: No, please do NOT return your share certificate(s) with your proxy. If the Fairmount Santrol Merger proposal is approved by Fairmount
Santrol stockholders, the Merger is completed and you hold physical share certificates, you will be sent a letter of transmittal as promptly as reasonably
practicable after the closing of the Merger describing how you may exchange your shares of Fairmount Santrol common stock for the per share Merger
Consideration. If your shares of Fairmount Santrol common stock are held in “street name” through a

bank, brokerage firm or other nominee, you will receive instructions from your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee as to how to effect the surrender
of your “street name” shares of Fairmount Santrol common stock in exchange for the per share Merger Consideration.

Q: What is the vote required to approve each proposal at the special meeting?

A: Fairmount Santrol Merger Proposal. Approving the Fairmount Santrol Merger proposal requires the affirmative vote of the stockholders
holding a majority of the outstanding shares of Fairmount Santrol common stock, at the close of business on the record date, entitled to vote on the
Fairmount Santrol Merger proposal (“Fairmount Santrol stockholder approval”). Accordingly, if a Fairmount Santrol stockholder fails to submit a proxy
or vote in person at the special meeting or abstains from voting, this will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Fairmount Santrol Merger
proposal.

Fairmount Santrol Compensation Proposal. In accordance with Section 14A of the Exchange Act, Fairmount Santrol is providing stockholders
with the opportunity to approve, by non-binding advisory vote, compensation payments for Fairmount Santrol’s named executive officers in connection
with the Merger. Approving the Fairmount Santrol compensation proposal, on a non-binding advisory basis, requires the affirmative vote of a majority
of Fairmount Santrol stockholders present, in person or represented by proxy, and entitled to vote at the special meeting. Accordingly, a Fairmount
Santrol stockholder who attends the special meeting but does not vote will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Fairmount Santrol
compensation proposal. Similarly, abstentions of Fairmount Santrol stockholders present, in person or represented by proxy, at the special meeting will
have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Fairmount Santrol compensation proposal. A Fairmount Santrol stockholder’s failure to submit a proxy
card will have no effect on the Fairmount Santrol compensation proposal.

Fairmount Santrol Adjournment Proposal. Approving the Fairmount Santrol adjournment proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of
Fairmount Santrol stockholders present, in person or represented by proxy, and entitled to vote at the special meeting. Accordingly, a Fairmount Santrol
stockholder who attends the special meeting but does not vote will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Fairmount Santrol adjournment
proposal. Similarly, abstentions of Fairmount Santrol stockholders present, in person or represented by proxy, at the special meeting will have the same
effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Fairmount Santrol adjournment proposal.

See the section entitled “The Special Meeting—Record Date and Quorum” beginning on page 116 of this proxy statement/prospectus.

Q: How many votes do I have?

A: You are entitled to cast one vote for each share of Fairmount Santrol common stock that you owned as of the close of business on the record
date. As of the close of business on the record date, there were 224,982,895 shares of Fairmount Santrol common stock issued and outstanding entitled
to vote at the special meeting.

Q: Do the Fairmount Santrol stockholders have to vote on the Fairmount Santrol Merger proposal at the special meeting if the Fairmount
Board has changed its recommendation with respect to the Fairmount Santrol Merger proposal?

A: Yes. Unless the Merger Agreement is terminated before the special meeting, Fairmount Santrol will notify the Fairmount Santrol stockholders
before the special meeting if the Fairmount Board has changed its recommendation with respect to the adoption of the Merger Agreement, and the
Fairmount Santrol stockholders will be asked to vote on the Fairmount Santrol Merger proposal even if the Fairmount Board has so changed its
recommendation.

Q: What will happen if I am present at the special meeting, in person or by proxy, and I fail to vote or I abstain from voting?

A: Fairmount Santrol Merger Proposal. If you fail to submit a proxy or vote in person at the special meeting, abstain from voting or do not
provide your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee with instructions, as applicable, this will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Fairmount
Santrol Merger proposal.

Table of Contents

Fairmount Santrol Compensation Proposal. If you are a Fairmount Santrol stockholder present at the special meeting, in person or represented by
proxy, and fail to vote or abstain, it will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Fairmount Santrol compensation proposal.

Fairmount Santrol Adjournment Proposal. If you are a Fairmount Santrol stockholder present at the special meeting, in person or represented by
proxy, and fail to vote or abstain, it will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Fairmount Santrol adjournment proposal.

Q: What constitutes a quorum for the special meeting?

A: The presence at the special meeting, in person or represented by proxy, of holders of a majority of the shares of Fairmount Santrol common
stock outstanding as of the close of business on the record date entitled to vote at the special meeting constitutes a quorum for the purposes of the special
meeting. Abstentions will be counted in determining whether a quorum exists. If your shares are held in “street name” by your bank, brokerage firm or
other nominee and you do not instruct your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee how to vote your shares, your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee
will not have authority to vote on your behalf with respect to any of the proposals, and your shares will not be counted for purposes of determining
whether a quorum exists. A quorum is necessary to transact business at the special meeting. Once a share of Fairmount Santrol common stock is
represented at the special meeting, it will be counted for the purpose of determining a quorum at the special meeting and any adjournment of the special
meeting. However, if a new record date is set for the adjourned special meeting, then a new quorum will be determined.

Q: What is the difference between holding shares as a stockholder of record and as a beneficial owner?

A: If your shares of Fairmount Santrol common stock are registered directly in your name with the transfer agent of Fairmount Santrol, American
Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, you are considered the stockholder of record with respect to those shares. As the stockholder of record, you
have the right to vote or to grant a proxy for your vote directly to Fairmount Santrol or to a third party to vote at the special meeting.

If your shares of Fairmount Santrol common stock are held by a bank, brokerage firm or other nominee, you are considered the beneficial owner
of shares held in “street name,” and your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee is considered the stockholder of record with respect to those shares.
Your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee will send you, as the beneficial owner, a package describing the procedure for voting your shares of
Fairmount Santrol common stock. You should follow the instructions provided by them to vote your shares of Fairmount Santrol common stock. You are
invited to attend the special meeting; however, you may not vote these shares in person at the special meeting unless you obtain a “legal proxy” from
your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee that holds your shares of Fairmount Santrol common stock, giving you the right to vote the shares of
Fairmount Santrol common stock at the special meeting.

Q: If my shares of Fairmount Santrol common stock are held in “street name” by my bank, brokerage firm or other nominee, will my bank,
brokerage firm or other nominee automatically vote those shares for me?

A: Your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee will only be permitted to vote your shares of Fairmount Santrol common stock if you instruct your
bank, brokerage firm or other nominee how to vote. You should follow the procedures provided by your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee
regarding the voting of your shares of Fairmount Santrol common stock. In accordance with the rules of the NYSE, banks, brokerage firms and other
nominees who hold shares of Fairmount Santrol common stock in “street name” for their customers have authority to vote on “routine” proposals when
they have not received instructions from beneficial owners.

However, banks, brokerage firms and other nominees are precluded from exercising their voting discretion with respect to non-routine matters,
such as the Fairmount Santrol Merger proposal, the Fairmount Santrol compensation proposal and the Fairmount Santrol adjournment proposal.

As a result, absent specific instructions from you, banks, brokerage firms or other nominees are not empowered to vote your shares of Fairmount
Santrol common stock at the special meeting. The effect of not instructing your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee how you wish your shares to be
voted will be the same as

Table of Contents

a vote “AGAINST” the Fairmount Santrol Merger proposal, and assuming you are not present at the special meeting, in person or by proxy, will not
have an effect on the Fairmount Santrol compensation proposal and the Fairmount Santrol adjournment proposal.

Please note that you may not vote shares of Fairmount Santrol common stock held in street name by returning a proxy card directly to Fairmount
Santrol or by voting in person at the special meeting unless you provide a “legal proxy,” which you must obtain from your bank, brokerage firm, trust
company or other nominee.

Q: What is a “broker non-vote”?

A: Under NYSE rules, banks, brokerage firms and other nominees may use their discretion to vote “uninstructed” shares (i.e., shares held of
record by banks, brokerage firms or other nominees but with respect to which the beneficial owner of such shares has not provided instructions on how
to vote on a particular proposal) with respect to matters that are considered to be “routine,” but not with respect to “non-routine” matters. “Non-routine”
matters are matters that may substantially affect the rights or privileges of stockholders, such as mergers, stockholder proposals, elections of directors
(even if not contested), executive compensation (including any advisory stockholder votes on executive compensation) and certain corporate governance
proposals, even if management-supported. A “broker non-vote” occurs on an item when (i) a broker, nominee or intermediary has discretionary
authority to vote on one or more proposals to be voted on at a meeting of stockholders, but is not permitted to vote on other proposals without
instructions from the beneficial owner of the shares and (ii) the beneficial owner fails to provide the broker, nominee or intermediary with such
instructions. Because none of the proposals to be voted on at the special meeting are “routine matters” for which your bank, brokerage firm or other
nominee may have discretionary authority to vote, if you do not instruct your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee how to vote your shares, your bank,
brokerage firm or other nominee will not have authority to vote on your behalf with respect to any of the proposals. Unless you attend the special
meeting in person with a properly executed legal proxy from your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee, your failure to provide instructions to your
bank, brokerage firm or other nominee will result in your shares of Fairmount Santrol common stock not being present and entitled to vote at the special
meeting and not being voted on any of the proposals and your shares will not be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum exists.
Consequently, there cannot be any broker non-votes at the special meeting.

Q: How can I change or revoke my vote?

A: You have the right to revoke a proxy, whether delivered over the Internet, by telephone or by mail, at any time before it is exercised, by voting
again at a later date through any of the methods available to you, by attending the special meeting and voting in person or by giving written notice of
revocation to Fairmount Santrol prior to the time the special meeting begins. Written notice of revocation should be mailed to: Fairmount Santrol
Holdings Inc., Attention: Secretary, 8834 Mayfield Road, Chesterland, Ohio 44026. Your attendance at the special meeting in and of itself will not
revoke any proxy. For a full description of the mechanics of proxy submittals and revocations, see the section entitled “The Special Meeting—Voting
Rights; Proxies; Revocation” beginning on page 117 of this proxy statement/prospectus.

Q: Are any Fairmount Santrol stockholders already committed to vote in favor of any of the special meeting proposals?

A: Yes. Concurrently with the entry into the Merger Agreement, Unimin and Merger Sub entered into a Voting and Support Agreement, dated
December 11, 2017 (the “Voting and Support Agreement”), with ASP FML Holdings, LLC and Charles D. Fowler (collectively, the “Supporting
Stockholders”). Under the Voting and Support Agreement, the Supporting Stockholders have agreed to vote all of their shares of Fairmount Santrol
common stock (including all shares owned as of December 11, 2017 and any additional shares either Supporting Stockholder acquires before the special
meeting) in favor of the Fairmount Santrol Merger proposal and have granted to Unimin a proxy to vote their shares in favor of the Fairmount Santrol
Merger proposal. As of April 2, 2018, the Supporting Stockholders, collectively, beneficially owned (with sole or shared voting power) 59,304,771
shares, or approximately 26.4%, of the Fairmount Santrol common stock then outstanding. For more information, see “Voting and Support Agreement”
beginning on page 211 of this proxy statement/prospectus.

Q: What should I do if I receive more than one set of voting materials?

A: If you hold shares of Fairmount Santrol common stock in “street name” and also directly as a record holder or otherwise or if you hold shares
of Fairmount Santrol common stock in more than one brokerage account, you may receive more than one set of voting materials relating to the special
meeting. Please complete, sign, date and return each proxy card (or cast your vote by telephone or Internet as provided on your proxy card) or otherwise
follow the voting instructions provided in this proxy statement/prospectus in order to ensure that all of your shares of Fairmount Santrol common stock
are voted. If you hold your shares in “street name” through a bank, brokerage firm or other nominee, you should follow the procedures provided by your
bank, brokerage firm or other nominee to vote your shares. If you hold your shares in “street name” through more than one bank, brokerage firm or
other nominee, you should follow the procedures provided by each of your banks, brokerage firms or other nominees in respect of each set of voting
materials to vote the portion of your shares of Fairmount Santrol common stock held through such bank, brokerage firm or other nominee.

Q: What happens if I sell my shares of Fairmount Santrol common stock before the special meeting?

A: The record date is earlier than both the date of the special meeting and the date on which the Merger will be completed. If you transfer your
shares of Fairmount Santrol common stock after the record date but before the special meeting, you will, unless the transferee requests a proxy from
you, retain your right to vote at the special meeting but will transfer the right to receive the per share Merger Consideration to the person to whom you
transfer your shares. In order to receive the per share Merger Consideration, you must hold your shares at the time of the closing of the Merger.

Q: What happens if I sell or otherwise transfer my shares of Fairmount Santrol common stock after the special meeting but before the closing
of the Merger?

A: If the Fairmount Santrol Merger proposal is approved by Fairmount Santrol stockholders at the special meeting and you sell or otherwise
transfer your shares of Fairmount Santrol common stock after the special meeting but before the closing of the Merger, you will have transferred the
right to receive the per share Merger Consideration to the person to whom you transfer your shares. In order to receive the per share Merger
Consideration upon the closing of the Merger, you must hold your shares of Fairmount Santrol common stock at the time of the closing of the Merger.

Q: Who will solicit and pay the cost of soliciting proxies?

A: Fairmount Santrol is making this solicitation and will bear the expense of printing and mailing proxy materials to its stockholders. Fairmount
Santrol will ask banks, brokers and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries to send proxy materials to beneficial owners of shares of Fairmount
Santrol common stock and to secure their voting instructions, if necessary, and Fairmount Santrol will reimburse them for their reasonable expenses in
so doing. Fairmount Santrol’s directors, officers and employees may also solicit proxies personally or by telephone, but they will not be specifically

Q: Why am I being asked to consider and vote on the proposal to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, certain existing compensation
arrangements for named executive officers of Fairmount Santrol in connection with the Merger?

A: Under SEC rules, Fairmount Santrol is required to seek a non-binding, advisory vote with respect to the compensation that may be paid or
become payable to its named executive officers that is based on, or otherwise relates to, the Merger.

Q: What will happen if Fairmount Santrol stockholders do not approve this Merger-related executive compensation?

A: The vote on the Fairmount Santrol compensation proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote on the Fairmount Santrol Merger proposal.
Accordingly, Fairmount Santrol stockholders may vote in favor of the Fairmount Santrol Merger proposal and not in favor of the Fairmount Santrol
compensation proposal, or vice versa. Fairmount Santrol stockholder approval of the compensation that may become payable to Fairmount Santrol’s
named executive officers in connection with the closing of the Merger is not a condition to the closing of the Merger. The vote is an advisory vote and
will not be binding on Fairmount Santrol or the combined company. If the Merger is completed, the Merger-related compensation may be paid to
Fairmount Santrol’s named executive officers to the extent payable in accordance with the terms of their compensation agreements and arrangements
even if Fairmount Santrol stockholders do not approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, the Merger-related executive compensation.

Q: Do any of Fairmount Santrol’s directors or executive officers have interests in the Merger that differ from or are in addition to my interests
as a stockholder of Fairmount Santrol common stock?

A: In considering the recommendation of the Fairmount Board with respect to the Fairmount Santrol Merger proposal and the other matters
described in this proxy statement/prospectus, you should be aware that certain directors and executive officers of Fairmount Santrol may have interests
in the Merger that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of Fairmount Santrol stockholders generally. The Fairmount Board was aware of and
has considered these interests, among other matters, in evaluating and negotiating the Merger Agreement and approving the Merger, and in
recommending that the Merger Agreement be adopted by Fairmount Santrol stockholders. See the sections entitled “Interests of Fairmount Santrol’s
Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger” beginning on page 171 of this proxy statement/prospectus and “Advisory Vote on Merger-Related
Compensation for Fairmount Santrol’s Named Executive Officers” beginning on page 367 of this proxy statement/prospectus.

Q: What do I need to do now?

A: Even if you plan to attend the special meeting in person, after carefully reading and considering the information contained in this proxy
statement/prospectus, please vote promptly to ensure that your shares are represented at the special meeting. If you hold your shares of Fairmount
Santrol common stock in your own name as the stockholder of record, you may submit a proxy to have your shares of Fairmount Santrol common stock
voted at the special meeting in one of three ways:
 

 
•  by telephone or over the Internet, by accessing the telephone number or Internet website specified on the enclosed proxy card. Proxies

The Merger and the Merger Agreement (Page 185)

Fairmount Santrol and Unimin have agreed to the strategic combination of Fairmount Santrol and Unimin under the terms of the Merger
Agreement that is described in this proxy statement/prospectus. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub, a
Delaware corporation and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Unimin, will be merged with and into Fairmount Santrol, with Fairmount Santrol
surviving as a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Unimin. Immediately following the effective time, Sibelco will own, directly or indirectly,
approximately 65% of the shares of combined company common stock and former Fairmount Santrol stockholders, including holders of certain
equity awards, will own the remaining approximately 35% of the outstanding shares. In addition, each unexpired and unexercised Fairmount
Santrol Stock Option, Fairmount Santrol RSU and Fairmount Santrol PSU will automatically convert into stock options and RSUs with respect to
combined company common stock, on the same terms and conditions under the applicable plans and award agreements in effect immediately prior
to the effective time after giving effect to the Exchange Ratio and appropriate adjustments to reflect the closing of the Merger. Immediately
following the Merger, Fairmount Santrol (as the surviving corporation in the Merger) will be merged with and into Merger Sub LLC, after which
Fairmount Santrol will cease to exist as a separate corporate entity. Merger Sub LLC will continue as the surviving entity in the Second Merger and
a direct wholly owned subsidiary of the combined company.

Upon the closing of the Merger, Unimin will be the parent holding company for the combined group and will operate under a new name that
will be selected by Unimin and Fairmount Santrol prior to the closing of the Merger. Following the Merger, the combined company will become a
publicly traded company with its common stock listed on the NYSE and registered under the Exchange Act. The combined company will be
subject to the reporting requirements of Sections 13 and 14 of the Exchange Act and will file periodic reports and proxy statements and other
information with the SEC in respect of the combined company common stock. As a result of the Merger, Fairmount Santrol will no longer be a
publicly held company. The Fairmount Board recommends that Fairmount Santrol stockholders vote (1) “FOR” the Fairmount Santrol Merger
proposal, (2) “FOR” the Fairmount Santrol compensation proposal and (3) “FOR” the Fairmount Santrol adjournment proposal.

Fairmount Santrol and Unimin encourage you to read the entire Merger Agreement carefully because it is the principal document governing
the Merger. For more information on the Merger Agreement, see the section entitled “The Merger Agreement” beginning on page 185 of this proxy
statement/prospectus.

Merger Consideration (Page 186)

As of the effective time, each share of Fairmount Santrol common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the closing of the
Merger (other than (1) shares owned by Fairmount Santrol or any wholly owned subsidiary of Fairmount Santrol (or held in the treasury of
Fairmount Santrol), (2) shares owned by Sibelco or any of its subsidiaries and (3) shares held by a stockholder who is entitled to appraisal rights
and has properly exercised and perfected (and not effectively withdrawn or lost) such stockholder’s demand for appraisal rights under the DGCL)
will be converted into the right to receive:
 

 (a) the Stock Consideration;
 

 (b) the Cash Consideration; and
 

 (c) cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any, without interest.

The Stock Consideration, the Cash Consideration and the right to receive cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any, are collectively referred to in
this proxy statement/prospectus as the Merger Consideration.

The Merger Agreement does not contain any provision that would adjust the Merger Consideration based on the fluctuations in the market
value of the Fairmount Santrol common stock. Because of this, the implied value of consideration to the Fairmount Santrol stockholders may
fluctuate between now and the closing of the Merger. However, the Merger Agreement provides that the Merger Consideration to be received by
the Fairmount Santrol stockholders will be adjusted appropriately to reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, share

Consideration” beginning on page  186 of this proxy statement/prospectus.

Recommendation of the Fairmount Board (Page 147)

After careful consideration, on December 11, 2017, the Fairmount Board (i) approved the Merger Agreement, (ii) determined that entering
into the Merger Agreement and consummating the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger, are advisable, fair to
and in the best interests of Fairmount Santrol and Fairmount Santrol stockholders and authorized and approved the execution, delivery and
performance of the Merger Agreement and (iii) directed that the Merger Agreement be submitted for consideration by Fairmount Santrol
stockholders. For factors considered by the Fairmount Board in reaching its decision to approve the Merger Agreement, see the sections entitled
“The Merger—Fairmount Santrol’s Reasons for the Merger” beginning on page 143 and “The Merger—Recommendation of the Fairmount Board”
beginning on page 147.

The Fairmount Board recommends that Fairmount Santrol stockholders vote (1) “FOR” the Fairmount Santrol Merger proposal, (2)
“FOR” the Fairmount Santrol compensation proposal and (3) “FOR” the Fairmount Santrol adjournment proposal.

Opinion of Fairmount Santrol’s Financial Advisor (Page 150)

Fairmount Santrol retained Wells Fargo Securities, LLC (“Wells Fargo Securities”) as the financial advisor to the Fairmount Board in
connection with the Merger. At the meeting of the Fairmount Board on December 11, 2017, Wells Fargo Securities rendered its oral opinion to the
Fairmount Board that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and
limitations and qualifications on the review undertaken by Wells Fargo Securities in preparing the opinion, the Merger Consideration to be received
by Fairmount Santrol stockholders, other than the Excluded Shares, in the Merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to such stockholders.
Wells Fargo Securities confirmed this oral opinion by delivering its written opinion to the Fairmount Board, dated December 11, 2017. For
purposes of Wells Fargo Securities’ opinion, the term “Excluded Shares” means any shares of Fairmount Santrol common stock held in treasury or
owned by Fairmount Santrol and its wholly owned subsidiaries and Unimin and its subsidiaries and other Dissenting Shares.

The full text of the written opinion of Wells Fargo Securities dated December 11, 2017, which sets forth the assumptions made,
procedures followed, matters considered and limitations and qualifications on the review undertaken by Wells Fargo Securities in
preparing the opinion, is attached as Annex B to this proxy statement/prospectus and is incorporated herein by reference. Fairmount
Santrol’s stockholders are urged to read the opinion in its entirety. Wells Fargo Securities’ written opinion was addressed to the Fairmount
Board (in its capacity as such) in connection with and for the purposes of its evaluation of the Merger, was directed only to the Merger
Consideration to be received by Fairmount Santrol stockholders in the Merger and did not address any other aspect of the Merger. The
opinion does not constitute a recommendation to any Fairmount Santrol stockholder as to how such stockholder should vote with respect
to the Fairmount Santrol Merger proposal or any other matter. For a description of the opinion that the Fairmount Board received from
Wells Fargo Securities, see “Opinion of Fairmount Santrol’s Financial Advisor” beginning on page 150 of this proxy statement/prospectus.

Interests of Fairmount Santrol’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger (Page 171)

Certain of the directors and executive officers of Fairmount Santrol may have interests in the Merger that are different from or in addition to
those of Fairmount Santrol stockholders generally. These interests include the treatment in the Merger of Fairmount Santrol equity compensation
awards, severance arrangements for the benefit of certain Fairmount Santrol executive officers, the expectation that some of the directors and
executive officers of Fairmount Santrol will serve as directors and executive officers of the combined company or its subsidiaries following the
closing of the Merger, the indemnification of current and former Fairmount Santrol directors and officers by the combined company and the
potential for additional bonuses.

The Fairmount Board was aware of and considered these interests when it approved the Merger Agreement, determined that entering into the
Merger Agreement and consummating the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger, are advisable, fair to and in
the best interests of Fairmount Santrol and Fairmount Santrol stockholders and authorized and approved the execution, delivery and performance of
the Merger Agreement and directed that the Merger Agreement be submitted for consideration by Fairmount Santrol stockholders. For a full
description of the ownership of Fairmount Santrol common stock by its directors and executive officers and the financial interests of Fairmount
Santrol executive officers and directors in the Merger, see the sections entitled “Interests of Fairmount Santrol’s Directors and Executive Officers in
the Merger” and “Advisory Vote on Merger-Related Compensation for Fairmount Santrol’s Named Executive Officers” beginning on page 171 and

“FOR” the Fairmount Santrol Merger proposal. As of April 2, 2018, approximately 26.4% of the outstanding shares of Fairmount Santrol common
stock were beneficially owned by the Supporting Stockholders.

merger (other than the Merger Agreement and the Mergers), consolidation, combination, material business transaction, sale of assets,

affect the closing of the Mergers.

Company Recommendation Change and Company Superior Proposals (Page 197)

The Fairmount Board recommends that Fairmount Santrol stockholders vote “FOR” the Fairmount Santrol Merger proposal.

The Merger Agreement provides that, subject to the exceptions described below, neither the Fairmount Board nor any committee thereof may
 

 
(i) withdraw, qualify or modify, or propose publicly to withdraw, qualify or modify, or fail to make, in each case in a manner adverse to

Unimin, the approval or recommendation by the Fairmount Board or such committee of the Merger or the Merger Agreement,
 

 
(ii) approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend, any Company Alternative Transaction (any action in clause

(i) or this clause (ii) being referred to as a “Company Recommendation Change”), or
 

 
(iii) cause Fairmount Santrol or any of its affiliates to enter into any letter of intent, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement or other

agreement related to any Company Alternative Transaction.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that, prior to obtaining Fairmount Santrol stockholder approval, the Fairmount Board determines
in good faith, after it has received a Company Superior Proposal (as defined under “The Merger Agreement—Company Recommendation Change
and Company Superior Proposals”), and after consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation, that the
failure to do so would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law, the Fairmount Board may (subject to
compliance with the terms of the Merger Agreement) effect a Company Recommendation Change and/or cause Fairmount Santrol to terminate the
Merger Agreement and concurrently with such termination enter into a definitive agreement providing for such Company Superior Proposal.

In addition, notwithstanding anything in the Merger Agreement to the contrary, at any time prior to obtaining Fairmount Santrol stockholder
approval, if the Fairmount Board determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized
reputation) that the failure to do so would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law, the Fairmount
Board may effect a Company Recommendation Change in response to any effect that materially affects (A) the business, financial condition or
results of operations of Fairmount Santrol and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (B) the Fairmount Santrol stockholders (including the benefits
of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement to Fairmount Santrol or the Fairmount Santrol stockholders), in either case that (x) is
first occurring after December 11, 2017, (y) does not involve or relate to a proposal the consummation of which would constitute a Company
Alternative Transaction and (z) is not known and was not reasonably foreseeable to the Fairmount Board as of December 11, 2017.

become final and non-appealable;

required by the Merger Agreement; or

 

 

•  at any time, in the event that (i) all of the conditions to each party’s obligation to effect the Merger, and all of the conditions to the

Refinancing of Indebtedness of Fairmount Santrol and Unimin (Page 161)

In connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement, Unimin has received a debt commitment letter from Barclays Bank PLC, BNP
Paribas and BNP Paribas Securities Corp. (Barclays Bank PLC and BNP Paribas, collectively, the “lenders”), pursuant to which the lenders have
committed to provide a seven-year senior secured term loan (the “term loan”) in the amount of $1.65 billion and a five-year senior secured
revolving credit facility (the “revolving credit facility” and, together with the term loan, the “facilities”) in the amount of $200 million. The
proceeds of the term loan would be used to repay debt of Fairmount Santrol, to repay debt of Unimin (including debt incurred to fund the Cash
Redemption) and to pay the Cash Consideration and transaction costs for the Merger.

Obligations to fund under the debt commitment letter are subject to certain conditions, including the closing of the Merger, the accuracy of
certain representations and warranties, the absence of a material adverse effect on Fairmount Santrol, the repayment of certain debt of Unimin and
Fairmount Santrol, receipt of audited and unaudited financial statements and certain pro forma information, delivery of a solvency certificate by
Unimin’s chief financial officer, payment of all fees required to be paid on the closing date of the facilities and execution of requisite credit facility
and collateral documentation and closing documentation.

Stockholders Agreement (Page 321)

Concurrently with the closing of the Merger, Unimin, Sibelco and certain other individuals who will be combined company stockholders will
enter into a Stockholders Agreement (the “Stockholders Agreement”). The Stockholders Agreement, which will become effective as of the closing
of the Merger, will contain various provisions relating to, among other things, representation on the Combined Company Board, certain
transactions involving Sibelco requiring approval of Fairmount-nominated independent directors, preemptive rights, certain limitations on the

Board of Directors. From the effective time until the day following the third annual meeting of combined company stockholders following
the effective time, Sibelco and the other combined company stockholders who are parties to the Stockholders Agreement will vote all voting shares
of combined company stock owned by them, and take all other necessary actions within his, her or its control, and the combined company and its
directors will take all necessary actions within its and their control:
 

 •  to ensure that the number of directors constituting the Combined Company Board is fixed and remains at 11 directors;
 

 
•  prior to the Trigger Date (as defined below), to nominate and vote to elect the Unimin-nominated directors and the Fairmount-

nominated directors as described above (under “—Board of Directors of the Combined Company Following the Merger”) in accordance
with the Merger Agreement; and

 

 •  from and after the Trigger Date,

times equal to the product of (x) Sibelco’s percentage ownership of outstanding shares of combined company common stock
and (y) the total number of directors authorized to serve on the Combined Company Board (rounded down to the nearest whole
number); and

than half of the total Combined Company Board.

independent directors, Sibelco will not, and will cause its controlled affiliates not to, transfer or agree to transfer any combined

polymer solutions industries (nepheline syenite flour, microcrystalline silica flour and ground kaolin). Each Distribution Agreement will continue
for a term of 20 years, unless terminated earlier in accordance with its terms, and will automatically terminate without any further action by the
combined company or Sibelco if Sibelco ceases to own, directly or indirectly, more than 50% of the issued and outstanding shares of the combined
company common stock. For additional information on the Distribution Agreements, see the

Agency Agreements (Page 328)

At the closing of the Merger, the combined company and Sibelco will enter into various exclusive agency agreements (the “Agency
Agreements”), pursuant to which each party will provide exclusive agency services with respect to certain of the other party’s products sold into
defined industries and geographic areas. In particular, the combined company will be the exclusive sales agent in North America and Mexico with
respect to certain of Sibelco’s products for the casting steel and HT alloys, display glass, foundry, feed amendments, tiles and engobes and welding
(electronics) industries. Sibelco will be the exclusive sales agent in North America and Mexico with respect to the combined company’s products
for the coating and polymers industries and throughout the world with respect to certain of the combined company’s products. Each Agency
Agreement will continue for a term of 20 years, unless terminated earlier in accordance with its terms, and will automatically terminate without any
further action by any party if Sibelco ceases to own, directly or indirectly, more than 50% of the issued and outstanding shares of the combined
company common stock. For additional information on the Agency Agreements, see the section entitled “Certain Relationships and Related Party
Transactions—Relationship with Sibelco—Agency Agreements” beginning on page 328 of this proxy statement/prospectus.

Non-Compete Agreement (Page 328)

pursuant to which the combined company and Sibelco will agree to refrain from selling, marketing, distributing or producing certain products
within defined markets and territories and Sibelco will be provided a right of first offer with respect to certain acquisitions and investment
opportunities of the combined company. The Non-Compete Agreement will automatically terminate when Sibelco, together with its controlled
affiliates, ceases to own more than 50% of the issued and outstanding shares of the combined company common stock. For additional information
on the Non-Compete Agreement, see the section entitled “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions—Relationship with
Sibelco—Non-Compete Agreement” beginning on page  328 of this proxy statement/prospectus.

Tax Matters Agreement (Page 320)

Prior to the effective time of the HPQ Carveout, Unimin, Sibelco and HPQ Co will enter into the Tax Matters Agreement governing their
respective rights, responsibilities and obligations relating to tax liabilities, the filing of tax returns, the control of tax contests and other tax matters.

Under the Tax Matters Agreement, the combined company and HPQ Co (and their affiliates) will be responsible for income taxes required to
be reported on their respective separate and group tax returns; however, HPQ Co will be responsible for any unpaid income taxes (as of the date of
the HPQ Redemption) attributable to the HPQ business prior to the date of the HPQ Carveout. HPQ Co will be responsible for any unpaid non-
income taxes (as of the date of the HPQ Redemption) attributable to the HPQ business (whether arising prior to the HPQ Carveout or not) and the
combined company will be responsible for all other non-income taxes. HPQ Co and the combined company will equally bear any transfer taxes
imposed on the HPQ Carveout. Rights to refunds in respect of taxes will be allocated in the same manner as the responsibility for tax liabilities.

The Tax Matters Agreement will generally allocate responsibility for filing tax returns to the party who is responsible for doing so under law,
and will give the right to control tax contests and audits to the party or parties who will be allocated responsibility for any such taxes under the Tax
Matters Agreement.

If the HPQ Carveout does not qualify for tax-free status under the Code, the combined company and HPQ Co will be responsible under law
for tax resulting from the failure of the HPQ Carveout to qualify for such status. However, the combined company, HPQ Co or Sibelco may be
responsible for indemnifying the other parties for any such taxes together with associated costs and damages (a “Tax Related Loss”) depending on
the circumstances. In particular, either the combined company, Sibelco or HPQ Co, as applicable, will be responsible

for indemnifying the other parties if a Tax Related Loss occurs as a result of certain actions that could adversely affect the tax-free status of the
HPQ Carveout, including certain acts relating to sales or dispositions of HPQ Co or combined company stock or assets, alterations to HPQ Co or
combined company voting shares, certain redemptions and breaches of certain representations relating to the HPQ Carveout; provided, however,
that the combined company will only be responsible for paying an indemnity for any Tax Related Losses if the relevant actions that would have
given rise to the combined company’s indemnity obligation were approved by the majority of the combined company’s directors that were not
appointed by Sibelco. Sibelco will be responsible for indemnifying the combined company in respect of all other Tax Related Losses.

Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Mergers to Holders of Fairmount Santrol Shares of Common Stock (Page 178)

Fairmount Santrol expects to, and as a condition precedent to completing the Merger expects to, receive an opinion from counsel to the effect
that the Mergers, taken together as an integrated transaction, will qualify as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

Assuming the Mergers qualify as a reorganization, a U.S. holder exchanging its shares of Fairmount Santrol common stock for the Merger
Consideration pursuant to the Merger Agreement will generally recognize gain (but not loss) in an amount equal to the lesser of (i) the excess of
such U.S. holder’s “amount realized” in the transaction (i.e., the fair market value of the shares of combined company common stock at the
effective time plus the amount of cash (including cash received in lieu of fractional shares, if any) received by such U.S. holder in exchange for its
shares of Fairmount Santrol common stock in the Merger) over such U.S. holder’s tax basis in its surrendered shares of Fairmount Santrol common
stock and (ii) the amount of cash (including cash received in lieu of fractional shares, if any) received by such U.S. holder in exchange for its shares
of Fairmount Santrol common stock in the Merger.

Any gain recognized upon the exchange will generally be capital gain, and will be long-term capital gain if, as of the effective time, the U.S.
holder’s holding period with respect to its surrendered shares of Fairmount Santrol common stock exceeds one year.

Assuming the Mergers qualify as a reorganization, a non-U.S. holder exchanging its shares of Fairmount Santrol common stock for the
Merger Consideration pursuant to the Merger Agreement generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax in respect of the Mergers, unless a
non-U.S. holder is subject to FIRPTA Tax (as defined herein).

For definitions of “U.S. holder” and “non-U.S. holder” and a more detailed discussion of the material United States federal income tax
consequences of the Mergers to U.S. holders and non-U.S. holders (including the potential application of FIRPTA), see the section entitled
“Material United States Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Transaction” beginning on page 178 of this proxy statement/prospectus.

The U.S. federal income tax consequences described above may not apply to all holders of Fairmount Santrol common stock. A holder’s tax
consequences will depend on its individual situation. Accordingly, each holder is urged to consult its tax advisors for a full understanding of the
particular tax consequences of the Merger to such holder.

Accounting Treatment (Page 167)

The Merger will be accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic
805, Business Combinations (“ASC 805”). ASC 805 requires one of the combining entities to be designated as the accounting acquirer for
accounting purposes. Unimin will be treated as the acquiring entity for accounting purposes. In identifying Unimin as the acquiring entity for
accounting purposes, Unimin took into account the voting rights of all equity instruments, the intended corporate

governance structure of the combined company and the size of each of the companies. In assessing the size of each of the companies, Unimin
evaluated various metrics, including, but not limited to, assets, revenue, operating income, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and enterprise value. No
single factor was the sole determinant in the overall conclusion that Unimin is the acquirer for accounting purposes, but all factors were considered
in arriving at such conclusion.

Appraisal Rights of Fairmount Santrol Stockholders (Page 361)

Under the DGCL, subject to the closing of the Merger, record holders of Fairmount Santrol common stock who do not vote in favor of the
Fairmount Santrol Merger proposal and who otherwise properly exercise and perfect their appraisal rights in accordance with Section 262 will be
entitled to seek appraisal for, and obtain payment in cash for the judicially determined fair value of, their shares of Fairmount Santrol common
stock, in lieu of receiving the Merger Consideration. The “fair value” could be higher or lower than, or the same as, the Merger Consideration.
Fairmount Santrol stockholders who wish to exercise the right to seek an appraisal of their shares must so advise Fairmount Santrol by submitting a
written demand for appraisal in the form described in this proxy statement/prospectus prior to the vote on the approval of the Fairmount Santrol
Merger proposal at the special meeting and must otherwise follow the procedures prescribed by Section 262. A person having a beneficial interest
in shares of Fairmount Santrol common stock held of record in the name of another person, such as a nominee or intermediary, must act promptly
to cause the record holder to follow the steps summarized in this proxy statement/prospectus in a timely manner to perfect appraisal rights.

The full text of Section 262 is attached as Annex E to this proxy statement/prospectus. Fairmount Santrol stockholders are encouraged to read
these provisions carefully and in their entirety. Moreover, due to the complexity of the procedures for exercising and perfecting the right to seek
appraisal, Fairmount Santrol stockholders who are considering exercising and perfecting that right are encouraged to seek the advice of legal
counsel. Failure to strictly comply with these provisions may result in a waiver of, or the inability to exercise, appraisal rights. For more
information regarding appraisal rights, see the section entitled “Appraisal Rights of Fairmount Santrol Stockholders” beginning on page  361 of this
proxy statement/prospectus.

Regulatory Approvals Required for the Merger (Page 165)

U.S. Antitrust

Under the HSR Act, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”), the Merger
cannot be closed until, among other things, notifications have been filed and certain information has been furnished to the FTC and the Antitrust
Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (the “Antitrust Division”) and specified waiting period requirements have been satisfied. On January 5,
2018 and January 10, 2018, Fairmount Santrol and Unimin each, respectively, filed a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act (the
“HSR Notification”) with the FTC and the Antitrust Division. On March 13, 2018, the FTC granted early termination of the waiting period under
the HSR Act with respect to the Merger, effective as of March 13, 2018.

Other Regulatory Approvals

The obligation of each of Fairmount Santrol and Unimin to effect the Merger is also subject to obtaining regulatory approval in Mexico. On
March 16, 2018, Fairmount Santrol and Unimin submitted an application for Mexican Antitrust Commission (Comisión Federal de Competencia
Económica) approval for the Merger and the parties are in the process of obtaining the necessary regulatory clearances in Mexico.

Each of the parties to the Merger Agreement has agreed to use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary,
proper or advisable under applicable antitrust laws and regulations, including the HSR Act and other applicable laws, to complete and effect the
Merger as soon as possible; provided, however, that the Merger Agreement does not require Fairmount Santrol or Unimin to agree to effect a
Material Divestiture in order to consummate the Merger.

Summary Historical Consolidated Financial and Operating Data of Unimin

The following tables set forth Unimin’s summary historical consolidated financial data as of and for the periods presented. The summary
historical consolidated financial information of Unimin as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 and for the three years ended December 31, 2017 have
been derived from Unimin’s audited historical consolidated financial statements, copies of which are attached as Annex F to this proxy
statement/prospectus. You should read the following summary consolidated financial data in conjunction with “Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of Unimin” and Unimin’s consolidated financial statements and related notes, copies of
which are attached as Annex F to this proxy statement/prospectus. Historical results are not necessarily indicative of future results of Unimin or the
combined company. Unimin’s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

Prior to the closing of the Merger, Unimin will effect an approximately 89 for 1 stock split of its common stock. As the stock split will occur
following the effectiveness of the registration statement of which this proxy statement/prospectus is a part, Unimin’s historical share information
included in this proxy statement/prospectus has not been adjusted to give retrospective effect to the stock split. The exact stock split will be

(1) EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures. For a definition of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA

and a reconciliation to net income, see “—Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA (each as defined herein) are supplemental non-GAAP financial measures that are used by management and
certain external users of Unimin’s financial statements in evaluating its operating performance. Unimin defines EBITDA as net income before
interest expense, income tax expense (benefit) and depreciation, depletion and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA before
non-cash impairment of assets and certain non-operational income and expenses including restructuring charges.

Management of Unimin believes EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are useful because they allow Unimin management to more effectively
evaluate its normalized operations from period to period as well as provide an indication of cash flow generation from operations before investing
or financing activities. Accordingly, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not take into consideration Unimin’s financing methods, capital structure
or capital expenditure needs. Adjusted EBITDA excludes certain non-operational income and/or costs, the removal of which improves
comparability of operating results across reporting periods. However, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have limitations as analytical tools and
should not be considered as alternatives to, or more meaningful

than, net income as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP as indicators of Unimin’s operating performance. Certain items excluded from
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are significant components in understanding and assessing a company’s financial performance, such as a
company’s cost of capital and tax structure, as well as the historic costs of depreciable assets, none of which are components of EBITDA or
Adjusted EBITDA.

Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow for management’s discretionary use, as it does not consider
certain cash requirements such as interest payments, tax payments and debt service requirements. Adjusted EBITDA contains certain other
limitations, including the failure to reflect Unimin’s cash expenditures, cash requirements for working capital needs and cash costs to replace assets
being depreciated and amortized, and excludes certain non-operational charges. Management compensates for these limitations by relying primarily
on Unimin’s U.S. GAAP results (and IFRS results) and by using Adjusted EBITDA only as a supplement.

Although Unimin attempts to determine EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in a manner that is consistent with other companies in its industry,
Unimin’s computation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies due to
potential inconsistencies in the methods of calculation. Unimin believes that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are widely followed measures of
operating performance.

The following table sets forth a reconciliation of net income (loss), the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure, to EBITDA
and Adjusted EBITDA:

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are supplemental non-GAAP financial measures that are used by management and certain external users of
Fairmount Santrol’s financial statements in evaluating its operating performance.

Management of Fairmount Santrol believes EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are useful because they allow Fairmount Santrol to more
effectively evaluate its operations from period to period without regard to its financing methods or capital structure. EBITDA and Adjusted
EBITDA have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered as alternatives to, or more meaningful than, net income as determined in
accordance with U.S. GAAP as indicators of Fairmount Santrol’s operating performance. Certain items excluded from EBITDA and Adjusted
EBITDA are significant components in understanding and assessing a company’s financial performance, such as a company’s cost of capital and
tax structure, as well as the historic costs of depreciable assets, none of which are components of EBITDA or Adjusted EBITDA. Although
Fairmount Santrol attempts to determine EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in a manner that is consistent with other companies in its industry,
Fairmount Santrol’s computations of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other
companies. Fairmount Santrol believes that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are widely followed measures of operating performance.

Adjusted EBITDA is presented as a performance measure because certain charges or expenses may occur in a particular period and are not
indicative of true operating performance. For this reason, Fairmount Santrol management believes Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors as well.

The following table sets forth a reconciliation of net income, the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure, to EBITDA and
Adjusted EBITDA:

Summary Historical and Pro Forma Earnings Per Share Information

The following table summarizes unaudited per share information on a historical basis for Unimin and Fairmount Santrol, on an unaudited pro
forma combined basis for Unimin and Fairmount Santrol reflecting the Merger and related transactions and adjustments and on an unaudited
equivalent pro forma basis for Fairmount Santrol. The following information should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial
statements and accompanying notes of Unimin, copies of which are attached as Annex F to this proxy statement/prospectus, and of Fairmount
Santrol, which are incorporated by reference in this proxy statement/prospectus, as well as the unaudited pro forma combined financial information
beginning on page 100 of this proxy statement/prospectus. The unaudited pro forma combined financial information is presented for illustrative
purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of what the operating results or financial position would have been if the Merger and related
transactions had been completed as of the beginning of the period presented, nor is it necessarily indicative of the future operating results or
financial position of the combined company. The historical earnings per share, dividends per share and book value per share of Unimin and
Fairmount Santrol shown in the table below are derived from their audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2017.

The historical book value per share is computed by dividing total shareholders’ equity by the number of shares outstanding at the end of the
period, excluding any shares held in treasury. The unaudited pro forma combined earnings per share is computed by dividing the pro forma
earnings per share by the pro forma weighted-average number of shares outstanding after giving effect to the Merger. The unaudited pro forma
combined book value per share is computed by dividing total pro forma shareholders’ equity by the pro forma number of shares outstanding at the
end of the period. The unaudited pro forma combined per share information is presented as if the Merger and related transactions and adjustments
occurred as of the date of the historical financial statements. The per share information on an unaudited equivalent pro forma basis for Fairmount
Santrol is computed by multiplying the unaudited pro forma combined data (basic and diluted earnings per share, cash dividend per share and book
value per share) by the Exchange Ratio of 0.20.

Prior to the closing of the Merger, Unimin will effect an approximately 89 for 1 stock split of its common stock. As the stock split will occur
following the effectiveness of the registration statement of which this proxy statement/prospectus is a part, Unimin’s historical share information
included in this proxy statement/prospectus has not been adjusted to give retrospective effect to the stock split. The exact stock split will be
determined based on the actual number of Fairmount Santrol shares outstanding or reserved for issuance immediately prior to the closing of the
Merger.

Risks Related to Unimin’s Business

Demand fluctuates for the minerals Unimin produces, which could adversely affect Unimin’s results of operations.

Demand in the industries served by Unimin’s customers is influenced by many factors, including the following:
 

 •  demand for oil, natural gas and petroleum products;
 

 •  fluctuations in energy, fuel, oil and natural gas prices and the availability of such fuels;

•  changes in laws and regulations (or the interpretation thereof) related to the mining and hydraulic fracturing industries, silica dust exposure

or the environment;

 •  the availability of substitute products at lower costs or substitute minerals that provide superior functionality at similar or better economics;
 

 •  increases in costs of labor and labor strikes; and
 

 •  war, riots, insurrection, civil disturbance and criminal activities, including activities of drug cartels.

Unimin cannot predict or control the factors that affect demand for its products. Negative developments in the above factors, among others, could
cause the demand for commercial silica or other minerals to decline, which could adversely affect Unimin’s business, financial condition, results of
operations, cash flows and prospects.

Unimin’s business and financial performance depend in part on the level of activity in the oil and gas industries.

Approximately 45% of Unimin’s revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 were derived from sales to companies in the oil and gas
industries. As a result, Unimin’s operations are dependent, in part, on the levels of activity in oil and gas exploration, development and production. More
specifically, the demand for the proppants Unimin produces is closely related to the number of oil and gas wells completed in geological formations
where sand-based proppants are used in hydraulic fracturing activities. These activity levels are affected by both short- and long-term trends in oil and
gas prices, among other factors.

Industry conditions that impact the activity levels of oil and natural gas producers are influenced by numerous factors over which Unimin has no
control, including:
 

 
•  governmental regulations, including the policies of governments regarding the exploration for and production and development of their oil

and natural gas reserves;
 

 •  global weather conditions and natural disasters;
 

 •  worldwide political, military and economic conditions;
 

 •  the cost of producing and delivering oil and natural gas;
 

 •  commodity prices;
 

 •  development of alternative energy sources;
 

 •  changes in demand for proppants; and
 

 •  the ability of the oil and gas industry to comply with OSHA standards for respirable dust.

In recent years, oil and gas prices and, therefore, the level of exploration, development and production activity, have experienced significant
fluctuations. Worldwide economic, political and military events, including war, terrorist activity, events in the Middle East and initiatives by the
Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (“OPEC”) and other large non-OPEC producers have contributed, and are likely to continue to
contribute, to price and volume volatility. Additionally, warmer than normal winters in North America and other weather patterns may adversely impact
the short-term demand for natural gas and, therefore, demand for Unimin’s products. Reduction in demand for natural gas to generate electricity could
also adversely impact the demand for frac sand.

Any significant reduction in oil and natural gas prices would generally depress the level of oil and natural gas exploration, development,
production and well completion activity, which could result in a corresponding decline in the demand for the frac sand Unimin produces. Such a decline
could result in Unimin selling fewer tons of frac sand at lower prices or selling lower priced products, which would have a material adverse effect on
Unimin’s business, results of operations and financial condition. When demand for frac sand increases, there may not be a corresponding increase in the
prices for Unimin’s products or Unimin’s customers may not switch back

to higher priced products, which could have a material adverse effect on Unimin’s results of operations and financial condition. The commercial
development of economically-viable alternative energy sources could have a similar effect. In addition, the price Unimin receives for sales of its frac
sand may be impacted by short-term fluctuations in the demand for frac sand, and any negative fluctuations in this demand could have an adverse effect
on Unimin’s results of operations and cash flows.

Any future decreases in the rate at which oil and natural gas reserves are discovered or developed, whether due to the passage of legislation,
increased governmental regulation, limitations or prohibitions on exploration and drilling activity, including hydraulic fracturing, or other factors, could
have a material adverse effect on Unimin’s business and financial condition, even in a stronger oil and natural gas price environment.

Unimin’s operations are subject to the seasonal and/or cyclical nature of its customers’ businesses, which could adversely affect Unimin’s
results of operations.

The substantial majority of Unimin’s sales are to customers in industries that have historically been seasonal, such as glassmaking, construction
and foundry, and/or cyclical, such as the oil and natural gas industry. During periods of economic slowdown, such customers often reduce their
production rates and also reduce capital expenditures and defer or cancel pending projects. Such developments occur even among customers that are not
experiencing financial difficulties.

Demand for industrial minerals is driven to a large extent by the construction and automotive industries. For example, demand for flat glass
depends on the automotive and commercial and residential construction and remodeling industries. Demand for commercial silica used to manufacture
building products is driven primarily by demand in the construction industry. Demand for foundry silica substantially depends on the rate of automobile,
light truck and heavy equipment production as well as construction. Other factors influencing the demand for industrial minerals include (i) the
substitution of plastic or other materials for glass, (ii) competition from offshore producers of glass products, (iii) changes in demand for Unimin’s
products due to technological innovations and (iv) prices, availability and other factors relating to Unimin’s products.

Unimin cannot predict or control the factors that affect demand for its products. Negative developments in the above factors, among others, could
cause the demand for industrial and recreational sand to decline, which could adversely affect Unimin’s business, financial condition, results of
operations, cash flows and prospects.

In addition, as transportation costs represent one of the largest costs for Unimin’s customers, if, in response to economic pressures, such customers
choose to move their production offshore, the increased logistics costs could reduce demand for Unimin’s products. Continued weakness in the
industries Unimin serves has had, and may in the future have, an adverse effect on sales of Unimin’s products and Unimin’s results of operations. A
continued or renewed economic downturn in one or more of the industries or geographic regions that Unimin serves, or in the worldwide economy,
could cause actual results of operations to differ materially from historical and expected results.

A lack of dependable or available transportation services or infrastructure could have a material adverse effect on Unimin’s business.

Unimin contracts with rail, truck, ship and barge services to move materials from its mines to its production facilities and to move its products on
to its customers. Transportation and related costs, including, among other things, freight charges, fuel surcharges, transloading fees, switching fees,
railcar lease costs, demurrage costs and storage fees, represent the most significant variable costs that Unimin passes on to its customers. Any significant
delays, disruptions or the non-availability of transportation systems and services caused by, among other things, labor disputes, strikes, lock-outs, lack of
maintenance, human error or malfeasance, accidents, transportation delays, mechanical difficulties, shortages of railcars, trucks, ships or barges, train
derailments, bottlenecks, adverse weather conditions, earthquakes, storms, flooding, drought, other natural disasters or environmental events, increased
railcar congestion or other events could have a material adverse effect on Unimin’s business. In addition, these events could temporarily impair
Unimin’s ability to supply its customers through its logistics network of rail-based terminals or, if Unimin’s customers are not using Unimin’s rail
transportation services, the ability of its customers to take delivery and, in certain circumstances, constitute a force majeure event under

Unimin’s customer contracts, permitting customers to suspend taking delivery of and paying for Unimin’s products. As Unimin continues to expand its
production, the company will need increased investment in transportation infrastructure, including most significantly, additional terminals and railcars.

Unimin is dependent on rail transportation to transport its products.

In 2017, approximately 57% of Unimin’s volume was transported by rail. Therefore, Unimin’s business is highly dependent on rail transportation.
A significant disruption of the rail transportation services utilized by Unimin or its customers could cause Unimin’s business and results of operations to
be materially adversely affected.

Recent years have seen an increase in rail traffic congestion throughout the U.S. primarily due to overall growth in railroad volumes and a lag in
response time from the railroads to adjust for increased demands. From time to time, periodic high demand and unusually adverse weather conditions
may cause rail congestion resulting in rail delays and rail logistical problems. Unimin has experienced rail transportation delays in the past. Future
periods of congestion or rail transportation shortage may affect Unimin’s ability to supply its products to its customers in a timely or cost-effective
manner, particularly where Unimin’s facilities are not located in close proximity to customer locations.

The availability of railcars can also affect Unimin’s ability to transport its products. In addition to the products Unimin supplies, railcars can be
used to transport many different types of products across various industries. If railcar owners sell or lease railcars to Unimin’s competitors or to
companies operating in other industries, Unimin may not have enough railcars to transport its products. Alternatively, if Unimin were to experience a
decline in sales, it could result in railcar over-capacity, which would lead to railcar storage fees while, at the same time, Unimin would continue to incur
lease costs for those railcars in storage.

Unimin invests significantly in maintaining and upgrading its railcar fleet in order to meet its customers’ needs and to compete effectively with
alternative suppliers. A failure to properly anticipate its customers rail transportation needs or to effectively expend capital could result in Unimin losing
business to its competitors.

In many cases, Unimin relies upon third parties to maintain the rail lines from its facilities to the national rail network, and any failure on their part
to maintain the lines could impede Unimin’s delivery of products, impose additional costs on Unimin and could have a material adverse effect on its
business, results of operations and financial condition.

Unimin depends on trucking to transport a significant portion of its products, particularly in areas of increasing demand for its products. A
shortage of available truck drivers and difficulty in truck driver recruitment and retention may have a materially adverse effect on Unimin’s
business.

In addition to its rail network, Unimin depends on trucking services, in particular in the areas in which its customers’ activity has experienced
rapid increase resulting in spikes in demand for transportation. For example, Unimin recently has been experiencing a significant ramp up in demand
from the Permian Basin in West Texas. As a result, there is high demand for qualified truck drivers to supply goods necessary for the proliferation of
activity in West Texas at a time when unemployment in the region is low, putting significant pressure on the supply of available qualified truck drivers.
Any delay or inability to secure the personnel and services necessary for Unimin to deliver its products to customers in high activity areas in a timely
and cost-effective manner could cause customers to use a competitor and could have a material adverse effect on Unimin’s business, results of
operations and financial condition.

The U.S. truckload transportation industry as a whole periodically experiences a shortage of qualified drivers, sometimes during periods of
economic expansion in which alternative employment opportunities are more plentiful and freight demand increases, or alternatively during periods of
economic downturns, in which unemployment benefits might be extended and financing may be limited for independent contractors who seek to
purchase equipment or for students who seek financial aid for driving school. Unimin’s independent contractors are responsible for paying for their own
equipment, fuel and other operating costs, and significant increases in these costs could cause them to seek higher compensation from Unimin or seek
other opportunities within or outside the trucking industry.

Table of Contents

The trucking industry suffers from a high driver turnover rate. If Unimin is unable to attract qualified independent contractors, it could be forced
to, among other things, limit its growth, decrease the number of its tractors in service, adjust its independent contractor compensation, or pay higher
rates to third-party truckload carriers, which could adversely affect Unimin’s profitability and results of operations if not offset by a corresponding
increase in customer rates.

Unimin is subject to the risks of owning and operating the Winchester & Western railroad.

Unimin owns and operates the Winchester & Western railroad, a private railroad in New Jersey, West Virginia, Virginia and Maryland. Unimin
uses the Winchester & Western railroad to move minerals from its Dividing Creek and Gore facilities to customers via access to the Norfolk Southern
and CSX railroads. Operating a railroad is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including potential public safety concerns, claims for personal
injury and property damage, accidents involving trespassers on the railway, railroad crossing accidents, failure of information technology, severe
weather conditions, access to a limited number of suppliers of locomotives and railway equipment, and significant government regulation of health,
safety, labor, environmental and other matters. In addition, due to the nature of the railroad business, Unimin’s railroad operations are subject to
extensive federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other things, emissions to the air, discharges to waters and, to
the extent Unimin utilizes the railroad to transport hazardous waste, risks in the handling, storage, transportation and disposal of waste and other
materials. Any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on Unimin’s business.

Increasing logistics and transportation costs could reduce Unimin’s revenues by causing its customers to reduce production or by impairing its
ability to deliver products to its customers.

Transportation, handling and related costs, including freight charges, fuel surcharges, transloading fees, switching fees, railcar lease costs,
demurrage costs and storage fees, tend to be a significant component of Unimin’s total delivered cost of sales. In many instances, transportation costs
can represent up to 70% of the delivered cost of Unimin’s products. As a result, the cost of transportation is a critical factor in a customer’s purchasing
decision. The high relative cost of transportation related expense tends to favor manufacturers located in close proximity to the customer. Increased costs
that cannot be passed on to customers could impair Unimin’s ability to deliver products economically to customers or to expand the company’s customer
base. In addition, Unimin’s competitors may be able to deliver products to Unimin’s customers with lower transportation costs, which, in certain cases,
may result in loss of business for Unimin.

Unimin transports significant volumes of minerals across long distances and international borders. Any increases in Unimin’s logistics costs, as a
result of increases in the price of oil or otherwise, would increase the company’s costs and the final prices of Unimin’s products to its customers. In
addition, any increases in customs or tariffs, as a result of changes to existing trade agreements between countries or otherwise, could increase Unimin’s
costs or the final cost of its products to its customers or decrease Unimin’s margins. Such increases could harm Unimin’s competitive position and could
have a material adverse effect on its business.

Geographic shifts in demand could negatively affect Unimin’s business.

A significant portion of Unimin’s distribution infrastructure is located in or near oil and gas producing areas. However, a significant portion of
Unimin’s frac sand processing facilities are located significant distances from its customers. Similarly, in the Industrial segment, a portion of Unimin’s
sales benefit from having Unimin facilities in close proximity to customer locations. A shift in demand away from areas where Unimin has significant
distribution infrastructure or relocation of its customers’ businesses to areas farther from its facilities or distribution infrastructure could increase
Unimin’s costs for delivering its products or result in an inability of Unimin to supply certain customers, which in turn could have a material adverse
effect on Unimin’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

Unimin’s business could be adversely affected by strikes or work stoppages by railroad workers, truckers and port workers.

There has been labor unrest, including strikes and work stoppages, among workers at various transportation providers and in industries affecting
the transportation industry. Unimin could lose business due to any

Table of Contents

significant work stoppage or slowdown and, if labor unrest results in increased rates for transportation providers such as truckers or railroad workers,
Unimin may not be able to pass these cost increases on to its customers. In the past, there have been strikes involving railroad workers. Future strikes by
railroad workers in the United States, Canada or anywhere else where Unimin’s customers’ freight travels by railroad would impact Unimin’s
operations. Any significant work stoppage, slowdown or other disruption involving railroads, truckers, ports or draymen could adversely affect Unimin’s
business and results of operations.

Unimin’s operations are dependent on its rights and ability to mine its properties and on having renewed or received the required permits and
approvals from governmental authorities and other third parties.

Unimin holds numerous governmental, environmental, mining and other permits, water rights and approvals authorizing operations at each of its
facilities. A decision by a governmental agency or other third party to deny or delay issuing a new or renewed permit or approval, or to revoke or
substantially modify an existing permit or approval, could have a material adverse effect on Unimin’s ability to continue operations at the affected
facility. Furthermore, federal, state and local governments could impose a moratorium on mining operations in certain areas. Expansion of Unimin’s
existing operations is also predicated on securing the necessary environmental or other permits, and water rights or approvals, which Unimin may not
receive in a timely manner or at all. In addition, certain of Unimin’s facilities are located near existing and proposed third-party industrial operations,
which could affect Unimin’s ability to fully extract, or the manner in which it extracts, the mineral reserves to which it has mining rights.

Title to, and the area of, mineral properties and water rights may also be disputed. Mineral properties sometimes contain claims or transfer
histories that examiners cannot verify. A successful claim that Unimin does not have title to one or more of its properties or lacks appropriate water
rights could cause Unimin to lose any rights to explore, develop and extract any minerals on that property, without compensation for its prior
expenditures relating to such property. Unimin’s business may suffer a material adverse effect in the event one or more of its properties are determined
to have title deficiencies.

In some instances, Unimin has received access rights or easements from third parties, which allow for a more efficient operation than would exist
without the access or easement. A third party could take action to suspend the access or easement, and any such action could be materially adverse to
Unimin’s results of operations or financial condition.

Changes in product mix can have an adverse effect on Unimin’s gross margins and could cause Unimin’s results of operations to fluctuate.

Unimin produces many different products from the minerals it extracts. Customers in the same industry may use different products for similar
purposes, some of which may require more processing than others and subsequently may be more expensive for Unimin to produce. The costs Unimin
experiences at its manufacturing locations depend significantly on the mix of products produced, not all of which Unimin may be able to pass along to
its customers, which can reduce Unimin’s margins and which may fluctuate from period to period for a number of reasons. Furthermore, if one or more
industries that Unimin supplies were to experience a significant shift in the products it uses, Unimin could be forced to undertake significant
expenditures to upgrade its operations to supply these products or to acquire or build additional production capacity in order to meet this demand to the
extent Unimin’s current operations cannot be retrofitted to supply such demand.

Unimin may be adversely affected by decreased or shifts in demand for frac sand or the development of either effective alternative proppants
or new processes to replace hydraulic fracturing.

Frac sand and coated sand are proppants used in the completion and re-completion of oil and natural gas wells through the process of hydraulic
fracturing. Frac sand is the most commonly used proppant and is less expensive than ceramic proppant, which is also used in hydraulic fracturing to
stimulate and maintain oil and natural gas production. A significant shift in demand from sand-based proppants to other proppants, such as ceramic
proppants, or a shift in demand from higher-margin sand-based proppants to lower-margin sand-based proppants, could have a material adverse effect on
Unimin’s business, financial condition and results of operations. The hydraulic fracturing industry is not yet a fully matured industry and is still subject
to

Table of Contents

technological change (for example, horizontal drilling and fracturing is currently less than 10 years old). The development and use of new technology
for effective alternative proppants, or new technologies allowing for improved placement of proppants at reduced volumes, or the development of new
processes to replace hydraulic fracturing altogether, could also cause a decline in demand for the sand-based proppants Unimin produces and could have
a material adverse effect on Unimin’s business, financial condition and results of operations. Similarly, the increase in supply of in-basin sand, which
may be of lower cost, in the Permian and Eagleford basins, could adversely affect Unimin’s business, particularly at locations where Unimin sells
Northern White sand. In addition, the discovery by competitors of minerals in locations which are closer to Unimin’s customers could provide
competitors with a geographic advantage. Any significant reduction in demand for products sold from Unimin’s facilities could have an adverse effect
on Unimin’s profitability.

A large percentage of Unimin’s sales are subject to fluctuations in market pricing.

A large percentage of Unimin’s supply agreements have market-based pricing mechanisms. Accordingly, in periods with decreasing prices,
Unimin’s results of operations may be lower than if its supply agreements had fixed prices. In periods with increasing prices, Unimin’s supply
agreements permit the company to increase prices; however, Unimin’s customers may elect to cease purchasing Unimin’s products if they do not agree
with the price increases or are able to find alternative, cheaper sources of supply. Furthermore, certain volume-based supply agreements may influence
Unimin’s ability to fully capture current market pricings. These pricing provisions may result in significant variability in Unimin’s results of operations
and cash flows from period to period.

A significant percentage of Unimin’s volume is also supplied under fixed price contracts. Over the life of such contracts, the contracted price for
such minerals may be below the current market price, at times significantly so. During such periods, this dynamic may depress Unimin’s profit margins
as compared to its industry peers.

Changes in supply and demand dynamics could also impact market pricing for Unimin’s products. A number of existing frac sand providers and
new industry entrants have recently announced reserve acquisitions, processing capacity expansions and greenfield projects. In periods where sources of
supply of raw frac sand exceed demand, prices for frac sand may decline and Unimin’s results of operations and cash flows may continue to decline, be
volatile or otherwise be adversely affected. In particular, in 2017 several new and current sand suppliers announced plans to develop new in basin
facilities in the Permian and Eagleford basins. While the quality and type of proppants produced in-basin is not always the same as those produced in
Northern White locations, the cost of this in-basin sand could be lower and the increase in supply of in-basin sand could become a suitable replacement
for all or a portion of the Northern White sands particularly if customers change their sizing and quality specifications to favor in basin sands. These
factors could adversely affect Unimin’s business, particularly at locations where Unimin sells Northern White sand.

Unimin may not be able to complete capital expansion projects, the actual costs of any capacity expansion may exceed estimated costs, and
Unimin may not be able to secure demand for the incremental production capacity. In addition, actual operating costs for the new capacity may
be higher than anticipated.

Unimin undertakes projects from time to time to expand its production capacity and distribution network and to modernize its operations. For
example, Unimin is currently constructing a new facility in the Permian basin and is modernizing its nepheline syenite operations in Canada. No
assurance can be given that, when Unimin endeavors to open new or upgraded facilities, the expected timetables for opening such facilities will be met
in light of the uncertainties inherent in the development of the regulatory framework, construction, the licensing process, legislative action, potential
litigation, market conditions and demand for Unimin’s products.

In addition, any capital expansion project involves numerous regulatory, environmental, political and legal uncertainties beyond Unimin’s control
and is subject to various risks, including but not limited to:
 

 
•  Unimin’s ability to timely obtain necessary authorizations, approvals and permits from regulatory, including environmental, agencies and on

terms that are acceptable to Unimin;
 

52

Table of Contents

 
•  potential changes in federal, state and local statutes and regulations, including environmental requirements, that prevent a project from

proceeding or increase the anticipated cost of the project;
 

 •  the inability to acquire rights-of-way or land or water rights on a timely basis on terms that are acceptable to Unimin;
 

 •  the inability to acquire necessary energy supplies, including electricity, natural gas and diesel fuel;
 

 •  labor shortage risks, safety issues and work stoppages;
 

 •  engineering issues;
 

 •  contamination problems;
 

 •  equipment or raw material supply constraints; and
 

 •  unexpected equipment maintenance requirements.

Any of these events could delay the expansion, construction or optimization of Unimin’s facilities.

Any capital expansion will require Unimin to spend substantial capital. If the assumptions on which Unimin’s estimated capital expenditures are
based change or are inaccurate, Unimin may require additional funding. Such funding may not be available on acceptable terms or at all. Moreover,
actual operating costs once Unimin has completed a capacity expansion may be higher than initially anticipated. Unimin also may not secure off-take
commitments for the incremental production from the incremental capacity and may not be able to secure adequate demand for the incremental
production.

If Unimin undertakes capital expansion projects, they may not be completed on schedule or at the budgeted cost or at all. Moreover, upon the
expenditure of future funds on a particular project, the company’s revenues may not increase immediately, or as anticipated, or at all. For instance,
Unimin may construct new facilities over an extended period of time and will not receive any material increases in revenues until the projects are
completed. Moreover, Unimin may construct facilities to capture anticipated future growth in a location in which such growth does not materialize or for
which Unimin is unable to acquire new customers. Unimin may also rely on estimates of proved, probable or possible reserves in its decision to
undertake expansion projects, which may prove to be inaccurate. As a result, Unimin’s new facilities and infrastructure may be unable to achieve
Unimin’s expected investment return, which could materially and adversely affect the company’s results of operations and financial position.

Furthermore, substantial investments in transportation infrastructure may be required to effectively execute the capacity expansion, and Unimin
may not be successful in expanding its logistical capabilities to accommodate the additional production capacity. A decision by any governmental
agency not to issue a required permit or substantial delays in the permitting process could prevent or delay Unimin from pursuing the development or
expansion project. In addition, if the demand for Unimin’s products declines during the period the company experiences delays in raising capital or
completing the permitting process, Unimin may not realize the expected benefits from the capital expansion project. Furthermore, Unimin’s new or
modified facilities may not operate at designed capacity or may cost more to operate than expected.

Any failure to successfully implement any capacity expansion plans due to an inability to obtain necessary permits, insufficient funding, delays,
unanticipated costs, adverse market conditions or other factors, or failure to realize the anticipated benefits of Unimin’s capacity expansion plans,
including securing demand for the incremental production, could have a material adverse effect on Unimin’s business, financial condition and results of
operations.

Unimin relies upon trade secrets, contractual restrictions and patents to protect its proprietary rights. Failure to protect Unimin’s intellectual
property rights may undermine its competitive position, and protecting Unimin’s rights or defending against third-party allegations of
infringement may be costly.

Unimin’s commercial success depends on its proprietary information and technologies, know-how and other intellectual property. Because of the
technical nature of its business, Unimin relies on patents, trade secrets,

Table of Contents

trademarks and contractual restrictions to protect its intellectual property rights. The measures Unimin takes to protect its trade secrets and other
intellectual property rights may be insufficient. Failure to protect, monitor and control the use of existing intellectual property rights could cause Unimin
to lose its competitive advantage and incur significant expenses. It is possible that Unimin’s competitors or others could independently develop the same
or similar technologies or otherwise obtain access to Unimin’s unpatented technologies. In such case, Unimin’s trade secrets would not prevent third
parties from competing with the company. As a result, Unimin’s results of operations may be adversely affected. Furthermore, third parties or Unimin’s
employees may infringe or misappropriate the company’s proprietary technologies or other intellectual property rights, which could also harm Unimin’s
business and results of operations. Policing unauthorized use of intellectual property rights can be difficult and expensive, and adequate remedies may
not be available.

In addition, third parties may claim that Unimin’s products infringe or otherwise violate their patents or other proprietary rights and seek
corresponding damages or injunctive relief. Defending against such claims, with or without merit, could be time-consuming and result in costly
litigation. An adverse outcome in any such litigation could subject Unimin to significant liability to third parties (potentially including treble damages)
or temporary or permanent injunctions prohibiting the manufacture or sale of Unimin’s products, the use of its technologies or the conduct of its
business. Any adverse outcome could also require Unimin to seek licenses from third parties (which may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all)
or to make substantial one-time or ongoing royalty payments. Protracted litigation could also result in Unimin’s customers or potential customers
deferring or limiting their purchase or use of Unimin’s products until resolution of such litigation. In addition, Unimin may not have insurance coverage
in connection with such litigation and may have to bear all costs arising from any such litigation to the extent Unimin is unable to recover them from
other parties. Any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on Unimin’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

Unimin’s future performance will depend on its ability to succeed in competitive industries and on its ability to appropriately react to potential
fluctuations in demand for and supply of it products.

Unimin operates in highly competitive industries that are characterized by a number of large, national producers and a larger number of small,
regional or local producers. Competition in the industries in which Unimin operates is based on price, consistency and quality of product, site location,
distribution and logistics capabilities, customer service, reliability of supply, breadth of product offering, availability of economic substitutes and
technical support.

Unimin competes with national producers such as Badger Mining Corporation (which owns Atlas Resin Proppants LLC), CARBO Ceramics Inc.,
Emerge Energy Services LP, Fairmount Santrol, Hi-Crush Partners, LP, Momentive Performance Materials Inc., Preferred Sands LLC, Smart Sand Inc.,
Superior Silica and U.S. Silica Holdings, Inc. Certain of Unimin’s large competitors may have greater financial and other resources than Unimin does,
may develop superior technology or may have production facilities that are located closer to key customers than Unimin’s.

Unimin also competes with smaller, regional or local producers. For instance, prior to 2015, there had been an increasing number of small
producers servicing frac sand customers due to increased demand for hydraulic fracturing services. If demand for hydraulic fracturing services decreases
and the supply of frac sand increases, prices for frac sand could continue to materially decrease as less-efficient producers exit the industry, selling frac
sand at below market prices. Furthermore, competitors may choose to consolidate, which could provide them with greater financial and other resources
and negatively impact demand for Unimin’s frac sand products. In addition, oil and natural gas exploration and production companies and other
providers of hydraulic fracturing services could acquire their own frac sand reserves, expand their existing frac sand production capacity or otherwise
fulfill their own proppant requirements and existing or new frac sand producers could add to or expand their frac sand production capacity, which would
negatively impact demand for Unimin’s frac sand products.

In Unimin’s Industrial segment, Unimin competes with large diversified companies but also with smaller, local or regional producers. Competitors
may produce minerals similar to those sold by Unimin or they may produce substitute products that offer similar functionality. In the Industrial segment,
Unimin competes primarily

Custom Grinders. Imported products which Unimin distributes for Sibelco compete with international competitors, primarily in Europe.

Unimin may not be able to compete successfully against either larger or smaller competitors in the future, and competition could have a material
adverse effect on Unimin’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

Certain of Unimin’s products may be susceptible to displacement by alternative products.

Certain of the products Unimin produces supply customers for which there are limited alternatives currently available. For example, Unimin is one
of the world’s leading producers of low-iron nepheline syenite used in glass, ceramics, paint and plastics. However, while there are currently limited
alternatives available to Unimin’s nepheline syenite customers, other minerals can provide similar functional benefits. If these alternative products can
be processed to provide a more cost-effective solution, the nature of the business presents an increased risk of an industry-wide switch to such
alternative product, which could have a material adverse effect on Unimin’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

If Unimin’s customers delay or fail to pay a significant amount of their outstanding receivables, it could have a material adverse effect on
Unimin’s business, results of operations and financial condition.

Unimin may be subject to its customers delaying or failing to pay their invoices. In weak economic environments, Unimin may experience
increased delays or failures due to, among other reasons, a reduction in its customers’ cash flow from operations and their access to the credit markets. If
Unimin’s customers delay or fail to pay a significant amount of their outstanding receivables, it could have a material adverse effect on Unimin’s
business, results of operations and financial condition.

Some of Unimin’s customers may experience financial difficulties, including insolvency. If a customer cannot provide Unimin with reasonable
assurance of payment, Unimin may be required to fully reserve the outstanding accounts receivable balance for the customer. Although Unimin will
continue to try to obtain payments from these customers, it is likely that one or more of these customers will not pay for their purchases of Unimin’s
products. With respect to customers that are in bankruptcy proceedings, Unimin similarly may not be able to collect sums owed by these customers and
also may be required to refund pre-petition amounts paid during the preference period (typically 90 days) prior to the bankruptcy filing.

Unimin’s credit procedures and policies may not be adequate to fully eliminate customer credit risk. If Unimin fails to adequately assess the
creditworthiness of existing or future customers or unanticipated deterioration in their creditworthiness, any resulting increase in nonpayment or
nonperformance by them and Unimin’s inability to re-market or otherwise sell the volumes could have a material adverse effect on Unimin’s business,
financial condition and results of operations.

A large portion of Unimin’s sales is generated by a limited number of customers, and the loss of, or a significant reduction in purchases by,
Unimin’s largest customers could adversely affect its operations.

During the year ended December 31, 2017, Unimin’s top 10 customers accounted for approximately 45% of its sales, and Unimin’s largest
customer, Halliburton Energy Services, accounted for approximately 12% of its sales. These customers may not continue to purchase the same level of
Unimin’s products in the future due to a variety of reasons. For example, some of Unimin’s top customers could go out of business or, alternatively, be
acquired by other companies that purchase the same products and services provided by Unimin from other third-party providers. Unimin’s customers
could also seek to capture and develop their own sources of minerals they purchase from Unimin. Over the course of their relationships, Unimin has sold
product to its largest customers on both a purchase order basis and pursuant to supply agreements. Unimin currently has supply agreements with certain
of its top customers that contain customary termination provisions for bankruptcy related events and uncured breaches of the applicable agreement.

Upon the expiration of Unimin’s current supply agreements, its customers may not continue to purchase the same levels of product due to a
variety of reasons. In addition, Unimin may choose to renegotiate its existing contracts on less favorable terms or at reduced volumes in order to
preserve relationships with its customers. Upon the expiration of Unimin’s current contract terms, Unimin may be unable to renew its existing contracts
or enter into new contracts on terms favorable to Unimin, or at all. The demand for Unimin’s products or prevailing prices at the time Unimin’s current
supply agreements expire may render entry into new long-term supply agreements difficult or impossible. Any renegotiation of Unimin’s contracts on
less favorable terms, or inability to enter into new contracts on economically acceptable terms upon the expiration of Unimin’s current contracts, could
have a material adverse effect on Unimin’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

If any of Unimin’s major customers substantially reduces or altogether ceases purchasing Unimin’s products and Unimin is not able to generate
replacement sales, Unimin’s business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected until such time as the company can
generate replacement sales.

Certain of Unimin’s contracts contain provisions requiring Unimin to deliver minimum amounts of minerals or purchase minimum amounts of
services. Noncompliance with these contractual obligations may result in penalties or termination of the agreement.

In certain instances, Unimin commits to deliver products or purchase services, under penalty of nonperformance. If Unimin is unable to meet the
minimum contract requirements, the counterparty may be permitted to terminate the agreements or require Unimin to pay a fee. The amount of the fee
would be based on the difference between the minimum amount contracted for and the amount delivered or purchased. In such events, Unimin’s
business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.

Unimin’s operations are subject to operating risks that are often beyond its control and could adversely affect production levels and costs, and
such risks may not be covered by insurance.

Unimin’s mining, processing and production facilities are subject to risks normally encountered by such facilities in the industries in which
Unimin operates. These risks include:
 

 •  changes in the price and availability of transportation;
 

 •  changes in the price and availability of natural gas, propane, fuel oil or electricity;
 

 •  changes in product mix and the costs of producing various products;
 

 •  unusual or unexpected geological formations or pressures;
 

 •  cave-ins, pit wall failures, stockpile sloughs or rock falls, particularly in underground mines;
 

 •  unanticipated ground, grade, sinkhole or water conditions;
 

 •  extreme seasonal weather conditions;
 

 
•  hazardous or catastrophic weather conditions or events, including flooding, tornadoes, hail and/or ice storms and hurricanes, and the

physical impacts of climate change;
 

 •  environmental hazards;
 

 •  industrial accidents, including injuries to key personnel;
 

 •  physical facility security breaches;
 

 
•  changes in laws and regulations (or the interpretation thereof) or increased public scrutiny related to the mining, drilling, well completion

and hydraulic fracturing industries, silica dust exposure or the environment;
 

 •  nonperformance of contractual obligations;
 

 •  inability to acquire or maintain necessary permits or mining or water rights;
 

 •  restrictions on blasting and mining operations, including potential moratoriums on mining as a result of local activism or complaints;

 •  inability to obtain necessary production equipment or replacement parts in a timely manner;
 

 •  reduction in the amount of water available for processing;
 

 •  labor disputes;
 

 •  cybersecurity breaches;
 

 •  technical difficulties or key equipment failures;
 

 •  late delivery of supplies;
 

 •  fires, explosions or other accidents;
 

 •  facility shutdowns in response to environmental regulatory actions;
 

 •  facility shutdowns or speed losses due to community restrictions; and
 

 •  loss of key operational personnel.

Any of these risks could result in damage to, or destruction of, Unimin’s mining properties or production facilities, personal injury, environmental
damage, delays in mining or processing, losses or possible legal liability. Any prolonged downtime or shutdowns at Unimin’s mining properties or
production facilities could have a material adverse effect on Unimin. In addition, not all of these risks are reasonably insurable, and Unimin’s insurance
coverage contains limits, deductibles, exclusions and endorsements. Unimin’s insurance coverage may not be sufficient to meet its needs in the event of
loss, and any such loss may have a material adverse effect on the company.

A significant portion of Unimin’s volume is generated from its Utica, Kasota and Tunnel City production facilities. Additionally, a significant
portion of Unimin’s energy sales are generated at terminals located in various shale plays. Any adverse developments at any of these production
facilities and terminals or in the industries they serve could have a material adverse effect on Unimin’s business, financial condition and results
of operations.

A significant portion of Unimin’s volume is generated from its Utica, Kasota and Tunnel City production facilities located in Illinois, Minnesota
and Wisconsin, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2017, approximately 32% of Unimin’s total volume was shipped from these facilities. In
addition, a significant portion of Unimin’s energy sales are generated at terminals located in various shale plays. Any adverse developments at these
production facilities and terminals or in the industries these facilities serve, including adverse developments due to catastrophic events or weather
(including floods, windstorms, ice storms or tornadoes), adverse government regulatory impacts, private actions by residents of the local or surrounding
communities, decreased demand for the products these facilities produce, adverse developments affecting customers served by these facilities or
transportation-related constraints, could have a material adverse effect on Unimin’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

In addition, any adverse development at Unimin’s production facilities that would cause Unimin to curtail, suspend or terminate operations at the
production facilities could result in Unimin being unable to meet its contracted deliveries. If Unimin is unable to deliver contracted volumes within the
required time frame, or otherwise arrange for delivery from a third party, it could be required to pay make-whole payments to its customers that could
have a material adverse effect on Unimin’s financial condition and results of operations.

The manufacture of Unimin’s products is dependent on the availability of raw materials and feedstocks.

Unimin depends on its suppliers for the raw materials and feedstocks necessary to produce many of its products. If Unimin is unable to secure
adequate, cost effective supply commitments for the raw materials and feedstocks associated with its products, its ability to produce and sell various
products at profitable margins may be adversely impacted. Many raw materials and feedstocks are not sold pursuant to long-term contracts and Unimin
cannot guarantee that its suppliers will continue to provide necessary raw materials or feedstocks at reasonable prices or at all. The loss of key suppliers
could have material adverse effect on Unimin’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

Reduced access, lack of or inability to obtain access to water may adversely affect Unimin’s operations or the operations of Unimin’s customers.

The mining and processing activities in which Unimin engages at a number of its facilities require significant amounts of water, and some of
Unimin’s facilities are located in areas that are water-constrained. Additionally, the development of oil and gas properties through fracture stimulation
likewise requires significant water use. Unimin has obtained water rights that it currently uses to service the activities on its various properties, and
Unimin plans to obtain all required water rights to service other properties it may develop or acquire in the future. However, the amount of water that
Unimin and its customers are entitled to use pursuant to its water rights must be determined by the appropriate regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions
in which Unimin and its customers operate. Such regulatory authorities may amend the regulations regarding such water rights, increase the cost of
maintaining such water rights or eliminate Unimin’s current water rights, and Unimin and its customers may be unable to retain all or a portion of such
water rights. These new regulations, which could also affect local municipalities and other industrial operations, could have a material adverse effect on
Unimin’s operating costs and effectiveness if implemented. Such changes in laws, regulations or government policy and related interpretations
pertaining to water rights may alter the environment in which Unimin and its customers do business, which may negatively affect Unimin’s financial
condition and results of operations. Additionally, a water discharge permit may be required to properly dispose of water at Unimin’s processing sites.
The water discharge permitting process is also subject to regulatory discretion, and any inability to obtain the necessary permits could have an adverse
effect on Unimin’s financial condition and results of operations.

Title to Unimin’s mineral properties and water rights, and royalties related to Unimin’s production, may be disputed.

Title to, and the area of, mineral properties and water rights, and royalties related to Unimin’s production of sand and other minerals, may be
disputed. A successful claim that Unimin lacks appropriate mineral and water rights on one or more of its properties could cause Unimin to lose any
rights to explore, develop and operate mines on that property. Any decrease or disruption in Unimin’s mineral rights may adversely affect its operations.
In some instances, Unimin has received access rights or easements from third parties, which allow for a more efficient operation than would exist
without the access or easement. A third party could take action to suspend the access or easement, and any such action could be materially adverse to
Unimin’s results of operations or financial condition.

Unimin does not own the land on which the majority of its terminal facilities are located, and in some cases does not own the related terminal
assets and relies on long term leases or access agreements with third parties, including customers, which could disrupt Unimin’s operations.

Unimin does not own the land on which the majority of its terminals are located and instead owns leasehold interests and rights-of-way for the
operation of these facilities. Upon expiration, termination or other lapse of its current leasehold terms, Unimin may be unable to renew its existing leases
or rights-of-way on terms favorable to Unimin, or at all. Any renegotiation on less favorable terms or inability to enter into new leases on economically
acceptable terms upon the expiration, termination or other lapse of Unimin’s current leases or rights-of-way could cause Unimin to cease operations on
the affected land, increase costs related to continuing operations elsewhere and have a material adverse effect on Unimin’s business, financial condition
and results of operations. In addition, operating a terminal under a lease can involve escalating costs to Unimin and additional operational difficulties,
including with regard to hiring and retaining skilled personnel.

In addition, with respect to certain terminals, Unimin does not own the terminal assets themselves. With respect to these terminals, Unimin has
negotiated either long term leases with third parties or, in the case of certain customer-owned terminals, exclusive access agreements to the terminal.
Any leases are subject to the risks of renegotiation at less favorable terms or the risk of failure to enter into new leases on economically acceptable
terms. In certain circumstances, the terminals Unimin uses are owned by customers and Unimin’s terminal access agreements are tied to supply
agreements with these customers. In these cases it is possible that Unimin’s ability to continue operating these terminals could be impeded if the
customer’s volume needs diverge from Unimin’s ability to supply those needs and the customer no longer allows access to or use of the terminal.

If Unimin cannot successfully complete acquisitions or integrate acquired businesses, its growth may be limited and its financial condition may
be adversely affected.

One element of Unimin’s business strategy includes supplementing internal growth by pursuing acquisitions. Any acquisition may involve
potential risks, including, among other things:
 

 
•  the validity of Unimin’s assumptions about mineral reserves and future production, sales, capital expenditures, operating expenses and costs,

including synergies;
 

 •  difficulties and delays in realizing anticipated benefits from the acquired businesses;
 

 •  an inability to successfully integrate the businesses that are acquired;
 

 
•  the use of a significant portion of Unimin’s available cash or borrowing capacity to finance acquisitions and the subsequent decrease in

Unimin’s liquidity;
 

 •  a significant increase in Unimin’s interest expense or financial leverage if Unimin incurs additional debt to finance acquisitions;
 

 
•  the assumption of unknown liabilities, losses or costs for which Unimin is not indemnified or for which the third party’s indemnity obtained

by Unimin is inadequate;
 

 •  the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns;
 

 •  an inability to hire, train or retain qualified personnel both to manage and to operate Unimin’s growing business and assets;
 

 
•  the incurrence of other significant charges, such as impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets, asset devaluation or restructuring

charges;
 

 •  unforeseen difficulties encountered in operating in new geographic areas;
 

 •  the loss of customers or key employees at the acquired businesses; and
 

 
•  the accuracy of data obtained from production reports and engineering studies, geophysical and geological analyses, and other information

used when deciding to acquire a property, the results of which are often inconclusive and subject to various interpretations.

If Unimin cannot successfully complete acquisitions, realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions or integrate acquired businesses,
Unimin’s growth or financial condition may be adversely affected.

Inaccuracies in Unimin’s estimates of mineral reserves could result in lower than expected sales and higher than expected costs.

Unimin bases its mineral reserve estimates on engineering, economic and geological data assembled and analyzed by its engineers and geologists,
which are reviewed by outside firms. However, mineral reserve estimates are necessarily imprecise and depend to some extent on statistical inferences
drawn from available drilling data, which may prove unreliable. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities and qualities of
mineral reserves and costs to mine recoverable reserves, including many factors beyond Unimin’s control. Estimates of economically recoverable
mineral reserves necessarily depend on a number of factors and assumptions, all of which may vary considerably from actual results, such as:
 

 
•  geological and mining conditions and/or effects from prior mining that may not be fully identified by available data or that may differ from

experience;
 

 
•  assumptions concerning future prices of products, operating costs, mining technology improvements, development costs and reclamation

costs;
 

 •  assumptions concerning future effects of regulation, including the issuance of required permits and taxes by governmental agencies; and
 

 •  changes in product mix.

Any inaccuracy in Unimin’s estimates related to its mineral reserves could result in lower than expected sales and higher than expected costs.

Mine closures entail substantial costs, and if Unimin closes one or more of its mines sooner than anticipated, Unimin’s results of operations may
be adversely affected.

Unimin bases its assumptions regarding the life of its mines on detailed studies that it performs from time to time, but these studies and
assumptions do not always prove to be accurate. If Unimin closes any of its mines sooner than expected, sales will decline unless Unimin is able to
increase production at any of its other mines, which may not be possible. The closure of an open-pit mine also involves significant fixed closure costs,
including accelerated employment legacy costs, severance-related obligations, reclamation and other environmental costs and the costs of terminating
long-term obligations, including energy contracts and equipment leases. Unimin accrues for the costs of reclaiming open pits, stockpiles, tailings ponds,
roads and other mining support areas over the estimated mining life of its property. If Unimin were to reduce the estimated life of any of its mines, the
fixed mine closure costs would be applied to a shorter period of production, which would increase production costs per ton produced and could
materially and adversely affect Unimin’s results of operations and financial condition.

Applicable statutes and regulations require that mining property be reclaimed following a mine closure in accordance with specified standards and
an approved reclamation plan. The plan addresses matters such as removal of facilities and equipment, regrading, prevention of erosion and other forms
of water pollution, re-vegetation and post-mining land use. Unimin may be required to post a surety bond or other form of financial assurance equal to
the cost of reclamation as set forth in the approved reclamation plan. The establishment of the final mine closure reclamation liability is based on permit
requirements and requires various estimates and assumptions, principally associated with reclamation costs and production levels. If Unimin’s accruals
for expected reclamation and other costs associated with mine closures for which Unimin will be responsible were later determined to be insufficient,
Unimin’s business, results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected.

Unimin’s production processes consume large amounts of natural gas and electricity. An increase in the price or a significant interruption in
the supply of these or any other significant raw material costs could have a material adverse effect on Unimin’s business, financial condition or
results of operations.

Energy costs, primarily natural gas and electricity, are among Unimin’s highest costs of product sold. Natural gas is the primary fuel source used
for drying sand in the commercial silica production process and, as such, Unimin’s profitability is impacted by the price and availability of natural gas it
purchases from third parties. The price and supply of natural gas are unpredictable and can fluctuate significantly based on international, political and
economic circumstances, as well as other events outside Unimin’s control, such as changes in supply and demand due to weather conditions, actions by
OPEC and other oil and natural gas producers, regional production patterns and environmental concerns. Furthermore, utility companies could enforce
natural gas curtailments that affect Unimin’s operations. In addition, potential climate change regulations or carbon or emissions taxes could result in
higher production costs for energy, which may be passed on to Unimin in whole or in part. In the past, the price of natural gas has been extremely
volatile, and Unimin expects that this volatility may continue. For example, during the year ended December 31, 2017, the monthly closing price of
natural gas on the New York Mercantile Exchange ranged from a high of $3.93 per million British Thermal Units (“BTUs”) to a low of $2.63 per
million BTUs. In order to manage the above risk, Unimin may hedge natural gas prices through the use of derivative financial instruments, such as
forwards, swaps and futures. However, these measures carry risk (including nonperformance by counterparties) and do not in any event entirely
eliminate the risk of decreased margins as a result of natural gas price increases. A significant increase in the price of energy that is not recovered
through an increase in the price of Unimin’s products or an extended interruption in the supply of natural gas or electricity to Unimin’s production
facilities could have a material adverse effect on Unimin’s business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.

Increases in the price of diesel fuel may adversely affect Unimin’s results of operations.

Diesel fuel costs generally fluctuate with increasing and decreasing world crude oil prices and accordingly are subject to political, economic and
market factors that are outside of Unimin’s control. Unimin’s operations are dependent on earthmoving equipment, railcars and tractor trailers, and
diesel fuel costs are a significant component of the operating expense of these vehicles. Unimin uses earthmoving equipment in its mining operations,
and Unimin ships the vast majority of its products by either railcar or tractor trailer. To the extent that Unimin performs these services with equipment
that it owns, Unimin is responsible for buying and supplying the diesel fuel needed to operate these vehicles. To the extent that these services are
provided by independent contractors, Unimin may be subject to fuel surcharges that attempt to recoup increased diesel fuel expenses. To the extent that
Unimin is unable to pass along increased diesel fuel costs to its customers, Unimin’s results of operations could be adversely affected.

Phenol is the primary component of the resins Unimin buys, and Unimin’s resin supply agreements contain market-based pricing provisions
based on the cost of phenol. As a result, Unimin is exposed to fluctuations in the prices for phenol.

A significant increase in the price of phenol that is not recovered through an increase in the price of Unimin’s resin products could have a material
adverse effect on Unimin’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

A shortage of skilled labor together with rising labor costs in the mining industry may further increase operating costs, which could adversely
affect Unimin’s results of operations.

Efficient mining using modern techniques and equipment requires skilled laborers, preferably with several years of experience and proficiency in
multiple mining tasks, including processing of mined minerals. If the shortage of experienced labor continues or worsens or if Unimin is unable to train
the necessary number of skilled laborers, there could be an adverse impact on Unimin’s labor productivity and costs and its ability to expand production.

Unimin’s business may suffer if it loses, or is unable to attract and retain, key personnel.

Unimin depends to a large extent on the services of its key personnel. Unimin’s key employees have extensive experience and expertise in
evaluating and analyzing industrial mineral properties, building new processing facilities, maximizing production from such properties, marketing
industrial mineral production, transportation, distribution and developing and executing financing and hedging strategies, as well as substantial
experience and relationships with participants in the industries that Unimin serves. Competition for management and key personnel is intense, and the
pool of qualified candidates is limited. Further, most of Unimin’s key employees are not employed pursuant to employment agreements. The loss of any
of Unimin’s key employees or the failure to attract additional personnel, as needed, could have a material adverse effect on Unimin’s operations and
could lead to higher labor costs or the use of less-qualified personnel. If any of Unimin’s key employees were to join a competitor, or form a competing
company, the company could lose customers, suppliers, know-how and key personnel. Unimin does not maintain key-man life insurance with respect to
any of its employees. Unimin’s success is dependent on its ability to continue to attract, employ and retain highly-skilled personnel.

Unimin’s profitability could be negatively affected if it fails to maintain satisfactory labor relations.

As of December 31, 2017, approximately 40% of Unimin’s labor force was covered under 26 union agreements in the United States, Canada and
Mexico. These agreements are renegotiated when their terms expire. There are four agreements that are due to be renegotiated in 2018 for the U.S. and
Canada. The 10 agreements in Mexico are renegotiated annually. If Unimin is unable to renegotiate acceptable collective bargaining agreements with
these labor unions in the future, Unimin could experience, among other things, strikes, work stoppages or other slowdowns by its workers and increased
operating costs as a result of higher wages, health care costs or benefits paid to its employees. An inability to maintain good relations with its workforce
could cause a material adverse effect on Unimin’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

Failure to maintain effective quality control systems at Unimin’s mining, processing and production facilities could have a material adverse
effect on Unimin’s business, financial condition and operations.

The performance, quality and safety of Unimin’s products are critical to the success of its business. These factors depend significantly on the
effectiveness of Unimin’s quality control systems, which, in turn, depends on a number of factors, including the design of Unimin’s quality control
systems, its quality-training program and its ability to ensure that its employees adhere to the quality control policies and guidelines. Any significant
failure or deterioration of Unimin’s quality control systems could have a material adverse effect on Unimin’s business, financial condition, results of
operations and reputation.

Severe weather conditions could have a material adverse impact on Unimin’s business.

Unimin’s business could be materially adversely affected by weather conditions. Severe weather conditions may affect its customers’ operations,
thus reducing their need for Unimin’s products. Weather conditions may impact Unimin’s operations, resulting in weather-related damage to its facilities
and equipment or an inability to deliver equipment, personnel and products to job sites in accordance with contract schedules. In addition, the United
States Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) has stated that climate change may lead to the increased frequency and severity of extreme
weather events. Any such interference with Unimin’s operations could force the company to delay or curtail services and potentially breach its
contractual obligations or result in a loss of productivity and an increase in its operating costs.

In addition, severe winter weather conditions impact Unimin’s operations by causing it to halt its excavation and wet plant related production
activities at many of its facilities during the winter months. At such facilities, during non-winter months, Unimin excavates excess sand to build a
washed sand stockpile that feeds the dry plant, which continues to operate during the winter months. Unexpected winter conditions (e.g., if winter
conditions come earlier than expected or last longer than expected) may result in Unimin not having a sufficient sand stockpile to supply feedstock for
Unimin’s dry plant during winter months, which could result in Unimin being unable to meet its contracted sand deliveries during such time and lead to
a material adverse effect on Unimin’s business, financial condition, results of operations and reputation.

Unimin’s sales and profitability fluctuate on a seasonal basis and are affected by a variety of other factors.

Unimin’s sales and profitability are affected by a variety of factors, including actions of competitors, changes in general economic conditions,
weather conditions, variability of demand impacting fixed cost leverage and seasonal periods. As a result, Unimin’s results of operations may fluctuate
on a quarterly basis and relative to corresponding periods in prior years, and any of these factors could adversely affect Unimin’s business and cause its
results of operations to decline. For example, Unimin sells more of its products in the second and third quarters to customers who operate in the
Industrial segment due to the seasonal rise in construction driven by more favorable weather conditions. Unimin sells fewer of its products in the first
and fourth quarters due to reduced construction and recreational activity largely as a result of adverse weather conditions. Any unanticipated decrease in
demand for Unimin’s products during the second and third quarters could have a material adverse effect on Unimin’s sales and profitability.

In addition to supply considerations, severe weather conditions may curtail Unimin’s customers’ drilling activities and impair rail shipment and
transportation services and, as a result, Unimin’s sales volumes to customers may similarly be adversely affected. Unexpected winter weather conditions
may compound these seasonal impacts and could result in a material adverse effect on Unimin’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

Unimin may be subject to interruptions or failures in its information technology systems. A cyber incident could occur and result in
information theft, data corruption, operational disruption and/or financial loss.

Unimin relies on sophisticated information technology systems and infrastructure to process transactions, summarize its operating results and
manage its business. Unimin’s information technology systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and
telecommunications failures, computer viruses, cyber-attack or other security breaches, catastrophic events, such as fires, floods, earthquakes, tornadoes,
hurricanes,

acts of war or terrorism and usage errors by Unimin’s employees. If Unimin’s information technology systems are damaged or cease to function
properly, Unimin may have to make a significant investment to fix or replace them, and Unimin may suffer loss of critical data, interruptions or delays
in its operations and become subject to negative publicity. The reliability and capacity of Unimin’s information technology systems is critical to
Unimin’s operations and the implementation of its growth initiatives. Any material disruption in Unimin’s information technology systems, or delays or
difficulties in implementing or integrating new systems or enhancing current systems, could have an adverse effect on Unimin’s business and results of
operations.

Unimin’s information technologies, systems and networks, and those of its vendors, suppliers and other business partners, may become the target
of cyber-attacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of
proprietary and other information, or other disruption of business operations. In addition, certain cyber incidents, such as surveillance, may remain
undetected for an extended period. Unimin’s systems and insurance coverage for protecting against cyber security risks may not be sufficient. As cyber
incidents continue to evolve, Unimin will likely be required to expend additional resources to continue to modify or enhance its protective measures or
to investigate and remediate any vulnerability to cyber incidents. Unimin’s insurance coverage for cyber-attacks may not be sufficient to cover all the
losses Unimin may experience as a result of such cyber-attacks.

Unimin believes that there is a significant risk that the combined company will be a “United States Real Property Holding Corporation” for
U.S. federal income tax purposes.

Unimin believes that there is a significant risk that the combined company will be a “United States real property holding corporation” (a
“USRPHC”) within the meaning of Section 897 of the Code immediately following the closing of the Mergers.

If the combined company is a USRPHC after the closing of the Mergers, a non-U.S. holder may be subject to the FIRPTA Tax (as defined herein)
on a future sale or other disposition of combined company common stock. For a detailed discussion of the FIRPTA Tax, non-U.S. holders should read
the discussion in the section entitled “Material United States Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Transaction” in this proxy statement/prospectus,
particularly the section entitled “U.S. Federal Income Taxation of Holding Combined Company Common Stock—FIRPTA Tax in respect of combined
company common stock.”

Unimin’s international operations expose it to risks inherent in doing business abroad.

Unimin conducts business in many parts of the world, including Argentina, Mexico and Canada. Unimin’s international operations are subject to
the various laws and regulations of those respective countries as well as various risks peculiar to each country, which may include, but are not limited to:
 

 •  global economic conditions;
 

 
•  political actions and requirements of national governments, including trade restrictions, embargoes, seizure, detention, nationalization and

expropriations of assets;
 

 
•  changes in and interpretation of tax statutes and requirements of taxing authorities worldwide, routine examination by taxing authorities and

assessment of additional taxes, penalties and/or interest;
 

 •  war, civil unrest, riots and insurrections;
 

 •  acts of terrorism;
 

 •  criminal activities, including activities of drug cartels;
 

 •  the potential for the expropriation and nationalization of mines and other assets;
 

 •  devaluations and other fluctuations in currency exchange rates;
 

 •  the impact of inflation;
 

 •  trade protection measures;
 

 •  restrictions on foreign investments;

 •  limitations on Unimin’s ability to enforce legal rights and remedies;
 

 •  difficulty in repatriating foreign currency received in excess of the local currency requirements; and
 

 •  weak intellectual property protection.

Unimin is currently subject to and, following the closing of the Merger, the combined company will continue to be be subject to the U.S. Foreign
Corrupt Practice Act (“FCPA”) and other antibribery legislation and regulations applicable to it in other countries. The combined company’s ability to
comply with the FCPA and other anti-bribery legislation is dependent on the success of its ongoing compliance program, including its ability to continue
to manage its agents and business partners, and supervise, train and retain competent employees. The combined company could be subject to sanctions
and civil and criminal prosecution as well as fines and penalties in the event of a finding of a violation of the FCPA by Unimin or any of its employees.

A terrorist attack or armed conflict could harm Unimin’s business.

Terrorist activities, anti-terrorist efforts and other armed conflicts involving the United States or other countries in which Unimin operates could
adversely affect the U.S. and global economies and could prevent Unimin from meeting its financial and other obligations. Unimin could experience
loss of business, delays or defaults in payments from payors or disruptions of fuel supplies and markets if pipelines, production facilities, processing
facilities or refineries are direct targets or indirect casualties of an act of terror or war. Such activities could reduce the overall demand for oil and gas,
which, in turn, could also reduce the demand for Unimin’s products and services. Terrorist activities and the threat of potential terrorist activities and any
resulting economic downturn could adversely affect Unimin’s results of operations, impair its ability to raise capital or otherwise adversely impact
Unimin’s ability to realize certain business strategies.

Unimin may incur substantial product liability exposure due to the use or misuse of its products, and its product liability insurance may be
insufficient to cover claims against Unimin.

Unimin’s business exposes Unimin to potential liability risks as a result of the use or misuse of its products. Unimin may face liability to its
distributors and customers and it could also face substantial liability for damages if the ultimate end use of its products causes harm to consumers and
other users. Any such failures or defects could affect Unimin’s relationships with its distributors and customers, harm its reputation in the market and
have an adverse effect on its business. In addition, if any judgments or liabilities are material in size, Unimin may be unable to satisfy such liabilities. It
is possible that widespread product liability claims could increase Unimin’s costs and adversely affect Unimin’s revenues and operating income.
Moreover, liability claims arising from a serious adverse event may increase Unimin’s costs through higher insurance premiums and deductibles and
may make it more difficult to secure adequate insurance coverage in the future. In addition, Unimin’s product liability insurance may fail to cover future
product liability claims, thereby requiring Unimin to pay substantial monetary damages and adversely affecting its business.

Failure to maintain effective quality control systems at its mining facilities and terminals could have a material adverse effect on Unimin’s
business, financial conditions and operations.

The performance, quality and safety of the products and services which Unimin offers to its customers are critical to the success of its business.
These factors depend significantly on the effectiveness of the quality control systems at Unimin’s facilities and terminals, which, in turn, depends on a
number of factors, including the design of its quality control systems, the effectiveness and consistency of its quality-training program and its ability to
ensure that its employees comply with its quality control policies and guidelines. Any significant failure or deterioration of Unimin’s quality control
systems could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations and reputation.

The increasing cost of employee healthcare may have an adverse effect on Unimin’s profitability.

The cost of providing healthcare coverage for its employees is becoming an increasingly significant operating cost for many companies, including
Unimin. If healthcare costs continue to increase at a rapid pace, Unimin may not pass on these costs to employees. Therefore, if Unimin is unable to
offset rising healthcare costs

through improved operating efficiencies and reduced expenditures, the increased costs of employee healthcare may have an adverse effect on its
profitability and operating results.

Risks Related to Environmental, Mining and Other Regulation

Unimin and its customers are subject to extensive environmental and health and safety regulations that impose, and will continue to impose,
significant costs and liabilities. In addition, future regulations, or more stringent enforcement of existing regulations, could increase those costs
and liabilities, which could adversely affect Unimin’s results of operations.

Unimin is subject to a variety of federal, state, provincial and local regulatory environmental requirements affecting the mining and mineral
processing industry, including, among others, those relating to employee health and safety, environmental permitting and licensing, air and water
emissions, greenhouse gas emissions, water pollution, waste management, remediation of soil and groundwater contamination, land use, reclamation
and restoration of properties, hazardous materials and natural resources. Some environmental laws impose substantial penalties for noncompliance, and
others, such as the U.S. Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA” or the “Superfund law”), impose strict,
retroactive and joint and several liability for the remediation of releases of hazardous substances. Liability under CERCLA, or similar state, provincial
and local laws in the jurisdictions where Unimin operates, may be imposed as a result of conduct that was lawful at the time it occurred or for the
conduct of, or conditions caused by, prior operators or other third parties. Failure to properly handle, transport, store or dispose of hazardous materials or
otherwise conduct operations in compliance with environmental laws could expose Unimin to liability for governmental penalties, cleanup costs and
civil or criminal liability associated with releases of such materials into the environment, damages to property or natural resources and other damages, as
well as potentially impair Unimin’s ability to conduct its operations. In addition, future environmental laws and regulations could restrict Unimin’s
ability to expand its facilities or extract its mineral reserves or could require Unimin to modify its operations, to acquire costly equipment or to incur
other significant expenses in connection with its business. Future events, including changes in any environmental requirements (or their interpretation or
enforcement) and the costs associated with complying with such requirements, could have a material adverse effect on Unimin.

Any failure by Unimin to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations may cause governmental authorities to take actions that
could adversely impact its operations and financial condition, including:
 

 •  issuance of administrative, civil and criminal penalties;
 

 •  denial, modification or revocation of permits or other authorizations;
 

 •  imposition of injunctive obligations or other limitations on Unimin’s operations, including cessation of operations; and
 

 •  requirements to perform site investigatory, remedial or other corrective actions.

Moreover, environmental requirements, and the interpretation and enforcement thereof, change frequently and have tended to become more
stringent over time. For example, greenhouse gas emission regulation is becoming more rigorous. Unimin is currently subject to greenhouse gas
reporting obligations with respect to its operations in Calera, Alabama and expects to be required to report annual greenhouse gas emissions from its
operations at other facilities to the EPA, and additional greenhouse gas emission related requirements at the supranational, federal, state, regional,
provincial and local levels are in various stages of development. In addition, Unimin is required to annually calculate greenhouse gas emissions for its
operations in Nephton, Ontario and St. Canut, Quebec in Canada and Canoitas and Jaltiplan in Mexico. The U.S. Congress has considered, and may
adopt in the future, various legislative proposals to address climate change, including a nationwide limit on greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, the
EPA has issued regulations, including the “Tailoring Rule,” that subject greenhouse gas emissions from certain stationary sources to the Prevention of
Significant Deterioration and Title V provisions of the federal Clean Air Act. Any such regulations in the United States, Canada or Mexico could require
Unimin to modify existing permits or obtain new permits, implement

Table of Contents

additional pollution control technology, curtail operations or significantly increase its operating costs. Any regulation of greenhouse gas emissions,
including, for example, through a cap-and trade system, technology mandate, emissions tax, reporting requirement or other program, could adversely
affect Unimin’s business, financial condition, reputation, operating performance and product demand.

In addition to environmental regulation, Unimin is subject to laws and regulations relating to human exposure to respirable crystalline silica.
Several federal and state regulatory authorities, including the U.S. Mining Safety and Health Administration (“MSHA”) and the U.S. Occupational
Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”), may continue to propose changes in their regulations regarding workplace exposure to respirable
crystalline silica, such as permissible exposure limits and required controls and personal protective equipment. For example, in June 2016, OSHA
adopted regulations that reduced permissible exposure limits to 50 micrograms of respirable crystalline silica per cubic meter of air, averaged over an
eight-hour day. Both the North American Industrial Minerals Association and the National Industrial Sand Association track silicosis related issues and
work with government policymakers in crafting such regulations.

Unimin may not be able to comply with any new laws and regulations that are adopted, and any new laws and regulations could have a material
adverse effect on Unimin’s operating results by requiring it to modify its operations or equipment or shut down some or all of its facilities. Additionally,
Unimin’s customers may not be able to comply with any new laws and regulations, and any new laws and regulations could have a material adverse
effect on Unimin’s customers by requiring them to shut down old facilities or to relocate facilities to locations with less stringent regulations farther
away from Unimin’s facilities. Unimin cannot at this time reasonably estimate its costs of compliance or the timing of any costs associated with any new
laws and regulations or any material adverse effect that any new standards will have on its customers and, consequently, on its operations.

Unimin is subject to the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 and the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, both of which impose
stringent health and safety standards on numerous aspects of its operations.

Unimin’s operations are subject to the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977, as amended by the Mine Improvement and New Emergency
Response Act of 2006. Unimin is also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970. These statutes and regulations adopted pursuant to
such statutes impose stringent health and safety standards on numerous aspects of mineral extraction and processing operations, including the training of
personnel, operating procedures, operating equipment and other matters. Unimin’s failure to comply with such standards, or changes in such standards
or the interpretation or enforcement thereof, could have a material adverse effect on Unimin’s business, financial condition and results of operations or
otherwise impose significant restrictions on its ability to conduct mineral extraction and processing operations.

Silica-related legislation, health issues and litigation could have a material adverse effect on Unimin’s business, reputation or results of
operations.

Unimin and its customers are subject to laws and regulations relating to human exposure to respirable crystalline silica. Several federal and state
regulatory authorities, including MSHA and OSHA, may continue to propose and implement changes in their regulations regarding workplace exposure
to respirable crystalline silica, such as permissible exposure limits and required controls and personal protective equipment. Unimin may not be able to
comply with any new laws and regulations that are adopted, and any new laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on Unimin’s
operating results by requiring it to modify or cease its operations.

In addition, the inhalation of respirable crystalline silica can lead to the lung disease silicosis. There is evidence of an association between
respirable silica exposure and lung cancer as well as a possible association with other diseases, including immune system disorders such as scleroderma.
These health risks have been, and may continue to be, a significant issue confronting the silica industry. Concerns over silicosis and other potential
adverse health effects, as well as concerns regarding potential liability from the use of silica, may have the effect of discouraging Unimin’s customers’
use of the company’s silica products. The actual or perceived health risks of mining, processing and handling silica could materially and adversely affect
silica producers, including

Unimin, through reduced use of silica products, the threat of product liability or employee lawsuits, increased scrutiny by federal, state and local
regulatory authorities of Unimin and its customers, or reduced financing sources available to the silica industry.

Unimin and/or its predecessors have been named as a defendant, usually among many defendants, in numerous products liability lawsuits alleging
damages caused by silica exposure, mostly brought by or on behalf of current or former employees of their customers. As of December 31, 2017, there
were 137 active silica-related products liability claims pending in which Unimin is a defendant. During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016,
Unimin was named as a defendant in 10 and five new claims, respectively, and resolved seven and five claims, respectively. Many of the claims pending
against Unimin arise out of the alleged use of its silica products in foundries or as an abrasive blast media and have been filed in the states of Ohio and
Mississippi, although cases have been brought in many other jurisdictions over the years. In accordance with Unimin’s insurance obligations, these
claims are being defended by Unimin’s subsidiaries’ insurance carriers, subject to Unimin’s payment of a percentage of the defense costs. Based on
information currently available, management cannot reasonably estimate a loss at this time. Although the outcomes of these claims cannot be predicted
with certainty, in Unimin’s view, none of these cases, individually or in the aggregate, are probable to have a material adverse effect on Unimin’s
business, financial condition and results of operations.

Federal, state and local legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing and the potential for related litigation could result
in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays for Unimin’s customers, which could cause a decline in the demand for its
sand-based proppants and negatively impact its business, financial condition and results of operations.

A significant portion of Unimin’s business supplies frac sand to hydraulic fracturing operators in the oil and natural gas industry. Although Unimin
does not directly engage in hydraulic fracturing activities, its customers purchase frac sand for use in their hydraulic fracturing operations. Hydraulic
fracturing is a widely used industry production technique that is used to recover natural gas and/or oil from dense subsurface rock formations. The
process involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals, under pressure, into the formation to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production.

The hydraulic fracturing process has historically been regulated by state or local governmental authorities. However, the practice of hydraulic
fracturing has become controversial in some areas and is undergoing increased scrutiny. Several federal agencies, regulatory authorities and legislative
entities are investigating the potential environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing and whether additional regulation may be necessary. The EPA has
asserted limited federal regulatory authority over hydraulic fracturing and has indicated it may seek to further expand its regulation of hydraulic
fracturing. The Bureau of Land Management has proposed regulations applicable to hydraulic fracturing conducted on federal and Indian oil and gas
leases. Congress has from time to time considered the adoption of legislation to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing.

In addition, various state, local and foreign governments have implemented, or are considering, increased regulatory oversight of hydraulic
fracturing through additional permitting requirements, operational restrictions, disclosure requirements and temporary or permanent bans on hydraulic
fracturing in certain areas such as environmentally sensitive watersheds. For example, Vermont and New York banned hydraulic fracturing in 2012 and
2015, respectively. A number of local municipalities across the United States have instituted measures resulting in temporary or permanent bans on or
otherwise limiting or delaying hydraulic fracturing in their jurisdictions. Such moratoriums and bans could make it more difficult to conduct hydraulic
fracturing operations and increase Unimin’s customers’ cost of doing business, which could negatively impact demand for Unimin’s frac sand products.
In addition, new OSHA rules regulating certain aspects of the use of silica in the hydraulic fracturing industry and becoming effective in 2021 will
increase costs for companies in the hydraulic fracturing industry by compelling them to meet the same standards for employees that Unimin currently
satisfies. A number of states—including the major oil and gas producing states of North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Texas and West
Virginia—have also enacted legislation or issued regulations that impose various disclosure requirements on hydraulic fracturing operators. The
availability of information regarding the constituents of hydraulic fracturing fluids could make it easier for third parties opposing the hydraulic
fracturing process to

Table of Contents

initiate individual or class action legal proceedings based on allegations that specific chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process could adversely
affect groundwater and drinking water supplies or otherwise cause harm to human health or the environment. Moreover, disclosure to third parties or to
the public, even if inadvertent, of Unimin’s customers’ proprietary chemical formulas could diminish the value of those formulas and result in
competitive harm to such customers, which could indirectly impact Unimin’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

Although Unimin does not conduct hydraulic fracturing, the adoption of new laws or regulations at the federal, state, local or foreign levels
imposing reporting obligations on, or otherwise limiting or delaying, the hydraulic fracturing process could make it more difficult to complete oil and
natural gas wells, increase Unimin’s customers’ costs of compliance and doing business and otherwise adversely affect the hydraulic fracturing services
they perform, which could negatively impact demand for Unimin’s sand-based proppants. In addition, heightened political, regulatory and public
scrutiny of hydraulic fracturing practices, including nuisance lawsuits, could expose Unimin or its customers to increased legal and regulatory
proceedings, which could be time-consuming, costly or result in substantial legal liability or significant reputational harm. Unimin could be directly
affected by adverse litigation involving the company or indirectly affected if the cost of compliance limits the ability of its customers to operate. Such
costs and scrutiny could directly or indirectly, through reduced demand for Unimin’s sand-based proppants, have a material adverse effect on Unimin’s
business, financial condition and results of operations.

Unimin and its customers are subject to other extensive regulations, including licensing, plant and wildlife protection and reclamation
regulations, that impose, and will continue to impose, significant costs and liabilities. In addition, future regulations, or more stringent
enforcement of existing regulations, could increase those costs and liabilities, which could adversely affect Unimin’s results of operations.

In addition to the regulatory matters described above, Unimin and its customers are subject to extensive governmental regulation on matters such
as permitting and licensing requirements, plant and wildlife protection, wetlands protection, reclamation and restoration of mining properties after
mining is completed. Unimin’s future success depends, among other things, on the quantity of its mineral reserves and its ability to extract these reserves
profitably and its customers being able to operate their businesses as they currently do.

In order to obtain permits and renewals of permits in the future, Unimin may be required to prepare and present data to governmental authorities
pertaining to the impact that any proposed exploration or production activities, individually or in the aggregate, may have on the environment. Certain
approval procedures may require preparation of archaeological surveys, endangered species studies and other studies to assess the environmental impact
of new sites or the expansion of existing sites. Compliance with these regulatory requirements is expensive and significantly lengthens the time needed
to develop a site. Finally, obtaining or renewing required permits is sometimes delayed or prevented due to community opposition, including nuisance
lawsuits, and other factors beyond Unimin’s control. The denial of a permit essential to Unimin’s operations or the imposition of conditions with which
it is not practicable or feasible to comply could impair or prevent Unimin’s ability to develop or expand a site. New legal requirements, including those
related to the protection of the environment, or the identification of certain species as “threatened” or “endangered” could be adopted that could
materially adversely affect Unimin’s mining operations (including its ability to extract mineral reserves), Unimin’s cost structure or Unimin’s customers’
ability to use its sand-based proppants. Such current or future regulations could have a material adverse effect on Unimin’s business and Unimin may
not be able to obtain or renew permits in the future.

Unimin’s inability to acquire, maintain or renew financial assurances related to the reclamation and restoration of mining property could have
a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.

Unimin is generally obligated to restore property in accordance with regulatory standards and Unimin’s approved reclamation plan after it has
been mined. Unimin is required under federal, state and local laws to maintain financial assurances, such as surety bonds, to secure such obligations.
The inability to acquire, maintain or renew such assurances, as required by federal, state and local laws, could subject Unimin to fines and penalties

Table of Contents

as well as the revocation of Unimin’s operating permits. Such inability could result from a variety of factors, including:
 

 •  the lack of availability, higher expense or unreasonable terms of such financial assurances;
 

 •  the ability of current and future financial assurance counterparties to increase required collateral; and
 

 •  the exercise by financial assurance counterparties of any rights to refuse to renew the financial assurance instruments.

Unimin’s inability to acquire, maintain or renew necessary financial assurances related to the reclamation and restoration of mining property could
have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.

Risks Related to the Combined Company’s Indebtedness

Following the Merger, the combined company’s substantial indebtedness and pension obligations could adversely affect its financial flexibility
and competitive position.

As of December 31, 2017, after giving pro forma effect to the Merger and related transactions and the incurrence of indebtedness in connection
therewith, the combined company would have had approximately $1.6 billion of outstanding long-term indebtedness and would have been able to
borrow an additional $200 million under the revolving credit facility.

Unimin also has, and the combined company will continue to have, significant pension obligations. As of December 31, 2017, the underfunded
amount of Unimin’s pension plans was approximately $97.8 million. Unimin also contributes to several multi-employer pension plans based on
obligations arising under collective bargaining agreements with unions representing employees covered by those agreements. Approximately 9.5% of
Unimin’s current U.S. employees are participants in such multiemployer plans. In 2017, Unimin’s total contributions to these plans were approximately
$8.1 million. Fairmount Santrol previously participated in a multiemployer defined benefit pension plan. Fairmount Santrol withdrew from the plan in
October 2015 and has recorded a liability of approximately $9.3 million as of December 31, 2016, which is payable in annual installments until
November 2035.

The combined company’s indebtedness and pension obligations could have important consequences and significant effects on its business. For
example, it could:
 

 •  increase the combined company’s vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions;
 

 
•  require the combined company to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations to make payments on its indebtedness and

pension obligations, thereby reducing the availability of its cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other general
corporate purposes;

 

 •  limit the combined company’s flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in its business and the industries in which it operates;
 

 •  restrict the combined company from exploiting business opportunities;
 

 •  make it more difficult to satisfy the combined company’s financial obligations, including payments on its indebtedness;
 

 •  place the combined company at a disadvantage compared to its competitors that have less debt and fewer pension obligations; and
 

 
•  limit the combined company’s ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, railcar or other future purchase

commitments, acquisitions, debt service requirements, execution of its business strategy or other general corporate purposes.

In addition, the combined company will have exposure to increases in interest rates under its senior secured long-term indebtedness, including the
revolving credit facility, which will accrue interest at variable rates. As of

9/26/2019 DEFM14A

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1010858/000119312518134923/d493258ddefm14a.htm 85/315

Table of Contents

December 31, 2017, after giving pro forma effect to the Merger and the incurrence of indebtedness in connection therewith, the combined company
would have had $1.6 billion of debt outstanding. As a result of this variable interest rate debt, the combined company’s financial condition could be
adversely affected by increases in interest rates.

The agreements governing the combined company’s indebtedness will contain covenants and substantial restrictions that may restrict the
combined company’s business and financing activities.

The agreements that will govern the combined company’s term loan and revolving credit facility will contain, and any future financing agreements
that the combined company may enter into will likely contain, operating and financial restrictions and covenants that may restrict the combined
company’s ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in, expand or pursue its business activities. These covenants will include,
among other things, limitations on the incurrence of indebtedness, the incurrence of liens, investments, asset sales, affiliate transactions, repurchases of
equity securities, the declaration and payment of dividends, and mergers, consolidations and other fundamental transactions. In addition, the revolving
credit facility will include a total net debt covenant, to be tested on a quarterly basis, commencing with the first full fiscal quarter after the closing date
of the facilities, of no more than 4.5:1, to step down to 4.00:1 for the quarter ended December 31, 2018.

The combined company’s ability to comply with these restrictions and covenants is uncertain and will be affected by the levels of cash flow from
operations and events or circumstances beyond the combined company’s control. If market or other economic conditions deteriorate, the combined
company’s ability to comply with these covenants may be impaired. If the combined company violates any of the restrictions, covenants, ratios or tests
in its debt agreements, a significant portion of the combined company’s indebtedness may become immediately due and payable and the lenders’
commitment to make further loans to the combined company may terminate. The combined company might not have, or be able to obtain, sufficient
funds to make these accelerated payments. Even if the combined company could obtain alternative financing, that financing may not be on terms that are
favorable or acceptable to the combined company. In addition, the combined company’s obligations under its debt agreements will be secured by
substantially all of its assets, and if the combined company is unable to repay its indebtedness under these agreements, the lenders could seek to
foreclose on the combined company’s assets and could initiate a bankruptcy proceeding or liquidation proceeding against the collateral.

The combined company may need to incur substantial additional debt in the future in order to maintain or increase its production levels and to
otherwise pursue its business plan. The combined company may not be able to borrow funds successfully or, if it can, this debt may impair its
ability to operate its business.

A significant amount of capital expenditures will be required to grow the combined company’s production capacity. If prices for the products the
combined company produces were to decline for an extended period of time, if the costs of acquisition and development opportunities were to increase
substantially or if other events were to occur which reduced the combined company’s sales or increased its costs, the combined company may be
required to borrow in the future to enable the combined company to finance its anticipated capital expenditures and other growth opportunities. The cost
of the borrowings and the combined company’s obligations to repay the borrowings could have important consequences, because:

purposes may be impaired or such financing may not be available on favorable terms, or at all;
 

 
•  covenants contained in the combined company’s existing and future credit and debt arrangements may require the combined company to

indebtedness, reducing the funds that would otherwise be available for operations and future business opportunities; and

The combined company’s ability to service its indebtedness will depend on, among other things, the combined company’s future financial and
operating performance, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial, business, regulatory and other factors, some of which
are beyond the combined company’s control. If the combined company’s operating results are not sufficient to generate cash flows in order to service its
current or future indebtedness, the combined company would be forced to take actions such as reducing or delaying business activities, acquisitions,
investments and/or capital expenditures, selling assets, restructuring or refinancing its indebtedness or seeking additional equity capital or bankruptcy
protection. The combined company may not be able to effect any of these remedies on satisfactory terms or at all.

Risks Related to the Proposed Merger

There is no assurance when or if the proposed Merger will be completed.

Completion of the proposed Merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of a number of conditions as set forth in the Merger Agreement,
including regulatory approval, Fairmount Santrol stockholder approval and other closing conditions. There can be no assurance that the conditions to
completion of the proposed Merger will be satisfied or waived or that other events will not intervene to delay or result in the failure to close the
proposed Merger.

In addition, each of Unimin and Fairmount Santrol may unilaterally terminate the Merger Agreement under certain circumstances, and Unimin
and Fairmount Santrol may agree at any time to terminate the Merger Agreement, even if Fairmount Santrol stockholders have already approved the
Fairmount Santrol Merger proposal and thereby approved the proposed Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. For a
discussion of the conditions to the completion of the proposed Merger and the provisions relating to the termination of the proposed Merger, see the
sections entitled “The Merger Agreement—Conditions to Closing of the Merger” and “The Merger Agreement—Termination” beginning on page 203
and page 205, respectively, of this proxy statement/prospectus.

Regulatory approvals necessary to complete the proposed Merger may not be received, may take longer than expected or may impose
conditions that are not presently anticipated or that cannot be met.

In addition to other conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, completion of the proposed Merger is conditioned upon the receipt of various
regulatory approvals. Unimin and Fairmount Santrol have made various filings and submissions and are pursuing all required consents, orders and
approvals in accordance with the Merger Agreement. For a discussion of the required regulatory approvals, see the sections entitled “The Merger—
Regulatory Approvals Required for the Merger” and “The Merger Agreement—Regulatory Approvals” beginning on page 165 and page 199,
respectively, of this proxy statement/prospectus.

Regulatory and governmental entities may impose conditions on the granting of such approvals and if such regulatory and governmental entities
seek to impose such conditions, lengthy negotiations may ensue among such regulatory or governmental entities, Fairmount Santrol and Unimin. Such
conditions and the process of obtaining regulatory approvals could have the effect of delaying the closing of the Merger and such conditions may not be
satisfied for an extended period of time following the special meeting. Such conditions may also impose additional costs or limitations on the combined
company following the closing of the Merger, including a requirement that Fairmount Santrol or Unimin divest certain assets if necessary in order to
obtain certain regulatory approvals, and may limit the ability of the combined company to integrate the Fairmount Santrol and Unimin businesses. These
conditions may therefore reduce the anticipated benefits of the Merger, which could also have a material adverse effect on the combined company’s
business and cash flows and results of operations, and neither Fairmount Santrol nor Unimin can predict what, if any, changes may be required by
regulatory or governmental authorities whose approvals are required. If such consents, orders and approvals require an extended period of time to be
obtained, such extended period of time could increase the chance that an event occurs that constitutes a material adverse effect with respect to Unimin or
Fairmount Santrol and thereby may offer the other party an opportunity not to complete the proposed Merger. Such extended period of time also may
increase the chance that other adverse effects with respect to Unimin or Fairmount Santrol could occur, such as the loss of key personnel. Further, no
assurance can be given that the required consents, orders and approvals will

be obtained, that they can be obtained in a timely manner or that the required conditions to the closing of the Merger will be satisfied, and, even if all
such consents, orders and approvals are obtained and such conditions are satisfied, no assurance can be given as to the terms, conditions and timing of
such consents, orders and approvals.

The special meeting may take place before all of the required regulatory approvals have been obtained and before all conditions to such approvals,
if any, are known. In this event, if the Fairmount Santrol Merger proposal is approved by Fairmount Santrol stockholders, Unimin and Fairmount Santrol
may agree to, or be subjected to, certain regulatory conditions after such Fairmount Santrol stockholder approval is obtained and would not be required
to seek further approval of Fairmount Santrol stockholders, even if such conditions could have an adverse effect on Unimin, Fairmount Santrol or the
combined company.

Fairmount Santrol or Unimin may waive one or more of the closing conditions without resoliciting stockholder approval.

Fairmount Santrol or Unimin may determine to waive, in whole or in part, one or more of the conditions to its obligations to consummate the
Merger. Fairmount Santrol and Unimin currently expect to evaluate the materiality of any waiver and its effect on Fairmount Santrol stockholders in
light of the facts and circumstances at the time to determine whether any amendment of this proxy statement/prospectus or any re-solicitation of proxies
or voting cards is required in light of such waiver. Any determination whether to waive any condition to the Merger or as to re-soliciting stockholder
approval or amending this proxy statement/prospectus as a result of a waiver will be made by Fairmount Santrol or Unimin, as applicable, at the time of
such waiver based on the facts and circumstances as they exist at that time.

Unimin and Fairmount Santrol will be subject to business uncertainties while the Merger is pending.

Uncertainty about the closing or effect of the Merger may affect the relationship between Unimin and Fairmount Santrol and their respective
suppliers, customers, distributors, licensors and licensees during the pendency of the Merger. Any such impact may have an adverse effect on Unimin
and/or Fairmount Santrol, and consequently on the combined company. These uncertainties may cause parties that deal with Unimin and/or Fairmount
Santrol to seek to change existing business relationships with them and to delay or defer decisions concerning Unimin or Fairmount Santrol. Changes to
existing business relationships, including termination or modification, could negatively affect each of Unimin’s and Fairmount Santrol’s revenue,
earnings and cash flow, as well as the market price of Fairmount Santrol common stock. Adverse effects arising from the pendency of the Merger could
be exacerbated by any delays in closing of the Merger or termination of the Merger Agreement.

Additionally, the attention of Unimin’s and Fairmount Santrol’s management may be directed towards the completion of the proposed Merger,
including obtaining regulatory approvals and other transaction-related considerations, and may be diverted from the day-to-day business operations of
Unimin and Fairmount Santrol, as applicable, and matters related to the proposed Merger may require commitments of time and resources that could
otherwise have been devoted to other opportunities that might have been beneficial to Unimin and Fairmount Santrol, as applicable. Further, the
proposed Merger may give rise to potential liabilities, including as a result of pending and future stockholder lawsuits relating to the proposed Merger.
Any of these matters could adversely affect the businesses of, or harm the results of operations, financial condition or cash flows of, Unimin and
Fairmount Santrol.

Unimin and Fairmount Santrol may face challenges in attracting and retaining key personnel during the pendency of the Merger.

Each of Unimin and Fairmount Santrol is dependent on the experience and industry knowledge of their respective officers, key management
personnel and other key employees to operate their businesses and execute their respective business plans. The combined company’s success after the
Merger will depend in part upon the ability of Unimin and Fairmount Santrol to retain key management personnel and other key employees and to
attract new management personnel and other key employees. Current and prospective employees of Unimin and Fairmount Santrol may experience
uncertainty about their roles within the combined company during and following the Merger, which may have an adverse effect on the ability of each of
Unimin and Fairmount Santrol to attract or retain key management personnel and other key employees. If key employees depart because of

Table of Contents

issues related to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain with the businesses, the combined company’s business following
the closing of the Merger could be negatively impacted. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that the combined company will be able to attract or
retain key management personnel and other key employees of Unimin and Fairmount Santrol to the same extent that they have previously been able to
attract or retain their employees. Adverse effects arising from the pendency of the Merger could be exacerbated by any delays in closing of the Merger
or termination of the Merger Agreement.

Unimin and Fairmount Santrol will be subject to certain contractual restrictions while the Merger is pending.

The Merger Agreement restricts each of Unimin and Fairmount Santrol from making certain acquisitions and divestitures, entering into certain
contracts, incurring certain indebtedness and expenditures, paying certain dividends, repurchasing or issuing securities and taking other specified actions
without the consent of the other party until the earlier of the closing of the Merger or the termination of the Merger Agreement. These restrictions may
prevent Unimin and/or Fairmount Santrol from pursuing attractive business opportunities that may arise prior to the closing of the Merger and could
have the effect of delaying or preventing other strategic transactions. Adverse effects arising from the pendency of the Merger could be exacerbated by
any delays in closing of the Merger or termination of the Merger Agreement. See “The Merger Agreement—Conduct of Business Prior to the Closing of
the Merger” beginning on page 193 of this proxy statement/prospectus.

Third parties may terminate or alter existing contracts or relationships with Unimin or Fairmount Santrol.

Each of Unimin and Fairmount Santrol has contracts with customers, suppliers, vendors, distributors, affiliates, landlords, licensors, joint venture
partners and other business partners, which may require Unimin or Fairmount Santrol, as applicable, to obtain consent from these other parties in
connection with the Merger. If these consents cannot be obtained, the counterparties to these contracts and other third parties with which Unimin and/or
Fairmount Santrol currently have relationships may have the ability to terminate, reduce the scope of or otherwise materially adversely alter their
relationships with either or both parties in anticipation of the Merger, or with the combined company following the Merger. The pursuit of such rights
may result in Unimin, Fairmount Santrol or the combined company suffering a loss of potential future revenue or incurring liabilities in connection with
a breach of such agreements and losing rights that are material to its business. Any such disruptions could limit the combined company’s ability to
achieve the anticipated benefits of the Merger. The adverse effect of such disruptions could also be exacerbated by a delay in the closing of the Merger
or the termination of the Merger Agreement.

Unimin may not be able to obtain financing to make the cash payments contemplated at the closing of the Merger.

In addition to the issuance of common stock as the Stock Consideration, Unimin plans to fund the Cash Consideration and the Cash Redemption,
and to refinance certain indebtedness of Fairmount Santrol and Unimin, from debt financing to be provided by the lenders pursuant to the debt
commitment letter, as more fully described in the section entitled “The Merger—Refinancing of Indebtedness of Fairmount Santrol and Unimin”
beginning on page 161 of this proxy statement/prospectus. The availability of any debt financing is subject to certain conditions precedent. Therefore,
Unimin cannot assure you that the financing pursuant to the debt commitment letter will be available. There can be no assurance that Unimin will be
able to obtain financing on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.

Unimin and Fairmount Santrol will incur substantial transaction fees and costs in connection with the proposed Merger and the integration of
their businesses.

Unimin and Fairmount Santrol have incurred and expect to incur additional material non-recurring expenses in connection with the proposed
Merger and completion of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements. Additional unanticipated costs may
be incurred in the course of coordinating the businesses of Unimin and Fairmount Santrol after the completion of the proposed Merger. Unimin and
Fairmount Santrol cannot be certain that the elimination of duplicative costs or the realization of

Table of Contents

other efficiencies related to the coordination of the two businesses after the completion of the proposed Merger will offset the transaction and
coordination costs in the near term or at all.

There are a large number of processes, policies, procedures, operations, technologies and systems that must be integrated in connection with the
Merger. While both Unimin and Fairmount Santrol have assumed that a certain level of expenses would be incurred in connection with the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, there are many factors beyond their control that could affect the total amount of, or the
timing of, anticipated expenses with respect to the integration and implementation of the combined businesses.

There may also be additional unanticipated significant costs in connection with the Merger that the combined company may not recoup. These
costs and expenses could reduce the benefits and additional income Unimin and Fairmount Santrol expect to achieve from the Merger. Although Unimin
and Fairmount Santrol expect that the benefits of the Merger will offset the transaction expenses and integration costs over time, no assurance can be
given that any benefits will be achieved in the near term, if at all.

Further, even if the proposed Merger is not completed, Unimin and Fairmount Santrol will need to pay certain pre-tax costs relating to the
proposed Merger incurred prior to the date the proposed Merger was abandoned, such as legal, accounting, financial advisory, filing and printing fees,
reorganization and restructuring costs, employee benefit-related expenses and other related charges. Additionally, if the proposed Merger is not
completed within the expected timeframe, such delay may materially adversely affect the benefits that Unimin and Fairmount Santrol may achieve as a
result of the proposed Merger and could result in additional pre-tax transaction costs, loss of revenue or other effects associated with uncertainty about
the proposed Merger. Satisfying the conditions to, and completion of, the proposed Merger may take longer than, and could cost more than, Unimin and
Fairmount Santrol expect.

The unaudited pro forma combined financial information contained in this proxy statement/prospectus is presented for illustrative purposes
only and may not be an indication of the combined company’s results of operations or financial condition following the closing of the proposed
Merger.

This proxy statement/prospectus includes unaudited pro forma combined financial information for the combined company, which give effect to the
Merger, the HPQ Carveout, the Cash Redemption, the refinancing of indebtedness of both Unimin and Fairmount Santrol and related transactions, and
should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and accompanying notes of Unimin and Fairmount Santrol, which are included or
incorporated by reference in this proxy statement/prospectus. The unaudited pro forma combined financial information contained in this proxy
statement/prospectus is presented for illustrative purposes only and should not be considered to be an indication of the combined company’s results of
operations or financial condition following the closing of the Merger. The unaudited pro forma combined financial information has been derived from
the historical financial statements of Unimin and Fairmount Santrol and adjustments, assumptions and preliminary estimates have been made in
connection with the preparation of this information. The information upon which these adjustments and assumptions have been made is preliminary, and
these kinds of adjustments, assumptions and estimates are difficult to make with accuracy.

Moreover, the unaudited pro forma combined financial information does not reflect all costs that are expected to be incurred by the combined
company in connection with the Merger. For example, the impact of any incremental costs incurred in coordinating the operations of Unimin and
Fairmount Santrol are not reflected in the unaudited pro forma combined financial information. In addition, the unaudited pro forma combined financial
information does not include, among other things, estimated cost or growth synergies, adjustments related to restructuring or integration activities, future
acquisitions or disposals not yet known or probable, including those that may be required by regulatory or governmental authorities in connection with
the Merger, or impacts of Merger-related change in control provisions that are currently not factually supportable and/or probable of occurring.

As a result, the actual results of operations and financial condition of the combined company following the closing of the Merger may not be
consistent with, or evident from, this unaudited pro forma combined financial

information. The assumptions used in preparing the unaudited pro forma combined financial information may not prove to be accurate, and other factors
may affect the combined company’s results of operations or financial condition following the closing of the Merger. Any potential decline in the
combined company’s financial condition or results of operations may cause significant variations in the price of the combined company common stock
following the closing of the Merger.

The unaudited pro forma combined financial information in this proxy statement/prospectus is based on the best information available, which in
part includes a number of estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions may prove not to be accurate, and accordingly, the unaudited pro
forma combined financial information should not be assumed to be indicative of what the combined company’s financial condition, results of operations
or cash flows actually would have been as a stand-alone company or to be a reliable indicator of what the combined company’s financial condition or
results of operations may actually be in the future.

Unimin’s historical financial information included in this proxy statement/prospectus is not necessarily representative of the results Unimin
would have achieved as an independent company and may not be a reliable indicator of the combined company’s future results.

Unimin’s historical financial information included in this proxy statement/prospectus may not reflect what Unimin’s financial condition, results of
operations and cash flows would have been if it had been an independent company during the periods presented or what the combined company’s
financial condition, results of operations and cash flows will be in the future when it becomes an independent company. This is primarily because:
 

 •  Prior to the closing of the Merger, Unimin’s business was operated by Sibelco as part of its group, rather than as an independent company.
 

 

•  Certain of Unimin’s working capital requirements and capital requirements for its general corporate purposes, including acquisitions and
capital expenditures, historically have been satisfied as part of the group-wide cash management practices of Sibelco. While Unimin’s
business historically has generated sufficient cash to finance its working capital and other cash requirements, following the closing of the
Merger, the combined company will no longer have access to Sibelco’s global credit facilities and treasury management services. Without
the opportunity to obtain financing from Sibelco, the combined company may need to obtain additional financing from banks, through
public offerings or private placements of debt or equity securities or other arrangements.

 

 
•  The combined company will enter into agreements with Sibelco that did not exist prior to the closing of the Merger, and will modify certain

existing arrangements between Unimin and Sibelco. For more information, see “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions—
Relationship with Sibelco.”

 

 
•  Other significant changes may occur in the combined company’s cost structure, management, financing, tax profile and business operations

as a result of its operating as a company separate from Sibelco following the closing of the Merger.

For more information about Unimin’s past financial performance and the basis of presentation of its financial statements, see “Selected Historical
Consolidated Financial Data of Unimin” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of Unimin”
beginning on page 96 and page 291, respectively, and Unimin’s financial statements and the notes thereto, copies of which are attached as Annex F to
this proxy statement/prospectus.

The combined company may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the Mergers.

The success of the Mergers will depend on, among other things, the combined company’s ability to combine the Unimin and Fairmount Santrol
businesses in a manner that realizes anticipated synergies and meets or exceeds the projected stand-alone cost savings and revenue growth trends
anticipated by each company. On a combined basis, the combined company expects to benefit from significant synergies, including integrating and
optimizing the supply chains of Unimin and Fairmount Santrol in order to reduce logistics costs, improve mine yields, decrease cycle times of the
companies’ combined rail fleet and optimize the combined company’s footprint. In the longer term, the combined company will evaluate applying
Fairmount Santrol’s coating

technologies to other minerals and applications in industries Unimin serves, advancing both companies’ collective dust control technologies, growing
Fairmount Santrol’s blending businesses across Unimin’s assets and geographies and leveraging the best operational and commercial excellence
programs of each company across the combined business. If the combined company is not able to successfully achieve these objectives, or the cost to
achieve these synergies is greater than expected, then the anticipated benefits of the Mergers may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to
realize than expected.

The combined company must achieve the anticipated savings and synergies in a timely manner and without adversely affecting current revenues
and investments in future growth. In addition, the combined company must successfully combine the businesses of Fairmount Santrol and Unimin in a
manner that permits the anticipated savings and synergies to be realized. If the combined company is not able to successfully achieve these objectives,
the anticipated benefits of the Mergers may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected. A variety of factors may adversely
affect the combined company’s ability to realize the currently expected operating synergies, savings and other benefits of the Mergers, including the
failure to successfully optimize the combined company’s facilities footprint, the failure to take advantage of the combined company’s supply chain, the
failure to identify and eliminate duplicative programs and the failure to otherwise integrate Fairmount Santrol’s and Unimin’s respective businesses.

The financial analyses and forecasts considered by Fairmount Santrol, Unimin and their respective financial advisors may not be realized,
which may adversely affect the market price of the combined company common stock following the closing of the Merger.

In performing its financial analysis and rendering its opinion regarding the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the Merger Consideration,
Fairmount Santrol’s financial advisor relied on, among other things, internal stand-alone financial analyses and forecasts provided by Fairmount Santrol.
See “The Merger—Certain Unaudited Financial Forecasts of Fairmount Santrol and Unimin.” None of these analyses or forecasts were prepared with a
view towards public disclosure or compliance with the published guidelines of the SEC, U.S. GAAP or the guidelines established by the American
Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation and presentation of financial forecasts. These projections are inherently based on various
estimates and assumptions that are subject to the judgment of those preparing them. These projections are also subject to significant economic,
competitive, industry and other uncertainties and contingencies, all of which are difficult or impossible to predict and many of which are beyond the
control of Fairmount Santrol and Unimin. Important factors that may affect the actual results of Unimin and Fairmount Santrol and cause the internal
financial forecasts to not be achieved include risks and uncertainties relating to Unimin’s and Fairmount Santrol’s businesses, industry performance, the
regulatory environment, general business and economic conditions and other factors described under the section entitled “Cautionary Statement
Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” in this proxy statement/prospectus.

In addition, the financial forecasts also reflect assumptions that are subject to change and do not reflect revised prospects for Unimin’s and
Fairmount Santrol’s businesses, changes in general business or economic conditions or any other transaction or event that has occurred or that may
occur and that was not anticipated at the time the financial forecasts were prepared. In addition, since such financial forecasts cover multiple years, the
information by its nature becomes less predictive with each successive year. There can be no assurance that Unimin’s, Fairmount Santrol’s or the
combined company’s financial condition or results of operations will be consistent with those set forth in such analyses and forecasts.

Combining the businesses of Unimin and Fairmount Santrol may be more difficult, costly or time-consuming than expected, which may
adversely affect the combined company’s results of operations and negatively affect the value of the combined company common stock
following the closing of the Merger.

Unimin and Fairmount Santrol have entered into the Merger Agreement because each believes that the Merger will be beneficial to its respective
company and stockholders and that combining the businesses of Unimin and Fairmount Santrol will produce cost synergies and other benefits. However,
Unimin and Fairmount Santrol have historically operated as independent companies and will continue to do so until the closing of the Merger.
Following the closing of the Merger, the combined company’s management will need to integrate

Table of Contents

Unimin’s and Fairmount Santrol’s respective businesses. The combination of two independent businesses of the size and scale of Unimin and Fairmount
Santrol is a complex, costly and time consuming process and the management of the combined company may face significant challenges in
implementing such integration, some of which may be beyond their control including, without limitation:
 

 •  difficulties in achieving, in a timely manner, anticipated cost savings, synergies, business opportunities and growth prospects;
 

 •  difficulties in managing a larger combined company, addressing differences in historical business culture and retaining key personnel;
 

 
•  the diversion of Unimin’s and Fairmount Santrol’s respective management teams’ attention from ongoing business operations as a result of

the Merger;
 

 •  the possibility of incorrect assumptions underlying expectations regarding the integration process;
 

 
•  unanticipated difficulties in integrating information technology, communications programs, financial procedures and operations and other

systems (including those provided by third party service providers), procedures and policies;
 

 •  difficulty addressing possible differences in corporate cultures and management philosophies;
 

 •  unforeseen and unexpected liabilities related to the Mergers or Unimin’s or Fairmount Santrol’s business;
 

 •  any potential deterioration of credit ratings resulting from the Merger;
 

 •  unanticipated changes in applicable laws and regulations;
 

 •  managing tax costs or inefficiencies associated with integrating the operations of the combined company;
 

 •  combining separate organizations located in different regions of the country; and
 

 •  any other unforeseen expenses or delays associated with the Merger.

Some of these factors will be outside of the control of Unimin and Fairmount Santrol and any one of them could result in increased costs or
decreased revenue, which could materially impact the combined company’s business, financial condition and results of operations as well as increase the
risk of operational errors due to management teams being diverted from ongoing business concerns, which could have negative reputational or
regulatory impacts. The integration process and other disruptions resulting from the Merger may also adversely affect the combined company’s
relationships with employees, suppliers, customers, distributors, licensors and others with whom Unimin and Fairmount Santrol have business or other
dealings, and difficulties in integrating the businesses of Unimin and Fairmount Santrol could harm the reputation of the combined company.

If the combined company is not able to combine the businesses of Unimin and Fairmount Santrol successfully in an efficient, cost-effective and
timely manner, the anticipated benefits and cost synergies of the Mergers may not be realized fully, or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected,
and the value of the combined company common stock or the revenue, levels of expenses and results of operations of the combined company may be
affected adversely. If the combined company is not able to adequately address integration challenges, the combined company may be unable to
successfully realize the anticipated benefits of the Merger.

Further, while either party can, in general, refuse to complete the proposed Merger if there is a material adverse effect (as defined in the Merger
Agreement) affecting the other party prior to the completion of the proposed Merger, certain types of changes do not permit either party to refuse to
complete the proposed Merger, even if such changes would have a material adverse effect on Unimin or Fairmount Santrol. If adverse changes occur but
Unimin and Fairmount Santrol must still complete the proposed Merger, the market price of the combined company common stock may suffer. There
can be no assurance that, if the proposed Merger is not completed, these risks will not materialize and will not materially adversely affect the business
and financial results of Unimin and Fairmount Santrol as separate companies.

If a Fairmount Santrol stockholder exercises statutory appraisal rights, the value such stockholder receives could be less than the value of the
Merger Consideration such stockholder would otherwise receive pursuant to the Merger Agreement.

Subject to the closing of the Merger, record holders of Fairmount Santrol common stock who do not vote in favor of the Fairmount Santrol Merger
proposal and who otherwise properly exercise and perfect their appraisal rights in accordance with Section 262 will be entitled to seek appraisal for, and
obtain payment in cash for the judicially determined fair value of, their shares of Fairmount Santrol common stock, in lieu of receiving the Merger
Consideration. The “fair value” could be higher or lower than, or the same as, the Merger Consideration. For more information regarding appraisal
rights, see the section entitled “Appraisal Rights of Fairmount Santrol Stockholders” beginning on page 361 of this proxy statement/prospectus. Failure
to strictly comply with Section 262 may result in a waiver of, or the inability to exercise, appraisal rights. In that event, a Fairmount Santrol stockholder
will be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration for his or her shares in accordance with the Merger Agreement. In view of the complexity of the
procedures specified in Section 262, Fairmount Santrol stockholders who wish to pursue appraisal rights are encouraged to seek the advice of legal
counsel.

If a substantial number of dissenting Fairmount Santrol stockholders demand appraisal rights under Delaware law, the combined company’s
ability to fund growth initiatives or to achieve other anticipated benefits of the Merger could be adversely affected.

Dissenting Fairmount Santrol stockholders are entitled to assert the right to appraisal of the fair value of their shares of Fairmount Santrol
common stock under Delaware law, as described in the section entitled “Appraisal Rights of Fairmount Santrol Stockholders” beginning on page 361 of
this proxy statement/prospectus. If the Merger is consummated and dissenting Fairmount Santrol stockholders demand appraisal rights and it is
determined that they are entitled to such rights, the combined company would be required to pay cash to satisfy such dissenting stockholders’ rights to
fair value, as such dissenting stockholders will not receive any Merger Consideration; provided, however, that the shares of any dissenting Fairmount
Santrol stockholder that fails to perfect, effectively withdraws or otherwise loses its appraisal rights under the DGCL will be treated as though such
shares had been converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as of the effective time. Unimin and Fairmount Santrol cannot predict the
amount of cash that the combined company may be required to provide following the Merger to any dissenting Fairmount Santrol stockholder seeking
appraisal rights. If those amounts or the number of Dissenting Shares (as defined herein) are substantial, it could have a material adverse effect on the
combined company’s ability to fund growth initiatives or achieve other anticipated benefits of the Merger.

The conditions to closing of the Merger may not be satisfied, the Merger Agreement may be terminated in accordance with its terms and the
Merger may not be completed.

The closing of the Merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of a number of conditions. These conditions include, among others: (i) the
approval of the Fairmount Santrol Merger proposal by Fairmount stockholders holding a majority of all outstanding shares of Fairmount Santrol
common stock entitled to vote; (ii) the receipt of certain regulatory approvals, including the termination or expiration of the waiting period under the
HSR Act; (iii) the absence of certain governmental restraints or prohibitions preventing the closing of the Merger; (iv) the effectiveness of the
registration statement of which this proxy statement/prospectus forms a part and the absence of any stop order or proceedings by the SEC; (v) the
approval for listing by the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance, of the shares of combined company common stock issuable to Fairmount Santrol
stockholders in connection with the Merger; (vi) the truth and correctness of the representations and warranties made by each of the parties to the
Merger Agreement (generally subject to certain “materiality” and “material adverse effect” qualifiers); (vii) the performance by each of the parties to the
Merger Agreement of its respective obligations under the Merger Agreement in all material respects; (viii) the receipt of a tax opinion with respect to
matters related to the HPQ Carveout and the receipt of a tax opinion with respect to matters related to the Merger; (ix) the consummation of the HPQ
Carveout; and (x) the execution and effectiveness of certain Ancillary Agreements. These conditions to the closing of the Merger may not be fulfilled
and, accordingly, the Merger may not be completed.

In addition, if the Merger is not completed by the outside date either Fairmount Santrol or Unimin may choose not to proceed with the Merger,
and the parties to the Merger Agreement can mutually decide to terminate the Merger Agreement at any time prior to the closing of the Merger, before
or after obtaining Fairmount Santrol stockholder approval. In addition, Fairmount Santrol or Unimin may elect to terminate the Merger Agreement in
certain other circumstances. If the Merger Agreement is terminated, Fairmount Santrol and Unimin may incur substantial fees in connection with
termination of the Merger Agreement and will not recognize the anticipated benefits of the Merger. See “The Merger Agreement—Conditions to
Closing of the Merger” and “The Merger Agreement—Termination.”

The termination of the Merger Agreement could negatively impact Fairmount Santrol and/or Unimin.

If the Merger is not completed for any reason, including as a result of Fairmount Santrol stockholders failing to approve the Fairmount Santrol
Merger proposal, the ongoing businesses of Fairmount Santrol and/or Unimin may be adversely affected. Fairmount Santrol’s and Unimin’s respective
businesses may be adversely impacted by the failure to pursue other beneficial opportunities during the pendency of the Merger, by the failure to obtain
the anticipated benefits of completing the Merger, by payment of certain costs relating to the Merger (whether or not the Merger is completed), by the
focus of their respective managements on the Merger for an extended period of time rather than on normal business operations or opportunities or by the
loss of certain senior managers and other key personnel by either or both of Fairmount Santrol and Unimin as a consequence of the Merger not closing.
Fairmount Santrol and Unimin could experience negative reactions from their customers, regulators and employees. In addition, Fairmount Santrol may
experience negative reactions from the financial markets, and the market price of Fairmount Santrol common stock might decline as a result of any such
failures to the extent that the current market price reflects a market assumption that the Merger will be completed. Any of these factors, among others,
could have a material impact on the business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations of Fairmount Santrol and/or Unimin.

If the Merger Agreement is terminated and the Fairmount Board seeks another merger, business combination or other transaction, Fairmount
Santrol stockholders cannot be certain that Fairmount Santrol will be able to find a party willing to offer equivalent or more attractive consideration than
the consideration Fairmount Santrol stockholders would receive in the Merger. If the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances
specified in the Merger Agreement, Fairmount Santrol may be required to pay Unimin, or Unimin may be required to pay Fairmount Santrol, a
termination fee of $52 million, depending on the circumstances surrounding the termination. See the sections entitled “The Merger Agreement—
Termination” and “The Merger Agreement—Termination Fees” in this proxy statement/prospectus for a more complete discussion of the circumstances
under which the Merger Agreement could be terminated and when the termination fees may be payable by Fairmount Santrol or Unimin.

Fairmount Santrol or Unimin may also be negatively impacted if the respective companies become subject to litigation related to entering into or
failing to consummate the Merger, including direct actions by Fairmount Santrol stockholders against the directors of Fairmount Santrol, and Unimin,
for breaches of fiduciary duty and derivative actions brought by Fairmount Santrol stockholders in the name of Fairmount Santrol.

Certain of the directors and executive officers of Fairmount Santrol may have interests in the Merger that are different from, or in addition to,
those of Fairmount Santrol stockholders generally.

Certain of the directors and executive officers of Fairmount Santrol negotiated the terms of the Merger Agreement, the Fairmount Board approved
the Merger Agreement and the Fairmount Board recommended that Fairmount Santrol stockholders vote in favor of the Fairmount Santrol Merger
proposal, the Fairmount Santrol compensation proposal and the Fairmount Santrol adjournment proposal. Fairmount Santrol directors and executive
officers have certain financial interests in the Merger that may be different from, or in addition to, or in conflict with, those of Fairmount Santrol
stockholders generally. These interests include the treatment in the Merger of Fairmount Santrol equity compensation awards, severance arrangements
for the benefit of certain Fairmount Santrol executive officers, the expectation that some of the directors and executive officers of Fairmount Santrol will
serve as directors and executive officers of the combined company or its subsidiaries

following the closing of the Merger, the indemnification of current and former Fairmount Santrol directors and officers by the combined company and
the potential for additional bonuses.

The Fairmount Board was aware of and considered these potential interests, among other matters, in evaluating and negotiating the Merger
Agreement, in determining that the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby were advisable and fair to and in the best interests of
the Fairmount Santrol stockholders, and in recommending to you that you vote to approve the Fairmount Santrol Merger proposal, the Fairmount
Santrol compensation proposal and the Fairmount Santrol adjournment proposal. Fairmount Santrol stockholders should be aware of these interests
when they consider recommendations of the Fairmount Board that they vote in favor of the Fairmount Santrol Merger proposal, the Fairmount Santrol
compensation proposal and the Fairmount Santrol adjournment proposal. The interests of Fairmount Santrol directors and executive officers are
described in more detail in the section of this proxy statement/prospectus entitled “Interests of Fairmount Santrol’s Directors and Executive Officers in
the Merger.”

The Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) may assert that the Mergers, taken together as an integrated transaction, do not qualify as a
“reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

Although Fairmount Santrol expects to receive a tax opinion from its legal counsel, Jones Day, to the effect that the Mergers, taken together as an
integrated transaction, will qualify as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, neither Unimin nor Fairmount Santrol has
applied for, or expects to obtain, a ruling from the IRS with respect to the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Mergers. No assurance can be
given that the IRS will agree with the positions taken in the legal opinion or will not challenge the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Mergers.
If the Mergers do not qualify as a reorganization, U.S. holders will recognize gain or loss on the exchange of their Fairmount Santrol common stock for
the Merger Consideration. Non-U.S. holders also may be subject to U.S. federal income tax if the Mergers do not qualify as a reorganization.

For a more detailed discussion of the material United States federal income tax consequences of the Mergers to U.S. holders and non-U.S. holders
(including the potential application of FIRPTA), see the section entitled “Material United States Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Transaction”
beginning on page 178 of this proxy statement/prospectus.

The combined company may be subject to material U.S. tax liabilities as a result of the HPQ Carveout.

As a condition precedent to the closing of the Merger, Fairmount Santrol will receive from Unimin an opinion from the qualified advisor specified
in the Merger Agreement (the “HPQ Carveout Opinion”) to the effect that the HPQ Contribution and HPQ Redemption should qualify as tax-free
transactions under the Code. The HPQ Carveout Opinion relies on certain representations, assumptions and understandings as to factual matters, and if
these are not accurate, the conclusions expressed in the HPQ Carveout Opinion may not be correct. The HPQ Carveout Opinion is not binding on the
IRS. In addition, certain actions that can be taken by Sibelco, the combined company and HPQ Co could retroactively cause the HPQ Carveout to fail to
qualify for tax-free status, although the Tax Matters Agreement will generally subject the parties thereto to an indemnity obligation if they undertake
certain actions that create a material risk of causing the HPQ Carveout to be treated as a taxable distribution.

No ruling has been sought or obtained from the IRS regarding the U.S. federal income tax treatment of the HPQ Carveout, and there can be no
assurance that the IRS will not take a contrary position to that of the HPQ Carveout Opinion, or that the positions in the HPQ Carveout Opinion would
be sustained if challenged.

If the HPQ Carveout failed to qualify for tax-free status, the combined company would be subject to tax in respect of gain recognized in respect of
the HPQ Carveout as if it had sold the shares of HPQ Co for their fair market value at the time such shares were distributed. Furthermore, even if the
distribution were otherwise to qualify under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code, it may be taxable to the combined company under
Section 355(e) of the Code, if the distribution were later deemed to be part of a plan (or series of related transactions) pursuant to which one or more
persons acquire, directly or indirectly, stock representing a 50% or greater interest in HPQ Co or Unimin. For this purpose, any acquisitions of Unimin
common stock, combined

company common stock or of HPQ Co common stock within the period beginning two years before the distribution and ending two years after the
distribution are presumed to be part of such a plan, although HPQ Co or the combined company may be able to rebut that presumption, including
through the use of certain safe harbors contained in U.S. Treasury Regulations under Section 355(e) of the Code.

The combined company may be entitled to indemnification by either HPQ Co or Sibelco if the HPQ Carveout fails to qualify for tax-free status
under the Tax Matters Agreement under certain circumstances. However, if the combined company undertakes certain actions relating to sales or
dispositions of stock or assets, alterations to its voting shares, or certain redemptions that result in the HPQ Carveout failing to qualify for tax-free
status, the combined company may be responsible under the Tax Matters Agreement for indemnifying HPQ Co for tax liabilities and related costs and
damages. However, the combined company will only be responsible for paying such indemnity if the relevant actions giving rise to the combined
company’s indemnity obligation were approved by the majority of the combined company’s directors that were not appointed by Sibelco.

Unimin and Fairmount Santrol may be materially adversely affected by negative publicity related to the proposed Merger and in connection
with other matters.

From time to time, political and public sentiment in connection with the proposed Merger and in connection with other matters could result in a
significant amount of adverse press coverage and other adverse public statements affecting Unimin and Fairmount Santrol. Adverse press coverage and
other adverse statements, whether or not driven by political or public sentiment, may also result in investigations by regulators, legislators and law
enforcement officials or in legal claims. Responding to these investigations and lawsuits, regardless of the ultimate outcome of the proceeding, can
divert the time and effort of senior management from the management of Unimin’s and Fairmount Santrol’s respective businesses. Addressing any
adverse publicity, governmental scrutiny or enforcement or other legal proceedings is time consuming and expensive and, regardless of the factual basis
for the assertions being made, can have a negative impact on the reputation of Unimin and Fairmount Santrol, on the morale and performance of their
employees and on their relationships with their respective regulators. It may also have a negative impact on their ability to take timely advantage of
various business and market opportunities. The direct and indirect effects of negative publicity, and the demands of responding to and addressing it, may
have a material adverse effect on Unimin’s and Fairmount Santrol’s respective businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

The Merger Agreement contains provisions that could discourage a potential alternative acquirer that might be willing to pay more to acquire
Fairmount Santrol.

The Merger Agreement contains provisions that may discourage a third party from submitting a business combination proposal to Fairmount
Santrol during the pendency of the proposed Merger. In particular, the Merger Agreement includes a general prohibition on soliciting or, subject to
certain exceptions, entering into discussions with any third party regarding any acquisition or combination proposal or offers for competing transactions,
subject to limited exceptions. While the Fairmount Board may withdraw or change its recommendation regarding the Merger Agreement in response to
an unsolicited third-party proposal to acquire Fairmount Santrol that the Fairmount Board determines to be superior to the Merger with Unimin, there
are restrictions on its ability to do so. Further, even if the Fairmount Board withdraws its approval or recommendation of the Fairmount Santrol Merger
proposal, Fairmount Santrol will still be required to submit the Fairmount Santrol Merger proposal to a vote of its stockholders at the special meeting
unless the Merger Agreement is earlier terminated in accordance with its terms. For further information, see the section entitled “The Merger Agreement
—No Solicitation by Fairmount Santrol” and “The Merger Agreement—Company Recommendation Change and Company Superior Proposals” in this
proxy statement/prospectus. In addition, Fairmount Santrol may be required to pay Unimin a termination fee of $52 million in certain circumstances
involving acquisition proposals for competing transactions. For further information, see the section entitled “The Merger Agreement—Termination
Fees.” These provisions could discourage a potential third-party acquirer from considering or proposing an alternative acquisition, even if it were
prepared to pay consideration with a higher value than that proposed to be paid in the Merger. If the Merger Agreement is terminated and Fairmount
Santrol

determines to seek another strategic transaction, Fairmount Santrol may not be able to negotiate a transaction on terms comparable to, or better than, the
terms of this transaction.

The fairness opinion obtained by Fairmount Santrol from its financial advisor reflects the fairness of the Merger Consideration, from a
financial point of view, only as of the date of the opinion, and will not be updated to reflect changes in circumstances from the signing of the
Merger Agreement in December 2017 through the closing of the Merger.

Fairmount Santrol obtained a fairness opinion dated December 11, 2017 from its financial advisor Wells Fargo. However, Fairmount Santrol has
not obtained an updated opinion from its financial advisor as of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus, and Fairmount Santrol does not anticipate
asking its financial advisor to update its opinion. In rendering its opinion, Wells Fargo Securities made judgments and assumptions with regard to
industry performance, general business, market and financial conditions and other matters that are beyond the control of Fairmount Santrol and Unimin.
These include, among other things, the impact of competition on the businesses of Fairmount Santrol and Unimin, the industry generally, industry
growth and the absence of any material adverse change in the financial condition and prospects of Fairmount Santrol and Unimin, the industry and in the
financial markets in general, any of which could affect the public trading value of Fairmount Santrol common stock by the time the Merger is
completed.

Because the fairness opinion was issued at the time of the signing of the Merger Agreement and will not be updated, the opinion will not address
the fairness of the Merger Consideration from a financial point of view at the time the Merger is completed or as of any date other than the date of the
opinion. The fairness opinion also does not address the prices at which Fairmount Santrol common stock will trade at any time. The fairness opinion that
Fairmount Santrol received from Wells Fargo Securities is attached as Annex B to this proxy statement/prospectus. For a description of the opinion, see
the section entitled “The Merger—Opinion of Fairmount Santrol’s Financial Advisor” in this proxy statement/prospectus. For a description of the other
factors considered by the Fairmount Board in determining to approve the Merger, see the section entitled “The Merger—Fairmount Santrol’s Reasons
for the Merger” in this proxy statement/prospectus.

Following the closing of the Merger, any inability to access the debt capital markets could impair the combined company’s liquidity, business or
financial condition.

Any limitation on the ability of the combined company to raise money in the debt markets could have a substantial negative effect on the
combined company’s liquidity. The combined company’s access to the debt markets in amounts adequate to finance its activities could be impaired as a
result of various factors, some of which are not specific to the combined company, such as a severe disruption of the financial markets and interest rate
fluctuations.

The costs and availability of financing from the debt capital markets will also be dependent on the creditworthiness of the combined company.
The level and quality of the combined company’s earnings, operations, business and management, among other things, will impact its creditworthiness
and potentially any credit ratings assigned by rating agencies to the combined company. A decrease in credit ratings assigned to the combined company
by the ratings agencies may, to the extent that the combined company wishes to secure further borrowing, negatively impact the combined company’s
access to the debt capital markets and increase the combined company’s cost of borrowing. It may also impact investor confidence in the combined
company and consequently cause a decline in the price of the combined company common stock. There can be no assurance that the combined company
will have a credit rating assigned to it by rating agencies or maintain any specific credit rating on a stand-alone basis. Any actual or anticipated changes
or downgrades in such credit ratings may have a negative impact on the combined company.

Following the closing of the Merger, the combined company may launch branding or rebranding initiatives that may involve substantial costs
and may not be favorably received by customers.

Following the closing of the Merger, the combined company will operate under a new name that will be selected by Unimin and Fairmount
Santrol prior to the closing of the Merger. Following this name change, the combined company may incur substantial costs in rebranding its products
and services, and the combined

Table of Contents

company may not be able to achieve or maintain brand name recognition or status under the new combined company brand that is comparable to the
recognition and status previously enjoyed by Unimin and Fairmount Santrol separately. The failure of any such rebranding initiative could adversely
affect the combined company’s ability to attract and retain customers after the closing of the Merger, which could cause the combined company not to
realize some or all of the benefits contemplated by Unimin and Fairmount Santrol to result from the closing of the Merger.

An impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets would adversely affect the combined company’s financial condition and results of
operations.

Upon the closing of the Merger, the combined company will record goodwill as a result of the Merger, and other intangible assets will be recorded
as a result of the purchase price allocation performed in connection with the Merger. Under U.S. GAAP, goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite
lives are not amortized but are tested for impairment annually, or more often if an event or circumstance indicates that an impairment loss may have
been incurred. Other intangible assets with a finite life are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives and reviewed for
impairment whenever there is an indication of impairment. In particular, if the combination of the businesses meets with unexpected difficulties, or if the
combined company’s business does not develop as expected, impairment charges may be incurred in the future, which could be significant and which
could have an adverse effect on the combined company’s financial condition and results of operations.

Certain terms of the Ancillary Agreements that will be entered into between the combined company and Sibelco in connection with the Merger
may be less favorable to the combined company than the terms it could have obtained from an unaffiliated third party.

At the closing of the Merger, the combined company and Sibelco will enter into a number of additional agreements, including the Distribution
Agreements, the Agency Agreements and the Non-Compete Agreement. Pursuant to the Distribution Agreements, the combined company and Sibelco
will each provide distribution services with respect to certain of the other party’s products and license certain trademarks. Pursuant to the Agency
Agreements, the combined company and Sibelco will each provide exclusive agency services with respect to certain of the other party’s products within
defined trading areas. Pursuant to the Non-Compete Agreement, for so long as Sibelco or any of its affiliates owns more than 50% of the issued and
outstanding shares of the combined company common stock, the combined company and Sibelco will agree to refrain from selling, marketing,
distributing or producing certain products within defined markets and territories. In addition, in connection with the HPQ Carveout, prior to the closing
of the Merger, Unimin, Sibelco and HPQ Co will enter into the Contribution Agreement and the Tax Matters Agreement. Among other things, these
agreements will provide for a customary allocation of assets and liabilities relating to Unimin’s high purity quartz business, and mutual indemnities will
be provided by the relevant parties in respect of such liabilities. Certain terms of these agreements and other transactions between the combined
company and Sibelco may be less favorable to the combined company than the terms it could have obtained from an unaffiliated third party. For further
information on the relationship between the combined company and Sibelco, see “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions—Relationship
with Sibelco” in this proxy statement/prospectus.

The ability of the combined company to pursue potential business opportunities and expand its business may be limited in the future because of
its obligations under the Non-Compete Agreement with Sibelco.

At the closing of the Merger, the combined company and Sibelco will enter into the Non-Compete Agreement, pursuant to which the combined
company and Sibelco will agree to refrain from selling, marketing, distributing or producing certain products within defined markets and territories and
Sibelco will be provided a right of first offer with respect to certain acquisitions and investment opportunities of the combined company. As a result of
these requirements and restrictions, in compliance with its obligations under the Non-Compete Agreement, the combined company may have to forgo
certain attractive business opportunities that it may have otherwise pursued.

The Non-Compete Agreement will automatically terminate when Sibelco, together with its controlled affiliates, ceases to own more than 50% of
the issued and outstanding shares of the combined company common

stock. If the Non-Compete Agreement terminates, Sibelco may elect to expand its operations in the product markets and territories in which the
combined company operates, in which case the combined company will face increased competition and may lose market share, which could have a
material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. For additional information on the Non-Compete
Agreement, see the section entitled “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions—Relationship with Sibelco—Non-Compete Agreement” in
this proxy statement/prospectus.

The combined company may require transition services from Sibelco following the closing of the Merger.

Upon the closing of the Merger, Sibelco will have no obligation to provide the combined company with any assistance or services other than
pursuant to a Distribution Agreement and an Agency Agreement that will be entered into in connection with the Merger, along with such other
arrangements as have otherwise been contractually agreed to as described under “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions—Relationship
with Sibelco.” These services may not include every service Unimin has received from Sibelco in the past, and Sibelco is only obligated to provide these
services for the periods indicated in the respective agreements. Accordingly, following the closing of the Merger, the combined company will need to
provide internally or obtain from unaffiliated third parties the services that Unimin currently receives from Sibelco. These services may include
information technology, tax, insurance and other administrative activities, the effective and appropriate performance of which is critical to the combined
company’s operations. The combined company may be unable to replace these services in a timely manner or on terms and conditions as favorable as
those that Unimin receives from Sibelco. Because Unimin’s business previously operated and currently operates in part as a component of the wider
Sibelco group, the combined company may be unable to successfully establish the infrastructure or implement the changes necessary to operate
independently, or it may incur additional costs that could adversely affect the combined company’s business. If the combined company fails to obtain the
quality of administrative and other services necessary to operate effectively or incurs greater costs in obtaining these services, its financial condition,
results of operations and cash flow may be materially and adversely affected.

Risks Related to Investing in and Ownership of Combined Company Common Stock

There has been no public market for the combined company common stock and the lack of a public market makes it difficult to determine the
combined company’s fair market value. The market price of the combined company common stock following the closing of the Merger could be
volatile and Fairmount Santrol stockholders could lose all or part of their investment.

Unimin’s outstanding capital stock is currently privately held and currently is not traded on any public market. As a result, no public market price
is available to Fairmount Santrol stockholders for use in determining the value of the combined company common stock they are entitled to receive as
the Stock Consideration. The value ascribed to Unimin’s securities in other contexts may not be indicative of the price at which Unimin common stock
may have traded if it were traded on a public market. The Merger Consideration to be paid to Fairmount Santrol stockholders was determined based on
negotiations between the parties to the Merger Agreement and likewise may not be indicative of the price at which Unimin common stock may have
traded if it were traded on a public market. The Merger Consideration to be paid to Fairmount Santrol stockholders will not necessarily reflect the price
at which investors in the market will be willing to buy and sell shares of combined company common stock following the closing of the Merger. In
addition, the market price of the combined company common stock following the closing of the Merger could be volatile and could be subject to wide
fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond the combined company’s control.

Fairmount Santrol stockholders cannot be sure that an active trading market will develop or be sustained for the shares of combined company
common stock they will receive.

Unimin does not have any class of securities publicly traded or listed in the United States or elsewhere and, accordingly, public information about
Unimin and its businesses or operations has been limited. The parties to the Merger Agreement have agreed to use their reasonable best efforts to cause
the shares of the combined company common stock to be issued in the proposed Merger to be approved for listing on the NYSE prior to the effective
time, subject to official notice of issuance, and the approval for listing on the NYSE of the combined

company common stock to be issued to Fairmount Santrol stockholders in the proposed Merger is a condition to the completion of the proposed Merger.
The listing of shares on the NYSE does not assure that a market for the combined company common stock will develop or be sustained. No assurance
can be provided as to the demand for or trading price of the combined company common stock following the closing of the proposed Merger, and the
combined company common stock may trade at a price less than the current market price of Fairmount Santrol common stock.

The trading price and volume of the combined company common stock may be volatile, and holders of the combined company common stock
may not be able to sell their shares following the Merger.

The trading price and volume of the combined company common stock may be volatile following completion of the proposed Merger. The stock
markets in general have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad
market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of the combined company common stock. Volatility in the market price of the combined
company common stock may prevent you from being able to sell your combined company common stock at or above the price at which you purchased
the combined company common stock. As a result, you may suffer a loss on your investment.

Demand for the combined company common stock following completion of the proposed Merger and the development and continued existence of
a market and favorable price for the combined company common stock will depend on a number of conditions, most of which the combined company
cannot control, including:
 

 •  general economic conditions within the U.S. and internationally, including changes in interest rates;
 

 
•  general market conditions, including fluctuations in commodity prices, sand-based proppants or industrial and recreational sand-based

products;
 

 •  domestic and international economic, legal and regulatory factors unrelated to the combined company’s performance;
 

 •  changes in electricity and natural gas prices;
 

 •  actual or anticipated fluctuations in the combined company’s quarterly and annual results and those of its competitors;
 

 
•  quarterly variations in the rate of growth of the combined company’s financial indicators, such as revenues, EBITDA, net income and net

income per share;
 

 •  the businesses, operations, results and prospects of the combined company;
 

 •  the operating and financial performance of the combined company;
 

 •  future mergers and strategic alliances;
 

 •  market conditions in the energy industry;
 

 •  changes in government regulation, taxes, legal proceedings or other developments;
 

 •  shortfalls in the combined company’s operating results from levels forecasted by securities analysts;
 

 •  investor sentiment toward the stock of energy companies in general;
 

 •  changes in revenue or earnings estimates, or changes in recommendations or withdrawal of research coverage, by equity research analysts;
 

 
•  failure of the combined company to achieve the perceived benefits of the Mergers, including financial results and anticipated synergies, as

rapidly as or to the extent anticipated by financial or industry analysts;
 

 •  speculation in the press or investment community;
 

 •  the failure of research analysts to cover the combined company common stock;

 •  sales of common stock by the combined company, large stockholders or management, or the perception that such sales may occur;
 

 •  changes in accounting principles, policies, guidance, interpretations or standards;
 

 •  announcements concerning the combined company or its competitors;
 

 •  public reaction to the combined company’s press releases, other public announcements and filings with the SEC;
 

 •  strategic actions taken by competitors;
 

 •  actions taken by the combined company stockholders;
 

 •  additions or departures of key management personnel;
 

 •  maintenance of acceptable credit ratings or credit quality;
 

 •  the general state of the securities markets; and
 

 
•  the risk factors described in this proxy statement/prospectus and the documents incorporated by reference into this proxy

statement/prospectus.

These and other factors may impair the development or sustainability of a liquid market for the combined company common stock and the ability
of investors to sell shares at an attractive price. These factors also could cause the market price and demand for the combined company common stock to
fluctuate substantially, which may negatively affect the price and liquidity of the combined company common stock. Many of these factors and
conditions are beyond the control of the combined company or the combined company stockholders.

Securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the overall market and in the market
price of a company’s securities. Such litigation, if instituted against the combined company, could result in very substantial costs, divert management’s
attention and resources and harm the combined company’s business, operating results and financial condition.

The financial performance of the combined company and the price of the combined company common stock will be affected by factors
different from those that historically have affected Fairmount Santrol.

Following the Merger, Fairmount Santrol stockholders will become combined company stockholders. The combined company’s business and
target customers will differ from that of Fairmount Santrol, and accordingly the results of operations of the combined company will be affected by some
factors that are different from those currently affecting the results of operations and stock price of Fairmount Santrol. For a discussion of the businesses
of Unimin and Fairmount Santrol and of some important factors to consider in connection with such businesses, see the sections entitled “Business,”
“Risk Factors—Risks Related to Unimin’s Business” and the documents incorporated by reference in this proxy statement/prospectus and referred to
under “Where You Can Find Additional Information” in this proxy statement/prospectus.

Fairmount Santrol stockholders cannot be sure of the value of the Merger Consideration they will receive.

As a result of the Merger, each issued and outstanding share of Fairmount Santrol common stock (other than (1) shares owned by Fairmount
Santrol or any wholly owned subsidiary of Fairmount Santrol (or held in the treasury of Fairmount Santrol), (2) shares owned by Sibelco or any of its
subsidiaries and (3) shares held by any stockholder who is entitled to appraisal rights and has properly exercised and perfected (and not effectively
withdrawn or lost) such stockholder’s demand for appraisal rights under the DGCL) will be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration,
consisting of the Stock Consideration, the Cash Consideration and cash paid in lieu of fractional shares, if any, without interest. Fairmount Santrol
stockholders will receive a fixed number of shares of combined company common stock in the Merger rather than a number of shares of combined
company common stock with a particular fixed market value. The market value of Fairmount Santrol common stock at the effective time may vary
significantly from its market price on December 11, 2017 (the date the Merger Agreement was executed), the date of this proxy statement/prospectus or
the date on which Fairmount

Santrol stockholders vote on the Fairmount Santrol Merger proposal. Because the Exchange Ratio is fixed and will not be adjusted to reflect any
changes in the market price of Fairmount Santrol common stock, the market value of Fairmount Santrol common stock surrendered in exchange for the
Merger Consideration may be higher or lower than the values of Fairmount Santrol common stock on earlier dates. The majority of the Merger
Consideration to be received by Fairmount Santrol stockholders will be combined company common stock, but at the time of the special meeting,
Fairmount Santrol stockholders will not know or be able to determine the value of the combined company common stock they would receive upon the
closing of the Merger. Changes in the market price of Fairmount Santrol common stock may result from a variety of factors that are beyond the control
of Fairmount Santrol and Unimin, including changes in its business, operations and prospects, regulatory considerations, governmental actions, legal
proceedings and other developments. Market assessments of the benefits of the Merger, the likelihood that the Merger will be completed and general and
industry-specific market and economic conditions may also have an effect on the market price of Fairmount Santrol common stock. Neither Fairmount
Santrol nor Unimin is permitted to terminate the Merger Agreement solely because of changes in the market price of Fairmount Santrol common stock.

Future sales or issuances of combined company common stock, including sales by Sibelco, could have a negative impact on the combined
company common stock price.

Upon the closing of the Merger, Sibelco will own, directly or indirectly, approximately 65% of the combined company common stock. Sales of
combined company common stock by Sibelco or the perception that sales may be made by Sibelco could significantly reduce the market price of the
combined company common stock. In addition, even if Sibelco does not sell a large number of shares of combined company common stock into the
market, its right to transfer such shares may depress the stock price of the combined company common stock.

Pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Registration Rights Agreement, Sibelco will be entitled to registration rights with respect to its
combined company common stock. These registration rights will include the right to demand that its shares be registered, the right to choose the method
by which the shares of common stock are distributed, a choice as to the underwriter and registration rights in conjunction with other registered offerings
by the combined company. Expenses incident to the combined company’s performance of or compliance with a demand registration made by Sibelco
will be borne by the combined company. If Sibelco exercises its registration rights, the market price of shares of combined company common stock may
be adversely affected.

Concurrently with the closing of the Merger, Sibelco will become party to the Stockholders Agreement pursuant to which Sibelco will be subject
to certain transfer restrictions. In particular, Sibelco will agree that:
 

 

•  for 45 days beginning at the effective time, Sibelco and any stockholder party to the Stockholders Agreement who is also a combined
company director cannot, and to the extent permitted by applicable law must cause their respective controlled affiliates not to, transfer or
agree to transfer any combined company common stock or other shares of capital stock to any person that is not an affiliate of such
stockholder, and

 

 

•  for three years following the effective time, unless approved by a majority of the Fairmount-nominated independent directors, Sibelco will
not, and will cause its controlled affiliates not to, transfer or agree to transfer any combined company common stock or other shares of
capital stock to any person (other than an affiliate of Sibelco) or group if such person or group would, following such transfer, beneficially
own in excess of (i) 15% of the voting power of the outstanding shares of combined company voting stock or (ii) 50% of the voting power
of the outstanding shares of combined company voting stock, unless such person agrees to make an offer to purchase all shares of combined
company common stock held by all combined company stockholders for the same consideration and on substantially the same terms and
conditions.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Sibelco can transfer shares of combined company stock at any time (i) to any wholly owned affiliate of Sibelco
who signs a joinder to the Stockholders Agreement, (ii) pursuant to a public offering of shares of combined company common stock (including pursuant
to spin-off or split-off

Table of Contents

transactions or related actions involving a person holding Sibelco’s interest in the combined company) or (iii) in connection with a change of control of
Sibelco. A change of control of Sibelco means (i) the acquisition by any other person, directly or indirectly, of record or beneficial ownership of more
than 50% of the total voting securities of Sibelco, (ii) the acquisition by any other person of all or substantially all of the consolidated assets of Sibelco
or (iii) the acquisition by any other person of the ability to vote or direct the voting securities of Sibelco for the election of a majority of Sibelco’s
directors.

Combined company stockholders may experience dilution in the future.

The percentage ownership of combined company stockholders may be diluted in the future because of equity issuances for acquisitions, capital
market transactions or otherwise, including, without limitation, equity awards that the combined company may grant to its directors, officers and
employees. Such issuances may have a dilutive effect on the combined company’s earnings per share, which could adversely affect the market price of
the combined company common stock.

Certain employees of Fairmount Santrol will have rights to purchase or receive shares of combined company common stock after the Merger as a
result of the conversion of their Fairmount Santrol Stock Options, Fairmount Santrol RSUs and Fairmount Santrol PSUs into combined company stock
options and RSUs. The conversion of these Fairmount Santrol equity awards into combined company equity awards is described in further detail in the
section entitled “The Merger Agreement—Treatment of Fairmount Santrol Equity Awards.” The issuance of shares of combined company common
stock pursuant to these awards will dilute the percentage ownership of combined company stockholders. It is also expected that, from time to time after
the closing of the Merger, the compensation committee of the Combined Company Board will grant additional equity awards to employees and directors
of the combined company under the combined company’s compensation and employee benefit plans. These additional equity awards will have a dilutive
effect on the combined company’s earnings per share, which could adversely affect the market price of the combined company common stock.

In addition, the combined company’s certificate of incorporation will authorize the combined company to issue, without the approval of
stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designations, powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional and
other special rights, including preferences over combined company common stock with respect to dividends and distributions, as the Combined
Company Board generally may determine. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the
value of the combined company common stock. For example, subject to the terms of the Stockholders Agreement, the holders of preferred stock could
be granted the right to elect some number of directors on the happening of specified events or to veto specified transactions. Similarly, the repurchase or
redemption rights or liquidation preferences that could be assigned to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the combined
company common stock. For more information, see “Description of Combined Company Capital Stock.”

If securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about the combined company’s business, if they adversely change their
recommendations regarding the combined company common stock or if the combined company’s operating results do not meet their
expectations, the combined company common stock price and trading volume could decline.

The trading market for the combined company common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts
publish about the combined company or its businesses. While securities and industry analysts currently cover Fairmount Santrol, securities and industry
analysts do not currently cover Unimin and may never publish research on the combined company. If no securities or industry analysts commence
coverage of the combined company, the trading price for combined company common stock would likely be negatively impacted. In the event securities
or industry analysts initiate coverage, if one or more of the analysts who cover the combined company downgrade its securities or publish inaccurate or
unfavorable research about its businesses, or if the combined company’s operating results do not meet analyst expectations, the combined company
common stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of the combined company or fail to publish reports on the
combined company regularly, demand for combined

company common stock could decrease, which might cause the combined company common stock price and trading volume to decline.

Existing Fairmount Santrol stockholders will have a reduced ownership and voting interest in, and will exercise less influence over management
of, the combined company after the Merger than they did with respect to Fairmount Santrol prior to the Merger.

Fairmount Santrol stockholders currently have the right to vote in the election of the Fairmount Board and on other matters affecting Fairmount
Santrol that are subject to a vote of stockholders. Upon the closing of the Merger, each Fairmount Santrol stockholder who receives combined company
common stock in the Merger will become a combined company stockholder with a percentage ownership of, and voting interest in, the combined
company that is smaller than such stockholder’s percentage ownership of, and voting interest in, Fairmount Santrol immediately prior to the Merger.
Immediately following the closing of the Merger, the former Fairmount Santrol stockholders, as a group, including holders of certain Fairmount Santrol
equity awards, will own approximately 35% of the combined company common stock. In addition, former directors of Fairmount Santrol will constitute
less than half of the Combined Company Board. Accordingly, Fairmount Santrol stockholders will have less influence on the management and policies
of the combined company than they now have on the management and policies of Fairmount Santrol.

Sibelco will exercise significant influence over the combined company, and its interests in the combined company may be different than yours.

Upon the closing of the Merger, Sibelco will beneficially own, directly or indirectly, approximately 65% of the outstanding shares of combined
company common stock. In addition, pursuant to the Stockholders Agreement, Sibelco will have certain preemptive rights pursuant to which it will be
able to purchase its pro rata portion of any new securities that the combined company may from time to time propose to issue or sell to any person, with
certain exceptions. Accordingly, subject to applicable law and the limitations set forth in the combined company’s certificate of incorporation, the
combined company’s bylaws and the Stockholders Agreement, Sibelco will be able to exercise significant influence over the combined company’s
business policies and affairs, including any action requiring the approval of the combined company stockholders, including the adoption of amendments
to the combined company’s certificate of incorporation and the combined company’s bylaws and the approval of a merger or sale of all or substantially
all of the combined company’s assets.

Pursuant to the Stockholders Agreement, Sibelco will have the right to nominate the majority of the initial directors of the combined company.
Subject to the limitations included in the combined company’s certificate of incorporation, the combined company’s bylaws and the Stockholders
Agreement, the Unimin-nominated directors will have significant authority to effect decisions affecting the capital structure of the combined company,
including the issuance of additional capital stock, the incurrence of additional indebtedness, the implementation of stock repurchase programs and the
decision of whether or not to declare dividends. In addition, prior to or at the closing of the Merger, the combined company and Sibelco will enter into
the Contribution Agreement, the Tax Matters Agreement, the Distribution Agreements, the Agency Agreements and the Non-Compete Agreement,
which are discussed in the section entitled “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions—Relationship with Sibelco.”

The interests of Sibelco may conflict with the interests of other combined company stockholders. For example, Sibelco may support certain long-
term strategies or objectives for the combined company that may not be accretive to combined company stockholders in the short term. The
concentration of ownership may also delay, defer or even prevent a change in control of the combined company, even if such a change in control would
benefit the other combined company stockholders, and may make some transactions more difficult or impossible without the support of Sibelco. This
significant concentration of share ownership may adversely affect the trading price for the combined company common stock because investors may
perceive disadvantages in owning stock in companies with stockholders who own significant percentages of a company’s outstanding stock. In addition,
sales by Sibelco of shares of combined company common stock in the market, or the perception that Sibelco might sell shares in the market, or the fact
that a large portion of the combined company

common stock is not part of the public float, could have an adverse effect on the trading market for the combined company common stock.

The combined company will be a “controlled company” within the meaning of the rules of the NYSE and, as a result, will qualify for, and
intends to rely on, exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements.

In addition to the consequences of the concentration of share ownership and possible conflicts between the interests of Sibelco and your interests
discussed above, the combined company will initially be a “controlled company” within the meaning of the rules of the NYSE. Under these rules, a
company in which over 50% of the voting power is held by an individual, a group or another company is a “controlled company” and is not required to
have:
 

 •  a majority of its board of directors be independent directors;
 

 
•  a nominating/corporate governance committee or a compensation committee, or to have such committees be composed entirely of

independent directors; and
 

 
•  the compensation of the Chief Executive Officer of the combined company be determined, or recommended to the board of directors for

determination, either by a compensation committee comprised of independent directors or by a majority of the independent directors on the
board of directors.

Following the closing of the Merger, the combined company may rely on certain of these exemptions. In particular, a majority of the combined
company’s directors may not be independent directors. Accordingly, you may not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that
are subject to all of the corporate governance requirements of the NYSE without regard to the exemptions available for “controlled companies,” and the
combined company’s initial status as a “controlled company” may adversely affect the trading price for the combined company common stock. For more
information, see the section entitled “Management and Corporate Governance of the Combined Company After the Merger—Board of Directors of the
Combined Company” in this proxy statement/prospectus.

The combined company common stock to be received by Fairmount Santrol stockholders in the Merger will have rights that differ from the
rights of shares of Fairmount Santrol common stock.

Upon the closing of the Merger, Fairmount Santrol stockholders will no longer be Fairmount Santrol stockholders, but will instead be combined
company stockholders. The rights of former Fairmount Santrol stockholders who become combined company stockholders will be governed by the
combined company’s certificate of incorporation and the combined company’s bylaws, which will be adopted as of the effective time, in the form of
Annexes C and D to this proxy statement/prospectus. The rights associated with the combined company common stock are different from the rights
associated with shares of Fairmount Santrol common stock. See “Comparison of Stockholder Rights Before and After the Merger” in this proxy
statement/prospectus.

The combined company currently does not intend to pay dividends on its common stock following the closing of the Merger, and the combined
company’s debt agreements will place certain restrictions on its ability to do so. Consequently, unless there is a change to the combined
company dividend policy, your only opportunity to achieve a return on your investment is if the price of the combined company common stock
appreciates.

The combined company does not plan to declare dividends on shares of its common stock in the foreseeable future. Any determination to pay
dividends will be at the discretion of the Combined Company Board and will be dependent on then-existing conditions, including the combined
company’s financial condition, earnings, legal requirements, including limitations under Delaware law, restrictions in the combined company’s debt
agreements that limit its ability to pay dividends to stockholders and other factors the Combined Company Board deems relevant. If the Combined
Company Board decides to declare dividends in the future, it may, in its sole discretion, change the amount or frequency of dividends or discontinue the
payment of dividends entirely. For these reasons, you will not be able to rely on dividends to receive a return on your investment. Accordingly,

realization of a gain on your shares of combined company common stock received in the Merger will likely depend solely on the appreciation of the
price of the combined company common stock, which may never occur.

In connection with the Merger, the combined company will become a public reporting company subject to financial reporting and other
requirements.

In connection with the Merger, the combined company will become a public reporting company subject to reporting, disclosure control and other
obligations under the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”) and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and
Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”), as well as rules adopted, and to be adopted, by the SEC and the NYSE. The combined company’s
management and other personnel will need to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. As a result, the combined company
will incur higher legal, accounting and other expenses than before, and these expenses may increase even more in the future. For example, subject to
certain exceptions, Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires an annual management assessment of the effectiveness of internal controls over
financial reporting and a report by the combined company’s independent registered public accounting firm addressing these assessments. If the
combined company is unable to implement its compliance initiatives in a timely and effective fashion, its ability to comply with the financial reporting
requirements and other rules that apply to reporting companies could be impaired.

In addition, the combined company cannot assure you that there will not be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in its internal control
over financial reporting in the future. Any failure to maintain internal control over financial reporting could severely inhibit the combined company’s
ability to accurately report its cash flows, results of operations or financial condition. If the combined company is unable to conclude that its internal
control over financial reporting is effective, or if its independent registered public accounting firm determines that the combined company has a material
weakness or significant deficiency in its internal control over financial reporting, the combined company could lose investor confidence in the accuracy
and completeness of its financial reports, the market price of its common stock could decline, and the combined company could be subject to sanctions
or investigations by the NYSE, the SEC or other regulatory authorities. Failure to remedy any material weakness in the combined company’s internal
control over financial reporting, or to implement or maintain other effective control systems required of public companies, could also restrict its future
access to the capital markets and reduce or eliminate the trading market for the combined company common stock.

The combined company’s certificate of incorporation will contain a provision renouncing the combined company’s interest and expectancy in
certain corporate opportunities.

The combined company’s certificate of incorporation will provide that, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the combined company,
on behalf of itself and its subsidiaries, renounces any interest or expectancy of the combined company and its subsidiaries in, or in being offered an
opportunity to participate in, business opportunities that are from time to time presented to Sibelco or any of Sibelco’s officers, directors, agents,
members, affiliates and subsidiaries (other than the combined company and its subsidiaries) (each, a “Specified Party”), or business opportunities in
which a Specified Party participates or desires to participate, even if the opportunity is one that the combined company or its subsidiaries might
reasonably be deemed to have pursued or had the ability or desire to pursue if granted the opportunity to do so. In addition, each such Specified Party
has no duty to communicate or offer such business opportunity to the combined company and, to the fullest extent permitted by law, will not be liable to
the combined company or any of its subsidiaries or any stockholder for a breach of any fiduciary or other duty, as a director or officer or controlling
stockholder or otherwise, by reason of the fact that such Specified Party pursues or acquires such business opportunity, directs such business opportunity
to another person or fails to present such business opportunity, or information regarding such business opportunity, to the combined company or its
subsidiaries.

As a result of this provision, a director of the combined company who also serves as a director, officer or employee of Sibelco or any of Sibelco’s
subsidiaries or affiliates may pursue certain acquisitions or other opportunities that may be complementary to the combined company’s business and, as
a result, such acquisition or other opportunities may not be available to the combined company. These potential conflicts of interest could

have a material adverse effect on the combined company’s business, financial condition and results of operations if attractive corporate opportunities are
allocated by Sibelco to itself or its subsidiaries or affiliates instead of to the combined company.

The combined company’s certificate of incorporation and the combined company’s bylaws, as well as Delaware law, will contain provisions that
could discourage acquisition bids or merger proposals, which may adversely affect the market price of the combined company common stock.

Provisions that will be contained in the combined company’s certificate of incorporation and the combined company’s bylaws may delay or
discourage transactions involving an actual or potential change in control or a change in management, including transactions in which combined
company stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares or transactions that combined company stockholders might otherwise deem to
be in their best interests. Therefore, these provisions could adversely affect the price of the combined company common stock. Among other things, the
combined company’s certificate of incorporation and the combined company’s bylaws will:
 

 
•  permit the Combined Company Board to issue up to 15,000,000 shares of preferred stock, with any rights, preferences and privileges as it

may designate (including preferences over the combined company common stock);
 

 
•  provide that, except as otherwise provided in the Stockholders Agreement, the authorized number of directors may be changed only by

resolution adopted by a majority of the Combined Company Board, subject to the rights of holders of any series of preferred stock;
 

 
•  provide that all vacancies, including newly created directorships, may, except as otherwise provided in the Stockholders Agreement or

required by law and subject to the rights of holders of preferred stock as designated from time to time, be filled by the affirmative vote of a
majority of directors then in office, even if less than a quorum;

 

 
•  require that any action to be taken by combined company stockholders following the Trigger Date must be effected at a duly called annual or

special meeting of combined company stockholders and not be taken by written consent;
 

 
•  provide that combined company stockholders seeking to present proposals before a meeting of combined company stockholders or to

nominate candidates for election as directors at a meeting of combined company stockholders must provide notice in writing in a timely
manner and also specify requirements as to the form and content of such stockholder’s notice;

 

 
•  provide that special meetings of combined company stockholders following the Trigger Date may be called only by the Combined Company

Board pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of the total number of directors that the combined company would have if there were
no vacancies;

 

 •  provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for certain legal proceedings; and
 

 

•  provide that the Combined Company Board always has the power to make, rescind, alter, amend and repeal the combined company’s bylaws
and that, following the Trigger Date, the combined company’s bylaws may be adopted, altered, amended or repealed by the holders of
combined company common stock only upon the approval of at least 66 2⁄3% of the voting power of all the then outstanding shares of
combined company common stock.

Additionally, the DGCL provides that stockholders are not entitled to the right to cumulative votes in the election of directors unless a
corporation’s certificate of incorporation provides otherwise. The combined company’s certificate of incorporation will not provide for cumulative
voting in the election of directors.

of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should any of the underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary in material respects from
those expressed or implied by any forward-looking statements. Consequences of material differences in results as compared with those anticipated in the
forward-looking statements could include, among other things, business disruption, operational problems, financial loss, legal liability to third parties
and similar risks, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the combined company’s consolidated financial condition, results of operations,
credit rating or liquidity. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. Neither Unimin nor Fairmount Santrol undertakes
any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that arise after the date of this proxy

“—Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are supplemental non-GAAP financial measures that are used by management and certain external users of
Fairmount Santrol’s financial statements in evaluating its operating performance.

Management of Fairmount Santrol believes EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are useful because they allow Fairmount Santrol to more effectively
evaluate its operations from period to period without regard to its financing methods or capital structure. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have
limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered as alternatives to, or more meaningful than, net income as determined in accordance with
U.S. GAAP as indicators of Fairmount Santrol’s operating performance. Certain items excluded from EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are significant
components in understanding and assessing a company’s financial performance, such as a company’s cost of capital and tax structure, as well as the
historic costs of depreciable assets, none of which are components of EBITDA or Adjusted EBITDA. Although Fairmount Santrol attempts to determine
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in a manner that is consistent with other companies in its industry, Fairmount Santrol’s computations of EBITDA and
Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. Fairmount Santrol believes that EBITDA and Adjusted
EBITDA are widely followed measures of operating performance.

Adjusted EBITDA is presented as a performance measure because certain charges or expenses may occur in a particular period and are not
indicative of true operating performance. For this reason, Fairmount Santrol management believes Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors as well.

Note 1. Description of the Transactions

Merger

On December 11, 2017, Unimin, a wholly owned subsidiary of Sibelco, and Sibelco entered into the Merger Agreement with Fairmount Santrol,
Merger Sub, a wholly owned subsidiary of Unimin, and Merger Sub LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Unimin, providing for, among other things, the
Merger of Merger Sub into Fairmount Santrol with Fairmount Santrol continuing as the surviving corporation and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of
Unimin. Immediately following the Merger, Fairmount Santrol will be merged with and into Merger Sub LLC after which Fairmount Santrol will cease
to exist as a separate corporate entity. Merger Sub LLC will continue as the surviving entity in the second merger as a direct wholly owned subsidiary of
Unimin. In connection with the Merger, each share of Fairmount Santrol common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the closing of the
Merger (other than (1) shares owned by Fairmount Santrol or any wholly owned subsidiary of Fairmount Santrol (or held in the treasury of Fairmount
Santrol), (2) shares owned by Sibelco or any of its subsidiaries and (3) shares held by a stockholder who is entitled to appraisal rights and has properly
exercised and perfected (and not effectively withdrawn or lost) such stockholder’s demand for appraisal rights under the DGCL) will be converted into
the right to receive (a) a number of shares of combined company common stock equal to the Exchange Ratio, (b) an amount in cash equal to the result of
(x) $170,000,000, divided by (y) the fully diluted Fairmount Santrol share number, without interest (which is estimated to result in cash consideration of
approximately $0.74 per diluted share of Fairmount Santrol common stock) and (c) cash in lieu of fractional shares, without interest. Immediately
following the effective time, Fairmount Santrol stockholders, including holders of certain Fairmount Santrol equity awards, immediately prior to the
effective time will own approximately 35% of the shares of combined company common stock.

The closing of the Merger and the actual closing date depend upon the satisfaction of a number of conditions, including, among others, (1) the
waiting period (and any extension thereof) applicable to the Merger under the HSR Act having been terminated or having expired (which has occurred),
(2) all applicable waiting periods (or extensions thereof) or necessary approvals relating to the Merger under the applicable laws of the jurisdictions or
governmental entities specified in the Merger Agreement having expired, been terminated or been received, (3) there being no order, statute, law,
ordinance, rule or regulation of any court or other governmental entity of competent jurisdiction or other legal restraint or prohibition in effect, in the
United States or in any jurisdiction specified in the Merger Agreement, that prevents, makes illegal or prohibits the closing of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, (4) the SEC having declared effective the registration statement of
which this proxy statement/prospectus forms a part and no stop order or proceedings seeking a stop order shall be threatened by the SEC or shall have
been initiated by the SEC, (5) the approval for listing by the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance, of the shares of Unimin common stock
issuable to the holders of Fairmount Santrol common stock in connection with the Merger and (6) approval of the Fairmount Santrol stockholders at a
duly called meeting of stockholders.

HPQ Carveout

As contemplated by the Merger Agreement, Sibelco will retain the global high purity quartz business, which consists of Unimin’s Electronics
segment. Prior to, and as a condition to, the consummation of the Merger, Unimin will contribute certain of its assets to HPQ Co, in exchange for all of
the stock of HPQ Co and the assumption by HPQ Co of certain liabilities related to the business being transferred, in accordance with the Contribution
Agreement. Unimin will then distribute 100% of the stock of HPQ Co to Sibelco in exchange for certain shares of Unimin common stock held by
Sibelco, in accordance with the Contribution Agreement. Accordingly, the pro forma adjustments exclude the assets, liabilities, stockholder’s equity,
revenue and net income of Unimin high purity quartz business as it will not be part of the future combined company.

Cash Redemption

In connection with the closing of the Merger, Unimin expects to redeem shares of Unimin common stock currently held by Sibelco in exchange
for an amount in cash equal to approximately (1) $660 million plus interest accruing at 5.0% per annum for the period from June 30, 2017 through the
closing of the Merger less (2) $170 million, which will be paid to stockholders of Fairmount Santrol.

Refinancing of Indebtedness

In connection with the Merger, Unimin expects to enter into a Credit Agreement with a group of banks, financial institutions and other entities,
with Barclays Bank PLC and BNP Paribas Securities Corp. as lead arrangers and joint bookrunners (the “Credit Agreement”). The Credit Agreement is
expected to contain a $1.65 billion term loan and a $200 million revolving credit facility. The term loan is expected to mature seven years after the
closing of the Merger and the revolving credit facility is expected to mature five years after the closing of the Merger. Interest on both facilities is
expected to accrue, at the borrower’s option, at a per annum rate of adjusted LIBOR plus a spread or the adjusted base rate plus a spread. The proceeds
of the term loan would be used to repay debt of Fairmount Santrol, to repay debt of Unimin (including debt incurred to fund the Cash Redemption) and
to pay the Cash Consideration (as defined in the Merger Agreement) and transaction costs for the Merger.

Note 2. Basis of Pro Forma Presentation

The accompanying unaudited pro forma combined financial statements were prepared in accordance with Article 11 of Regulation S-X and are
based on the audited historical financial information of Unimin and Fairmount Santrol. The audited historical consolidated financial information has
been adjusted in the accompanying unaudited pro forma combined financial statements to give effect to pro forma events that are (1) directly attributable
to the transactions, (2) factually supportable and (3) with respect to the unaudited pro forma combined statement of operations, expected to have a
continuing impact on the combined results.

The unaudited pro forma combined financial information gives effect to the transactions to be accounted for as a business combination in
accordance with ASC 805, with Unimin treated as the accounting acquirer, as if the transactions with Fairmount Santrol had been completed on
January 1, 2017, for statement of operations purposes, and on December 31, 2017, for balance sheet purposes.

Fairmount Santrol’s assets acquired and liabilities assumed will be recorded at their fair value at the transaction date. ASC 805 establishes that the
consideration transferred shall be measured at the closing date of the transaction at the then-current market price. This particular requirement will likely
result in a per share equity component that is different from the amount assumed in this unaudited pro forma combined financial information. The
purchase consideration for Fairmount Santrol under the acquisition method will be based on the share price of Fairmount Santrol common stock on the
closing date of the Merger multiplied by the estimated fully diluted shares of Fairmount Santrol common stock held by Fairmount Santrol stockholders.
The preliminary allocation of purchase price assumes a Fairmount Santrol common stock price of $4.22 per share (based on the closing share price on
April 2, 2018).

One-time transaction-related expenses anticipated to be incurred prior to, or concurrently with, the closing of the Merger are not included in the
unaudited pro forma combined statement of operations.

Further, the unaudited pro forma combined financial statements do not reflect the following items:
 

 
•  Restructuring or integration activities that have yet to be determined or transaction or other costs following the Merger that are not expected

to have a continuing impact on the business of the combined company;
 

 
•  The impact of possible cost or growth synergies expected to be achieved by the combined company, as no assurance can be made that such

cost or growth synergies will be achieved; and
 

 
•  Future acquisitions and disposals not yet known or probable, including those that may be required by regulatory and governmental

authorities in connection with the Merger.

Note 3: Preliminary Consideration

Unimin is a private company and the fair value of its common stock is not readily available. ASC 805 addresses a business combination scenario
where the transaction-date fair value of the acquiree’s equity interests
 

104



9/26/2019 DEFM14A

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1010858/000119312518134923/d493258ddefm14a.htm 120/315

Table of Contents

may be more reliably measurable than the transaction-date fair value of the acquirer’s equity interests. In such cases, ASC 805 requires the acquirer to
use the transaction-date fair value of the acquiree’s equity interests instead of the transaction-date fair value of the acquirer’s equity interests transferred.
As Fairmount Santrol common stock is publicly traded in an active market, Unimin determined that Fairmount Santrol common stock is more reliably
measurable than Unimin common stock to determine the fair value of the preliminary consideration to be transferred in the transactions. The quoted
price of Fairmount Santrol common stock has been determined to be the most factually supportable measure available to support the determination of
the fair value of the consideration transferred, given the market participant element of a widely held stock in an actively traded market. The preliminary
consideration assumes a Fairmount Santrol common stock price of $4.22 per share (based on the closing share price on April 2, 2018). The preliminary
consideration is calculated as follows:
 

(in thousands, except share amount and share price)     
Fully diluted Fairmount Santrol share number(1)    234,974,481 
Fairmount Santrol share price as of April 2, 2018   $ 4.22 

    
 

Preliminary Consideration   $ 991,592 
    

 

 

 

(1) Represents the number of outstanding Fairmount Santrol shares on a fully diluted basis, as of April 2, 2018, calculated
as the sum of 224,954,671 shares of Fairmount Santrol common stock issued and outstanding plus 10,019,810 shares to
be issued related to outstanding options (includes vested options and those which will be accelerated as a result of
change-in-control provisions within the award agreements).

The initial allocation of the preliminary consideration in the unaudited pro forma combined financial statement is based upon a preliminary
consideration of approximately $991.6 million. The value of the preliminary consideration will change based on fluctuations in the share price of the
Fairmount Santrol common stock. An increase or decrease in the share price of Fairmount Santrol common stock by 10% from the closing price of
$4.22 used in the calculation of the preliminary consideration will increase or decrease the amount of preliminary consideration by approximately
$100.0 million.

The final purchase accounting to be determined in accordance with ASC 805 is dependent upon certain valuations that have yet to progress to a
stage where there is sufficient information for a definitive measurement. In addition, the value of the combined company common stock to be issued to
Fairmount Santrol stockholders will be determined based on the trading price of the shares of Fairmount Santrol common stock at the closing date of the
Merger. Accordingly, the pro forma adjustments are preliminary and have been made solely for the purpose of providing unaudited pro forma combined
financial information. Following the consummation of the transactions, final valuations will be performed and it is anticipated that the values assigned to
the assets acquired and liabilities assumed will be finalized during the measurement period following the closing date of the Merger.

Differences between these preliminary estimates and the final purchase accounting will occur and these differences could have a material impact
on the accompanying unaudited pro forma combined financial information and the combined company’s future results of operations and financial
position.

Note 4: Fair Value Estimates of Assets to be Acquired and Liabilities to be Assumed

The table below represents an initial allocation of the preliminary consideration to Fairmount Santrol’s tangible and intangible assets acquired and
liabilities assumed based on as preliminary estimate of their respective fair values as of December 31, 2017. The determination is based on a preliminary
valuation and is subject to revisions pending the completion of the valuation and other adjustments:

(2) Goodwill is calculated as the difference between the preliminary fair value of the consideration transferred and the preliminary fair values of the

assets acquired and liabilities assumed and increased by noncontrolling interest. Goodwill is not amortized.

Note 5: Pre-Merger Pro Forma Adjustments

Prior to the consummation of the Merger, (1) Unimin will redeem 163,537 shares of common stock from its parent in connection with the HPQ
Carveout, (2) Unimin will redeem 217,714 shares of common stock from its parent in connection with the Cash Redemption in exchange for a payment
of $520.2 million to the parent, which will be financed with the proceeds of the $1.65 billion Credit Agreement and cash on hand, (3) Unimin will effect
a stock split of its common stock (estimated to be approximately 89:1) and (4) Unimin will amend and restate its certificate of incorporation, which will
increase its authorized capital stock to 750 million shares of common stock and 15 million shares of preferred stock and will decrease its par value per
share from $1.00 to $0.01. The impact to stockholders’ equity and shares of Unimin is as follows:

Table of Contents

The accretion of the original issue discount and amortization of the up-front commitment fee are factually supportable (based on the Credit
Agreement, as described in Note 1). The interest rate used to calculate interest expense of $88.6 million is specified in the Credit Agreement. Additional
fees may apply as part of executing and closing on the Credit Agreement. The interest rate and interest expense from the anticipated term loan
borrowing are calculated as follows:
 
(in thousands, except for interest rates)     
2017 three month LIBOR quarterly average spot rate    1.4% 
Spread above LIBOR representing a Total Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) of greater than 2x and less

than 2.5x    4.0% 
    

 

Contractual interest rate    5.4% 
Multiplied by: Anticipated term loan principal balance   $1,650,000 

    
 

Interest expense from anticipated term loan borrowing   $ 88,594 
    

 

The interest rate will change based on the then-current LIBOR rate. The spread above LIBOR may change due to the combined company’s Total
Net Leverage ratio taking into account higher (or lower) spreads due to higher (or lower) leverage ratio tiers. A 1/8% change in interest rates would
result in a change in the term loan interest expense of approximately $2.1 million.

O – Represents estimated increase in depreciation, depletion and amortization expense of $11.3 million related to the fair value adjustment of property,
plant and equipment, in addition to intangible assets acquired.

P – Represents the tax impact of the pro forma adjustments at the estimated combined statutory rate of 37%. The effective tax rate of the combined
company could be significantly different (either higher or lower) depending on post-Merger activities and impact due to U.S. tax reform.

COMPARATIVE HISTORICAL AND
UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED

PER SHARE INFORMATION

The following table summarizes unaudited per share information on a historical basis for Unimin and Fairmount Santrol, on an unaudited pro
forma combined basis for Unimin and Fairmount Santrol reflecting the Merger and related transactions and adjustments and on an unaudited equivalent
pro forma basis for Fairmount Santrol. The following information should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and
accompanying notes of Unimin, copies of which are attached as Annex F this proxy statement/prospectus, and of Fairmount Santrol, which are
incorporated by reference into this proxy statement/prospectus, as well as the unaudited pro forma combined financial information beginning on
page 100 of this proxy statement/prospectus. The unaudited pro forma combined information is presented for illustrative purposes only and is not
necessarily indicative of what the combined company’s operating results or financial position would have been if the Merger and related transactions
had been completed as of the beginning of the period presented, nor is it necessarily indicative of the future operating results or financial position of the
combined company. The historical earnings per share, dividends per share and book value per share of Unimin and Fairmount Santrol shown in the table
below are derived from their audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017.

The historical book value per share is computed by dividing total shareholders’ equity by the number of shares outstanding at the end of the
period, excluding any shares held in treasury. The unaudited pro forma combined earnings per share is computed by dividing total unaudited pro forma
combined earnings by the unaudited pro forma combined weighted-average number of shares outstanding after giving effect to the Merger. The
unaudited pro forma combined book value per share is computed by dividing total unaudited pro forma combined shareholders’ equity by the unaudited
pro forma combined number of shares outstanding at the end of the period. The unaudited pro forma combined per share information is presented as if
the Merger and related transactions and adjustments occurred as of the date of the historical financial statements. The per share information on an
unaudited equivalent pro forma basis for Fairmount Santrol is computed by multiplying the unaudited pro forma combined data (basic and diluted
earnings per share, cash dividend per share and book value per share) by the Exchange Ratio of 0.20.

Prior to the closing of the Merger, Unimin will effect an approximately 89 for 1 stock split of its common stock. As the stock split will occur
following the effectiveness of the registration statement of which this proxy statement/prospectus is a part, Unimin’s historical share information
included in this proxy statement/prospectus has not been adjusted to give retrospective effect to the stock split. The exact stock split will be determined
based on the actual number of Fairmount Santrol shares outstanding or reserved for issuance immediately prior to the closing of the Merger.

February 1, 2017. In connection with the closing of the Merger, Unimin expects to redeem shares of Unimin common stock currently held by Sibelco in
exchange for an amount in cash equal to approximately $660 million, plus interest accruing at 5.0% since June 30, 2017 through the effective time, less
$170 million, which will be paid to Fairmount Santrol stockholders as consideration in the Merger.

On and subsequent to the closing of the Merger, the combined company does not currently anticipate declaring or issuing dividends. Any decision
by the combined company to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of the Combined Company Board and will depend upon the operations,
cash requirements, legal restrictions and other factors deemed relevant by the Combined Company Board. Further, it is expected that the combined
company’s debt agreements will place certain restrictions on the combined company’s ability to pay dividends. Consequently, unless there is a change to
the combined company dividend policy, your only opportunity to achieve a return on your investment is if the price of the combined company common
stock appreciates. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Investing in and Ownership of Combined Company Common Stock” beginning on page 84 of

THE SPECIAL MEETING

Only Fairmount Santrol stockholders of record at the close of business on the record date (April 20, 2018) will be entitled to vote at the special
meeting. As of the close of business on the record date, 224,982,895 shares of Fairmount Santrol common stock were outstanding and entitled to vote at
the special meeting.

Date, Time and Place

This proxy statement/prospectus is furnished in connection with the solicitation of proxies by the Fairmount Board for use at the special meeting
to be held on May 25, 2018, or at any adjournment or postponement thereof. The special meeting will be held at Jones Day located at 901 Lakeside
Avenue, Cleveland, Ohio 44114 on May 25, 2018, at 1:30 p.m., Eastern Time.

Purposes of the Special Meeting

At the special meeting, Fairmount Santrol stockholders will be asked to consider and vote on:
 

 •  the Fairmount Santrol Merger proposal;
 

 •  the Fairmount Santrol compensation proposal; and
 

 •  the Fairmount adjournment proposal.

Fairmount Santrol stockholders must approve the Fairmount Santrol Merger proposal (adopting the Merger Agreement) for the Merger to occur. If
the Fairmount Santrol stockholders fail to approve the Fairmount Santrol Merger proposal, the Merger will not occur. A copy of the Merger Agreement
is attached as Annex A to this proxy statement/prospectus, and the material provisions of the Merger Agreement are described herein in the section
entitled “The Merger Agreement.”

The vote on the Fairmount Santrol compensation proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote to approve the Fairmount Santrol Merger
proposal. Accordingly, a Fairmount Santrol stockholder may vote to approve the Fairmount Santrol compensation proposal and vote not to approve the
Fairmount Santrol Merger proposal and vice versa. Because the vote on the Fairmount Santrol compensation proposal is advisory in nature only, it will
not be binding on either Fairmount Santrol or Unimin. Accordingly, if the Merger Agreement is adopted by the Fairmount Santrol stockholders and the
Merger is completed, the Merger-related compensation may be paid to Fairmount Santrol’s executive officers even if Fairmount Santrol stockholders fail
to approve the Fairmount Santrol compensation proposal.

Fairmount Santrol does not expect a vote to be taken on any other matters at the special meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof. If
any other matters are properly presented at the special meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof for consideration, however, the holders of
the proxies will have discretion to vote on these matters in accordance with their best judgment.

This proxy statement/prospectus and the enclosed form of proxy are first being mailed to the Fairmount Santrol stockholders on or about April 26,
2018.

Record Date and Quorum

Only holders of record of shares of Fairmount Santrol common stock at the close of business on April 20, 2018, the record date, are entitled to
vote at the special meeting. On the record date, 224,982,895 shares of Fairmount Santrol common stock were issued and outstanding, and there were 38
record holders of Fairmount Santrol common stock.

The presence at the special meeting, in person or represented by proxy, of holders of a majority of the shares of Fairmount Santrol common stock
outstanding as of the close of business on the record date entitled to vote at the special meeting constitutes a quorum for the purposes of the special
meeting. Abstentions will be counted in determining whether a quorum exists. If your shares are held in “street name” by your bank, brokerage firm or

proposals, and your shares will not be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum exists. Because none of the proposals to be voted on at the
special meeting are routine matters for which brokers may have discretionary authority to vote, Fairmount Santrol does not expect any broker non-votes
at the special meeting. A quorum is necessary to transact business at the special meeting. Once a share of Fairmount Santrol common stock is
represented at the special meeting, it will be counted for the purpose of determining a quorum at the special meeting and any adjournment of the special
meeting. However, if a new record date is set for the adjourned special meeting, then a new quorum will be determined.

Votes Required

Assuming a quorum is present, the votes required for each proposal are as follows:
 

 
•  Proposal 1: Fairmount Santrol Merger proposal. The votes cast “FOR” this proposal must represent a majority of all outstanding shares of

Fairmount Santrol common stock as of the record date.
 

 
•  Proposal 2: Fairmount Santrol compensation proposal. The affirmative vote of a majority of Fairmount Santrol stockholders present, in

person or represented by proxy, and entitled to vote at the special meeting is required to approve the non-binding Fairmount Santrol
compensation proposal.

 

 
•  Proposal 3: Fairmount Santrol adjournment proposal. The affirmative vote of a majority of Fairmount Santrol stockholders present, in

person or represented by proxy, and entitled to vote at the special meeting is required to approve the Fairmount Santrol adjournment
proposal.

Voting and Support Agreement

As of April 2, 2018, approximately 26.4% of the outstanding shares of Fairmount Santrol common stock were beneficially owned by the
Supporting Stockholders. In accordance with the Voting and Support Agreement among Unimin, Merger Sub and the Supporting Stockholders, the
Supporting Stockholders have agreed to vote all of their shares of Fairmount Santrol common stock “FOR” the Fairmount Santrol Merger proposal.

Voting by Fairmount Santrol Directors and Officers

In addition to the shares of Fairmount Santrol common stock held by parties to the Voting and Support Agreement, as of April 2, 2018,
approximately 5.3% of the outstanding shares of Fairmount Santrol common stock were held by Fairmount Santrol directors and executive officers and
their affiliates (exclusive of the shares held by the Supporting Stockholders). It is currently expected that these directors and executive officers will vote
their shares of Fairmount Santrol common stock in favor of the above-listed proposals, although none of them has entered into any agreements
obligating him or her to do so.

Voting Rights; Proxies; Revocation

Each Fairmount Santrol stockholder may cast one vote for each share of Fairmount Santrol common stock owned as of the close of business on
the record date.

Attendance

Attendance at the special meeting is limited to Fairmount Santrol stockholders and invited guests. If you hold shares in your name and you wish to
attend the special meeting, please be prepared to provide proper identification, such as a driver’s license. If you hold your shares in “street name” and
you wish to attend the special meeting, you also will need proof of ownership, such as a recent account statement or letter from your bank or broker,
along with proper identification.

Even if you wish to attend the special meeting, we urge Fairmount Santrol stockholders to cast their votes using the enclosed proxy card. If you
choose to vote in person at the special meeting, it will revoke any previous proxy submitted. If you hold your shares in “street name” and wish to vote in

Providing Voting Instructions by Proxy

If your shares are registered directly in your name with Fairmount Santrol’s transfer agent, American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, you
are considered the stockholder of record with respect to those shares and you may cast your vote in person at the special meeting or by any one of the
following ways:
 

 

•  By Telephone: You may call the toll-free number indicated on your proxy card. Follow the simple instructions and use the personalized
control number specified on your proxy card to vote your shares. You will be able to confirm that your vote has been properly recorded.
Your telephone vote authorizes the named proxies to vote your shares in the same manner as if you had marked, signed and returned a proxy
card.

 

 
•  Online: You may visit the website indicated on your proxy card. Follow the simple instructions and use the personalized control number

specified on your proxy card to vote your shares. You will be able to confirm that your vote has been properly recorded. Your online vote
authorizes the named proxies to vote your shares in the same manner as if you had marked, signed and returned a proxy card.

 

 •  By Mail: You may mark, sign and date the enclosed proxy card and return it in the postage-paid envelope provided.

If your shares are held in an account at a bank, brokerage firm or other similar organization, then you are the “beneficial owner” of shares held in
“street name.” The organization holding your account is considered the shareholder of record for purposes of voting at the special meeting. As a
beneficial owner, you have the right to instruct that organization on how to vote the shares held in your account. If you request printed copies of these
proxy materials by mail, you will receive a voting instruction form. Under NYSE rules, if you hold your shares of Fairmount Santrol common stock in
“street name,” your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee may not vote your shares without instructions from you on non-routine matters. None of the
proposals to be voted on at the special meeting are routine matters. Therefore, without your voting instructions, your bank, brokerage firm or other
nominee may not vote your shares on any of the proposals at the special meeting. Consequently, there cannot be any broker non-votes at the special
meeting.

If you are a participant in the Fairmount Santrol 401(k) Plan (the “401(k) Plan”), you have the right to instruct the Trustee of the 401(k) Plan,
Fidelity Management Trust Company, to vote the shares allocated to your 401(k) Plan account.    If no instructions are given or if your voting
instructions are not received by the deadline shown on the enclosed voting instruction form, the Trustee is not authorized to vote the uninstructed shares.

 •  Submitting your vote at a later time online or by telephone;
 

 •  Submitting a properly signed proxy card with a later date that is received at or prior to the special meeting; or
 

 
•  Attending the special meeting and voting in person (if you do revoke your proxy during the special meeting, it will not, of course, affect any

vote that has already been taken).

The Fairmount Board is soliciting proxies in connection with the special meeting. The expense of soliciting proxies, including the cost of
preparing, assembling and mailing the notice and this proxy statement/prospectus, will be borne by Fairmount Santrol. Fairmount Santrol may pay

THE MERGER
(PROPOSAL 1)

This discussion of the Merger is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Merger Agreement, which is attached to this proxy
statement/prospectus as Annex A. You should read the entire Merger Agreement carefully as it is the legal document that governs the Merger.

General

The Merger Agreement provides that, upon the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to the Merger, Merger Sub will be merged with and into
Fairmount Santrol, with Fairmount Santrol surviving the Merger as a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Unimin. Immediately following the Merger,
Fairmount Santrol (as the surviving corporation in the Merger) will be merged with and into Merger Sub LLC after which Fairmount Santrol will cease
to exist as a separate corporate entity. Merger Sub LLC will continue as the surviving entity in the Second Merger as a direct wholly owned subsidiary
of the combined company and will succeed to and assume all the rights, privileges, immunities, properties, powers and franchises of Fairmount Santrol.

Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, Fairmount Santrol stockholders will have the right to receive, with respect
to each share of Fairmount Santrol common stock they hold at the effective time (other than (1) shares owned by Fairmount Santrol or any wholly
owned subsidiary of Fairmount Santrol (or held in the treasury of Fairmount Santrol), (2) shares owned by Sibelco or any of its subsidiaries and
(3) shares held by any stockholder who is entitled to appraisal rights and has properly exercised and perfected (and not effectively withdrawn or lost)
such stockholder’s demand for appraisal rights under the DGCL), the Merger Consideration, consisting of the Stock Consideration, the Cash
Consideration and cash paid in lieu of fractional shares, if any, without interest. For a more detailed description of the Merger Consideration, see “The
Merger Agreement—Effects of the Merger; Merger Consideration.” Upon the closing of the Merger, Sibelco will own, directly or indirectly,
approximately 65% of the issued and outstanding shares of combined company common stock and holders of Fairmount Santrol common stock
immediately prior to the effective time will hold in the aggregate, including certain equity awards, approximately 35% of the issued and outstanding
shares of combined company common stock. Upon the closing of the Merger, Unimin, as the parent company of the combined group, will operate under
a new name that will be selected by Unimin and Fairmount Santrol prior to the closing of the Merger.

In addition, at the effective time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of any of the parties to the Merger Agreement or the
holders of any shares of Fairmount Santrol common stock, each share of common stock of Merger Sub, par value $0.01 per share, issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the effective time will be cancelled and, in exchange for the cancellation of the shares of Merger Sub common stock
and the provision of the aggregate Merger Consideration by Unimin, Fairmount Santrol, as the surviving corporation in the Merger, will issue an
equivalent number of fully paid and non-assessable shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, all of which shares will be held by Unimin, and
which will constitute the only outstanding shares of common stock of Fairmount Santrol, as the surviving corporation, immediately following the
effective time. In addition, by virtue of the Second Merger and without any action on the part of any of the parties to the Merger Agreement, or the
holders of any shares of Fairmount Santrol common stock, each share of Fairmount Santrol common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the closing of the Second Merger will be automatically cancelled and retired and will cease to exist, and no consideration will be delivered in exchange
therefor.

The Merger Agreement does not contain any provision that would adjust the Exchange Ratio based on fluctuations in the market value of the
Fairmount Santrol common stock. Because of this, the implied value of the Merger Consideration to the Fairmount Santrol stockholders may fluctuate
between now and the closing of the Merger. However, the Merger Agreement provides that the Merger Consideration to be received by the Fairmount
Santrol stockholders will be adjusted appropriately to reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, share consolidation, share subdivision,
share bonus issue or stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Fairmount Santrol common stock or Unimin
common stock, as applicable), reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other like

change with respect to the number of shares of Fairmount Santrol common stock or Unimin common stock issued and outstanding after December 11,
2017 and prior to the effective time.

Background of the Merger

The Fairmount Board, together with Fairmount Santrol management, regularly reviews and assesses Fairmount Santrol’s business and operations
and periodically reviews and assesses various potential strategic alternatives available to enhance value to Fairmount Santrol’s stockholders. As part of
such reviews and assessments, Fairmount Santrol from time to time has held preliminary, informal discussions with potential strategic transaction
partners, including Unimin, Party A and Party B (each as hereinafter defined) and engaged third parties to assist in connection with such assessments.

During 2014 and 2015, Fairmount Santrol held a number of preliminary, high-level discussions with Sibelco and Party B regarding potential
transactions. Given volatility in the market, and its effects on each party’s relative valuation, the discussions did not progress beyond these high-level
discussions.

In connection with the preliminary, high-level discussions referenced above, in November 2014, Fairmount Santrol and Unimin entered into a
non-disclosure agreement with customary mutual “standstill” provisions. The confidentiality provisions of that agreement continued until November
2017 (and were superseded by a non-disclosure agreement entered into on February 27, 2017, as discussed below), and the mutual “standstill”
provisions continued until November 2015.

In June of 2015, representatives of Fairmount Santrol met with representatives of Unimin and Sibelco, who indicated an interest in a potential
combination of Unimin and Fairmount Santrol.

The parties continued intermittent high-level discussions through March of 2016, including exchanging high-level, preliminary information. In
connection with these discussions, Sibelco engaged Morgan Stanley & Co. International PLC (“Morgan Stanley”), whose representatives in these
matters included representatives of Morgan Stanley who had previously assisted Fairmount Santrol.

On March 18, 2016, the Executive Committee of the Fairmount Board met at a regularly scheduled meeting. During this meeting, the Executive
Committee discussed Wells Fargo Securities’ previous representation of Sibelco and Unimin and determined that Wells Fargo Securities’ relationships
with Sibelco and Unimin were not material and did not preclude Wells Fargo Securities from providing independent investment banking services to
Fairmount Santrol in connection with a potential transaction with Sibelco and Unimin.

On March 31, 2016, Fairmount Santrol formally engaged Wells Fargo Securities with respect to any transaction involving Sibelco or Unimin.

In April of 2016, the parties ceased discussions regarding a potential transaction as the Fairmount Board determined that, while a potential
combination of Unimin and Fairmount Santrol could be value enhancing for Fairmount Santrol stockholders, the proppant market was too volatile to
undertake a transaction at that time.

Also in April of 2016, Party B made a proposal to Fairmount Santrol to acquire certain of Fairmount Santrol’s key sand assets. After initial
consideration of the proposal, including the valuation, the Fairmount Board declined to discuss such transaction with Party B.

During 2016, Fairmount Santrol undertook a variety of actions designed to stabilize its balance sheet, including extending and repurchasing a
portion of its debt at a discount and raising capital through two equity issuances. A portion of the net proceeds from the equity issuances were used to
permanently payoff Fairmount Santrol’s long-term debt and the balance of its debt was refinanced in November 2017, in addition to putting in place a
new revolving credit facility.

In early 2017, as the proppant market began to recover, Fairmount Santrol, Sibelco and Unimin re-engaged in high-level discussions regarding a
potential strategic combination.

On February 7, 2017, Ms. Deckard, Chief Executive Officer of Fairmount Santrol, received a call from Mr. Deleersnyder, Chief Executive Officer
of Sibelco, regarding a potential strategic combination. In addition, representatives of Wells Fargo Securities received a call from representatives of
Morgan Stanley regarding the same.

Table of Contents

On February 27, 2017, the Fairmount Board held a meeting to discuss, among other things, a potential strategic transaction with Sibelco and
Unimin. Management and the Fairmount Board discussed the changing dynamics in the proppant market and the potential impact of those dynamics on
the valuation of any such transaction. The Fairmount Board also discussed the fact that Morgan Stanley, who had previously assisted Fairmount Santrol,
was now representing Sibelco and that Wells Fargo Securities, who had previously assisted Sibelco and Unimin, would be representing Fairmount
Santrol in connection with these discussions.

On February 27, 2017, Fairmount Santrol and Unimin entered into a non-disclosure agreement, with customary mutual “standstill” provisions, and
customary joint defense arrangements in order to enable counsel for both parties to conduct a regulatory analysis of any potential transaction. The
mutual “standstill” provisions continued until February 27, 2018.

On March 1, 2017, members of the management teams of Fairmount Santrol, Unimin and Sibelco met in New York City to present an overview of
their respective businesses. Also present were representatives of Wells Fargo Securities and of Morgan Stanley, and a representative of Hughes Hubbard,
antitrust counsel to Sibelco and Unimin.

On March 7, 2017, members of the management teams of Fairmount Santrol, Unimin and Sibelco held a conference call to discuss potential
synergies that may be available in a merger between Fairmount Santrol and Unimin.

On March 16, 2017, representatives of Wells Fargo Securities and of Morgan Stanley met in New York City to discuss the process for exchanging
the parties’ respective financial forecasts and other due diligence information.

On March 23, 2017, representatives of Wells Fargo Securities received a call from representatives of Morgan Stanley. During that call,
representatives of Morgan Stanley indicated that Sibelco was having a board meeting on March 31, 2017 to discuss, among other things, a potential
transaction between Fairmount Santrol and Unimin.

On April 5, 2017, Ms. Deckard met with Mr. Deleersnyder in New York City to discuss the potential transaction. Mr. Deleersnyder indicated that
Sibelco viewed the relative valuations as implying an ownership stake for Fairmount Santrol stockholders in the combined company of approximately
30%; Ms. Deckard indicated that this was too low. Ms. Deckard and Mr. Deleersnyder discussed the benefits of, and other potential considerations
related to, a combination, and the relative valuations of Fairmount Santrol and Unimin.

On April 21, 2017, Mr. Deleersnyder and Ms. Deckard held a telephone call. On the call, Mr. Deleersnyder proposed, subject to due diligence, an
all-stock merger between Fairmount Santrol and Unimin pursuant to which Fairmount Santrol’s stockholders would own 33-34% of the stock of the
combined company, with Sibelco owning the balance. Mr. Deleersnyder also proposed that Sibelco would have the right to appoint five directors to the
Board of the combined company with four Fairmount Santrol directors continuing, and that Sibelco would consider Ms. Deckard as a candidate to serve
as the Chief Executive Officer of the combined company.

On May 5, 2017, the Fairmount Board held a regularly scheduled meeting. All members of the Fairmount Board were present. In attendance were
Mr. Biehl, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Fairmount Santrol, Mr. Magaud, Executive Vice President and Chief Strategy &
Innovation Officer of Fairmount Santrol, and Mr. Crandall, Executive Vice President and General Counsel and Secretary of Fairmount Santrol, as well
as representatives of Wells Fargo Securities. At the meeting, in light of the potential for rapid and frequent developments regarding a potential business
combination involving Fairmount Santrol, the Fairmount Board determined to establish a working group of the Fairmount Board to have primary
responsibility for handling day-to-day issues arising in connection with discussions with Unimin, Sibelco and any other potential counterparty.

On May 6, 2017, Ms. Deckard and Mr. Deleersnyder held a telephone call. On that call, Ms. Deckard provided an update to Mr. Deleersnyder that
the Fairmount Board intended to establish a working group to have primary responsibility for handling day-to-day issues arising in connection with
discussions with Unimin and Sibelco, and that the Fairmount Board would be meeting in the coming week to provide a response to Sibelco’s proposal of
April 21, 2017.

On May 11, 2017 and May 12, 2017, the Fairmount Board held regularly scheduled meetings. All members of the Fairmount Board were present.
In attendance were Mr. Biehl, Mr. Magaud, Mr. Crandall, Mr. Richardson, Executive Vice President and Chief People Officer of Fairmount Santrol, and
other members of Fairmount Santrol management. Representatives of Wells Fargo Securities and Jones Day participated in the meeting. Jones Day
discussed the Fairmount Board’s fiduciary duties and the potential for a conflict of interest involving Ms. Deckard in light of Sibelco’s willingness to
consider that Ms. Deckard might serve as the Chief Executive Officer of the combined company after the potential closing of a transaction. The
Fairmount Board asked a number of questions of the representative of Jones Day regarding their fiduciary duties and the potential conflict of interest
and a discussion among the directors ensued. As Chairman of the Fairmount Board, the Fairmount Board instructed Mr. LeBaron to lead all material
negotiations between Fairmount Santrol and Sibelco, Unimin or any other potential counterparty with respect to the transaction terms and that Ms.
Deckard not engage in any material negotiations with Sibelco, Unimin or any other potential counterparty with respect to transaction terms without the
knowledge or participation of Mr. LeBaron or a designee of his selection from the Fairmount Board. Continuing its discussion from the May 5, 2017
board meeting, the Fairmount Board formally established the working group of the Fairmount Board, which is referred to herein as the “Business
Combination Group.” The Business Combination Group was granted the authority (i) to provide analysis, advice, and opinions to the Fairmount Board
and/or management as required or requested with respect to a potential transaction; (ii) to engage in discussions with Fairmount Santrol’s advisors and
other relevant third parties, including any potential counterparty, with respect to any such potential transaction; (iii) to provide regular updates and
communications to the Fairmount Board with respect to any activities undertaken by the Business Combination Group; (iv) to develop and recommend
to the Fairmount Board a course of action regarding any potential transaction; (v) to act in the interval between meetings of the Fairmount Board in
furtherance of instructions given to the Business Combination Group by the Fairmount Board; and (vi) to perform such other functions as are from time
to time assigned by the Fairmount Board. The Business Combination Group was not delegated the authority to approve any potential business
combination. The Business Combination Group consisted of Mr. LeBaron, Ms. Deckard, Mr. Sand, Mr. Conway and Mr. Hadden.

The Business Combination Group held telephonic meetings on May 6, May 7, May 9, May 16, May 19, May 21 and May 22, 2017. The meetings
were attended by representatives of Jones Day and of Wells Fargo Securities, and in the meetings Wells Fargo Securities presented various preliminary
financial analyses at the request of the Business Combination Group. In particular, the Business Combination Group was focused on identifying the
most relevant preliminary valuation analyses and in validating the assumptions underlying those analyses, and on such basis forming a preliminary
position on the relative valuation of Fairmount Santrol and Unimin.

On May 12, 2017, Mr. LeBaron and Ms. Deckard met with Mr. Deleersnyder and Mr. Decat, Chief Financial Officer of Sibelco, in New York City.
At the meeting, it was agreed that the limited non-public data already exchanged should be updated in light of rapidly evolving market factors in the
industries in which Fairmount Santrol and Unimin operate. The representatives of Fairmount Santrol indicated that they would be in a position to
respond to Sibelco on Fairmount Santrol’s view of the relative valuation of the two companies shortly after the updated information is exchanged.

On May 13, 2017, Ms. Deckard and Mr. Deleersnyder held a telephone call in which Mr. Deleersnyder expressed disappointment that Fairmount
Santrol had not yet responded to the April 11, 2017 verbal indication of relative valuation that Mr. Deleersnyder had communicated. Ms. Deckard
indicated that Fairmount Santrol was still interested in the opportunity but needed additional time and information to ensure the Fairmount Board could
make a decision whether a combination with Unimin would maximize value for Fairmount Santrol stockholders versus Fairmount Santrol’s stand-alone
business plan. Ms. Deckard and Mr. Deleersnyder did not discuss relative valuation of the two companies or other elements of the proposal. Ms.
Deckard subsequently provided the Business Combination Group with a summary of such conversation.

On May 21, 2017, Mr. LeBaron provided an update to the Fairmount Board concerning the work undertaken by the Business Combination Group
in its various May 2017 meetings, and indicated that the Business Combination Group was, with the assistance of Wells Fargo Securities, nearly finished
with the process of

forming a preliminary counterproposal to Sibelco regarding the relative valuation of Fairmount Santrol and Unimin. In forming the preliminary
counterproposal to Sibelco, the Business Combination Group identified preliminary valuation methodologies, such as discounted cash flow analyses and
contribution analyses, and reviewed the assumptions underlying those methodologies, including Fairmount Santrol management’s views on the
historical and projected performance (including assumptions on utilization of production capacity) of Fairmount Santrol and of Unimin.

On May 22, 2017, the Business Combination Group held a meeting, and, after discussion and with input from representatives of Wells Fargo
Securities, recommended that Mr. LeBaron communicate a non-binding counterproposal to Sibelco of a 38% ownership interest of the combined
company for Fairmount Santrol’s stockholders.

On May 23, 2017, Mr. LeBaron provided an update to the Fairmount Board concerning the recommendation of the Business Combination Group
that Fairmount Santrol submit a counterproposal of a 38% ownership interest.

On May 24, 2017, Mr. LeBaron and Ms. Deckard held a telephone call with Mr. Deleersnyder and Mr. Decat. On the call, Mr. LeBaron provided
Fairmount Santrol’s counterproposal that Fairmount Santrol stockholders own 38% of the potential combined company.

On May 26, 2017, Mr. Deleersnyder called Ms. Deckard. Mr. Deleersnyder communicated to Ms. Deckard that Sibelco did not believe there was a
basis for continuing discussions in light of Fairmount Santrol’s counterproposal of 38% ownership. Ms. Deckard subsequently provided an update to the
Fairmount Board of her discussions with Mr. Deleersnyder.

On May 31, 2017, representatives of Wells Fargo Securities and of Morgan Stanley had lunch in Houston. During this lunch and at the direction of
the Fairmount Board, representatives of Wells Fargo Securities indicated that a strategic combination between Fairmount Santrol and Unimin continued
to be compelling but that Fairmount was waiting on a response from Sibelco as to its latest proposal.

On June 2, 2017, Mr. Deleersnyder and Ms. Deckard held a telephone call. On that call, Mr. Deleersnyder and Ms. Deckard each expressed a
desire to continue to explore a potential strategic transaction, notwithstanding the valuation gap between the two parties. Ms. Deckard subsequently
provided an update to the Business Combination Group of her discussions with Mr. Deleersnyder.

On June 15, 2017, Mr. Deleersnyder and Mr. LeBaron had a call to discuss potentially re-engaging in discussions regarding a strategic transaction.
Mr. LeBaron informed Mr. Deleersnyder that Mr. Deleersnyder should contact Mr. LeBaron directly with any matters relating to a potential transaction.

On June 28, 2017, Mr. Deleersnyder called Mr. LeBaron to inform him that Sibelco would be delivering a letter relating to a potential transaction
and provided Mr. LeBaron with a high-level overview of the proposed terms of such transaction.

On June 29, 2017, Mr. Deleersnyder delivered a letter to Mr. LeBaron via e-mail. The letter contained a revised proposal pursuant to which
Fairmount Santrol stockholders would own 35% of the combined company if a synergies analysis established in excess of $100 million of synergies,
33% of the combined company if a synergies analysis established less than $80 million of synergies, or a percentage interpolated between 33% and 35%
for synergies between $80 million and $100 million. The letter also indicated that the proposal was predicated on Unimin’s contribution of $860 million
of net debt and certain debt-like liabilities; that based upon Sibelco’s discussions with Morgan Stanley, Sibelco was highly confident that refinancing of
the combined company’s pro forma net debt of approximately $1.5 billion could be arranged; and that Unimin’s “High Purity Quartz” business would be
excluded from the transaction. The letter further proposed that (i) Sibelco would have the right to nominate the majority of directors, with the minority
consisting of independent legacy Fairmount Santrol directors plus the Chief Executive Officer of the combined company, (ii) that each of Fairmount
Santrol and Unimin would have representation in the c-suite of the combined company, as determined via a “best of breed” selection process, (iv) that
Sibelco and Fairmount Santrol would “jointly finalize” the Chief Executive

Officer selection process, and (v) that Unimin would survive the merger as the “topco” of the combined entity and would list on NYSE or NASDAQ.

On June 30, 2017 and July 7, 2017, the Business Combination Group held telephonic meetings to discuss the revised proposal from Sibelco,
potential responses to Sibelco, and preliminary financial analyses prepared by Wells Fargo Securities. Fairmount Santrol management and
representatives of Wells Fargo Securities noted recent changes to each company’s business and financial performance that may affect each party’s view
on relative valuation.

On July 10, 2017, Mr. LeBaron called Mr. Deleersnyder and communicated that Fairmount Santrol would not be willing to move forward with a
transaction if the Fairmount stockholders would have an ownership level of less than 35% but would be prepared to move forward with the proposed
synergy analysis in order to determine if a transaction at 35% ownership of the combined company would be acceptable to the Fairmount Board. Mr.
LeBaron noted that Fairmount Santrol was not inclined to tying negotiation of the relative ownership to expected synergies analysis, as doing so would
misalign incentives to identify maximum synergy opportunities. Mr. Deleersnyder agreed that the parties should be working to identify as many
synergies as possible, but reiterated that Sibelco would need to validate $100 million of synergies to proceed at a 35% ownership level for Fairmount
Santrol stockholders. Mr. LeBaron also noted that Fairmount Santrol’s decision to move forward with the synergy review was predicated on (i) the
proposed structure having no negative tax impact on Fairmount Santrol’s stockholders, (ii) the proposed board composition of five-to-four in favor of
Sibelco, or an equivalent “plus one” construct on a larger board, would apply whether or not Fairmount Santrol’s Chief Executive Officer was appointed
as Chief Executive Officer of the combined company, and (iii) Sibelco agreeing to stockholder arrangements providing customary protections to the
post-closing minority stockholders. Mr. LeBaron and Mr. Deleersnyder also discussed the identity of consulting firms to be used in a synergies analysis.

On July 18, 2017, representatives of Fairmount Santrol and of Sibelco began discussions with consulting firms in order to receive and evaluate
proposals for providing the contemplated synergies analysis.

On July 21, 2017, representatives of Jones Day held a conference call with representatives of Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer US LLP
(“Freshfields”), counsel to Sibelco, to discuss the structure of the proposed transaction and primary legal workstreams that would need to be undertaken
if Fairmount Santrol and Sibelco were to agree to move forward with the proposed transaction.

On July 29, 2017, Unimin engaged Accenture LLP (“Accenture”) (with Fairmount Santrol agreeing to share Accenture’s costs), and Fairmount
Santrol and Sibelco engaged McKinsey & Company (“McKinsey”), in each case, to undertake the synergies analysis. Throughout August 2017,
Fairmount Santrol, Unimin and Sibelco worked with Accenture and McKinsey to complete the synergies analysis.

On August 16, 2017, and August 17, 2017, the Fairmount Board held a regularly scheduled meeting in Cleveland. All members of the Fairmount
Board were present. In attendance were Mr. Crandall, Mr. Biehl, Mr. Richardson and other members of Fairmount Santrol management. Also present
were representatives of Wells Fargo Securities and a representative of Jones Day. At the meeting, the representatives of Wells Fargo Securities presented
various preliminary financial analyses related to the latest Sibelco proposal, including a discounted cash flow analysis updated based on Fairmount
Santrol management’s then-current views on financial outlook, and an updated contribution analysis. The Fairmount Board discussed the key
assumptions underlying the forecasts and financial analyses at length. The representative of Jones Day also discussed with the Fairmount Board various
aspects of the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable law and key aspects of merger agreements in this context, including provisions related to the
directors’ continued ability to exercise their fiduciary duties and provisions relating to consummation risk allocation and transaction certainty. The
Fairmount Board also received updates from Fairmount Santrol management on other aspects of the potential transaction process, including relating to
employee retention considerations.

On September 5, 2017, McKinsey and Accenture presented their final synergies analysis to Fairmount Santrol management and Sibelco
management. Among other things, the analysis indicated an approximate range

of $112 - $136 million of annual synergies, excluding capital expenditure avoidance. Given the scope of the information provided to McKinsey and
Accenture, after September 5, 2017, management of Fairmount Santrol continued to refine and update the synergies analysis as due diligence progressed
and in order to capture potential areas of synergies outside of the scope of McKinsey’s and Accenture’s engagement.

On September 8, 2017, Mr. LeBaron and Mr. Deleersnyder held a call to discuss the results of the synergies analysis and next steps in advancing a
transaction. Both Mr. LeBaron and Mr. Deleersnyder, on behalf of Fairmount Santrol and Sibelco respectively, indicated an expectation that given the
results of the synergy analysis both parties would seek approval to proceed with the proposed transaction. Mr. Deleersnyder indicated that Sibelco would
seek approval from its board to proceed with a transaction during a previously scheduled meeting on September 21 and September 22, 2017.

On September 9, 2017, Mr. LeBaron provided an update to the Fairmount Board, which included a summary of the findings of the synergies
analysis. The update also included preliminary materials prepared by Wells Fargo Securities recapping recent transaction process events, and materials
prepared by Jones Day describing key matters still to be negotiated between Fairmount Santrol and Sibelco, including post-closing governance rights
and minority protections, treatment of Fairmount Santrol equity awards, risk allocation relating to obtaining regulatory approvals, and various other
customary contract matters. At the conclusion of the meeting, the Fairmount Board approved continuing due diligence and negotiations with Sibelco
regarding a potential transaction.

On September 12, 2017, at the request of a representative of a third participant in Fairmount Santrol’s industry (“Party A”), Mr. LeBaron met with
the representative of Party A. At the meeting, the representative of Party A discussed with Mr. LeBaron the view of Party A that a combination of Party
A and Fairmount Santrol would have compelling strategic rationale. No specific proposal was made or discussed, but both Mr. LeBaron and the
representative of Party A agreed that there was a compelling logic to consolidation in the companies’ industry. Mr. LeBaron indicated that he would
discuss such potential combination with the Fairmount Board.

On September 15, 2017, the representative of Party A e-mailed to Mr. LeBaron materials that described Party A’s views of the strategic rationale
for a combination of Fairmount Santrol and Party A. The materials did not contain a specific proposal regarding a valuation of the potential combination
of Fairmount Santrol with Party A, but did indicate that Party A was interested in a stock-for-stock merger with shared post-closing governance.

Starting on or about September 15, 2017, and, except as otherwise noted below, continuing through the opening of virtual datarooms containing
due diligence information on October 18, 2017, Fairmount Santrol and Unimin and their respective advisors negotiated the scope and terms of the
parties’ reciprocal due diligence review.

On September 18, 2017, representatives of Jones Day called representatives of Freshfields in order to reiterate that Fairmount Santrol would
require various post-closing protections for minority stockholders of the combined company, including negative approval rights in favor of non-Sibelco
directors of the combined company and in favor of minority stockholders as a class, a limitation on acquisitions of combined company stock by Sibelco
in excess of the original issuance of 65%, and standstill provisions and transfer restrictions applicable for certain periods post-closing.

On September 19, 2017, the Business Combination Group held a telephonic meeting. Representatives of Jones Day and of Wells Fargo Securities
were present. At the meeting, the Business Combination Group discussed and provided input on draft transaction term sheets, prepared by Jones Day
with input from Fairmount Santrol management and Wells Fargo Securities, outlining the principal terms of a potential merger agreement and post-
closing stockholder arrangements.

On September 25, 2017, Mr. Deleersnyder delivered a letter to Mr. LeBaron via e-mail. The letter contained a revised proposal pursuant to which
Fairmount Santrol stockholders would own 34% of the combined company. The letter indicated that Sibelco’s view of synergies was $96 million, driven
by Sibelco’s view that $23 million in cost synergies would be achievable by Fairmount Santrol and Unimin even in the absence of a transaction. The

letter further stated that the revised 34% ownership proposal assumed a $600 million debt-financed cash distribution from Unimin to Sibelco prior to the
closing of a transaction. The letter also clarified that the proposed board composition would be five-to-three in favor of Sibelco, with a ninth director
being the Chief Executive Officer, whether or not Fairmount Santrol’s Chief Executive Officer continued. The letter again referred to the Chief
Executive Officer role as being “jointly” finalized in the future.

Later on September 25, 2017, at the direction of the Business Combination Group, representatives of Wells Fargo Securities contacted
representatives of Morgan Stanley and conveyed that Fairmount Santrol was disappointed with the revised proposal from Sibelco and would be putting a
hold on due diligence planning work given relative ownership split in Sibelco’s proposal.

On September 26, 2017, the Business Combination Group held a telephonic meeting. Representatives of Jones Day and of Wells Fargo Securities
were in attendance. The Business Combination Group discussed the revised proposal from Sibelco, and also discussed the differences between the draft
transaction term sheet previously reviewed by the Business Combination Group and the terms of Sibelco’s revised proposal. The Business Combination
Group discussed at length the appropriate protections required to protect the interest of post-closing minority stockholders, and received related legal
advice from representatives of Jones Day and financial advice from representatives of Wells Fargo Securities. Among other things, representatives of
Wells Fargo Securities noted that in their view, the public equity markets would be likely to price in much of the probable synergy benefits of the
combination shortly after the announcement and the closing of a transaction and on such basis Fairmount Santrol’s stockholders would not need the
benefit of multiple years of minority shareholder protections in order to realize the benefits of the transaction. During the remainder of September 26,
2017, and throughout September 27, 2017, the members of the Business Combination Group worked with Fairmount Santrol’s legal and financial
advisors to prepare a response letter to Sibelco.

On September 27, 2017, Fairmount Santrol became aware that a major financial news outlet was seeking comment from third parties concerning
the existence of discussions between Fairmount Santrol and Sibelco in respect of a merger between Fairmount Santrol and Unimin.

Later on September 27, 2017, Mr. LeBaron provided an update to the Fairmount Board describing the potential impending press report and the
status of discussions with Sibelco.

Later on September 27, 2017, Ms. Deckard delivered to Mr. Deleersnyder, via e-mail, a letter from Mr. LeBaron to Mr. Deleersnyder and Mr.
Decat. The letter communicated Fairmount Santrol’s surprise with the 34% ownership percentage proposed by Sibelco, and outlined terms on which
Fairmount Santrol would be willing to continue to discuss the proposed transaction, including (i) 35% ownership for Fairmount Santrol stockholders in
the combined company, (ii) clarification that the $600 million distribution payable from Unimin to Sibelco prior to closing would be included in the
$860 million net debt of Unimin at closing, (iii) the absence of any financing contingency, and (iv) the provision to Fairmount Santrol of comprehensive
“reverse” due diligence material by Unimin. Additionally, the letter was accompanied by a term sheet that conveyed numerous positions of Fairmount
Santrol with respect to a proposed transaction, including Fairmount’s positions (i) with respect to the scope of assets that the parties should be required
to divest in order to secure regulatory approvals, and that Sibelco would pay a “reverse” termination fee to Fairmount Santrol if the merger agreement
was terminated because of a required divestiture in excess of a certain threshold, (ii) that the termination fee payable to Sibelco in connection with a
topping bid would be “two-tiered” (meaning the fee would be lower for an initial period after announcement of a transaction), (iii) that at least two of
the Sibelco-appointed directors of the combined company would be independent under applicable listing standards, and (iv) that the post-closing
minority stockholders would receive protective rights consistent with other recent controlling shareholder transactions.

On September 29, 2017, Mr. Deleersnyder delivered via e-mail a letter to Mr. LeBaron, which Mr. Deleersnyder noted was unsigned by Sibelco.
The letter noted that (i) with respect to the combined company’s board, Sibelco would not accept a requirement that any of its selected directors be
independent, and that Sibelco expected shareholder rights attendant to its proposed position as the majority stockholder of a controlled company,
including the absence of a nominating and corporate governance committee of the combined

company, (ii) Sibelco would require a financing contingency as a closing condition to a transaction, covering both the $600 million levered dividend
payable from Unimin to Sibelco and refinancing of Unimin’s and Fairmount Santrol’s existing debt, (iii) Sibelco would not accept a “reverse”
termination fee in respect of an antitrust-related termination of a merger agreement, (iv) Sibelco would expect a divestiture threshold significantly lower
than the threshold proposed by Fairmount Santrol, and (v) Sibelco would expect a significant, “single-tier” termination fee payable by Fairmount Santrol
in certain circumstances. The letter also contained an appendix of key proposed transaction terms, which, among other things, left blank the ownership
split between Sibelco and Fairmount Santrol’s stockholders.

Later on September 29, 2017, Mr. LeBaron and Mr. Deleersnyder spoke by telephone. On the call, Mr. Deleersnyder indicated that the Sibelco
board would agree to Fairmount Santrol stockholders owning 35% of the combined company, subject to Fairmount Santrol agreeing to the other terms
set forth in the September 29, 2017 letter.

On September 30, 2017, at the direction of the Fairmount Board, representatives of Wells Fargo Securities and of Jones Day, and representatives
of Morgan Stanley and of Freshfields, held a conference call to discuss the proposed terms of the transaction as set forth in the September 27, 2017,
Fairmount Santrol letter and the September 29, 2017, Sibelco letter.

On October 1, 2017, representatives of Jones Day sent Freshfields and Morgan Stanley a revised term sheet as well as an additional term sheet
specifically describing the protections that Fairmount Santrol was requesting for the post-closing minority stockholders in the combined company.

On October 3, 2017, at the direction of the Fairmount Board, representatives of Wells Fargo Securities and of Jones Day, and representatives of
Morgan Stanley and of Freshfields, held a conference call to continue discussing the proposed term sheets.

On October 3, 2017, a major financial news outlet published a report that Fairmount Santrol and Unimin were evaluating a business combination.

On October 4, 2017, representatives of Freshfields sent Jones Day a revised draft of the term sheet containing minority stockholder protections.
Among other things, the draft contained a cap on Sibelco’s ownership of the combined company of 80.1%, the deletion of the “majority of minority”
approval requirement on changes of control of the combined company within three years after closing, and the limitation of the standstill and transfer
restriction protections to a two-year period after closing.

On October 6, 2017, a representative of a potential third party acquiror (“Party B”) left a message for Ms. Deckard requesting to have a
conversation. Party B is a participant in Fairmount Santrol’s industry. Ms. Deckard, Mr. LeBaron and Jones Day discussed various approaches to
responding to Party B and Mr. LeBaron, based on the advice of Jones Day, requested that Ms. Deckard provide a simple response consistent with
Fairmount Santrol’s customary response to market rumors while making it clear that the Fairmount Board would consider, consistent with its fiduciary
duties, any credible strategic proposal.

Later on October 6, 2017, representatives of Jones Day sent Freshfields revised drafts of the general transaction term sheet and of the separate
term sheet containing minority stockholder protections. Among other things, the general term sheet draft reflected the parties’ agreement that a financing
contingency was acceptable to Fairmount Santrol if Fairmount Santrol would be party to the financing commitments and able to pursue damages against
lenders for failure to fund when required, reflected Fairmount Santrol’s most recent position that it would only require a “reverse” termination fee in the
context of an antitrust-related termination of the merger agreement in the event that Fairmount Santrol was sufficiently comfortable with the to-be-
agreed divestiture threshold, and reflected Fairmount Santrol’s agreement to a single-tier termination fee payable by Fairmount Santrol in certain
circumstances with the amount of the fee still to be determined. Among other things, the minority protections term sheet contained a cap on Sibelco’s
ownership of the combined company of 70%, a right of the combined company’s independent directors to block the issuance of additional equity
securities of the combined company if the independent directors determined the issuance to involve a conflict of interest between Sibelco and the
minority stockholders, a right of the combined company’s independent directors to block a

change of control transaction within the first three years after closing, and three years of protection under the standstill and transfer restriction
provisions.

On October 7, 2017, Ms. Deckard and the Party B representative spoke by telephone. The Party B representative inquired about the news reports
concerning a combination of Fairmount Santrol and Unimin. Ms. Deckard noted that Fairmount Santrol does not comment on market rumors, but that, if
Party B were interested in pursuing a transaction with Fairmount Santrol, Party B should expect that, consistent with its fiduciary duties, the Fairmount
Board would evaluate any credible strategic proposal.

Later on October 7, 2017, Mr. LeBaron, together with Ms. Deckard and other members of Fairmount Santrol management, held a conference call
with representatives of Sibelco to discuss open material terms. Representatives of Jones Day, Wells Fargo Securities, Freshfields and Morgan Stanley
held further discussions later on October 7, 2017.

Later on October 7, 2017, representatives of Freshfields sent Jones Day revised drafts of the two term sheets. Among other things, the revised
drafts left blank the combined company ownership split, deleted a right of the combined company’s independent directors to block a change in control of
the combined company for three years after the closing, and provided that Sibelco would be capped at 70% ownership of the combined company for
three years after the closing and thereafter at 80.1%.

Also late on October 7, 2017, a representative of Party B delivered a letter via email to Mr. LeBaron and Ms. Deckard. The letter referenced the
October 3, 2017 market reports concerning a potential transaction between Fairmount Santrol and Unimin, and indicated that Party B was interested in
acquiring Fairmount Santrol for a combination of cash and stock. The letter did not contain a specific proposal or potential valuation range.

On October 8, 2017 and October 9, 2017, Fairmount Santrol’s and Sibelco’s respective legal and financial advisors continued to exchange drafts
of the general transaction term sheet, of the separate term sheet containing minority stockholder protections, and of a document outlining the general
scope of post-closing commercial agreements between Sibelco and the combined company.

On October 9, 2017, representatives of Freshfields sent Jones Day revised drafts of the two term sheets. Among other things, the revised drafts
included a 35% ownership of the combined company by the Fairmount Santrol stockholders, deleted reference to a “reverse” termination fee in the
context of an antitrust-related termination of the merger agreement, provided minority stockholders the ability to participate on the same terms as
Sibelco in any change in control transaction of the combined company during the three year period after the closing, and provided that Sibelco would be
capped at 70% ownership of the combined company for three years after the closing and thereafter at 80.1%.

Also on October 9, 2017, representatives of Morgan Stanley called Wells Fargo Securities to convey that Sibelco’s board had reviewed the
October 9, 2017 term sheet delivered by Freshfields and had agreed to proceed with a transaction on the terms outlined therein.

On October 10, 2017, Mr. LeBaron called the representative of Party B and indicated that, if Party B were to submit a specific proposal to
Fairmount Santrol, that the Fairmount Board would consider such specific proposal.

On October 11, 2017, the Fairmount Board held a regularly scheduled meeting in Cleveland. All of the members of the Fairmount Board were
present. Also present at the meeting were Mr. Crandall, Mr. Biehl, Mr. Richardson, Mr. Magaud and other members of Fairmount Santrol management.
Also in attendance, telephonically, were representatives of Jones Day and of Wells Fargo Securities. At the meeting, the Fairmount Board asked a
number of questions of the representatives of Jones Day and Wells Fargo Securities and discussed recent developments in the transaction process with
Fairmount Santrol management and the representatives of Wells Fargo Securities. Representatives of Jones Day also discussed with the directors various
aspects of their fiduciary duties under applicable law, and presented in detail the provisions of the term sheets being negotiated with Sibelco, including
the terms that remained unresolved, including the duration of a right in favor of minority stockholders to participate in any transaction in which Sibelco
would transfer control of the combined company and the antitrust divestiture threshold and related “reverse” termination fee. The Fairmount Board
discussed the

proposed terms of the Unimin transaction at length. The Fairmount Board also discussed preliminary materials prepared by Wells Fargo Securities
concerning a potential transaction with either Party A or Party B, and discussed at length the likelihood that either Party A or Party B would ultimately
be willing and able to submit proposals more favorable to Fairmount Santrol’s stockholders than Sibelco’s proposal. Also at the meeting, after the
representatives of Wells Fargo Securities departed the meeting, the Fairmount Board provisionally approved an amendment to Fairmount Santrol’s
March 31, 2016 engagement letter with Wells Fargo Securities, pursuant to which amendment Wells Fargo Securities became entitled to receive a
transaction fee in respect of a transaction between Fairmount Santrol and a party other than Unimin or Sibelco. Fairmount Santrol and Wells Fargo
Securities subsequently executed such amended engagement letter on October 20, 2017.

Later on October 11, 2017, a representative of Party A delivered a letter to Mr. LeBaron via e-mail. The letter contained a proposal whereby
Fairmount Santrol and Party A would combine in a stock-for-stock merger, with Fairmount Santrol stockholders owning 53% of the combined company
as of the date of the letter.

On October 18, 2017, Fairmount Santrol and Sibelco (in respect of Unimin) opened their respective virtual datarooms to each other and their
respective advisors, which datarooms were subject to the parties’ agreement on several procedures to protect competitively sensitive information from
disclosure to the parties’ respective employees in certain operational roles. Generally, Fairmount Santrol, Sibelco and Unimin, and their respective
advisors continued their respective due diligence reviews through the end of November 2017.

On October 19, 2017, the Fairmount Board held a special telephonic meeting. All members of the Fairmount Board were present. Present from
Fairmount Santrol management were Mr. Crandall, Mr. Magaud, Mr. Richardson and Mr. Biehl. Also present were representatives of Jones Day and of
Wells Fargo Securities. At the meeting, the Fairmount Board discussed various aspects of the potential strategic transaction process, including in relation
to Unimin, Party A and Party B. Also at the meeting, the representatives of Wells Fargo Securities presented preliminary financial analyses of the
proposal received from Party A. Among other things, representatives of Wells Fargo Securities noted that, in light of the pro forma combined company
ownership implied by Party A’s proposal, Party A’s proposal amounted to an acquisition of Party A by Fairmount Santrol. The representatives of Wells
Fargo Securities also discussed with the Fairmount Board an operational comparison of Fairmount Santrol, Unimin and Party A. At the conclusion of
the meeting, the Fairmount Board determined that an acquisition of Party A by Fairmount Santrol was not, at that time, likely to be more beneficial to
Fairmount Santrol’s stockholders than a combination with Unimin.

Later on October 19, 2017, Mr. LeBaron called a representative of Party A to discuss a potential combination, including with respect to potential
synergies and the elements of a potential transaction between Party A and Fairmount Santrol that would be relevant to the valuation of such potential
transaction.

Later on October 19, 2017, a representative of Party B delivered a letter via email to Mr. LeBaron and Ms. Deckard. The letter contained a
proposal to acquire Fairmount Santrol for $4.73 per share, consisting of $1.42 per share in cash and the balance in the form of stock consideration that
would constitute approximately 24% ownership of Party B. Party B indicated that it believed a combined transaction would have anticipated synergies
of $175 million to $225 million per year. The letter did not specify any other proposed transaction terms. The closing price of Fairmount Santrol
common stock on October 19, 2017 was $3.96 per share.

On October 20, 2017, a representative of Party A delivered a letter to Mr. LeBaron via e-mail. The letter reiterated Party A’s existing offer, noting
that the then-current exchange ratio implied an ownership percentage of 48% for current Fairmount Santrol stockholders as of the date of the letter. The
letter also set forth Party A’s views of certain structural aspects of Party A’s October 11, 2017 proposal, including the fact that Party A viewed the
proposal as a “merger of equals” as opposed to a transaction with a “large premium.”

Also on October 20, 2017, representatives of Freshfields sent to Jones Day the first draft of the merger agreement, together with the first draft of
certain other key transaction documents. Among other things, the draft merger agreement reflected Sibelco’s positions that Sibelco would not be a party
to the merger agreement, that Fairmount Santrol would not have the right to terminate the merger agreement to accept a superior proposal without first
holding a special meeting to submit the merger agreement to Fairmount Santrol stockholders, that

Table of Contents

the Fairmount Board would have the right to change its recommendation with respect to the merger agreement to Fairmount Santrol stockholders only if
a superior proposal were made (and not in respect of any other event or change), that Sibelco and Unimin would be entitled to reimbursement of all
transaction expenses by Fairmount Santrol in the event that Fairmount Santrol’s stockholders did not adopt the merger agreement, and that Fairmount
Santrol would not be entitled to a “reverse” termination fee in the event of the termination of the merger agreement in connection with a required
divestiture in excess of the agreed divestiture threshold.

Freshfields continued to deliver to Jones Day first drafts of various other key transaction documents through the end of October 2017, including
the Stockholders Agreement and the restated Certificate of Incorporation of the combined company. During this period, representatives of Jones Day
and of Freshfields commenced negotiating the various transaction documents, and such negotiations continued through the execution of a definitive
merger agreement, including as further discussed below.

On October 30, 2017, representatives of Jones Day sent revised drafts of certain transaction documents, including the merger agreement, to
Freshfields. Among other things, the revised draft merger agreement reflected Fairmount Santrol’s positions that Sibelco would be a party to the merger
agreement, that Fairmount Santrol would have the right to terminate the merger agreement to accept a superior proposal without respect to whether or
not the Fairmount Santrol stockholders had first voted against the adoption of the merger agreement, that the Fairmount Board would have the right to
change its recommendation with respect to the merger agreement to Fairmount Santrol stockholders in response to a material intervening event, that
Sibelco and Unimin would not be entitled to reimbursement of all transaction expenses by Fairmount Santrol in the event that Fairmount Santrol’s
stockholders did not adopt the merger agreement, and that Fairmount Santrol would be entitled to a “reverse” termination fee in the event of the
termination of the merger agreement in connection with a required divestiture in excess of a certain divestiture threshold to be agreed following further
antitrust analysis. The revised merger agreement also included Fairmount Santrol’s proposal that the “single-tier” termination fee payable by Fairmount
Santrol in connection with a topping bid or change of recommendation would be 2.5% of the equity value of Fairmount Santrol in the transaction.

On October 31, 2017, a representative of Party B contacted Mr. LeBaron by e-mail to request an update on when Fairmount Santrol would
respond to Party B’s proposal. Mr. LeBaron indicated to the representative of Party B that the Fairmount Board was scheduled to meet on November 3,
2017, and that Fairmount Santrol would likely respond to Party B’s proposal after that meeting.

On November 2, 2017, representatives of Jones Day and of Freshfields held a conference call to negotiate material open terms in the draft merger
agreement, including whether Sibelco would be a party to the merger agreement and whether Sibelco would be required to pay a “reverse” termination
fee if the merger agreement were terminated in connection with a failure to obtain required regulatory approvals.

On November 3, 2017, the Fairmount Board held a special telephonic meeting. All members of the Fairmount Board were present. Present from
Fairmount Santrol management were Mr. Crandall, Mr. Biehl, Mr. Richardson and Mr. Magaud. Also present were representatives of Jones Day and of
Wells Fargo Securities. At the meeting, the Fairmount Board discussed the most recent developments in the strategic transaction process, and
representatives of Wells Fargo Securities presented various preliminary financial analyses comparing the proposals submitted by Sibelco, Party A and
Party B, including contribution analyses, synergy analyses, and preliminary discounted cash flow analyses. The Fairmount Board discussed these
preliminary financial analyses at length and discussed with Fairmount Santrol management and the representatives of Wells Fargo Securities several of
the assumptions underlying the analyses, including the different applicable weighted average cost of capital calculations. Wells Fargo Securities noted
that Wells Fargo Securities’ preliminary financial analyses reflected that Unimin’s weighted average cost of capital was less than Fairmount Santrol’s,
Party A’s and Party B’s respective weighted average cost of capital, given Unimin’s industrial and recreational business, and that such lower cost of
capital would likely have a beneficial impact on Unimin’s valuation, as compared to Fairmount Santrol’s, Party A’s and Party B’s respective valuations.
The Fairmount Board also considered the fact that Fairmount Santrol’s accounting due diligence provider, an internationally recognized accounting firm,
should complete its due diligence review of Unimin prior to any decision being made on whether to move

forward with a transaction without U.S. GAAP audited financials. The Fairmount Board, together with Fairmount Santrol management and the
representatives of Wells Fargo Securities, also discussed at length considerations related to the stockholder value reflected in each proposal, including
potentially available synergies and other strategic results of a combination with each potential counterparty including the value of the revenue stability
provided by industrial and recreational lines of business in a cyclical frac sand environment, as well as the risks and potential benefits of continuing to
operate Fairmount Santrol on a standalone basis.

Also at the meeting, representatives of Jones Day updated the Fairmount Board on the status and preliminary results of Jones Day’s and Fairmount
Santrol management’s detailed review of any potential competition-related regulatory concerns associated with a transaction with Unimin, and Jones
Day’s and Fairmount Santrol’s management’s initial perspectives on similar matters in relation to Party A and Party B. The Fairmount Board also
discussed the importance of more fully exploring a transaction with Party B to determine whether Party B would be prepared to propose a consideration
level that would be greater than the value implied by the proposed Unimin transaction, including by providing Party B the opportunity to review non-
public information of Fairmount Santrol in order to allow Party B to increase the valuation of its proposal. The Fairmount Board also discussed the
importance of reasonably validating the synergies inherent in a deal with Party B, in light of the substantial stock component in the proposed
consideration. At the conclusion of the meeting, the Fairmount Board determined that Mr. LeBaron should engage both Party A and Party B in order to
work with each of them to provide updated indications of interest in a strategic transaction with Fairmount Santrol within the subsequent two weeks.

Later on November 3, 2017, at the direction of the Fairmount Board, Mr. LeBaron called a representative of Party B, and informed Party B that
Party B’s proposal was not compelling to the Fairmount Board, but that the Fairmount Board was amenable to Party B conducting limited due diligence
in order to allow Party B to revise its offer. Mr. LeBaron noted that any due diligence investigation would be required to be mutual, in light of the
substantial stock consideration proposed. Later on November 3, 2017, at the direction of the Fairmount Board, representatives of Wells Fargo Securities
called the financial advisor to Party B to indicate that Fairmount Santrol expected a revised proposal from Party B no later than November 15, 2017.

Also on November 3, 2017, Mr. LeBaron called a representative of Party A to inform Party A of the Fairmount Board’s decision. Mr. LeBaron
was not able to connect by telephone with the representative of Party A until November 5, 2017, at which time Mr. LeBaron conveyed a substantially
similar message as had been conveyed to Party B.

On November 6, 2017, Fairmount Santrol and Party B entered into a non-disclosure agreement.

On November 7, 2017, Fairmount Santrol and Party A entered into a non-disclosure agreement.

Later on November 7, 2017, representatives of Freshfields delivered draft financing commitment documents to Jones Day, which included
Fairmount Santrol as a co-borrower but did not allow for Fairmount to seek any consequential or similar damages against the financing sources for their
failure to fund the transaction.

On November 8, 2017, representatives of Fairmount Santrol, Party B and each of their respective financial advisors held a conference call to
discuss due diligence process and logistics. During this call, Party B’s financial advisor inquired as to the discussions with other potential transaction
counterparties, including whether Fairmount Santrol would choose one party to move forward with after revised offers were provided. At the direction
of the Fairmount Board, representatives of Wells Fargo Securities indicated that Fairmount Santrol and the Fairmount Board were evaluating a variety of
alternatives to maximize stockholder value and did not intend to provide exclusivity to any one potential counterparty.

On November 9, 2017, representatives of Party B met with Fairmount Santrol management at the offices of Jones Day in Cleveland to discuss
potential revenue and cost synergies as part of Party B’s due diligence investigation. At the meeting, Fairmount Santrol management indicated that, in
light of the substantial stock component of the proposed consideration, meaningful data exchange for due diligence purposes would be predicated on
general mutuality of information sharing as between Party B and Fairmount Santrol.

Also on November 9, 2017, representatives of Wells Fargo Securities had a telephone call with representatives of Party A’s financial advisor.
During this call, representatives of Party A’s financial advisor asked for a specific value target and assurances regarding Fairmount Santrol’s desire to
engage in a transaction with them. At the direction of the Fairmount Board, representatives from Wells Fargo Securities indicated that Fairmount Santrol
was prepared to engage in due diligence and further negotiations with Party A, but Fairmount Santrol could not give any assurances as to any particular
outcome.

Later on November 9, 2017, representatives of Freshfields sent certain revised transaction documents, including a revised draft merger agreement,
to Jones Day. Among other things, the revised draft merger agreement reflected Sibelco’s positions that Sibelco would be amenable to being party to the
merger agreement only in respect of transaction actions specifically required to be taken by Sibelco such as required regulatory filings required to be
made by an ultimate parent entity, that Sibelco and Unimin would be entitled to reimbursement of all transaction expenses by Fairmount Santrol in the
event that Fairmount Santrol’s stockholders did not adopt the merger agreement, and that Fairmount Santrol would not be entitled to a “reverse”
termination fee in the event of the termination of the merger agreement in connection with a required divestiture in excess of the agreed divestiture
threshold.

On November 12, 2017, representatives of Jones Day and of Freshfields held a conference call to negotiate unresolved legal issues in the
transaction documentation. Among other things, Jones Day discussed with Freshfields the position of Fairmount Santrol that Fairmount Santrol had only
agreed to a financing contingency in the merger agreement on the basis that Fairmount Santrol would be able to recover the full measure of damages
against the lenders under the financing commitment documentation if the financing failed to fund at the closing.

On November 12, 2017, Party A’s financial advisor held a conference call with representatives of Wells Fargo Securities. In the call, Party A’s
financial advisor sought further information as to whether Party A’s proposal was likely to be competitive with other strategic alternatives being
explored by Fairmount Santrol. At the direction of the Fairmount Board, Wells Fargo Securities responded that Party A’s offer was not compelling as
proposed but that if Party A could improve on their proposal, the Fairmount Board would consider such improved proposal. In addition, Wells Fargo
Securities offered that Fairmount Santrol would make certain information to enable Party A to conduct due diligence in order to improve Party A’s offer.
After such conference call, Party A ceased discussions with Fairmount Santrol regarding a potential combination of the two companies.

On November 13, 2017, Fairmount was provided with updated financial information with respect to Unimin’s third quarter results. This financial
information indicated lower than expected results during the third quarter.

Also on November 13, 2017, representatives of Party B and representatives of Party B’s financial advisor, met with Fairmount Santrol
management and representatives of Wells Fargo Securities at the offices of Jones Day in New York City to discuss Party B’s preliminary views on
potential synergies that would be expected to be realized in a potential transaction.

Later on November 13, 2017, and continuing through November 14, 2017, members of Fairmount Santrol management, representatives of Wells
Fargo Securities and representatives of Jones Day met with Sibelco management and representatives of Freshfields at the offices of Freshfields in New
York City to continue the negotiation of transaction documents. In the course of the negotiations, the parties concluded a number of previously open
terms in the transaction documentation, including agreeing that the divestiture threshold for obtaining regulatory approval would be 3.6 million tons of
capacity. At the conclusion of these negotiations, the parties had not yet resolved certain material issues, including whether Sibelco would be party to the
merger agreement in all respects, the amount of the termination fee payable by Fairmount Santrol in connection with a topping bid or a change in
recommendation (Fairmount Santrol’s proposal was $46 million, and Sibelco’s proposal was $50 million), whether Fairmount Santrol would be entitled
to a “reverse” termination fee in the event of the termination of the merger agreement in connection with a required divestiture in excess of the agreed
divestiture threshold, whether Sibelco and Unimin would be entitled to reimbursement of all transaction expenses

by Fairmount Santrol in the event that Fairmount Santrol’s stockholders did not adopt the merger agreement. Further, the parties did not determine a
satisfactory remedy construct that would apply in the event that the lenders under the financing commitment documents would not be amenable to
Fairmount Santrol recovering its full damages from the lenders in the event of a breach.

On November 15, 2017, a representative of Party B delivered a letter via email to Mr. LeBaron and Ms. Deckard. The letter contained a revised
proposal to acquire Fairmount Santrol for $5.27 per share, consisting of $1.58 per share in cash with the balance in the form of stock consideration that
would constitute approximately 23% ownership of Party B. Party B indicated that it believed a combined transaction would have anticipated EBITDA
synergies of $150 million to $210 million per year and $5 to $10 million of recurring capital expenditure savings per year. The letter did not specify any
other proposed transaction terms. The closing price of Fairmount Santrol common stock on November 15, 2017 was $4.52 per share.

On November 16, 2017, the Fairmount Board held a regularly scheduled meeting in Cleveland. Also present were a representative of Jones Day
and representatives of Wells Fargo Securities. At the meeting, the representatives of Wells Fargo Securities presented to the directors Wells Fargo
Securities’ preliminary financial analyses of the November 15, 2017 proposal by Party B, noting to the Fairmount Board, among other things, that the
November 15, 2017 proposal was best understood as an update to the October 19, 2017 proposal, adjusted to reflect a change in the market price of
Party B’s stock since October 19, 2017. At the meeting, the representatives of Wells Fargo Securities, Fairmount Santrol management and the Fairmount
Board also discussed various other aspects of potential combinations with Party B and with Unimin, including achievable synergies, regulatory
approval, and the results of Fairmount Santrol’s due diligence on Unimin, including Unimin’s third quarter financial results. The representative of Jones
Day also discussed with the Fairmount Board the still unresolved material issues relating to the Unimin transaction documentation. The representative of
Jones Day also discussed with the directors their fiduciary duties under applicable law. The Fairmount Board discussed with its advisors at length
various strategies and next steps to maximize the value proposed by Party B. At the conclusion of the meeting, the Fairmount Board directed Mr.
LeBaron to inform Party B that Party B’s current proposal was inadequate and that Party B needed to provide a more compelling proposal in order for
the Fairmount Board to consider further engaging on a potential transaction with Party B, and that Party B’s revised proposal should specify what level
of regulatory risk Party B was willing to bear in a potential transaction.

On November 17, 2017, representatives of an investment bank advising Party B indicated to representatives of Wells Fargo Securities that Party B
did not believe there to be meaningful regulatory risk in a combination between Fairmount Santrol and Party B, but that Party B was nevertheless not
willing to accept a “hell or high water” regulatory clearance standard.

Later on November 17, 2017, representatives of Jones Day sent Freshfields revised drafts of several transaction documents, including the merger
agreement. The merger agreement reflected all of Fairmount Santrol’s positions on the open issues remaining after the November 13 – 14, 2017
negotiations.

On November 18, 2017, Mr. LeBaron held a telephone call with a representative of Party B. Mr. LeBaron indicated that Party B would need to
provide Fairmount Santrol with a revised proposal to continue discussions, that the revised proposal should constitute Party B’s best offer, and that it
should include Party B’s specific positions on regulatory risk.

On November 20, 2017, a representative of Party B delivered a letter via email to Mr. LeBaron and Ms. Deckard. The letter contained a revised
proposal to acquire Fairmount Santrol for $6.58 per share, consisting of $1.97 per share in cash with the balance in the form of stock consideration that
would constitute approximately 27% ownership of Party B. The letter stated that Party B believed that a combination of Fairmount Santrol and Party B
would be “achievable from a regulatory standpoint,” and that Party B would commit to make “necessary divestitures … that are not material to
Fairmount.” Party B indicated that it believed a combined transaction would have anticipated synergies of $150 million to $210 million per year. The
closing price of Fairmount Santrol common stock on November 20, 2017 was $5.06 per share.

Also on November 20, Fairmount Santrol management held a conference call with Sibelco and Unimin management, during which the parties
discussed various business updates and due diligence findings, including with respect to Unimin’s third quarter financial results.

On November 21, 2017, the Fairmount Board held a special telephonic meeting. All members of the Fairmount Board were in attendance. In
attendance from Fairmount Santrol management were Mr. Crandall, Mr. Biehl, Mr. Richardson and Mr. Magaud. Also in attendance were
representatives of Jones Day, of Wells Fargo Securities, and of Fairmount Santrol’s external accounting due diligence advisor. At the meeting, Mr.
LeBaron updated the Fairmount Board on the most recent developments in the potential transaction process. Representatives of management updated the
Fairmount Board on management’s current synergies analysis with respect to a transaction with each of Unimin, Party A and Party B. The updated
analysis indicated management estimated potential annual synergies of approximately $146 million, $99 million and $134 million, respectively. Mr.
Biehl and the representatives of Fairmount Santrol’s external accounting due diligence advisor also discussed with the Fairmount Board the results of
Fairmount Santrol’s financial due diligence on Unimin, noting that adjustments identified in such due diligence did not affect the proposed ownership
split in any material manner. The Fairmount Board discussed at length the results of the financial due diligence on Unimin and adjustments to the
financial models related to those results, and related matters. Also at the meeting, representatives of Wells Fargo Securities presented various updates to
Wells Fargo Securities’ preliminary financial analyses and the underlying reasons and causes of those updates. The Fairmount Board discussed at length
the implied equity values of Fairmount Santrol and potential strategic counterparties as calculated by Wells Fargo Securities. The Fairmount Board also
discussed the previous determination that Ms. Deckard was not authorized to discuss material transactional matters directly with potential
counterparties, and Mr. LeBaron confirmed that Mr. LeBaron had been involved in all such material contacts. Next, the representatives of Jones Day
discussed with the Fairmount Board the fiduciary duties of the directors under applicable law in the context of having received multiple transaction
proposals, and provided related strategic and legal advice. The Fairmount Board also discussed the open terms of the Unimin transaction documents, and
representatives of Jones Day discussed with the Fairmount Board certain aspects of Jones Day’s and Fairmount Santrol’s regulatory risk analysis. The
Fairmount Board also discussed with Fairmount Santrol management certain risks and benefits related to continuing to operate Fairmount Santrol on a
standalone basis, and discussed various other aspects of the relative merits of the proposed transactions, including discussing with Wells Fargo
Securities and Fairmount Santrol management assumptions underlying certain terminal values, prospective synergies, as well as market perspectives and
potential adjustments between IFRS and U.S. GAAP. The Fairmount Board also discussed at length matters related to consummation risk, including the
relative antitrust risks of the proposals from Sibelco and from Party B. At the conclusion of the meeting, the Fairmount Board determined that it was
appropriate to obtain more information about Party B’s proposal, including in respect of the regulatory analysis, before attempting to solicit additional
value from Sibelco on the basis of Party B’s proposal.

On November 22, 2017, at the direction of the Fairmount Board, representatives of Wells Fargo Securities held a call with Party B’s financial
advisor. On the call, the representatives of Wells Fargo Securities communicated that Party B’s November 20, 2017 proposal was constructive, but that
in addition to the revised purchase price, Fairmount Santrol would need to review Party B’s markup of a merger agreement and understand Party B’s
specific positions on regulatory risk allocation. In the call, Party B’s financial advisor again asked representatives of Wells Fargo Securities whether
Fairmount Santrol would be amenable to entering an exclusive negotiation period, and representatives of Wells Fargo Securities rejected that request.
The respective financial advisors also discussed a process for the completion of Party B’s due diligence review.

Later on November 22, 2017, representatives of Jones Day delivered a draft merger agreement to legal counsel to Party B.

Also on November 22, 2017, Fairmount Santrol management held a conference call with Party B’s management in furtherance of Party B’s
continued due diligence investigation.

During this period, representatives of Jones Day worked with Party B’s legal counsel to obtain information regarding Party B necessary to
complete Jones Day’s and Fairmount Santrol management’s review of a transaction between Fairmount Santrol and Party B from a regulatory
perspective.

On November 26, 2017, representatives of Party B’s financial advisor delivered to Wells Fargo Securities an issues list, prepared by Party B’s
legal counsel, detailing Party B’s high level comments to the draft merger agreement. Among other things, the issues list contained Party B’s specific
position on a divestiture threshold, noted that Party B was not willing to pay a “reverse” termination fee in the event of a termination of the merger
agreement in connection with a required divestiture in excess of that threshold, and noted that Party B was not willing to have a requirement that Party B
litigate with regulators in the event that a divestiture in excess of the threshold were required. Further, the issues list proposed a termination fee of 3.5%
of Fairmount Santrol’s equity value, and a “reverse” termination fee of 3.5% of Fairmount Santrol’s equity value payable by Party B in the event that
Party B failed to close the merger because Party B’s financing was not available.

On November 27, 2017, representatives of Morgan Stanley provided Unimin’s updated forecast for fiscal years 2017 and 2018, which had been
revised downward, to representatives of Wells Fargo Securities (Unimin having indicated that such downward revision was limited to the short term and
not expected to impact future years beyond 2018). See the section entitled “—Certain Unaudited Financial Forecasts of Fairmount Santrol and Unimin”
beginning on page 157 for additional information concerning such forecast and the adjustments made to it by Fairmount Santrol management as
described in that section of this proxy statement/prospectus.

Also on November 27, 2017, representatives of Jones Day held a call with legal counsel to Party B to discuss the issues list provided by Party B
on November 26, 2017. Later on November 27, 2017, representatives of Jones Day held a call with legal counsel to Party B to discuss Party B’s
proposed regulatory risk allocation. In the latter call, representatives of Jones Day indicated that Jones Day’s and Fairmount Santrol’s initial assessment
of regulatory risk, subject to receipt of confirmatory information from Party B, suggested a specific aggregate tonnage capacity divestiture threshold, at
which threshold Fairmount Santrol would have a reasonable degree of closing certainty. From November 27, 2017 to December 7, 2017, Fairmount
Santrol management and representatives of Jones Day continued to seek this confirmatory information, which included information related to mine
reserves and related operational information, from Party B and its advisors.

On November 28, 2017, Party B’s financial advisor sent an e-mail to Wells Fargo Securities containing a revised proposal from Party B with
respect to regulatory risk allocation, noting that Party B would be willing to divest a specified aggregate tonnage capacity that was in line with the
position discussed by representatives of Jones Day with Party B’s legal counsel on November 27, 2017, and that no “reverse” termination fee would be
payable if regulatory approval could not be obtained within such threshold. The proposal also extended the “drop dead date” of the draft merger
agreement to 12 months total. The proposal concluded by noting that any further regulatory commitments on the part of Party B would impact the value
that Party B could offer.

Later on November 28, 2017, the Fairmount Board held a special telephonic meeting. All members of the Fairmount Board were present. Present
from Fairmount Santrol management were Mr. Crandall, Mr. Biehl, Mr. Richardson and Mr. Magaud. Also present were representatives of Jones Day
and of Wells Fargo Securities. At the meeting, representatives of Jones Day updated the Fairmount Board on the most recent developments in Fairmount
Santrol’s discussions with Party B, and discussed the latest developments in Jones Day’s and Fairmount Santrol management’s regulatory analysis,
including an update on the information that Jones Day had yet to receive from Party B. Representatives of Jones Day explained the proposed divestiture
threshold with Party B to the Fairmount Board, noting that Jones Day had not received all required information to fully validate the threshold and that
Party B’s positions that it not be required to litigate with a regulator and that the merger agreement would not extend beyond 12 months from
announcement were considerably less advantageous to Fairmount Santrol than the corresponding terms proposed by Sibelco. Management also
discussed with the Fairmount Board its views on the potential annual synergies in each transaction—$147 million per year in the Unimin transaction vs.
$134 million in the Party B transaction—after having performed due diligence on both counterparties. The Fairmount Board discussed these matters at
length, and also discussed the impact of potential divestitures on the business prospects of a combined company in each potential transaction. The
Fairmount Board again discussed at length the benefits of diversification into the industrial and recreational markets, in addition to the advantages and
considerations related to continuing to operate Fairmount Santrol on a standalone basis, the advantages related to the significant cash component offered
by Party B, and various other strategic perspectives on the proposed combinations. Representatives of Wells Fargo Securities also discussed updated

preliminary financial analyses prepared by Wells Fargo Securities, noting that the materials did not yet account for a recent downward adjustment in the
2017 and 2018 forecasts of Unimin provided by Unimin management. The Fairmount Board also discussed at length preliminary materials prepared by
Wells Fargo Securities with respect to the effect of Sibelco offering additional ownership percentages to Fairmount Santrol stockholders in a
combination between Fairmount Santrol and Unimin, or a cash consideration component in such a combination. After discussing various strategic
considerations related to maximizing the value to Fairmount Santrol stockholders offered by either Sibelco or by Party B, and after discussing the
importance of having at least one strategic transaction alternative available to Fairmount Santrol at the conclusion of negotiations, the Fairmount Board
determined that Fairmount Santrol should inform Sibelco that Fairmount Santrol needed to better understand both the rationale behind, and any
valuation implications from, the downward adjustment to the Unimin forecast and other financial due diligence matters in order for the Fairmount Board
to appropriately evaluate and finalize negotiations between Fairmount Santrol and Sibelco.

On November 29, 2017, Fairmount Santrol management, representatives of Wells Fargo Securities and representatives of Jones Day met with
Party B management and Party B’s financial and legal advisors in Houston as part of Party B’s continued due diligence investigation of Fairmount
Santrol.

Later on November 29, 2017, the Fairmount Board held a special telephonic meeting. All members of the Fairmount Board were present. Present
from Fairmount Santrol management were Mr. Crandall, Mr. Biehl, Mr. Richardson and Mr. Magaud. Also present were representatives of Jones Day
and of Wells Fargo Securities. At the meeting, representatives of Wells Fargo Securities discussed updated preliminary financial analyses with the
Fairmount Board, including in respect of the updated financial forecasts provided by Unimin. The Fairmount Board discussed various comparative
analyses of the proposed transactions with Unimin and with Party B at length, and received related advice from representatives of Wells Fargo
Securities. At the conclusion of the meeting, the Fairmount Board directed Mr. LeBaron to solicit additional value from Sibelco, indicating that
Mr. LeBaron should request an increase of either $0.50 per share in cash plus 3% incremental ownership (implying a 38% ownership level for
Fairmount Santrol stockholders), or $1.00 per share in cash at the currently proposed 35% ownership level. The Fairmount Board also directed Mr.
LeBaron to attempt to secure a termination right in the event that the U.S. GAAP audited financial statements of Unimin, to be delivered after the
anticipated announcement date of a transaction, reflected adjustments from the IFRS audited financial statements of Unimin that were material.

On November 30, 2017, Mr. LeBaron and Ms. Deckard held a conference call with Mr. Deleersnyder and Mr. Decat, including the parties’
respective financial advisors. On the call, Mr. LeBaron indicated that the Fairmount Board was continuing to evaluate the downward-adjusted Unimin
forecast and, in addition, Fairmount Santrol had received a proposal from a third party at a level that warranted a full evaluation by the Fairmount Board.
Mr. LeBaron indicated that, in light of those developments, discussions between Fairmount Santrol and Sibelco should be put on hold for several days
while the Fairmount Board evaluated the new information, and that Fairmount Santrol would be in a position to provide more complete feedback to
Sibelco on December 5, 2017.

On November 30, 2017, Fairmount Santrol and Party B opened virtual datarooms to each other and their respective representatives, which
datarooms were subject to the parties’ agreement on several procedures to protect competitively sensitive information from disclosure to the parties’
respective employees in certain operational roles.

On December 1, 2017, at the direction of the Fairmount Board, representatives of Wells Fargo Securities sent Morgan Stanley a document
containing the primary open legal points relating to the transaction documentation, including the Fairmount Board’s position on such points. The
document included Fairmount Santrol’s positions that Sibelco should be a party to the merger agreement for all purposes, that a “reverse” termination
fee should be paid by Sibelco in the event that the merger agreement was terminated for lack of regulatory clearance, that a “reverse” termination fee
should be paid by Sibelco in the event that the merger did not close in connection with a failure of financing, that Fairmount Santrol should not be
required to reimburse the expenses of Sibelco and Unimin in the event that Fairmount Santrol stockholders did not adopt the merger

agreement, and that Fairmount Santrol would require a termination right in the event that the U.S. GAAP audited financial statements of Unimin
ultimately reflected adjustments from the IFRS audited financial statements of Unimin that were material.

Later on December 1, 2017, Party B’s investment bank distributed a “transaction timeline” proposing that Fairmount Santrol and Party B attempt
to complete negotiations and announce a transaction by December 18, 2017. Later on December 1, 2017, a representative of Party B called Ms. Deckard
indicating that, after further input from advisors, Party B desired to move forward the target date to the week prior to December 18, 2017. In response,
Ms. Deckard indicated that all communications from the representative of Party B should be directed to Mr. LeBaron.

Later on December 1, 2017, Ms. Deckard provided a written update to the Fairmount Board describing the sequence of events since the November
29, 2017 meeting of the Fairmount Board. In the update, Ms. Deckard indicated that, in accordance with the direction of the Fairmount Board at its
November 29, 2017, meeting, she and Mr. LeBaron intended to communicate to Sibelco the specific valuation requests approved by the Fairmount
Board.

Also on December 1, 2017, Fairmount Santrol management, Party B management, and those parties’ respective legal, financial and accounting
advisors participated in business and legal due diligence conference calls. In addition to the material positions reflected in Party B’s November 26, 2017
issues list, the revised merger agreement reflected a termination fee and “reverse” termination fee (in respect of a financing failure) of 3.0% of
Fairmount Santrol’s equity value.

From December 1, 2017 through December 6, 2017, Fairmount Santrol management, Party B management and their respective legal and financial
advisors held daily conference calls to discuss the process of due diligence and transaction document negotiations.

Also on December 1, 2017, counsel to Party B delivered a markup of the draft merger agreement to Jones Day. From December 1, 2017 to
December 6, 2017, Jones Day and legal counsel to Party B exchanged drafts and held conference calls to negotiate the draft merger agreement between
Fairmount Santrol and Party B. Among other things, the legal negotiations focused on provisions related to regulatory review of the potential
transaction, including Party B’s position that it should not be required to undertake litigation to contest any divestiture requirement in excess of the
proposed maximum divestiture threshold, and the absence of a “reverse” termination fee in the event that a closing did not occur as a result of unduly
burdensome antitrust divestiture requirements. As discussed later in this section, Fairmount Santrol later concluded discussions with Party B partially on
the basis that Fairmount Santrol believed Party B’s position on regulatory-related provisions did not afford Fairmount Santrol with sufficient closing
certainty; Party B did not change its positions on the foregoing legal terms up to and after such conclusion of discussions.

On December 3, 2017, representatives of Jones Day and of Party B’s legal counsel held a conference call to negotiate the draft merger agreement.
During the call, among other things, Party B’s legal counsel stated that Party B did not believe that a combination of Fairmount Santrol and Party B
presented significant regulatory risk.

Later on December 3, 2017, Fairmount Santrol management, Party B management and the companies’ respective financial advisors held a
conference call in which Party B stated that it was not prepared to deviate from its existing regulatory risk proposals, and that Party B was further
unwilling to agree to litigate with regulatory authorities to avoid any required divestiture in excess of Party B’s proposed divestiture threshold.

Between December 4, 2017 and December 7, 2017, representatives of Jones Day continued to request operational information from Party B and
its legal counsel in order to assist Jones Day and Fairmount Santrol management in their regulatory analysis.

Later on December 4, 2017, representatives of Jones Day sent a revised draft of the merger agreement to Party B’s counsel. Among other things,
the draft reverted to Fairmount Santrol’s previous positions regarding regulatory risk allocation, accepted Party B’s proposal of a termination fee of
3.0% of Fairmount Santrol’s equity value payable by Fairmount Santrol in certain circumstances, included a “reverse” termination fee in respect of

termination in connection with failure to obtain regulatory approvals of 3.0% of Fairmount Santrol’s equity value, and included a “reverse” termination
fee in respect of termination in connection with a failure of Party B’s financing of 6.0% of Fairmount Santrol’s equity value.

On December 4, 2017, Mr. LeBaron and Ms. Deckard called Mr. Deleersnyder and indicated that Sibelco would be required to increase the value
offered to Fairmount Santrol’s shareholders in order for Fairmount Santrol to continue to evaluate the proposed combination with Unimin. In particular,
Mr. LeBaron indicated to Mr. Deleersnyder that the Fairmount Board would require an increase of either $0.50 per share in cash plus 3% incremental
ownership (implying a 38% ownership level for Fairmount Santrol stockholders), or $1.00 per share in cash at the currently proposed 35% ownership
level.

Later on December 4, 2017, a United Kingdom-based financial blog published a report that a third party was considering an acquisition of
Fairmount Santrol. That report was subsequently further disseminated by United States-based financial news providers.

On December 5, 2017, Mr. Deleersnyder, via an e-mail to Mr. LeBaron and Ms. Deckard, delivered a letter addressed to Mr. LeBaron that
contained a revised proposal to acquire Fairmount Santrol. In addition to the previously agreed 35% ownership level for Fairmount Stockholders in the
combined company, the Sibelco revised proposal contained a $170 million cash consideration component, representing approximately $0.74 per share.
The letter also indicated that, consistent with the increased valuation, the termination fee payable by Fairmount Santrol in certain circumstances would
increase to $52 million. The letter further indicated that, while Sibelco would accept Fairmount Santrol’s position on certain of the positions conveyed in
Fairmount Santrol’s December 1, 2017 issues list, the revised valuation was contingent on Fairmount Santrol accepting Sibelco’s position on the absence
of a “reverse” termination fee payable by Sibelco in the event that the closing does not occur because of unduly burdensome antitrust approval
requirements, and the absence of a “reverse” termination fee payable by Sibelco in the event that the closing does not occur because of the unavailability
of financing.

Later on December 5, 2017, representatives of Freshfields sent Jones Day revised drafts of several transaction documents, including the merger
agreement, reflecting the positions described in Sibelco’s December 5, 2017 letter. Beginning with the receipt of these documents and continuing until
the execution and delivery of the merger agreement on December 11, 2017, representatives of Jones Day and of Freshfields held several conference calls
and exchanged several drafts of various transaction documents and disclosure schedules in an effort to resolve open legal issues and, after the December
6, 2017 direction by the Fairmount Board discussed below, to finalize definitive transaction documents.

On December 6, 2017, Party B’s legal counsel sent Jones Day a revised draft of the merger agreement. Among other things, the revised draft of
the merger agreement reverted to all of the positions previously taken by Party B with respect to regulatory risk allocation and decreased the “reverse”
termination fee in respect of termination in connection with a failure of Party B’s financing to 4.0% of Fairmount Santrol’s equity value. Later on
December 6, 2017, Party B’s legal counsel indicated to Jones Day that there was no available update on the timing of Party B’s financing commitments.

Also on December 6, 2017, the Fairmount Board held a special telephonic meeting. All members of the Fairmount Board were present. Present
from Fairmount Santrol management were Mr. Crandall, Mr. Biehl, and Mr. Richardson. Also present were representatives of Jones Day and of Wells
Fargo Securities. At the meeting, representatives of Wells Fargo Securities discussed with the Fairmount Board various preliminary financial analyses
prepared by Wells Fargo Securities with respect to the existing proposal from Party B and the newly revised proposal from Sibelco. The Fairmount
Board discussed the two proposals at length, and received related financial and legal advice from representatives of Wells Fargo Securities and Jones
Day, respectively. In discussing its preliminary financial analyses comparing the two proposals, the representatives of Wells Fargo Securities discussed
with the Fairmount Board, among other things, the potential perspective of the equity capital markets, including the possibility of an impact from being
a “controlled company” in the case of a transaction with Sibelco, and the likelihood of achieving a full “sum-of-the-parts” valuation in light of
Fairmount Santrol’s existing energy-focused equity analyst following. The Fairmount Board discussed these considerations at length. Also at the
meeting, representatives of Jones Day discussed in depth the results of Jones Day’s and Fairmount

Santrol management’s regulatory analysis, and answered related questions from the Fairmount Board, noting that Jones Day was still awaiting further
operational information relating to Party B which information could materially change Jones Day’s and Fairmount Santrol’s management’s assessment
of the risk of a transaction with Party B. Representatives of Jones Day also discussed in-depth the relative legal terms of the two proposed transactions,
with a focus on closing certainty and the Fairmount Board’s ability to continue to exercise its fiduciary duties post-signing. After discussing and taking
into account Wells Fargo Securities’ various preliminary financial analyses presented over the course of several weeks, the relative value and
consummation risk of the proposed transactions, the considerations related to entering into a transaction the result of which would be to have a
controlling non-U.S. stockholder, the strategic rationale of maximizing Fairmount Santrol’s diversification into the industrial and recreational market,
and the potential to achieve significant synergies, the Fairmount Board determined that at that time the transaction proposed by Sibelco was more
favorable to Fairmount Santrol’s stockholders. Subsequent to such determination, the Fairmount Board discussed at length the strategic considerations
relating to maximizing stockholder value, including whether and how to solicit additional value from Party B. At the conclusion of the discussion, the
Fairmount Board determined that it was appropriate to first obtain the confirmatory information regarding Party B necessary to finalize Jones Day’s and
Fairmount Santrol management’s regulatory analysis, and obtain more information from Sibelco concerning certain details of December 5, 2017
proposal regarding the relationship between the proposed combined company’s net debt and the proposed $170 million payment to Fairmount Santrol
stockholders, and subsequently to revisit the best path to solicit additional value from Party B with the benefit of that information being available to the
Fairmount Board.

Later on December 6, 2017, representatives of Fairmount Santrol communicated to Sibelco and separately to Party B that such parties should
confirm that there were no further updates to their respective proposals, with respect to the valuation or other terms proposed. In connection with such
communications, representatives of Morgan Stanley immediately indicated to Wells Fargo Securities that Sibelco’s offer in the letter dated December 5,
2017, had, according to its terms, already lapsed, and that Sibelco was not willing to offer any additional value to Fairmount Santrol, nor would Sibelco
accept any position on the key legal issues that would be inconsistent with the positions contained in the December 5, 2017 letter. Representatives of
Party B’s financial advisor indicated to representatives of Wells Fargo Securities that Party B would likely have a response, if any, on December 7, 2017.

In the evening of December 6, 2017, the Fairmount Board held another special telephonic meeting. All members of the Fairmount Board were
present except for Mr. Fisch. Present from Fairmount Santrol management were Mr. Crandall, Mr. Biehl, Mr. Richardson and Mr. Magaud. Also present
were representatives of Jones Day and of Wells Fargo Securities. At the meeting, representatives of Jones Day discussed again with the Fairmount
Board its applicable fiduciary duties. Representatives of Jones Day also discussed again with the Fairmount Board the regulatory analysis undertaken by
Fairmount Santrol management and Jones Day to date, noting that Jones Day had not yet received important information from Party B despite multiple
requests, but that the currently available information, including information delivered to Jones Day by counsel to Party B earlier on December 6, 2017,
indicated that the regulatory-related transaction terms currently proposed by Party B, including the specifically proposed divestiture threshold (which
divestiture threshold had been agreed by Fairmount Santrol, expressly subject to the receipt of additional information relating to Party B) were
materially less favorable to Fairmount Santrol when compared to the regulatory risk allocation terms offered by Sibelco. Mr. LeBaron and
representatives of Wells Fargo Securities also updated the Fairmount Board on communications with Sibelco and Party B during the course of the day.
The Fairmount Board discussed the foregoing at length. At the conclusion of the meeting, the Fairmount Board directed management to move forward
with the negotiation of definitive documentation with Unimin and Sibelco given the relative long-term valuations of the two offers, taking into account
the down-cycle protections provided by Unimin’s industrial and recreational business, and the regulatory risk allocation relative to the offer from Party
B. The Fairmount Board also noted that definitive documentation with Unimin and Sibelco had not yet been executed and delivered, and further
determined that, if Party B were to improve its current proposal financially or with respect to regulatory risk allocation, the Fairmount Board would
consider such revised proposal.

Later on December 6, 2017, at the direction of the Fairmount Board, Mr. LeBaron called Mr. Deleersnyder, and representatives of Wells Fargo
Securities called representatives of Morgan Stanley, to inform Sibelco that Fairmount Santrol intended to finalize definitive documentation with Sibelco
and Unimin as soon as practicable. In the course of such communication, Mr. Deleersnyder communicated to Mr. LeBaron that Sibelco requested
exclusivity with Fairmount Santrol. Mr. LeBaron, on behalf of Fairmount Santrol, declined to enter into an exclusivity agreement with Sibelco.

On December 7, 2017, legal counsel to Party B provided Jones Day with additional business information relevant to Fairmount Santrol’s and
Jones Day’s analysis of regulatory risks. Later on December 7, 2017, representatives of Jones Day discussed with Mr. LeBaron and Ms. Deckard the
conclusion of Fairmount Santrol’s and Jones Day’s analysis of the regulatory risks attendant to a combination of Fairmount Santrol and Party B. Mr.
LeBaron and Ms. Deckard subsequently updated the Fairmount Board on the results of such regulatory risk analysis, and their conclusion that, relying
on the results of Jones Day’s and Fairmount Santrol management’s regulatory risk analysis, that the maximum divestiture threshold and named
exclusions proposed by Party B combined with Party B’s unwillingness to provide a reverse termination fee or litigate should the transaction be
challenged was materially less favorable to Fairmount Santrol when compared to the regulatory risk allocation terms offered by Sibelco, not only when
compared to Sibelco’s proposal but also when viewed in isolation. In contrast, the Fairmount Board, relying on the results of Jones Day’s and Fairmount
Santrol management’s antitrust risk analysis, believed that Sibelco’s proposal provided an attractive transaction that was reasonably likely to obtain
regulatory clearance.

Also later on December 7, 2017, representatives of Jones Day held a conference call with legal counsel to Party B, in which representatives of
Jones Day communicated to Party B’s legal counsel that the regulatory-related transaction terms proposed by Party B were insufficient to provide
Fairmount Santrol with adequate closing certainty, and that barring a revision to such proposal by Party B, Fairmount Santrol would be unable to
progress discussions with Party B. During that conference call, representatives of legal counsel to Party B stated they understood the position stated by
Jones Day and did not have questions for Jones Day at that time.

Also later on December 7, 2017, a representative of Party B held a telephone call with Mr. LeBaron where the representative indicated to Mr.
LeBaron that Party B did not have any further ability to increase its proposed consideration.

Also later on December 7, 2017, representatives of Freshfields notified Jones Day that Unimin’s lenders were not amenable to Fairmount Santrol
being a party to the financing commitments, regardless of the type of damages that Fairmount Santrol would be able to recover against the lenders for
breach of those commitments. Representatives of Jones Day again indicated to Freshfields that the Fairmount Board had agreed to a financing
contingency and the absence of a “reverse” termination fee on the basis that Fairmount Santrol would be party to the financing commitments with
recourse against the lenders thereunder.

On the morning of December 8, 2017, Ms. Deckard called Mr. Deleersnyder to alert him to what Fairmount Santrol viewed as a highly significant
development relating to the transaction financing and related consummation risk. Mr. Deleersnyder indicated to Ms. Deckard that he was unaware of the
development.

On December 8, 2017, a representative of Party B, via e-mail to Mr. LeBaron and Ms. Deckard, sent a letter to the Fairmount Board. The letter
reiterated the valuation contained in Party B’s proposal of November 20, 2017. Because of an intervening change in the market price of Party B’s stock,
the stock consideration component of Party B’s proposal had decreased in value since November 20, 2017. As such, the letter noted that Party B’s
proposal valued Fairmount Santrol at $6.35 per share (as opposed to $6.58 per share as of November 20, 2017), but the letter also noted that the total
value to Fairmount Santrol stockholders would be $6.80 after taking into account participation in the potential synergies. The letter further noted that
Party B disagreed with Fairmount Santrol’s assessment that the antitrust aspects of the transaction proposed by Party B created significant lack of
certainty in closing a transaction with Party B. However, the letter did not amend any of Party B’s positions with respect to regulatory risk allocation and
indicated expected synergies to be $150 million per year, as opposed to a previously indicated range of $150 million to $210 million per year.

On December 9, 2017, Mr. LeBaron and Mr. Deleersnyder held conference calls to finalize the negotiation of unresolved issues, including related
to the removal of Fairmount Santrol as a party to the debt commitment papers. With respect to that issue, Sibelco ultimately agreed to an obligation to
pay a “reverse” termination fee of $52 million to Fairmount Santrol in the event that Sibelco and Unimin were unable to close the transaction because
financing was unavailable at the time that the merger would otherwise close.

Through December 10, 2017, Fairmount Santrol management, Sibelco management, and the companies’ respective legal and financial advisors
held several negotiation and drafting calls to finalize the terms of the transaction.

On December 10, 2017, the Fairmount Board held a special telephonic meeting. Present at the meeting were all directors other than Lawrence
Schultz. Present from Fairmount Santrol management were Mr. Crandall, Mr. Biehl, Mr. Richardson and Mr. Magaud. Also in attendance were
representatives of Jones Day and of Wells Fargo Securities. At the meeting, Mr. LeBaron and Ms. Deckard updated the Fairmount Board on recent
developments in the negotiations with Sibelco. Subsequently, representatives of Wells Fargo Securities presented to the Fairmount Board a preliminary
draft of Wells Fargo Securities’ fairness opinion presentation. The representatives of Wells Fargo Securities discussed in detail the financial terms of the
transaction, background information on the industries in which Fairmount Santrol operates, information concerning Fairmount Santrol and Unimin as
standalone companies, Wells Fargo Securities’ views of the strategic rationale for the transaction and Wells Fargo Securities’ preliminary financial
analyses. At the conclusion of the presentation, the representatives of Wells Fargo Securities indicated that, barring unusual circumstances, Wells Fargo
Securities saw no impediments to issuing a fairness opinion on December 11, 2017 as to the proposed transaction with Sibelco and Unimin. Also at the
meeting, representatives of Jones Day, referring to materials previously provided to the directors, discussed the terms of the merger agreement and the
related transaction documents, including the provisions designed to provide protections to the minority shareholders following the transaction.
Representatives of Jones Day also presented a detailed overview of the regulatory transaction terms that each of Sibelco and Party B were currently
proposing, and presented a detailed analysis of the regulatory risks associated with the potential transaction with Unimin and with a transaction with
Party B. Representatives of Jones Day noted that both Jones Day and Fairmount Santrol management were of the view that, based on all of the
information that they reviewed from Sibelco and Party B, the maximum divestiture threshold proposed by Party B, combined with Party B’s
unwillingness to provide a reverse termination fee or litigate should the transaction be challenged by a governmental agency, was materially less
favorable to Fairmount Santrol when compared to the regulatory risk allocation terms offered by Sibelco. Following each of the presentations by Jones
Day, the directors asked the representatives of Jones Day a number of questions and a discussion ensued. The Fairmount Board also discussed with the
representatives of Jones Day and of Wells Fargo Securities the negotiation process with Sibelco and with Party B in the preceding days, noting that
Jones Day had communicated to Party B’s counsel that Fairmount Santrol was not willing to accept the consummation risk allocation implicit in Party
B’s proposals to date. The Fairmount Board also noted that Mr. LeBaron and representatives of Wells Fargo Securities had, prior to the receipt of the
December 8, 2017 letter, indicated to Party B and its financial advisor that Party B should confirm that its existing proposal was its final proposal, and
that the December 8, 2017 letter received from Party B did not revise either Party B’s proposed valuation or provisions related to regulatory risk
allocation, or otherwise improve Party B’s proposal.

In the evening of December 11, 2017, the Fairmount Board held a special telephonic meeting. Present at the meeting were all directors other than
Michael Kearney, who was unable to attend due to a preexisting air travel reservation that conflicted with the meeting. (Immediately prior to the
meeting, Mr. Kearney indicated his support of the proposed transaction with Unimin in writing to Mr. LeBaron, Ms. Deckard and Mr. Crandall.) Present
from Fairmount Santrol management were Mr. Crandall, Mr. Biehl, Mr. Richardson and Mr. Magaud. Also in attendance were representatives of Jones
Day and of Wells Fargo Securities. At the meeting, representatives of Jones Day updated the directors on the finalization of definitive transaction
documentation with Sibelco and Unimin. Also at the meeting, Wells Fargo Securities reviewed with the Fairmount Board its financial analysis of the
Merger Consideration provided for in the Merger Agreement and delivered to the Fairmount Board its oral opinion, which was confirmed by delivery of
a written opinion dated December 11,

2017, to the effect that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and limitations
and qualifications on the review undertaken by Wells Fargo Securities in preparing the opinion, the Merger Consideration to be received by the holders
of Fairmount Santrol common stock (other than (i) shares owned by Fairmount Santrol or any wholly owned subsidiary of Fairmount Santrol (or held in
the treasury of Fairmount Santrol) immediately prior to the effective time, (ii) shares owned by Sibelco or any of its subsidiaries immediately prior to the
effective time, and (iii) shares held by any stockholder who is entitled to appraisal rights and has properly exercised and perfected (and not effectively
withdrawn or lost) such stockholder’s demand for appraisal rights under the DGCL)) in the Mergers, was fair, from a financial point of view, to such
stockholders, as more fully described below in the section “—Opinion of Fairmount Santrol’s Financial Advisor” beginning on page 150 of this proxy
statement/prospectus. Following discussion among the directors, and after careful consideration, the members of the Fairmount Board present at the
meeting unanimously declared that entering into the Merger Agreement and consummating the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger,
were advisable and fair to, and in the best interests of, Fairmount Santrol and its stockholders.

Later in the evening of December 11, 2017, Fairmount Santrol, Unimin, Sibelco and the Merger Subs executed and delivered the Merger
Agreement.

On the morning of December 12, 2017, Fairmount Santrol publicly announced the transaction.

Fairmount Santrol’s Reasons for the Merger

The Fairmount Board’s decision to approve the Merger and the Merger Agreement and to recommend to the Fairmount Santrol stockholders that
they vote for the adoption of the Merger Agreement was based on a number of factors. These factors included, without limitation, the following (which
are not necessarily presented in order of relative importance):

Strategic Rationale; Stockholder Value

The Fairmount Board considered a number of factors pertaining to the strategic rationale for the Merger and the value to be received by Fairmount
Santrol stockholders pursuant to the Merger Agreement, including, but not limited to, the following:
 

 
•  the current, historical and projected financial condition and results of operations of Fairmount Santrol on a standalone basis, including the

risk-adjusted probabilities associated with achieving Fairmount Santrol’s long-term strategic plan as a standalone company amid greater
industry volatility as compared to the opportunity afforded to Fairmount Santrol stockholders via the Merger Consideration;

 

 
•  the risks and challenges facing the industry more broadly, which include (1) volatility of oil and natural gas prices and (2) fluctuations in

demand for industrial and recreational sand and raw and sand-based proppants;
 

 
•  the Fairmount Board’s analysis of other potential strategic alternatives for Fairmount Santrol, including continuing on as an independent

company and the potential to acquire, be acquired or combine with other third parties;
 

 •  the financial analyses reviewed and discussed with the Fairmount Board;
 

 

•  the oral opinion of Wells Fargo Securities delivered to the Fairmount Board, which was confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated
December 11, 2017, to the effect that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters
considered and limitations and qualifications on the review undertaken by Wells Fargo Securities in preparing the opinion, the Merger
Consideration to be received by Fairmount Santrol stockholders, other than the Excluded Shares, in the Merger was fair, from a financial
point of view, to such stockholders, as more fully described below under the caption “—Opinion of Fairmount Santrol’s Financial Advisor”
beginning on page 150 of this proxy statement/prospectus (the full text of the written opinion of Wells Fargo Securities, dated December 11,
2017, which sets forth, among other things, the assumptions made, procedures followed,

matters considered and limitations and qualifications on the review undertaken by Wells Fargo Securities in preparing the opinion, is
attached as Annex B to this proxy statement/prospectus);

 

 
•  the fact that Wells Fargo and Fairmount Santrol’s legal advisors were involved throughout the negotiations and updated the Fairmount Board

directly and regularly, which provided the Fairmount Board with outside perspectives on the negotiation in addition to those of management;
 

 •  the historical and current market prices of Fairmount Santrol common stock and the financial performance of Unimin;
 

 

•  the fact that after extensive negotiations, it was agreed that Fairmount Santrol stockholders would receive as Merger Consideration: (i) an
amount in cash equal to the result of (x) $170,000,000, divided by (y) the fully diluted Fairmount Santrol share number (as defined herein),
without interest, (ii) 35%, in the aggregate, including equity awards, of the issued and outstanding shares of combined company common
stock, up from Sibelco’s initial proposal that Fairmount Santrol stockholders would only receive 35%, in the aggregate, including equity
awards, of the issued and outstanding shares of combined company common stock and (iii) cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any, without
interest;

 

 

•  the fact that a considerable portion of the Merger Consideration is payable in combined company common stock, which affords Fairmount
Santrol stockholders the opportunity to participate in the future earnings and expected growth of the combined company, including the value
of the expected synergies, and any future appreciation in the value of the combined company common stock should Fairmount Santrol
stockholders decide to retain the combined company common stock payable upon the closing of the Merger;

 

 
•  the fact that the Combined Company Board, immediately following the closing of the Merger, will include six Unimin-nominated directors

and four Fairmount-nominated directors, with Jenniffer D. Deckard serving as the Chief Executive Officer of the combined company;
 

 
•  the fact that, for a period of three years commencing upon the closing of the Merger, Sibelco will be subject to a customary standstill with

respect to the acquisition of combined company common stock (with certain customary exceptions);
 

 

•  the fact that, unless approved by a majority of the independent directors of the Combined Company Board, Sibelco will not, and will cause
Sibelco-related parties not to, acquire any combined company common stock or other shares of combined company capital stock if such
acquisition would result in Sibelco and Sibelco-related parties beneficially owning more than either (i) 70% of the outstanding shares of
combined company common stock during the three years following the effective time or (ii) 80.1% of the outstanding shares of combined
company common stock after three years following the effective time;

 

 

•  the fact that Sibelco will be subject to certain transfer restrictions following the closing date, except with respect to transfers to affiliates of
Sibelco, including that, for a period of three years following the closing date, subject to certain exceptions, Sibelco may not transfer any
shares of combined company common stock to any person or group if such person or group would beneficially own more than (i) 15% of
the voting power of the outstanding shares of combined company common stock after such transfer or (ii) 50% of the voting power of the
outstanding shares of combined company common stock, unless such person agrees to make an offer to purchase all shares of combined
company common stock held by all combined company stockholders for the same consideration and on substantially the same terms and
conditions;

 

 
•  the fact that any transaction entered into following the closing date between the combined company or any of its subsidiaries on the one

hand, and Sibelco or any of its affiliates (other than the combined company and its subsidiaries) on the other hand, is required to be on
arm’s-length terms and in the best interest of the combined company;

 

 
•  the fact that, for so long as Sibelco or any of its affiliates owns more than 50% of the outstanding shares of combined company common

stock following the closing date, Sibelco is restricted from

competing with the combined company with respect to selling, marketing, distributing or producing certain products within defined markets
and territories;

 

 
•  the Fairmount Board’s belief that the combined company will have a larger, more diversified and more complementary business portfolio, as

well as result in a logistics network with enhanced scale and geographic diversification and enhanced international reach, and that there is a
large pool of synergies that will improve operating margins and scalability and drive organic growth;

 

 •  the view that Unimin and Fairmount Santrol share a similar culture and value system and a commitment to exceed customer expectations;
 

 
•  the Fairmount Board’s belief that the Merger and related transactions will potentially result in meaningful synergies once Fairmount Santrol

and Unimin are fully integrated, and that such synergies would equal approximately $150 million and additional EBITDA; and
 

 •  the recommendation of Fairmount Santrol’s senior management team in favor of the Merger.

Terms of the Merger Agreement

The Fairmount Board considered the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, including, but not limited to, the following:
 

 
•  the Fairmount Board’s belief that the terms of the Merger Agreement, taken as a whole, increase the degree of certainty that the Merger will

be completed, including the fact that:
 

 
•  Unimin and Fairmount Santrol are required to use reasonable best efforts to obtain regulatory approvals, including agreeing to

divestitures, unless the required divestiture would be a Material Divestiture;
 

 •  there are limited circumstances in which Unimin may terminate the Merger Agreement; and
 

 •  the Merger Agreement contains no financing condition.
 

 
•  the Fairmount Board’s belief that the terms of the Merger Agreement, including Fairmount Santrol’s representations, warranties and

covenants and the conditions to each party’s obligations, are reasonable;
 

 
•  the fact that the Merger Agreement provides that, under certain circumstances, and subject to certain conditions, Fairmount Santrol is

permitted to furnish information to and conduct negotiations with a third party in connection with an unsolicited proposal for a business
combination or acquisition of Fairmount Santrol that constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a Company Superior Proposal;

 

 
•  the fact that the Fairmount Board, subject to certain conditions, has the right to change its recommendation in support of the Merger in

response to an intervening event, even if there is no competing or superior proposal, if the Fairmount Board determines that the failure to
take such action would likely be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the Fairmount Santrol stockholders under applicable law;

 

 
•  the fact that the Fairmount Board has the right to terminate the Merger Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement related to a Company

Superior Proposal, subject to giving Unimin notice and an opportunity to propose changes to the Merger Agreement, and the payment of a
$52 million termination fee;

 

 
•  the fact that the Fairmount Board, after discussing the termination fee with its advisors, believed that such fee was consistent with market

practice and would not preclude or deter a willing and financially capable third party, were one to exist, from making a superior proposal
following the announcement of a transaction with Unimin;

 

 
•  the fact that a vote of Fairmount Santrol stockholders on the Merger Agreement is required under Delaware law, and that if the Merger is

approved by Fairmount Santrol stockholders and consummated,

Table of Contents

 
the Fairmount Santrol stockholders who do not vote in favor of the adoption of the Mergers will have the right to demand appraisal of the
fair value of their shares under Delaware law;

 

 

•  the fact that Unimin is required to deliver to Fairmount Santrol the audited, consolidated financial statements of Unimin as of and for the
two years ended December 31, 2016 under U.S. GAAP no later than February 15, 2018, and that Fairmount Santrol may terminate the
Merger Agreement if such audited financials differ from the unaudited financial statements of Unimin provided to Fairmount Santrol in a
manner that results in, or would reasonably be expected to result in an Adverse Material Accounting Change (as defined below); and

 

 
•  Fairmount Santrol’s ability to specifically enforce Unimin’s obligations under the Merger Agreement, including Unimin’s obligations to

complete the Merger.

Risks and Potentially Negative Factors

In addition to the above factors, the Fairmount Board also identified and considered a number of uncertainties, risks and other potentially negative
factors in its consideration of the Merger and the Merger Agreement, including, but not limited to, the following:
 

 
•  the fact that the Merger may not be completed in a timely manner, or at all, despite the parties’ efforts, and even if the Fairmount stockholder

approval is obtained, regulatory agencies may not approve the Merger or may impose terms and conditions on their approvals that in
retrospect adversely affect the business and financial results of the combined company;

 

 •  the fact that U.S. GAAP audited financial statements for Unimin were not available at the time of execution of the Merger Agreement;
 

 
•  the risks and costs to Fairmount Santrol if the Merger is not completed, including the diversion of management and employee attention,

potential employee attrition and the potential effect on Fairmount Santrol’s business and relations with customers, suppliers and vendors;
 

 
•  the difficult and drawn-out negotiations with Sibelco, and the perceived likelihood that similar difficulties could arise during the period after

the execution of the Merger Agreement and before the closing of the Merger;
 

 

•  the fact that, if the Merger is completed, the existence of a controlling shareholder of the combined company may have the effect of making
it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or discouraging a third party from seeking to acquire, the combined company, and that a third
party would be required to negotiate any such transaction with Sibelco, and the interests of Sibelco with respect to such transaction may be
different from the interests of other combined company stockholders;

 

 •  the costs to be incurred in connection with the Merger;
 

 
•  the restrictions on the conduct of Fairmount Santrol’s business prior to completion of the Merger, which could delay or prevent Fairmount

Santrol from undertaking material strategic opportunities that might arise pending closing of the Merger to the detriment of the Fairmount
Santrol stockholders;

 

 

•  the risk of not realizing all of the anticipated strategic and other benefits between Unimin and Fairmount Santrol, including, without
limitation, the challenges of combining the businesses, operations and workforces of Unimin and Fairmount Santrol, the risk that expected
operating efficiencies and cost savings may not be realized or will cost more to achieve than anticipated, and the risk that divestitures
required by regulatory authorities may decrease the anticipated strategic and other benefits of the Merger and related transactions to the
combined company;

 

 
•  the limitations imposed on Fairmount Santrol’s ability to solicit alternative transactions prior to the closing of the Merger or termination of

the Merger Agreement, including the requirement to pay the termination fee to Unimin in the event Fairmount Santrol accepts a Company
Superior Proposal and other certain circumstances;

 •  the risk that Financing might not be obtained;
 

 •  the expectation that the Cash Consideration may be taxable to Fairmount Santrol stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes;
 

 
•  the fact that the Fairmount Board and executive officers may have interests in the Merger that are different from, or in addition to, those of

the Fairmount Santrol stockholders generally, including certain interests arising from the employment and compensation arrangements of
Fairmount Santrol’s executive officers, and the manner in which they would be affected by the Merger; and

 

 
•  the fact that, for so long as Sibelco, together with its controlled affiliates, owns more than 50% of the outstanding shares of the combined

company common stock following the closing of the Merger, the combined company is restricted from competing with Sibelco with respect
to selling, marketing, distributing or producing certain products within defined markets and territories.

The Fairmount Board weighed these positive and negative factors, realizing that future results are uncertain, including any future results
considered or expected in the factors noted above. In addition, many of the non-financial factors considered were highly subjective. As a result, in view
of the number and variety of factors they considered, the Fairmount Board did not consider it practicable and did not attempt to quantify or otherwise
assign relative weights to the specific factors it considered. Rather, the Fairmount Board made its determination based on the totality of the information
it considered. Individually, each director may have given greater or lesser weight to a particular factor or consideration.

The Fairmount Board believed that, overall, the potential benefits of the Merger to Fairmount Santrol and the Fairmount Santrol stockholders
outweighed the risks described above.

Recommendation of the Fairmount Board

After careful consideration of various factors described in the section entitled “The Merger—Fairmount Santrol’s Reasons for the Merger”
beginning on page 143 of this proxy statement/prospectus, at a meeting held on December 11, 2017, the Fairmount Board (i) approved the Merger
Agreement, (ii) determined that entering into the Merger Agreement and consummating the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement,
including the Merger, are advisable, fair to and in the best interests of Fairmount Santrol and Fairmount Santrol stockholders and authorized and
approved the execution, delivery and performance of the Merger Agreement and (iii) directed that the Merger Agreement be submitted for consideration
by Fairmount Santrol stockholders. The Fairmount Board recommends that Fairmount Santrol stockholders vote (1) “FOR” the Fairmount Santrol
Merger proposal, (2) “FOR” the Fairmount Santrol compensation proposal and (3) “FOR” the Fairmount Santrol adjournment proposal.

Unimin’s Reasons for the Merger

The Unimin Board believes that the Merger will provide a number of significant strategic opportunities and outcomes, including the following:
 

 
•  the Merger would create a leading North American supplier of industrial minerals with enhanced scale, unique growth strategies and a

diversified revenue mix across industries supplied, minerals, segments, geographies and customers, resulting in improved opportunities for
growth, cost savings and innovation relative to what Unimin could achieve on a standalone basis;

 

 •  Fairmount Santrol and Unimin have highly complementary businesses, which share customer-focused cultures;
 

 
•  the Merger is expected to combine the talent pools of both organizations to build a strong combined team with enhanced capabilities to serve

customers;
 

 
•  the combination of Fairmount Santrol and Unimin would give the combined company enhanced scale, diversity of products, diversity of

industries supplied and diversity of minerals and would better position the combined company to enhance stockholder value;

Table of Contents

 
•  the combination will allow the combined company to build an unparalleled logistics network throughout the key basin regions of North

America;
 

 
•  in connection with the Merger, the combined company will become a publicly traded company in the U.S., which is expected to provide the

company greater access to capital markets and allow the combined company to continue analyzing new potential opportunities;
 

 
•  after integration, the combined company is expected to achieve approximately $150 million of recurring annual run rate pre-tax net cost

synergies, which is expected to result in the combined company having greater potential to achieve further earnings growth and generate
more substantial cash flow than either Unimin or Fairmount Santrol could on a standalone basis;

 

 •  the Merger is expected to be accretive to each company’s earnings per share; and
 

 •  the combined company’s increased scale is expected to provide it with greater financial stability through market cycles.

In addition to the strategic factors described above, the Unimin Board considered the following additional factors:
 

 
•  its knowledge of Fairmount Santrol’s business, operations, assets, financial condition, earnings and prospects and the results of Unimin’s

due diligence review of Fairmount Santrol, which involved a review and assessment of Fairmount Santrol’s business, operations, assets,
financial condition, earnings and prospects;

 

 
•  the current and prospective business climate for the energy and industrial customers served by both companies, in which customers are

seeking large, diversified and reliable minerals suppliers and which favors firms with greater economies of scale and financial flexibility;
 

 

•  the alternatives reasonably available to Unimin, including remaining a part of the Sibelco group and seeking other strategic alternatives, and
the belief by the Unimin Board that the Merger with Fairmount Santrol will create the best available opportunity to maximize value for
Unimin’s stockholders, given the potential risks, rewards and uncertainties associated with other strategic alternatives and without limiting
the strategic alternatives that the combined company may pursue in the future;

 

 
•  the projected financial performance of Unimin as a stand-alone North American operation (relative to the projected financial performance of

the combined company) and the fit of the transaction with Unimin’s previously established strategic goals;
 

 •  the recommendation of Unimin’s senior management in favor of the Merger;
 

 
•  the initial Combined Company Board will include a majority of members affiliated or chosen by Unimin, and any replacements thereof will

be designated by the continuing Unimin directors;
 

 •  the chairman of the Combined Company Board will be a director chosen by Unimin;
 

 
•  the existing senior managers of Unimin and Fairmount Santrol will lead the management and oversight of the combined company following

the closing of the Merger, which provides continuity and allows an experienced team to be drawn from both companies to work together to
integrate the two companies;

 

 
•  the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, including the commitments by both Unimin and Fairmount Santrol to complete the

Merger;
 

 
•  the Unimin Board’s view, after consultation with its legal counsel, concerning the likelihood that regulatory approvals and clearances

necessary to consummate the Merger would be obtained;
 

 •  the Unimin Board’s view, after consultation with its financial advisors, concerning the potential value creation and synergies of the Mergers;

•  the Merger Agreement provides for a fixed Exchange Ratio that is expected to result in Sibelco and the Fairmount Santrol stockholders
owning 65% and 35%, respectively, of the combined company common stock immediately following the effective time, and that no
adjustment will be made in the Merger Consideration to be received by Fairmount Santrol stockholders in the Merger as a result of possible
increases or decreases in the trading price of the Fairmount Santrol common stock following the announcement of the Merger;

 

 
•  because Sibelco will hold, directly or indirectly, approximately 65% of the issued and outstanding shares of the combined company

immediately after the closing of the Merger, it will have the opportunity to participate in the future performance of the combined company,
including the anticipated synergies; and

 

 
•  the anticipated customer, employee and stakeholder reaction to the Merger, which the Unimin Board anticipated would be favorable based

on the enhanced product and service offerings, more efficient and expansive businesses and the anticipated synergies to be achieved as a
result of the Merger.

The Unimin Board weighed these advantages and opportunities against a number of other factors identified in its deliberations that weighed
negatively against the Merger, including:
 

 
•  the challenges inherent in the merger of two businesses of the size, geographical diversity and scope of Unimin and Fairmount Santrol,

including the risk that integration costs may be greater than anticipated and the possible diversion of management attention for an extended
period of time;

 

 
•  the difficulties of combining the businesses and workforces of Unimin and Fairmount Santrol based on, among other things, differences in

the cultures of the two companies;
 

 
•  Fairmount Santrol’s right, subject to certain conditions, to respond to and negotiate with respect to certain alternative proposals from third

parties made prior to the time Fairmount Santrol stockholders approve the Fairmount Santrol Merger proposal;
 

 
•  the restrictions in the Merger Agreement on the conduct of each of Unimin’s and Fairmount Santrol’s respective businesses during the

period between execution of the Merger Agreement and the closing of the Merger;
 

 
•  the risk that Fairmount Santrol stockholders may object to and challenge the Merger and take actions that may prevent or delay the closing

of the Merger, including to vote down the Fairmount Santrol Merger proposal;
 

 
•  the risk that regulatory agencies may object to and challenge the Merger or may impose terms and conditions in order to resolve those

objections that adversely affect the financial results of the combined company;
 

 
•  the risk that the pendency of the Merger for an extended period of time following announcement of the execution of the Merger Agreement,

as well as the risk of an extended integration period post-closing, could have an adverse impact on the business and financial performance of
Unimin or the combined company;

 

 
•  the potential for diversion of management and employee attention during the period prior to the closing of the Merger, and the potential

negative effects on Unimin’s and, ultimately, the combined company’s businesses;
 

 
•  the risk that, despite the efforts of Unimin and Fairmount Santrol prior to the closing of the Merger, Unimin and Fairmount Santrol may lose

key personnel and the potential resulting negative effects on Unimin’s and Fairmount Santrol’s and, ultimately, the combined company’s
businesses;

 

 •  the percentage of Fairmount Santrol’s business serving the energy industry;
 

 •  the risk that the combined company will not capture all of the anticipated synergies;
 

 •  the possibility that the combined company might not achieve its projected financial results;

 •  the risk that other anticipated benefits might not be realized;
 

 •  the risk that the combined company or its affiliates could become subject to adverse consequences under U.S. federal income tax laws;
 

 
•  the risk that industry developments, including changes in customer preferences, may adversely affect the business benefits anticipated to

result from the Merger;
 

 •  the risks associated with listing the combined company common stock on the NYSE; and
 

 
•  risks of the type described under “Risk Factors” beginning on page 46 of this proxy statement/prospectus and the matters described under

“Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” beginning on page 94 of this proxy statement/prospectus.

The foregoing discussion of the factors considered by the Unimin Board is not exhaustive but rather includes the principal factors considered by
the Unimin Board in connection with its deliberations related to the Merger. In view of the wide variety of factors considered in connection with its
evaluation of the Merger and the complexity of these matters, the Unimin Board did not find it useful to, and did not attempt to, quantify or assign any
relative or specific weights to the various factors that it considered in reaching its determination to approve the Merger Agreement. In addition,
individual members of the Unimin Board may have given differing weights to different factors. The Unimin Board conducted an overall review of the
factors described above, including thorough discussions with Unimin’s management and outside legal and financial advisors.

The foregoing discussion is based on assumptions regarding the synergies and revenue growth opportunities the combined company expects to
achieve following the Merger. However, these expected synergies and revenue growth opportunities may not develop. There can be no assurance that the
combined company will be able to successfully implement the strategic or operational initiatives that are intended. The explanation of the reasoning of
the Unimin Board and certain information presented in this section are forward-looking in nature and, therefore, the information should be read in light
of the factors discussed in the section entitled “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” beginning on page 94 of this proxy
statement/prospectus.

Opinion of Fairmount Santrol’s Financial Advisor

On December 11, 2017, Wells Fargo Securities rendered its oral opinion to the Fairmount Board, which was subsequently confirmed in writing by
delivery of Wells Fargo Securities’ written opinion dated the same date, that, as of December 11, 2017, the Merger Consideration to be received by
Fairmount Santrol stockholders, other than the Excluded Shares, in the Merger pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair, from a financial point of
view, to such holders.

Wells Fargo Securities’ opinion was for the information and use of the Fairmount Board (in its capacity as such) in connection with its
evaluation of the Merger. Wells Fargo Securities’ opinion only addressed the fairness, from a financial point of view, to Fairmount Santrol
stockholders, other than the Excluded Shares, of the Merger Consideration to be received by such holders in the Merger pursuant to the
Merger Agreement and did not address any other aspect or implication of the Merger. The summary of Wells Fargo Securities’ opinion in this
proxy statement/prospectus is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of its written opinion, which is included as Annex B to this
proxy statement/prospectus and sets forth the procedures followed, assumptions made, matters considered and limitations and qualifications on
the review undertaken by Wells Fargo Securities in connection with the preparation of its opinion. However, neither Wells Fargo Securities’
written opinion nor the summary of its opinion and the related analyses set forth in this proxy statement/prospectus is intended to be, and they
do not constitute, advice or a recommendation to the Fairmount Board or any Fairmount Santrol stockholder as to how such holder should
vote or act on any matter relating to the Merger.

In arriving at its opinion, Wells Fargo Securities, among other things:
 

 •  reviewed a draft, dated December 11, 2017, of the Merger Agreement;
 

 •  reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information relating to Fairmount Santrol and Unimin;
 

150

•  reviewed certain other information relating to Fairmount Santrol and Unimin, including financial forecasts for Fairmount Santrol for the
fiscal years ending December 31, 2017 through December 31, 2020 prepared and provided to Wells Fargo Securities by Fairmount Santrol
management, as adjusted and approved by Fairmount Santrol management (the “Fairmount Santrol Projections”), financial forecasts for
Unimin for the fiscal years ending December 31, 2017 through December 31, 2020 prepared and provided to Wells Fargo Securities by
Fairmount Santrol management, based on financial forecasts prepared by the management of Unimin, as adjusted and approved by
Fairmount Santrol management (the “Unimin Projections”) and certain information relating to the capital structure of Fairmount Santrol and
Unimin;

 

 
•  discussed with the managements of Fairmount Santrol and Unimin the respective businesses and prospects of Fairmount Santrol and

Unimin;
 

 
•  compared certain financial and stock market data of Fairmount Santrol and certain financial data of Unimin with similar data for other

companies with publicly traded equity securities in businesses that Wells Fargo Securities deemed relevant; and
 

 
•  considered such other information, financial studies, analyses and investigations and financial, economic and market criteria that Wells

Fargo Securities deemed relevant.

In connection with its review, Wells Fargo Securities did not independently verify any of the foregoing information, and Wells Fargo Securities
assumed and relied upon such information being complete and accurate in all respects. Wells Fargo Securities was advised, and at Fairmount Santrol’s
direction, assumed, that the Fairmount Santrol Projections and the Unimin Projections were reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently
available estimates and judgments of the managements of Fairmount Santrol and Unimin as to the respective future financial performance of Fairmount
Santrol and Unimin. At Fairmount Santrol’s direction, Wells Fargo Securities further assumed that the Fairmount Santrol Projections and Unimin
Projections were reasonable bases upon which to evaluate Fairmount Santrol, Unimin and the Merger and used and relied upon such forecasts for
purposes of its analyses and opinion. Wells Fargo Securities expressed no view or opinion with respect to the Fairmount Santrol Projections and the
Unimin Projections or the assumptions upon which they were based.

Neither Fairmount Santrol nor Unimin publicly discloses internal management projections of the type provided to Wells Fargo Securities in
connection with Wells Fargo Securities’ analysis of the Merger, and the Fairmount Santrol Projections and Unimin Projections were not prepared with a
view toward public disclosure. The Fairmount Santrol Projections and Unimin Projections were based on numerous variables and assumptions that are
inherently uncertain and may be beyond the control of management, including, without limitation, factors related to general economic and competitive
conditions and prevailing interest rates. Accordingly, actual results could vary significantly from those set forth in the Fairmount Santrol Projections and
Unimin Projections. For more information regarding the use of the Fairmount Santrol Projections and Unimin Projections, please refer to the section
entitled “—Certain Unaudited Financial Forecasts of Fairmount Santrol and Unimin” beginning on page 157 of this proxy statement/prospectus.

For purposes of its analyses and opinion, Wells Fargo Securities, at Fairmount Santrol’s direction, assumed that, in the course of obtaining any
regulatory or third party consents, approvals or agreements in connection with the Merger, no delay, limitation, restriction or condition would be
imposed that would have an adverse effect on Fairmount Santrol, Unimin or the contemplated benefits of the Merger. Wells Fargo Securities also
assumed that the Merger would be consummated in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations and in accordance with the terms of the Merger
Agreement without waiver, modification or amendment of any term, condition or agreement thereof that was material to its analyses or opinion and that
the final form of the Merger Agreement would not differ from the draft reviewed by Wells Fargo Securities in any respect material to its analyses or
opinion. In addition, Wells Fargo Securities was not requested to make, and did not make, an independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets or
liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of Fairmount Santrol or Unimin, nor was Wells Fargo Securities furnished with any such evaluations or appraisals.
Wells Fargo Securities did not undertake any independent analysis of any potential or actual litigation or claims, regulatory action, possible

unasserted claims or other contingent assets or liabilities, to which Fairmount Santrol or Unimin was or may have been a party or was or may have been
subject, or of any governmental investigation of any possible unasserted claims or other contingent liabilities to which Fairmount Santrol or Unimin was
or may have been a party or was or may have been subject.

Wells Fargo Securities’ opinion only addressed the fairness, from a financial point of view, to Fairmount Santrol stockholders, other than the
Excluded Shares, of the Merger Consideration to be received by such holders in the Merger pursuant to the Merger Agreement and did not address any
other aspect or implication (financial or otherwise) of the Merger, or any other agreement, arrangement or understanding entered into in connection with
the Merger or otherwise, including, without limitation, the fairness of the amount or nature of, or any other aspect relating to, any compensation or
Merger Consideration to be received by or otherwise payable to any officers, directors or employees of any party to the Merger, or class of such persons,
relative to the Merger Consideration or otherwise. Wells Fargo Securities did not express any advice or opinion regarding Sibelco’s control of Unimin
after giving effect to the Merger, and Wells Fargo Securities assumed that Sibelco’s control of Unimin had no effect on the valuation of the Merger
Consideration. Furthermore, Wells Fargo Securities did not express any advice or opinion regarding matters that require legal, regulatory, accounting,
insurance, tax, environmental, executive compensation or other similar professional advice. Wells Fargo Securities assumed that Fairmount Santrol had
or would obtain such advice or opinions from appropriate professional sources.

Wells Fargo Securities’ opinion was necessarily based upon information made available to Wells Fargo Securities as of the date of its opinion and
financial, economic, market and other conditions as they existed and could be evaluated on the date of its opinion. Wells Fargo Securities did not
undertake, and was under no obligation, to update, revise, reaffirm or withdraw its opinion, or otherwise comment on or consider events occurring or
coming to its attention after the date of its opinion. Wells Fargo Securities’ opinion did not address the relative merits of the Merger as compared to any
alternative transactions or strategies that might have been available to Fairmount Santrol, nor did it address the underlying business decision of the
Fairmount Board or Fairmount Santrol to proceed with or effect the Merger.

Financial Analyses

In preparing its opinion to the Fairmount Board, Wells Fargo Securities performed a variety of analyses, including those described below. The
summary of Wells Fargo Securities’ analyses is not a complete description of the analyses underlying Wells Fargo Securities’ opinion. The preparation
of such an opinion is a complex process involving various quantitative and qualitative judgments and determinations with respect to the financial,
comparative and other analytical methods employed and the adaptation and application of these methods to the unique facts and circumstances
presented. As a consequence, neither Wells Fargo Securities’ opinion nor its underlying analyses is readily susceptible to summary description. Wells
Fargo Securities arrived at its opinion based on the results of all analyses undertaken by it and assessed as a whole and did not draw, in isolation,
conclusions from or with regard to any individual analysis, methodology or factor. Accordingly, Wells Fargo Securities believes that its analyses and the
following summary must be considered as a whole and that selecting portions of its analyses, methodologies and factors, without considering all
analyses, methodologies and factors or the narrative description of the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the processes
underlying Wells Fargo Securities’ analyses and opinion.

In performing its analyses, Wells Fargo Securities considered general business, economic, industry and market conditions, financial and otherwise,
and other matters as they existed on, and could be evaluated as of, the date of its opinion. None of the selected companies used in Wells Fargo
Securities’ analyses is identical to Fairmount Santrol or Unimin and an evaluation of the results of those analyses is not entirely mathematical. The
financial analyses performed by Wells Fargo Securities were performed for analytical purposes only and are not necessarily indicative of actual values
or predictive of future results or values, which may be significantly more or less favorable than those suggested by the analyses. In addition, any
analyses relating to the value of assets, businesses or securities do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which businesses or securities
actually may be sold, which may depend on a variety of factors, many of which are beyond the control of Fairmount Santrol or Unimin.

While the results of each analysis were taken into account in reaching its overall conclusion with respect to fairness, Wells Fargo Securities did
not make separate or quantifiable judgments regarding individual analyses. Much of the information used in, and accordingly the results of, Wells Fargo
Securities’ analyses are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty.

Wells Fargo Securities’ opinion was only one of many factors considered by the Fairmount Board in evaluating the Merger. The type and amount
of Merger Consideration payable in the Merger were determined through negotiations between Fairmount Santrol and Unimin, and the decision to enter
into the Merger Agreement was solely that of the Fairmount Board.

The following is a summary of the material financial analyses performed by Wells Fargo Securities in connection with the preparation of its
opinion and reviewed with the Fairmount Board on December 11, 2017. The order of the analyses summarized below does not represent relative
importance or weight given to those analyses by Wells Fargo Securities. The analyses summarized below include information presented in tabular
format. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the analyses. Considering the data in the tables below without considering the full
narrative description of the analyses, as well as the methodologies underlying, and the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and
limitations and qualifications affecting, each analysis, could create an incomplete view of Wells Fargo Securities’ analyses.

For purposes of its analyses, Wells Fargo Securities reviewed a number of financial metrics, including the following:
 

 

•  Adjusted EBITDA— generally Adjusted EBITDA is the amount of the relevant company’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation,
amortization, non-recurring items and earnings attributable to non-controlling interests for a specified time period; however, to compare
Fairmount Santrol and Unimin on an equivalent basis, additional adjustments were made to Fairmount Santrol and Unimin’s respective
forecasted Adjusted EBITDAs based on differences in company financial reporting standards. Fairmount Santrol’s Adjusted EBITDA
included non-cash stock based compensation expenses and amortization of capitalized stripping costs, both of which are reported as
non-cash charges and normally excluded from Adjusted EBITDA; Unimin’s Adjusted EBITDA included adjustments for additional pension
expenses which are expected to be incurred upon conversion from IFRS to U.S. GAAP reporting standards and other adjustments as
described in “Certain Unaudited Financial Forecasts of Fairmount Santrol and Unimin.”

 

 

•  Total Enterprise Value (“TEV”)—generally the value as of a specified date of the relevant company’s outstanding equity securities (taking
into account outstanding options and other securities convertible, exercisable or exchangeable into or for equity securities of the company)
plus the value of its net debt (the value of its outstanding indebtedness and non-controlling interests less the amount of cash and cash
equivalents on its balance sheet).

Unless the context indicates otherwise, the Total Enterprise Values used in the selected companies analysis described below were calculated using
the market price of the common stock of the selected companies listed below as of December 8, 2017. The estimates of the future financial performance
of the selected companies listed below were based on certain publicly available research analyst estimates for those companies and the estimates of the
future financial performance of Fairmount Santrol and Unimin relied upon for the financial analyses described below were based on the Fairmount
Santrol Projections and the Unimin Projections, respectively.

Selected Companies Analysis. Wells Fargo Securities reviewed certain data for selected companies with publicly traded equity securities that
Wells Fargo Securities deemed relevant. None of the selected companies used in Wells Fargo Securities’ analyses is identical to Fairmount Santrol or
Unimin. The selected companies were selected because they are oilfield services companies with a North American sand based proppant focused
business, as well as, with respect to Unimin, selected companies with a sand based industrial materials focused business, that were deemed similar to
Fairmount Santrol and Unimin in one or more respects, including, among other things, services offered, customers, end-markets and financial
performance.

The financial data reviewed for the selected companies included:
 

 
•  Total Enterprise Value as a multiple of projected Adjusted EBITDA for the calendar year ending December 31, 2018, or “2018P Adjusted

EBITDA”; and
 

 
•  Total Enterprise Value as a multiple of projected Adjusted EBITDA for the calendar year ending December 31, 2019, or “2019P Adjusted

EBITDA”.

For Fairmount Santrol, the selected companies and median, mean, high and low of such financial data for the selected companies were:
 

 •  Emerge Energy Services LP
 

 •  Hi-Crush Partners LP
 

 •  Smart Sand, Inc.
 

 •  U.S. Silica Holdings, Inc.
 

   Median   Mean    High    Low  
TEV/2018P Adjusted EBITDA    4.4x    4.6x    5.5x    4.0x 
TEV/2019P Adjusted EBITDA    4.5x    4.5x    5.4x    3.5x 

Taking into account the results of the selected companies analysis, Wells Fargo Securities applied multiple ranges of 4.6x to 5.4x to Fairmount
Santrol’s 2018P Adjusted EBITDA and 4.5x to 5.4x to Fairmount Santrol’s 2019P Adjusted EBITDA. The selected companies analysis indicated the
following implied equity value reference ranges for Fairmount Santrol:
 

   Implied Equity Values ($mm)  
       Low           High     
2018P Adjusted EBITDA   $ 868   $ 1,125 
2019P Adjusted EBITDA   $ 713   $ 978 

For Unimin, Wells Fargo Securities separated the selected companies into three groups: the purely proppant focused companies (the “Pure Play
Proppant Peers”), the mixed proppant and industrial and recreation focused companies (the “Proppant/I&R Sand Peers”) and the industrial focused
companies (the “Industrial Peers”). The selected companies and median, mean, high and low of such financial data for the selected companies were:

Pure Play Proppant Peers

Taking into account the results of the selected companies analysis, Wells Fargo Securities applied multiple ranges of 5.5x to 6.8x to Unimin’s
2018P Adjusted EBITDA and 5.4x to 6.5x to Unimin’s 2019P Adjusted EBITDA. The selected companies analysis indicated the following implied
equity value reference ranges for Unimin:
 

   Implied Equity Values ($mm)  
       Low           High     
2018P Adjusted EBITDA   $ 1,548   $ 2,123 
2019P Adjusted EBITDA   $ 1,830   $ 2,384 

Discounted Cash Flow Analysis. Wells Fargo Securities performed a discounted cash flow analysis for each of Fairmount Santrol and Unimin by
calculating the estimated net present value of the projected unlevered free cash flows of each of Fairmount Santrol and Unimin for the calendar years
ending December 31, 2017 through December 31, 2020, based on the Fairmount Santrol Projections and the Unimin Projections. Unlevered free cash
flows were calculated as Adjusted EBITDA less unlevered cash taxes, capital expenditures and changes in working capital.

For Fairmount Santrol’s discounted cash flow analysis, Wells Fargo Securities applied perpetuity growth rates ranging from 2.5% to 3.5% and
discount rates ranging from 13.3% to 14.2%. The discounted cash flow analysis indicated the following implied equity value reference range for
Fairmount Santrol:
 

   Implied Equity Values ($mm)  
       Low           High     
Discounted Cash Flow Analysis   $ 728   $ 969 

For Unimin’s discounted cash flow analysis, Wells Fargo Securities applied perpetuity growth rates ranging from 2.5% to 3.5% and discount rates
ranging from 12.1% to 13.1%. The discounted cash flow analysis indicated the following implied equity value reference range for Unimin:
 

   Implied Equity Values ($mm)  
       Low           High     
Discounted Cash Flow Analysis   $ 1,594   $ 2,163 

Exchange Ratio Analysis. Based upon the implied equity values for each of Fairmount Santrol and Unimin as described above under “Selected
Companies Analysis” and “Discounted Cash Flow Analysis” and the fully diluted shares of Fairmount Santrol common stock and Unimin common
stock, as provided Fairmount Santrol management, Wells Fargo Securities calculated the implied contribution percentage reference ranges for Fairmount
Santrol and the implied exchange ratio reference ranges per share of Fairmount Santrol common stock to a share of Unimin common stock.

For each of the analyses referred to above, Wells Fargo Securities calculated the implied contribution percentages for Fairmount Santrol by
combining the low end of each range of implied equity values of Fairmount

Santrol to the low and high end of each range of implied equity values of Unimin before dividing by the low end of each implied equity value of
Fairmount Santrol, and by combining the high end of each range of implied equity values of Fairmount Santrol to the low and high end of each range of
implied equity values of Unimin before dividing by the high end of each implied equity value of Fairmount Santrol. In each case, the implied equity
values for Fairmount Santrol were adjusted for the aggregate Cash Consideration to be received, equal to $170 million. The exchange ratio analysis
indicated the following implied contribution percentage reference ranges for Fairmount Santrol:
 

   Implied Contribution Percentages  
       Low          High     
Discounted Cash Flow Analysis    21%   33% 

Selected Public Companies Analysis    
TEV/2018P EBITDA    25%   38% 
TEV/2019P EBITDA    19%   31% 

The implied contribution percentage reference ranges for Fairmount Santrol were then compared to the proposed Fairmount Santrol ownership
percentage of 35% in the combined company, as stated in the Merger Agreement.

Wells Fargo Securities also calculated the implied exchange ratios for Fairmount Santrol by first calculating the implied per share equity values
for each of Fairmount Santrol and Unimin. Wells Fargo Securities calculated the implied per share equity values for Fairmount Santrol by dividing the
low end of each range of implied equity values of Fairmount Santrol by the number of fully diluted shares of Fairmount Santrol common stock
outstanding as of December 8, 2017 (including expected issuances of diluted securities from December 8, 2017 to the closing of the Merger) and by
dividing the high end of each range of implied equity values of Fairmount Santrol by the number of fully diluted shares of Fairmount Santrol common
stock outstanding as of December 8, 2017 (including expected issuances of dilutive securities from December 8, 2017 to the closing of the Merger in
respect of equity awards expected to be issued in the ordinary course of business). In each case, the implied per share equity values for Fairmount
Santrol were adjusted for the per share Cash Consideration to be received by Fairmount Santrol stockholders, other than the Excluded Shares. Wells
Fargo Securities calculated the implied per share equity values for Unimin by dividing the low end of each range of implied equity values of Unimin by
the number of implied fully diluted shares of Unimin common stock outstanding and by dividing the high end of each range of implied equity values of
Unimin by the number of implied fully diluted shares of Unimin common stock outstanding. In each case, at the direction of Fairmount Santrol, the
number of implied fully diluted shares of Unimin common stock outstanding was based on an assumed 100:1 stock split of the number of fully diluted
shares of Unimin common stock outstanding.

Wells Fargo Securities then calculated the implied exchange ratios for Fairmount Santrol by dividing the low end of each range of implied per
share equity values of Fairmount Santrol by the high and low end of each range of implied per share equity values of Unimin and by dividing the high
end of each range of implied per share equity values of Fairmount Santrol by the high and low end of each range of implied per share equity values of
Unimin. The exchange ratio analysis indicated the following implied exchange ratio reference ranges for Fairmount Santrol:
 

   Implied Exchange Ratios  
       Low           High     
Discounted Cash Flow Analysis    0.198x    0.385x 

Selected Public Companies Analysis     
TEV/2018P EBITDA    0.252x    0.473x 
TEV/2019P EBITDA    0.175x    0.338x 

The implied exchange ratio reference ranges were then compared to the proposed Stock Consideration exchange ratio of 0.413x, calculated based
on the number of fully diluted shares of Fairmount Santrol common stock outstanding as of December 8, 2017.

Certain Unaudited Financial Forecasts of Fairmount Santrol and Unimin

During the course of the negotiations between Fairmount Santrol and Sibelco, each of Fairmount Santrol and Sibelco supplied the other with
certain business and financial information that was not publicly available. Fairmount Santrol management provided the Fairmount Board, Wells Fargo
Securities and Sibelco with certain financial projections, including the Fairmount Santrol Projections. Sibelco provided Fairmount Santrol and Wells
Fargo Securities with certain prospective business and financial information which was prepared by management of Unimin and of Sibelco, including
the Unimin Projections.

While neither the Fairmount Santrol Projections nor the Unimin Projections are presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP or with IFRS, the
financial information underlying certain aspects of the Fairmount Santrol Projections reflects the application of U.S. GAAP accounting methodologies
by Fairmount Santrol and the financial information underlying certain aspects of the Unimin Projections reflects the application of IFRS accounting
methodologies by Unimin. However, as discussed below, Fairmount Santrol management made certain adjustments to the Fairmount Santrol Projections
and the Unimin Projections in order to assist Fairmount Santrol’s evaluation of the respective projections on an equivalent basis, including by making
certain adjustments

to reflect Fairmount Santrol management’s views of appropriate adjustments of Unimin’s financial information from an IFRS presentation to a U.S.
GAAP presentation, as further described below.

The Unimin Projections were not prepared, reviewed or adopted by Sibelco or by Unimin. The Fairmount Santrol Projections and the Unimin
Projections were prepared based on Fairmount Santrol and Unimin as standalone entities, and do not reflect any potential synergies resulting from, or
any other aspects of, the Merger, and are not intended to be added together. Adding together the Fairmount Santrol Projections and the Unimin
Projections would not represent the results the combined company will achieve if the Merger is completed and does not represent forward-looking
financial information for the combined company.

Fairmount Santrol does not regularly provide public projections as to future earnings or cash flows. Fairmount Santrol management prepared the
prospective financial information set forth below to assist the Fairmount Board in its evaluation of the Merger. The accompanying prospective financial
information was not prepared with a view towards public disclosure or compliance with the published guidelines of the SEC, U.S. GAAP or the
guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation and presentation of financial forecasts, but, in the view
of Fairmount Santrol management, was prepared on a reasonable basis, reflected the best available estimates and judgments at the time of preparation,
and presented as of the time of preparation, to the best of Fairmount Santrol management’s knowledge and belief, and subject to the accuracy of the
information provided by Unimin, reasonable projections of the future financial performance of each of Unimin and Fairmount Santrol. However, this
information is not fact and should not be relied upon as being necessarily indicative of future results, and you are cautioned not to place undue reliance
on the prospective financial information. Neither Sibelco’s, Unimin’s nor Fairmount Santrol’s independent auditors, nor any other independent
accountants, have compiled, examined, or performed any procedures with respect to the prospective financial information contained herein, nor have
they expressed any opinion or any other form of assurance on such information or its achievability, and assume no responsibility for, and disclaim any
association with, the prospective financial information. The prospective financial information included in this document has been prepared by, and is the
responsibility of, the management of Fairmount Santrol. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has not audited, reviewed, examined, compiled nor applied
agreed-upon procedures with respect to the accompanying prospective financial information and, accordingly, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP does not
express an opinion or any other form of assurance with respect thereto. The PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP report incorporated by reference into this
proxy statement/prospectus relates to Fairmount Santrol’s previously issued financial statements. It does not extend to the prospective financial
information and should not be read to do so. Further, Fairmount Santrol management has made certain adjustments to the prospective financial
information, as discussed below, in order to assist Fairmount Santrol’s evaluation of the Merger between Fairmount Santrol and Unimin on an equivalent
basis. In addition, the Fairmount Santrol Projections and the Unimin Projections were both prepared before the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was signed into
law on December 22, 2017 and do not reflect the provisions of such law.

While presented with numerical specificity, the Fairmount Santrol Projections and the Unimin Projections are based upon a variety of estimates,
assumptions and adjustments relating to the businesses of Unimin and Fairmount Santrol that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions
may prove to be inaccurate for any number of reasons, including general economic conditions, competition, and the risks discussed in more detail in the
sections entitled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Unimin’s Business,” “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Fairmount Santrol’s Business and Operations”
and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Proposed Merger.” There can be no assurance that the Fairmount Santrol Projections or the Unimin Projections
will be realized, and actual results may differ materially from those shown. Generally, the further out the period to which the financial projections relate,
the more unpredictable the projections become as to likelihood of realization.

You should not place undue reliance on the Fairmount Santrol Projections or the Unimin Projections. Neither Fairmount Santrol, Unimin, Sibelco
nor any other person has made or makes any representation to any stockholder, or any other party, regarding the information included in these
projections. The inclusion of Fairmount Santrol Projections and the Unimin Projections in this proxy statement/prospectus should not be regarded as an
indication that Unimin, Sibelco, Fairmount Santrol or their respective representatives considered or consider the projections to be a reliable prediction of
future events, and the projections should not be relied

upon as such. Management of Unimin and Fairmount Santrol have prepared from time to time in the past, and will continue to prepare in the future,
internal financial forecasts that reflect various estimates and assumptions that change from time to time. Accordingly, the Fairmount Santrol Projections
and the Unimin Projections used in conjunction with the Merger may differ from these forecasts.

EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY LAW, NONE OF UNIMIN, FAIRMOUNT SANTROL, OR THEIR RESPECTIVE
DIRECTORS OR OFFICERS INTEND TO UPDATE OR REVISE THE FAIRMOUNT SANTROL PROJECTIONS OR THE UNIMIN
PROJECTIONS TO REFLECT CIRCUMSTANCES EXISTING AFTER THE DATE THEY WERE PREPARED OR TO REFLECT THE
OCCURRENCE OF FUTURE EVENTS, EVEN IN THE EVENT THAT SOME OR ALL OF THE ASSUMPTIONS ARE DETERMINED TO
BE INACCURATE OR ERRONEOUS. THE ASSUMPTIONS UNDERLYING THE FAIRMOUNT SANTROL PROJECTIONS AND/OR
THE UNIMIN PROJECTIONS MAY BE INACCURATE OR ERRONEOUS AS OF THE DATE OF THIS PROXY
STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS.

EBITDA is a financial measure of operating performance commonly used in Fairmount Santrol’s and Unimin’s industries but is not defined under
U.S. GAAP. EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income, operating income, cash flows from operating activities or
any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP or as a measure of a company’s profitability or liquidity. Because
EBITDA excludes some, but not all, items that affect net income, this measure may vary among companies, including as between Fairmount Santrol,
Unimin and comparable companies operating in Fairmount Santrol’s and Unimin’s industries. The EBITDA data presented below may not be
comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Fairmount Santrol management believed that EBITDA is a meaningful measure to investors
and provides additional information about their ability to meet future liquidity requirements for debt service, capital expenditures and working capital. In
addition, Fairmount Santrol management believes that EBITDA is a useful comparative measure of operating performance and liquidity. For example,
debt levels, credit ratings and, therefore, the impact of interest expense on earnings vary significantly between companies. Similarly, the tax positions of
individual companies can vary because of their differing abilities to take advantage of tax benefits, with the result that their effective tax rates and tax
expense can vary considerably. Finally, companies differ in the age and method of acquisition of productive assets, and thus the relative costs of those
assets, as well as in the depreciation or depletion (straight-line, accelerated, units of production) method, which can result in considerable variability in
depletion, depreciation and amortization expense between companies. Thus, for comparison purposes, each of Fairmount Santrol’s and Unimin’s
managements believes that EBITDA can be useful as an objective and comparable measure of operating profitability and the contribution of operations
to liquidity because it excludes these elements. Further, Adjusted EBITDA is a financial measure commonly used but not defined under U.S. GAAP that
generally removes non-recurring items and earnings attributable to non-controlling interests for a specified period from EBITDA. In order to compare
Fairmount Santrol and Unimin on an equivalent basis, the Fairmount Santrol Projections and the Unimin Projections constitute Adjusted EBITDA, and
further additional adjustments were made to Fairmount Santrol’s and Unimin’s respective forecasted Adjusted EBITDAs, as discussed below, to make
each respective company’s forecasted Adjusted EBITDA more comparable. Fairmount Santrol’s Adjusted EBITDA included non-cash stock-based
compensation expenses and amortization of capitalized stripping costs, both of which are reported as non-cash charges and normally excluded from
Adjusted EBITDA. Unimin’s Adjusted EBITDA included adjustments for additional pension expenses which will be required to be recognized upon
conversion from IFRS to U.S. GAAP reporting standards and other adjustments as described below.

Fairmount Santrol Projections

Although Fairmount Santrol periodically may issue limited guidance to investors concerning its expected financial performance, Fairmount
Santrol does not as a matter of course publicly disclose detailed financial forecasts. Further, the Fairmount Board does not as a matter of course adopt
forecasts covering periods of greater than one forward-looking fiscal year. Generally, once the Fairmount Board adopts a fiscal year forecast, Fairmount
Santrol management subsequently updates such forecast throughout that year as actual results are realized. In addition, after the first quarter actual
results are completed in a fiscal year, Fairmount Santrol

management provides the Fairmount Board with high-level projections for the next fiscal year. However, in connection with the evaluation and
negotiation of the Merger, Fairmount Santrol provided to Wells Fargo Securities and Sibelco certain non-public financial forecasts for the years that end
on December 31, 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020. Fairmount Santrol management originally prepared the Fairmount Santrol Projections covering the year
ended December 31, 2017 as part of its annual, ordinary course planning process and high-level projections for the year ending December 31, 2018
during fiscal 2017, and updated such projections in connection with the valuation work performed to assist in the Fairmount Board’s evaluation of the
Merger and to reflect developments in Fairmount Santrol’s business occurring since the conclusion of Fairmount Santrol’s most recent annual, ordinary
course planning process. Fairmount Santrol management first prepared the financial forecasts for the years that end on December 31, 2019 and
December 31, 2020 in connection with the valuation work performed to assist in the Fairmount Board’s evaluation of the Merger.

The Fairmount Santrol Projections:
 

 
•  were based upon numerous assumptions, as further described below, many of which are beyond the control of Fairmount Santrol and may

not prove to be accurate;
 

 
•  were, in the case of the 2017 and 2018 projections, originally developed as part of the annual, ordinary course planning process, as further

described above, and in each such case were updated in connection with the valuation work performed to assist in Fairmount Santrol’s
evaluation of the Merger;

 

 
•  were, in the case of the 2019 and 2020 projections, developed in connection with the valuation work performed to assist in Fairmount

Santrol’s evaluation of the Merger;
 

 

•  were developed with a view to creating prospective financial metrics that would be useful to the Fairmount Board and Wells Fargo
Securities in comparing Fairmount Santrol and Unimin on an equivalent basis, including without limitation by (i) deeming capital and
mineral leases, earnout payments and stripping costs to be capitalized items, in order to more closely reflect the accounting methodologies
used to prepare the Unimin Projections, and (ii) determining that EBITDA should not be adjusted upward with respect to non-cash stock-
based compensation expenses, in order to more closely reflect the fact that all compensation to similarly situated employees of Unimin was
all-cash;

 

 
•  do not necessarily reflect current estimates or assumptions management of Fairmount Santrol may have about prospects for Fairmount

Santrol’s businesses, changes in general business or economic conditions, expenses related to the proposed Merger, or any other transaction
or event that has occurred or that may occur and that was not anticipated at the time the projections were prepared;

 

 
•  are not necessarily indicative of current values or future performance, which may be significantly more favorable or less favorable than as

set forth below; and
 

 
•  are not, and should not be regarded as, a representation that any of the expectations contained in, or forming a part of, Fairmount Santrol’s

projections will be achieved.

The following information is set forth in the Fairmount Santrol Projections:
 

($ in millions)   2017P   2018P   2019P   2020P 
Adjusted EBITDA*   $190   $321   $294   $292 
Unlevered Free Cash Flow   $ 72   $ 76   $172   $157 

 

* 2017 Adjusted EBITDA reflects non-cash adjustments of $9. All Adjusted EBITDA figures reflect stripping cost adjustments of ($11). All Adjusted
EBITDA figures are net of stock-based compensation of ($8) for 2017 and ($11) for 2018 – 2020.

Unimin Projections

Fairmount Santrol’s management made certain assumptions based on a view of Unimin’s past performance, certain prospective business and
financial information provided by Sibelco and Unimin to Fairmount Santrol, and certain extrapolations considered by Fairmount Santrol management to
be reasonable, and on such basis prepared

the Unimin Projections for the fiscal years that end on December 31, 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020. The Unimin Projections were provided to the
Fairmount Board and reviewed and approved by Fairmount Santrol management for use by Wells Fargo Securities and Wells Fargo Securities’ financial
analyses and fairness opinion.

While certain prospective business and financial information that underlies the Unimin Projections was provided by Sibelco and Unimin to
Fairmount Santrol, the Unimin Projections were not themselves prepared, reviewed or adopted by Unimin’s management or by Sibelco. The prospective
financial information contained in the Unimin Projections for the fiscal years that end on December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2018 was based directly
upon the prospective financial information provided by Unimin, as adjusted by Fairmount Santrol to reflect Fairmount Santrol management’s views of
required pension adjustments in connection with a conversion from an IFRS presentation to a U.S. GAAP presentation and other adjustments for
pension expense, adjustments related to the HPQ Carveout and the replacement of parent company services by Sibelco to Unimin. The prospective
financial information contained in the Unimin Projections for the fiscal years that end on December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2020 was based upon
prospective information provided to Fairmount Santrol by Sibelco and Unimin, to which Fairmount Santrol management applied certain assumptions
(which assumptions were reasonable in the view of Fairmount Santrol management) concerning sand capacity utilization and the related per ton
margins. The Unimin Projections were based on certain prospective financial information provided by Unimin management that had been prepared on
an IFRS basis.

The following information was included in the Unimin Projections:
 

($ in millions)   2017P   2018P   2019P   2020P 
Adjusted EBITDA*   $284   $442   $503   $497 
Unlevered Free Cash Flow   $ 52   $ 73   $ 211   $308 

 

* All Adjusted EBITDA figures reflect charges of ($8) in total, consisting of U.S. GAAP to IFRS conversion charges related to pension accounting of
($2), other adjustments to pension expense of ($3) and charges related to the HPQ Carveout and the replacement of parent company services of ($3).

Refinancing of Indebtedness of Fairmount Santrol and Unimin

In connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement, Unimin has received a debt commitment letter from Barclays Bank PLC, BNP Paribas
and BNP Paribas Securities Corp., pursuant to which the lenders have committed to provide a senior secured term loan in the amount of $1.65 billion
and a senior secured revolving credit facility in the amount of $200 million. The proceeds of the term loan would be used to repay debt of Fairmount
Santrol, to repay debt of Unimin (including debt incurred to fund the Cash Redemption) and to pay the Cash Consideration and transaction costs for the
Merger.

Pursuant to the debt commitment letter, the term loan would mature seven years after the closing date of the facilities and would amortize in equal
quarterly installments in an amount equal to 1% per year beginning with the first full fiscal quarter after the closing date of the facilities, with the
balance due at maturity. Loans under the term loan would be prepaid with, subject to various exceptions, limitations and qualifications, (a) 100% of the
net proceeds of all non-ordinary course asset sales and insurance proceeds, (b) 100% of the net cash proceeds of issuances of indebtedness and (c) 50%
of annual excess cash flow (with stepdowns to 25% and 0% based on total net leverage ratio levels). Voluntary prepayments of the term loan are
permitted at any time without premium or penalty other than (a) customary “breakage” costs with respect to LIBOR borrowings and (b) a 1.00% call
protection premium applicable to certain “repricing transactions” occurring on or prior to the date that is 12 months after the closing date of the
facilities.

Pursuant to the debt commitment letter, the revolving credit facility would mature five years after the closing date of the facilities. Voluntary
reductions of the unused portion of the revolving credit facility commitment may be made at any time. The revolving credit facility will include a total
net leverage ratio covenant, to be tested on a quarterly basis, commencing with the first full fiscal quarter after the closing date of the facilities, of no
more than 4.50:1.00, to step down to 4.00:1.00 for the quarter ended December 31, 2018.

Interest on both facilities would accrue at a per annum rate of either (at the option of the combined company) (1) LIBOR plus a spread or (2) the
alternate base rate plus a spread. LIBOR refers to the London Inter-bank Offered Rate and, in general, is the average of the interest rates estimated by
each of the leading banks in London that it would be charged were it to borrow from other banks. LIBOR will never be less than 1.00%. The alternate
base rate, as defined in the debt commitment letter, is the highest of (i) Barclays’s prime rate, (ii) the US federal funds effective rate plus ½ of 1.00% and
(iii) the LIBOR rate for a one month period plus 1.00%. The debt commitment letter provides that the spread will vary depending on the combined
company’s total net leverage ratio (the ratio of debt (less up to $150 million of cash) to EBITDA for the most recent four fiscal quarter period), as
follows:
 

Total Net Leverage Ratio  
Applicable Margin for

LIBOR Loans   
Applicable Margin for

ABR Loans  
Greater than or equal to 3.5x   4.75%   3.75% 
Greater than or equal to 3.0x and less than 3.5x   4.50%   3.50% 
Greater than or equal to 2.5x and less than 3.0x   4.25%   3.25% 
Greater than or equal to 2.0x and less than 2.50x   4.00%   3.00% 
Less than 2.0x   3.75%   2.75% 

The interest rate spreads set forth in the table above will each be reduced by 0.25% if the corporate credit ratings in respect of the combined
company issued in connection with the initial syndication of the senior secured term loan and the senior secured revolving credit facility are BB- (with a
stable or better outlook) or higher and Ba3 (with a stable or better outlook) or higher from S&P and Moody’s, respectively.

The term loan and the revolving credit facility would be guaranteed by all of the combined company’s wholly owned material restricted
subsidiaries (including Fairmount Santrol (and its successor, Merger Sub LLC) and all of the wholly owned material restricted subsidiaries of Fairmount
Santrol), subject to certain exceptions. In addition, subject to various exceptions, the facilities would be secured by substantially all of the assets of the
combined company and each other guarantor, including but not limited to (a) a perfected first-priority pledge of all of the capital stock held by the
combined company or any other guarantor of each existing or subsequently acquired or organized wholly owned restricted subsidiary of the combined
company (no more than 65% of the voting stock of any foreign subsidiary) and (b) perfected first-priority security interests in substantially all of the
tangible and intangible assets of the combined company and each guarantor.

The facilities will contain customary representations and warranties, affirmative covenants, negative covenants and events of default. Negative
covenants will include, among others, limitations on debt, liens, asset sales, mergers, consolidations and fundamental changes, dividends and
repurchases of equity securities, repayments or redemptions of subordinated debt, investments, transactions with affiliates, restrictions on granting liens
to secure obligations, restrictions on subsidiary distributions, changes in the conduct of the business, amendments and waivers in organizational
documents and junior debt instruments, and changes in fiscal year.

In addition, the debt commitment letter provides that the documentation for the term loan and revolving credit facility will permit Unimin to add
one or more incremental term loan facilities and/or increase the commitments under the revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount up to
the sum of (x) $250 million, plus (y) an amount of incremental facilities so that, after giving effect to any such incremental facility, on a pro forma basis,
the total net leverage ratio would not exceed 2.75:1.00, plus (z) an amount equal to all voluntary prepayments of the term loan. In addition to
incremental term loan facilities and revolving credit facility increases, this incremental credit capacity can be utilized in the form of (a) senior unsecured
notes or loans, subject to a pro forma total net leverage ratio of up to 3.75:1.00, (b) senior secured notes or loans that are secured by the collateral on a
junior basis, subject to a pro forma total net leverage ratio of up to 3.25:1.00, or (c) senior secured notes that are secured by the collateral on a pari passu
basis, subject to a pro forma total net leverage ratio of up to 2.75:1.00.

Obligations to fund under the debt commitment letter are subject to certain conditions, including the closing of the Merger, the accuracy of certain
representations and warranties, the absence of a material adverse effect on Fairmount Santrol, the repayment of certain debt of Unimin and Fairmount
Santrol as reflected in “Summary—Refinancing of Indebtedness of Fairmount Santrol and Unimin” in this proxy statement/prospectus, receipt of
audited and unaudited financial statements and certain pro forma information, delivery of a solvency certificate by Unimin’s chief financial officer,
payment of all fees required to be paid on the closing date of the facilities and execution of requisite credit facility and collateral documentation and
closing documentation.

The HPQ Carveout

As contemplated by the Merger Agreement, Sibelco will retain the global high purity quartz business, which consists of Unimin’s Electronics
segment. Prior to, and as a condition to, the closing of the Merger, Unimin will contribute certain of its assets to HPQ Co, in exchange for all of the
stock of HPQ Co and the assumption by HPQ Co of certain liabilities related to the business being transferred, in accordance with the Contribution
Agreement. Unimin will then distribute 100% of the stock of HPQ Co to Sibelco in exchange for certain shares of Unimin common stock held by
Sibelco, in accordance with the Contribution Agreement. The HPQ Carveout will also include certain personnel and assets historically part of Unimin
that support coatings and polymers sales and research activities together with certain related intellectual property.

Prior to the effective time of the HPQ Carveout, Unimin, Sibelco and HPQ Co will enter into the Tax Matters Agreement governing their
respective rights, responsibilities and obligations relating to tax liabilities, the filing of tax returns, the control of tax contests and other tax matters.
Under the Tax Matters Agreement, the combined company and HPQ Co (and their affiliates) will be responsible for income taxes required to be reported
on their respective separate and group tax returns; however, HPQ Co will be responsible for any unpaid income taxes (as of the date of the HPQ
Redemption) attributable to the HPQ business prior to the date of the HPQ Carveout. HPQ Co will be responsible for any unpaid non-income taxes (as
of the date of the HPQ Redemption) attributable to the HPQ business (whether arising prior to the HPQ Carveout or not) and the combined company
will be responsible for all other non-income taxes. HPQ Co and the combined company will equally bear any transfer taxes imposed on the HPQ
Carveout. Rights to refunds in respect of taxes will be allocated in the same manner as the responsibility for tax liabilities.

The Cash Redemption

In connection with the closing of the Merger, Unimin expects to redeem shares of Unimin common stock currently held by Sibelco in exchange
for an amount in cash equal to approximately (1) $660 million plus interest accruing at 5.0% per annum for the period from June 30, 2017 through the
closing of the Merger less (2) $170 million, which will be paid to Fairmount Santrol stockholders as consideration in the Merger.

Exchange of Shares in the Merger

After the effective time, there will be no further registration of transfers of shares of Fairmount Santrol common stock. From and after the
effective time, each holder of a physical certificate or a book-entry share representing shares of Fairmount Santrol common stock outstanding
immediately prior to the effective time will no longer have any rights with respect to such shares, except for the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, or as otherwise provided in the Merger Agreement or by applicable law. Each share of Fairmount Santrol common stock owned by
Fairmount Santrol or any of its subsidiaries at the effective time will be cancelled without any payment of the Merger Consideration.

If you are a Fairmount Santrol stockholder, you will not be entitled to receive any dividends or other distributions with respect to combined
company common stock until the Merger is completed and you have surrendered your share certificates and/or book-entry shares of Fairmount Santrol
common stock in exchange for the Merger Consideration.

If you would otherwise be entitled to receive a fraction of a share of combined company common stock as a result of the Merger (after aggregating
all fractional shares of combined company common stock issuable to

you), in lieu of the fraction of a share and upon surrender of your certificates or book-entry shares of Fairmount Santrol common stock you will be paid
in cash in lieu of such fractional shares in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement.

If a Fairmount Santrol common stock certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, the person claiming the lost, stolen or destroyed stock
certificate must deliver an affidavit of that fact and, if required by Unimin or the exchange agent, must post a bond in such reasonable amount as Unimin
or the exchange agent, as applicable, may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such certificates before the
exchange agent will deliver the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect of the shares of Fairmount Santrol common stock represented by the lost,
stolen or destroyed stock certificate, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of combined company common stock, and unpaid dividends and distributions
on combined company common stock deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to the Merger Agreement.

Each of Unimin, Fairmount Santrol and the exchange agent will be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration otherwise
payable pursuant to the Merger Agreement such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the
Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld or paid over to or deposited with the relevant
governmental entity, such withheld amounts will be treated for all purposes of the Merger Agreement as having been paid to the person in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made.

If the exchange agent is to pay some or all of the Merger Consideration to a person other than the record holder, such record holder must have
their certificates properly endorsed or otherwise in proper form for transfer and the person requesting such delivery of the Merger Consideration must
pay any transfer or other taxes required by reason of such registration or establish to the exchange agent’s reasonable satisfaction that the taxes have
been paid or are not applicable.

As soon as reasonably practicable after the effective time, the exchange agent will mail to each holder of record of a certificate or book-entry share
that immediately prior to the effective time represented outstanding shares of Fairmount Santrol common stock, whose shares were converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration, (A) a letter of transmittal (which will specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the certificates or book-entry shares to the exchange agent, and which will be in such form and have such
other provisions as Unimin may reasonably specify) and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the certificates and book-entry shares in
exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a certificate or book-entry share, as applicable, for cancellation to the exchange agent or to
such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Unimin, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may
reasonably be required by the exchange agent, the holder of such certificate or book-entry share will be entitled to receive in exchange therefor that
number of whole shares of combined company common stock that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the Merger Agreement, along with the
Cash Consideration and cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any, and the certificate or book-entry share so surrendered will be cancelled. You should not
send in your Fairmount Santrol share certificates for exchange until you receive the letter of transmittal and instructions from the exchange agent.

Post-Closing Dividend Policy

The combined company does not currently anticipate declaring or issuing dividends on and subsequent to the closing of the Merger. Any decision
by the combined company to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of the Combined Company Board and will depend upon the operations,
cash requirements, legal restrictions and other factors deemed relevant by the Combined Company Board. Further, it is expected that the combined
company’s debt agreements will place certain restrictions on the combined company’s ability to pay dividends. Consequently, unless there is a change to
the combined company dividend policy, your only opportunity to achieve a return on your investment is if the price of the combined company common
stock appreciates. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Investing in and Ownership of Combined Company Common Stock” beginning on page 84 of
this proxy statement/prospectus.

Appraisal Rights

Under the DGCL, subject to the closing of the Merger, record holders of Fairmount Santrol common stock who do not vote in favor of the
Fairmount Santrol Merger proposal and who otherwise properly exercise and perfect their appraisal rights in accordance with Section 262 will be
entitled to seek appraisal for, and obtain payment in cash for the judicially determined fair value of, their shares of Fairmount Santrol common stock, in
lieu of receiving the Merger Consideration. The “fair value” could be higher or lower than, or the same as, the Merger Consideration. Fairmount Santrol
stockholders who wish to exercise the right to seek an appraisal of their shares must so advise Fairmount Santrol by submitting a written demand for
appraisal in the form described in this proxy statement/prospectus prior to the vote on the approval of the Fairmount Santrol Merger proposal at the
special meeting and must otherwise follow the procedures prescribed by Section 262. A person having a beneficial interest in shares of Fairmount
Santrol common stock held of record in the name of another person, such as a nominee or intermediary, must act promptly to cause the record holder to
follow the steps summarized in this proxy statement/prospectus and in a timely manner to perfect appraisal rights.

The full text of Section 262 is attached as Annex E to this proxy statement/prospectus. Fairmount Santrol stockholders are encouraged to read
these provisions carefully and in their entirety. Moreover, due to the complexity of the procedures specified in Section 262, Fairmount Santrol
stockholders who wish to pursue appraisal rights are encouraged to seek the advice of legal counsel. Failure to strictly comply with Section 262 may
result in a waiver of, or the inability to exercise, appraisal rights. For more information regarding appraisal rights, see the section entitled “Appraisal
Rights of Fairmount Santrol Stockholders” in this proxy statement/prospectus.

Listing of Combined Company Common Stock

There is currently no public trading market for Unimin’s securities. It is a condition to the closing of the Merger that the combined company
common stock to be issued to Fairmount Santrol stockholders in connection with the Merger be approved for listing on the NYSE, subject to official
notice of issuance. Unimin has applied to list its shares, which will become the combined company common stock, on the NYSE under a symbol to be
mutually selected by Unimin and Fairmount Santrol.

Delisting and Deregistration of Fairmount Santrol Common Stock

Shares of Fairmount Santrol common stock are currently listed and admitted to trading on the NYSE. When the Merger is completed, Fairmount
Santrol common stock will be delisted from the NYSE and will subsequently be deregistered under the Exchange Act.

Regulatory Approvals Required for the Merger

U.S. Antitrust

Under the HSR Act, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder by the FTC, the Merger cannot close until, among other things,
notifications have been filed and certain information has been furnished to the FTC and the Antitrust Division and specified waiting period requirements
have been satisfied. On January 5, 2018 and January 10, 2018, Fairmount Santrol and Unimin each, respectively, filed the HSR Notification with the
FTC and the Antitrust Division. On March 13, 2018, the FTC granted early termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act with respect to the
Merger, effective as of March 13, 2018.

Other Regulatory Approvals

The obligations of each of Unimin and Fairmount Santrol to effect the Merger is also subject to obtaining regulatory approval in Mexico. On
March 16, 2018, Fairmount Santrol and Unimin submitted an application for Mexican Antitrust Commission (Comisión Federal de Competencia
Económica) approval for the Merger and the parties are in the process of obtaining the necessary regulatory clearances in Mexico.

Each of the parties to the Merger Agreement has agreed to use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or
cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with each other in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, as
soon as possible following

Table of Contents

December 11, 2017, the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, including using reasonable best efforts in:
(1) causing all of the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement to be satisfied; (2) obtaining all necessary actions or non-actions, waivers, consents
and approvals from governmental entities, including under antitrust laws prior to the effective time; and (3) obtaining all consents, registrations,
approvals, permits, authorizations and waivers necessary, proper or advisable to be obtained from, or renewed with, third parties.

Each of the parties to the Merger Agreement has agreed to use “reasonable best efforts” to cause the expiration or termination of any applicable
waiting periods under the antitrust laws and the receipt, as soon as practicable, of all necessary actions or non-actions, waivers, consents and approvals
from antitrust and other governmental entities. For purposes of the Merger Agreement, each of the parties to the Merger Agreement agreed that
“reasonable best efforts” include proposing, negotiating, committing to and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, the sale,
divestiture, licensing, testing, zoning, recharacterizing, expanding other development of or disposition of such assets, businesses, relationships,
contractual rights or arrangements of Fairmount Santrol, Sibelco, Unimin or their respective subsidiaries or affiliates as may be required in order to
avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining order or other order in any suit or proceeding that would
otherwise have the effect of preventing or materially delaying the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements; provided, however, that the effectiveness of any such sale, divestiture, licensing or disposition shall be conditioned upon the
closing of the Merger. In addition, under the Merger Agreement, each of Sibelco, Unimin and Fairmount Santrol have agreed to use its reasonable best
efforts to defend through litigation on the merits any claim asserted in court by any party in order to avoid entry of, or to have vacated or terminated, any
order of any governmental entity (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that would prevent the closing of the Merger. Notwithstanding any
other provision in the Merger Agreement to the contrary, no provision in the Merger Agreement shall require Fairmount Santrol, Unimin and their
respective subsidiaries or affiliates, collectively, to agree to or effect a Material Divestiture. For purposes of the Merger Agreement, “Material
Divestiture” means the divestiture of one or more plants that, in the aggregate, would result in the loss of more than 3,600,000 tons in annual capacity,
provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, the calculation of any Material Divestiture will not include or be limited by any licensing arrangement relating
to any intellectual property associated with resin coated sand products as may be required by a governmental entity (other than such plants that would
otherwise be captured by this definition absent this proviso).

While Fairmount Santrol and Unimin believe that regulatory clearances will ultimately be obtained, they cannot be certain when or if such
clearances will be obtained, or if the clearances will contain terms, conditions or restrictions that will be detrimental to, or adversely affect, the
combined company after the closing of the Merger.

The Merger Agreement also requires the following conditions to be satisfied prior to the closing of the Merger: (i) a declaration of effectiveness
by the SEC of the registration statement on Form S-4 of which this proxy statement/prospectus forms a part; (ii) approval of the Fairmount Santrol
Merger proposal by Fairmount Santrol stockholders (as of the close of business on the record date); and (iii) authorization for listing of the combined
company common stock on the NYSE (subject to official notice of issuance by the NYSE).

Commercial Arrangements Between Unimin and Sibelco

Distribution Agreements

At the closing of the Merger, the combined company and Sibelco will enter into the Distribution Agreements, pursuant to which the combined
company will be the exclusive distributor in North America and Mexico with respect to certain of Sibelco’s products sold into the tiles and engobes
industry (sodium feldspar chips and shredded/blended ball clay) while Sibelco will be the exclusive distributor throughout the world with respect to
certain of the products of the combined company for the performance coatings and polymer solutions industries (nepheline syenite flour,
microcrystalline silica flour and ground kaolin). As a distributor of the other party’s products, each of the combined company and Sibelco will purchase
the other party’s respective products and resell them in its own name, for its own account, and at its own risk and will not act as an agent, partner or
franchisee of the producer of the products.

Table of Contents

The combined company and Sibelco, as applicable, will grant the other party a non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable right to use its product
trademarks in connection with the marketing and promotion of its products by the other party within the agreed geographic area (North America and
Mexico for Sibelco’s products and throughout the world for the products produced by the combined company).

Each of the combined company and Sibelco is permitted, as the producer of a particular product and in its absolute discretion, to discontinue or to
limit its production or alter the specifications of any product or product line subject to the applicable Distribution Agreement, to terminate or limit
deliveries of any product or product line, the production of which is so discontinued, limited or altered, and to add new and additional products or
product lines (provided that any new products or product lines will first be offered to the party acting as distributor for exclusive resale pursuant to the
terms and conditions of the respective Distribution Agreement).

Agency Agreements

At the closing of the Merger, the combined company and Sibelco will enter into the Agency Agreements, pursuant to which each party will
provide exclusive agency services with respect to certain of the other party’s products sold into defined industries (each referred to as the “Industry”)
and defined geographic areas (the “Agency Areas”). In particular, the combined company will be the exclusive sales agent in North America and
Mexico with respect to Sibelco’s products for the casting steel and HT alloys, display glass, foundry feed amendments, tiles and engobes and welding
(electronics) industries. Sibelco will be the exclusive sales agent in North America and Mexico with respect to the combined company’s products for the
coating and polymers industries and throughout the world with respect to the combined company’s products for the sanitaryware, ceramic ware,
industrial ceramics and feed amendments industries.

As compensation for its services, each agent will receive a commission equal to five percent of the Net Sales of the products generated by the
agent for which the producer received payment from a customer. Net Sales is defined as gross sales of products by the agent in an Agency Area
excluding (i) transportation costs, (ii) replacement costs, (iii) rebates, (iv) warehouse, terminal and handling costs and (v) import and export fees.

When acting as producer, the combined company and Sibelco, as applicable, will grant the agent a non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable
right to use its product trademarks in connection with the marketing and promotion of its products by the agent within an Agency Area.

Non-Compete Agreement

At the closing of the Merger, the combined company and Sibelco will enter into the Non-Compete Agreement, pursuant to which the combined
company and Sibelco will agree to refrain from selling, marketing, distributing or producing certain products within defined markets and territories and
Sibelco will be provided a right of first offer with respect to certain acquisitions and investment opportunities of the combined company. The
Non-Compete Agreement will automatically terminate when Sibelco, together with its controlled affiliates, ceases to own more than 50% of the issued
and outstanding shares of the combined company common stock.

Accounting Treatment

The Merger will be accounted for as a business combination under U.S. GAAP. The purchase price will be equal to the Cash Consideration plus
an amount determined based on the number of shares of combined company common stock issued using the Fairmount Santrol stock price on the date of
the Merger. The purchase price will also include additional consideration related to converted Fairmount Santrol equity awards for amounts attributable
to pre-Merger services. The purchase price will be allocated to the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Any excess purchase price after
this allocation will be assigned to goodwill. Under the acquisition method of accounting, goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at least
annually, or more frequently if circumstances indicate potential impairment. The operating results of Fairmount Santrol will be part of the combined
company beginning on the date of the closing of the Merger.

In connection with the application of acquisition accounting, ASC 805 requires one of the combining entities to be identified as the accounting
acquirer. Unimin will be treated as the acquiring entity for accounting purposes. In identifying Unimin as the acquiring entity for accounting purposes,
Unimin took into account the

Table of Contents

voting rights of all equity instruments, the intended corporate governance structure of the combined company and the size of each of the companies. In
assessing the size of each of the companies, Unimin evaluated various metrics, including, but not limited to, assets, revenue, operating income,
EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and enterprise value. No single factor was the sole determinant in the overall conclusion that Unimin is the acquirer for
accounting purposes, but all factors were considered in arriving at such conclusion.

Litigation Relating to the Merger

The Merger Agreement requires that each party will promptly advise the other party of any litigation or proceeding (including any litigation or
proceeding under or relating to any antitrust law) commenced after December 11, 2017 against such party or any of its directors (in their capacity as
such) by any stockholders of such party (on their own behalf or on behalf of such party) relating to the Merger Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated thereby and will keep the other party reasonably informed regarding any such litigation. Each party will give the other party the
opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any such litigation brought by any stockholders, and no such settlement will be agreed to
without the other party’s prior written consent, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

Restrictions on Sales of Shares of the Combined Company Common Stock Received in the Merger

The shares of combined company common stock to be issued will be freely transferable under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, except for
shares issued to any stockholder who may be deemed to be an “affiliate” of the combined company for purposes of Rule 144 under the Securities Act.
Persons who may be deemed to be affiliates include individuals or entities that control, are controlled by or are under common control with the
combined company and may include the executive officers, directors and significant combined company stockholders. This proxy statement/prospectus
does not cover resales of the combined company common stock received by any person upon the closing of the Merger, and no person is authorized to
make use of this proxy statement/prospectus in connection with any such resale.

In addition, the Stockholders Agreement among the combined company, Sibelco and certain other Fairmount Santrol stockholders to be entered
into at the effective time provides that:
 

 
•  for 45 days beginning at the effective time, Sibelco and any party to the Stockholders Agreement who is also a combined company director

cannot, and to the extent permitted by applicable law must cause their respective controlled affiliates not to, transfer or agree to transfer any
combined company common stock or other shares of capital stock to any person that is not an affiliate of such stockholder;

 

 

•  for three years following the effective time, unless approved by a majority of the Fairmount-nominated independent directors, Sibelco will
not, and will cause its controlled affiliates not to, transfer or agree to transfer any combined company common stock or other shares of
capital stock to any person (other than an affiliate of Sibelco) or group if such person or group would, following such transfer, beneficially
own in excess of (i) 15% of the voting power of the outstanding shares of combined company voting stock or (ii) 50% of the voting power
of the outstanding shares of combined company voting stock, unless such person agrees to make an offer to purchase all shares of combined
company common stock held by all combined company stockholders for the same consideration and on substantially the same terms and
conditions; and

 

 

•  notwithstanding the foregoing, Sibelco can transfer shares of combined company stock at any time (i) to any wholly owned affiliate of
Sibelco who signs a joinder to the Stockholders Agreement, (ii) pursuant to a public offering of shares of combined company common stock
(including pursuant to spin-off or split-off transactions or related actions involving a person holding Sibelco’s interest in the combined
company) or (iii) in connection with a change of control of Sibelco. A change of control of Sibelco means (i) the acquisition by any other
person, directly or indirectly, of record or beneficial ownership of more than 50% of the total voting securities of Sibelco, (ii) the acquisition
by any other person of all or substantially all of the consolidated assets of Sibelco or (iii) the acquisition by any other person of the ability to
vote or direct the voting securities of Sibelco for the election of a majority of Sibelco’s directors.

Certain Governance Matters Following the Merger

Following the Merger, the Combined Company Board will be comprised of 11 directors. Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement,
Fairmount Santrol and Unimin will cooperate and take all actions as are necessary to cause, effective as of the effective time, the Combined Company
Board to be comprised of:
 

 •  the six Unimin-nominated directors;
 

 •  the four Fairmount-nominated directors; and
 

 •  the Chief Executive Officer of the combined company as of the effective time, who will be Jenniffer D. Deckard.

At least three of the Fairmount-nominated directors must qualify as independent directors under NYSE corporate governance rules. If, prior to the
effective time, any individual designated to serve on the Combined Company Board after the effective time is unable or unwilling to so serve, Unimin or
Fairmount Santrol, as applicable, will designate another individual to serve in such individual’s capacity.

Under the terms of the Stockholders Agreement, from the effective time until the day following the third annual meeting of the combined
company stockholders following the effective time, Sibelco and the other combined company stockholders who are parties to the Stockholders
Agreement will vote all voting shares of combined company stock owned by them, and take all other necessary actions within his, her or its control
(including in his, her or its capacity as a stockholder, director, member of a board committee, officer of the combined company or otherwise), and the
combined company and its directors will take all necessary actions within its and their control:
 

 •  to ensure that the number of directors constituting the Combined Company Board is fixed and remains at 11 directors;
 

 
•  prior to the Trigger Date, to nominate and vote to elect the Unimin-nominated directors and the Fairmount-nominated directors as described

above in accordance with the Merger Agreement; and
 

 •  from and after the Trigger Date,
 

 
•  to cause the number of Unimin-nominated directors to be reduced so that the number of Unimin-nominated directors is at all times

equal to the product of (x) Sibelco’s percentage ownership of outstanding shares of combined company common stock and (y) the
total number of directors authorized to serve on the Combined Company Board (rounded down to the nearest whole number); and

 

 •  to nominate and vote to elect as directors:
 

 
•  the number of Unimin-nominated directors calculated as described above (reflecting Sibelco’s percentage ownership of

outstanding shares of combined company common stock);
 

 
•  the number of individuals equal to the difference between six and the number of Unimin-nominated directors, nominated in

accordance with the Stockholders Agreement (including the provisions regarding filling vacancies described below);
 

 •  the Fairmount-nominated directors; and
 

 •  the Chief Executive Officer of the combined company, from time to time.

The “Trigger Date” is defined as the earlier of (i) the close of business on the tenth business day following the date on which Sibelco and its
affiliates no longer beneficially own more than 50% of the outstanding shares of combined company common stock and (ii) the close of business on the
business day following the public announcement by Sibelco that Sibelco has made an election that the Trigger Date has occurred.

For the avoidance of doubt, subject to the provisions in the Stockholders Agreement related to vacancies, at no time prior to the third annual
meeting of combined company stockholders following the effective time may the number of Unimin-nominated directors be more than one more than
half of the total Combined Company Board.

In addition, from the effective time until the third annual meeting date, if a vacancy is created on the Combined Company Board at any time due
to the death, disability, retirement, resignation or removal of a director, then:
 

 
•  if such director is a Unimin-nominated director, the remaining Unimin-nominated directors have the right to designate an individual to fill

such vacancy;
 

 
•  if such director is a Fairmount-nominated director, then the remaining Fairmount-nominated directors have the right to designate an

individual to fill such vacancy;
 

 

•  prior to the Trigger Date, if the vacancy is caused by the death, disability, retirement, resignation or removal of a Fairmount-nominated
director, and the Fairmount-nominated directors do not fill such vacancy for more than 30 days after notice from the combined company of
such failure to fill the vacancy, then the vacant position will be filled by an individual designated by the Unimin-nominated directors then in
office, but any such individual will be removed if the remaining Fairmount-nominated directors so direct and simultaneously designate a
new director; and

 

 

•  if a vacancy is created on the Combined Company Board because of the removal of a Unimin-nominated director due to a decrease in
Sibelco’s percentage ownership of outstanding shares of combined company common stock as described above, then the remaining directors
will have the right to immediately designate a replacement for the removed director to fill such vacancy, provided that any such replacement
must be an independent director.

In addition, from the effective time until the third annual meeting date, if the Chief Executive Officer of the combined company is removed or
resigns as Chief Executive Officer of the combined company pursuant to the terms of such officer’s employment agreement, then such individual will
also be removed as a director, and the successor Chief Executive Officer of the combined company will be appointed to the Combined Company Board
in accordance with the combined company’s certificate of incorporation and the combined company’s bylaws.

From and after the third annual meeting date, the size and composition of the Combined Company Board may be adjusted by the Combined
Company Board in accordance with the combined company’s certificate of incorporation and the combined company’s bylaws, subject to the applicable
NYSE listing rules.

Additional governance related arrangements agreed to by Fairmount Santrol and Unimin are set forth in the Stockholders Agreement and in the
combined company’s certificate of incorporation and the combined company’s bylaws, forms of which to be adopted at the closing of the Merger are
attached as Annex C and Annex D, respectively, to this proxy statement/prospectus that will become effective as of the effective time. See the sections
entitled “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions—Relationship with Sibelco—Stockholders Agreement” and “Description of Combined
Company Capital Stock.”

INTERESTS OF FAIRMOUNT SANTROL’S
DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS IN THE MERGER

Certain of the directors and executive officers of Fairmount Santrol negotiated the terms of the Merger Agreement, the Fairmount Board approved
the Merger Agreement and the Fairmount Board recommended that Fairmount Santrol stockholders vote in favor of the Fairmount Santrol Merger
proposal and each of the other proposals presented herein. Fairmount Santrol directors and executive officers have certain financial interests in the
Merger that may be different from, or in addition to, or in conflict with, those of Fairmount Santrol stockholders generally. These interests include the
treatment in the Merger of Fairmount Santrol equity compensation awards, severance arrangements for the benefit of certain Fairmount Santrol
executive officers, the expectation that some of the directors and executive officers of Fairmount Santrol will serve as directors and executive officers of
the combined company or its subsidiaries following the closing of the Merger, the indemnification of current and former Fairmount Santrol directors and
officers by the combined company and the potential for additional bonuses.

The Fairmount Board was aware of and considered these interests when it (i) approved the Merger Agreement, (ii) determined that entering into
the Merger Agreement and consummating the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger, are advisable, fair to and in
the best interests of Fairmount Santrol and Fairmount Santrol stockholders and authorized the execution, delivery and performance of the Merger
Agreement and (iii) directed that the Merger Agreement be submitted for consideration by Fairmount Santrol stockholders. Fairmount Santrol
stockholders should be aware of these interests when they consider recommendations of the Fairmount Board that they vote in favor of the Fairmount
Santrol Merger proposal, the Fairmount Santrol compensation proposal and the Fairmount Santrol adjournment proposal.

Consideration Payable to Fairmount Santrol Directors and Executive Officers Pursuant to the Merger

For information regarding the Fairmount Santrol directors’ and executive officers’ beneficial ownership of Fairmount Santrol common stock see
“Principal Stockholders of Fairmount Santrol” beginning on page 316. Dispositions of shares of Fairmount Santrol common stock by Fairmount Santrol
directors and executive officers and the exercise, settlement or forfeiture of Fairmount Santrol equity awards, in each case prior to the closing of the
Merger, will change the total amount of the Stock Consideration and the Cash Consideration the Fairmount Santrol directors and executive officers will
receive in respect of their shares of Fairmount Santrol common stock upon the closing of the Merger.

Treatment of Outstanding Fairmount Santrol Equity Compensation Awards

Under the Merger Agreement, Fairmount Santrol equity awards outstanding immediately prior to the effective time, whether vested or unvested,
including awards held by Fairmount Santrol directors and executive officers, will be converted into corresponding equity awards of the combined
company with respect to a number of shares of combined company common stock calculated by multiplying the number of shares of Fairmount Santrol
common stock underlying the award by the Exchange Ratio. For converted stock options, the exercise price of such stock options will be determined by
dividing the per-share exercise price of the Fairmount Santrol Stock Options by the Exchange Ratio.

Stock options granted under the Fairmount Santrol Holdings, Inc. Stock Option Plan have “single trigger” vesting and will vest upon the closing
date of the Merger. All Fairmount Santrol Stock Options granted to the executive officers with “single trigger” vesting have an exercise price equal to or
greater than $5.21. All other Fairmount Santrol equity awards (as converted) have “double trigger” vesting and will become fully vested and exercisable
(as applicable) if the executive officer is terminated without cause or if the executive officer terminates his or her employment for good reason during
the one-year period following the closing of the Merger. Further, all vested converted stock options will remain exercisable for a minimum period of 12
months following the executive officer’s termination of employment at any time and for any reason other than for cause or, if earlier, until the original
expiration date of the Fairmount Santrol Stock Option. The treatment of Fairmount Santrol equity awards outstanding immediately prior to the effective
time is more fully described in “The Merger Agreement—Treatment of Fairmount Santrol Equity Awards” beginning on page 188.

(1) Amounts shown in this column represent shares underlying Fairmount Santrol PSU awards granted to the directors and
executive officers of Fairmount Santrol as of April 2, 2018. For each such Fairmount Santrol PSU award, the amounts
included in this column represent 100% of the target number of shares for 2016 Fairmount Santrol PSU awards granted and
133% of the target number of shares for 2017 Fairmount Santrol PSU awards.

Equity Grants During the Interim Period Prior to Completion of the Merger

Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Fairmount Santrol may grant additional equity awards to employees of Fairmount Santrol during the interim
period prior to the effective time, including the executive officers of Fairmount Santrol, in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice.
The equity awards that may be granted to executive officers of Fairmount Santrol during the interim period will be made in the form of time-vested
Fairmount Santrol RSU awards. Each such Fairmount Santrol RSU Award will provide for full and immediate vesting if the executive officer’s
employment is terminated without Cause or by the executive officer for Good Reason (as each term is defined in the Merger Agreement) during the one
year period beginning on the closing of the Merger and ending on the first anniversary of the closing date of the Merger. Additionally, Fairmount Santrol
may grant shares of Fairmount Santrol common stock (which may be deferred) to directors of Fairmount Santrol during the interim period in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice.

Potential Bonus and Enhanced Severance Awards During the Interim Period

Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Fairmount Santrol may grant additional bonuses and enhanced severance awards to employees of Fairmount
Santrol (including its executive officers) during the interim period in amounts (if any) to be determined prior to the effective time.

Severance Arrangements

Fairmount Santrol sponsors the Executive Change in Control Severance Plan (the “CIC Plan”) for the benefit of nine executive officers, which
generally provides a severance payment equal to two times (or three times in the case of Fairmount Santrol’s President and Chief Executive Officer) a
participant’s base salary and annual bonus target, a prorated annual bonus based on target level achievement, and a lump sum payment equal to 18
months of projected premiums required to receive extended health care coverage under COBRA if Fairmount Santrol (or its successor) terminates a
participant’s employment without Cause, or the participant terminates his or her employment for Good Reason, within 60 days prior to, and two years
following a Change in Control (as such terms are defined therein) of Fairmount Santrol. The CIC Plan includes additional provisions for Mark Barrus,
whose current title is Vice President and Treasurer. If Mr. Barrus continues to serve Fairmount Santrol and support the potential Change in Control, he
will receive 55% of his then-current base salary or 55% of his salary as of the date of his addition to the CIC Plan (whichever is greater), upon the
completion of the Change in Control, or if earlier, September 30, 2018. Additionally, in lieu of the severance payment based on a multiple of base salary
and target bonus, upon his termination without Cause or resignation for Good Reason, Mr. Barrus will receive a lump sum payment under the CIC Plan
equal to 52 weeks of his then-current salary. Mr. Barrus will only be eligible for severance benefits under the CIC Plan if the Change in Control occurs
on or prior to September 30, 2018 and Mr. Barrus experiences a termination without Cause or resigns for Good Reason 60 days prior to or within 12
months following the Change in Control. Thereafter, if Mr. Barrus experiences a termination without Cause or resigns for Good Reason under
Fairmount Santrol’s Salaried Severance Plan (the “Salaried Severance Plan”) (as such terms are defined in such plan), he will be entitled to continued
salary payments for 52 weeks in accordance with normal payroll practices, a prorated bonus payment for the year in which he experiences a qualifying
termination, continued participation in Fairmount Santrol’s health and dental insurance plans for 52 weeks at the employee premium rates and one year
of outplacement services. Executive officers must execute a release of claims and non-competition and non-solicitation agreement in favor of Fairmount
Santrol in order to be eligible for benefits under the CIC Plan and Salaried Severance Plan. The closing of the Merger will constitute a Change in
Control for purposes of the CIC Plan and Salaried Severance Plan. If any excise taxes would be triggered under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue
Code and any related taxes and penalties, then the change in control payments to the executive officers will be reduced by the amount

needed to avoid triggering the excise tax if such reduction will put the executive officer in a better after-tax position than the executive officer’s after-tax
position would be before applying such reduction.

Fairmount Santrol entered into a severance agreement with Mr. Biehl, its Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, on May 6, 2016.
Under the terms of the severance agreement, if Mr. Biehl’s employment is terminated without Cause or he terminates employment for Good Reason (as
each term is defined therein), Mr. Biehl will receive (i) 18 months of pay in equal monthly installments following termination, based upon Mr. Biehl’s
highest annualized base salary for the 12 months immediately preceding such termination, (ii) a prorated bonus for the year in which such termination
occurs (which shall be a minimum of 25% of Mr. Biehl’s annual base salary) and (iii) reimbursement for up to 18 months of premiums for health
continuation coverage under COBRA, in each case, subject to his execution of a release of claims in favor of Fairmount Santrol, as well as continued
compliance under any non-competition, non-solicitation or nondisclosure agreement he has with Fairmount Santrol. Any benefit that Mr. Biehl would
receive under the CIC Plan would be reduced by the amount Mr. Biehl receives under this severance agreement.

The following table sets forth the cash severance payments and estimated value of the welfare benefits that each executive officer would receive
under the applicable severance plan or agreement, in each case, assuming a qualifying termination of employment pursuant to the applicable severance
plan or agreement immediately following the closing of the Merger and assuming the Merger is consummated on April 2, 2018.

would be entitled to receive under the CIC Plan (and pursuant to Mr. Biehl’s severance agreement) and the “single trigger” cash retention
bonus payable to Mr. Barrus under the CIC Plan, based on the assumptions described above. The cash severance and bonus payments will be
paid upon a qualifying termination within the period that is 60 days prior to and 2 years following (for Mr. Barrus, 1 year following and only
if a change in control occurs on or prior to September 30, 2018) a change in control. If Mr. Biehl’s employment is terminated after the two
year period following the closing of the Merger, he will continue to be eligible for severance benefits under his severance agreement, and if
Mr. Barrus’s employment is terminated after the one year period following the closing of the Merger, or if the Merger is consummated after
September 30, 2018, he will be eligible for severance benefits under the Salaried Severance Plan instead of the CIC Plan. Mr. Barrus will be
entitled to receive his cash retention bonus under the CIC Plan on the earlier of September 30, 2018 or upon the closing of the Merger if he
continues to serve Fairmount Santrol and support the Merger through such date.

 

(2) Amounts shown in this column reflect the cost of providing 18 months of premiums for health continuation coverage under COBRA
pursuant to the CIC Plan and Mr. Biehl’s severance agreement based on the assumptions described above. These amounts are “double-
trigger” benefits that will be paid upon a qualifying termination of employment within the period of 60 days prior to and 2 years following
(for Mr. Barrus, 1 year following and only if a change in control occurs on or prior to September 30, 2018) a change in control. If Mr.
Biehl’s employment is terminated after the two year period following the closing of the Merger, he will continue to be eligible for the same
welfare benefits under the terms of his severance agreement. If the Merger is consummated after September 30, 2018, Mr. Barrus will be
eligible for benefits under the Salaried Severance Plan instead of the CIC Plan.

Payout of Deferred Compensation Amounts Upon the Closing of the Merger

Pursuant to the terms of the FMSA Holdings Inc. Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan, upon a Change in Control (as defined therein),
Fairmount Santrol directors who have deferred Fairmount Santrol RSU awards will receive a payout of such awards on the date of the closing of the

not participate in the FMSA Holdings Inc. Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan.

The following table sets forth the estimated amount each such Fairmount Santrol director will receive under the FMSA Holdings Inc.
Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan in respect of such director’s deferred Fairmount Santrol RSU awards assuming a price per share of

The Merger Agreement also requires Merger Sub LLC, as the surviving company in the Second Merger, for a period of six years following the
effective time, to either cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance
maintained by Fairmount Santrol or any of its subsidiaries or provide substitute policies for not less than the existing coverage and having other terms
not less favorable to the insured persons with respect to claims arising from facts or events occurring at or before the effective time, except that in no
event will the combined company or Merger Sub LLC as the surviving company in the Second Merger be required to pay with respect to such insurance
policies (or substitute insurance policies) of Fairmount Santrol in respect of any one policy year more than 300% of the annual premium payable by
Fairmount Santrol for such insurance for the prior 12 months (referred to as the “maximum amount”). If the combined company or Fairmount Santrol as
the surviving corporation of the Merger is unable to obtain the required insurance, it must obtain as much comparable insurance as possible for the years
within such six-year period for an annual premium equal to the maximum amount in respect of each policy year within such period. In lieu of the
foregoing, Fairmount Santrol may obtain at or prior to the effective time a six-year “tail” policy under its existing directors’ and officers’ insurance
policy providing equivalent coverage to that described above for a cost, on an annual basis, not to exceed the maximum amount.

MATERIAL UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX
CONSEQUENCES OF THE TRANSACTION

The following discussion constitutes the opinion of Freshfields and Jones Day, subject to the assumptions, qualifications and limitations set forth
below and in the tax opinions of each, which have been filed as Exhibits 8.1 and 8.2, respectively, to the registration statement of which this joint proxy
statement/prospectus is a part, as to certain material U.S. federal income tax considerations under present law with respect to the exchange of Fairmount
Santrol common stock for the Merger Consideration pursuant to the Merger and the ownership and disposition of combined company common stock.
This summary deals only with U.S. holders and non-U.S. holders (each as defined below) exchanging Fairmount Santrol common stock in the Merger
that use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency, hold their Fairmount Santrol common stock as a capital asset and will hold its combined company
common stock as a capital asset. This summary does not address tax considerations applicable to investors subject to special rules, such as persons that
will own immediately after the execution of the Mergers (directly, indirectly or constructively) 10% or more by vote or value of the combined company
equity interests, certain financial institutions, dealers or traders, insurance companies, tax exempt entities, pension funds, individual retirement or other
tax-deferred accounts, real estate investment trusts, regulated investment companies, expatriates, foreign governments, partnerships and other pass
through entities (and partners or other investors in partnerships or other pass through entities), persons holding their shares as part of a hedge, straddle,
conversion, constructive sale or other integrated transaction or persons who acquired Fairmount Santrol common stock pursuant to the exercise of
options or otherwise as compensation. This summary also does not address any U.S. state and local tax or non-U.S. tax considerations.

As used herein, “U.S. holder” means a beneficial owner of Fairmount Santrol common stock and, after the exchange of Fairmount Santrol
common stock for the Merger Consideration pursuant to the Merger, a beneficial owner of combined company common stock that is, for U.S. federal
income tax purposes, (i) an individual citizen or resident of the United States, (ii) a corporation created or organized under the laws of the United States,
any State thereof or the District of Columbia, (iii) a trust that (a) is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States if one or more
U.S. persons have the authority to control all of its substantial decisions or (b) has a valid election in effect under applicable Treasury regulations to be
treated as a U.S. person or (iv) an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income tax without regard to its source. For purposes of this
discussion, a “non-U.S. holder” is a beneficial owner of Fairmount Santrol common stock and, after the exchange of Fairmount Santrol common stock
pursuant to the Merger, combined company common stock that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, an individual, a corporation, a trust or an estate
that is not a U.S. holder.

The tax consequences to a partnership or other entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes (and of partners or other
investors in a partnership or other entity treated as a partnership) exchanging its Fairmount Santrol common stock for the Merger Consideration, or
holding or disposing of combined company common stock, generally will depend on the status of the partnership and the activities of its partners.
Partnerships (and partners or other investors in partnerships) holding Fairmount Santrol common stock should consult their own tax advisers about the
U.S. federal income tax consequences to their partners from participating in the Merger and acquiring, owning and disposing of combined company
common stock.

U.S. Federal Income Taxation of the Mergers

The Mergers

Unimin and Fairmount Santrol intend that the Mergers, taken together as an integrated transaction, will qualify as a “reorganization” within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. The obligation of Fairmount Santrol to complete the Merger is conditioned upon the receipt of an opinion from
Jones Day, counsel to Fairmount Santrol, or another independent tax advisor of national reputation to the effect that the Mergers, taken together as an
integrated transaction, will qualify as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code (the “Closing Condition Tax Opinion”). This
opinion will be based on assumptions, representations and warranties, including those contained in the Merger Agreement and in tax representation
letters provided at the effective time by Unimin (on behalf of itself, Merger Sub and Merger Sub LLC) and Fairmount Santrol. The accuracy of such
assumptions, representations and warranties could affect the conclusions set forth in such opinion and this opinion is not binding on the IRS or the
courts, and neither Unimin nor Fairmount Santrol intends to obtain a ruling from the IRS with respect

to the tax consequences of the Mergers. Additionally, the opinion of counsel and the discussion below do not address any U.S. state or local or non-U.S.
tax consequences of the Mergers. Fairmount Santrol has the ability to waive the receipt of the Closing Condition Tax Opinion as a condition to complete
the Merger. Fairmount Santrol does not currently intend to waive the receipt of the Closing Condition Tax Opinion as a condition to complete the
Merger, but if Fairmount Santrol does waive the receipt of the Closing Condition Tax Opinion as a condition to complete the Merger after the
registration statement of which this proxy statement/prospectus forms a part is declared effective by the SEC, and if the tax consequences of the Mergers
to Fairmount Santrol stockholders have materially changed, Fairmount Santrol will recirculate appropriate soliciting materials to resolicit the votes of
the Fairmount Santrol stockholders.

If the Mergers do not qualify as a reorganization, a U.S. holder will be required to recognize gain or loss on its exchange of Fairmount Santrol
common stock for the Merger Consideration, and a non-U.S. holder generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on its exchange of
Fairmount Santrol common stock for the Merger Consideration unless:
 

 

(i) the gain (if any) is effectively connected with such non-U.S. holder’s conduct of a U.S. trade or business (and, where a tax treaty applies, is
attributable to the non-U.S. holder’s U.S. permanent establishment or fixed base), in which case such gain will be taxed on a net income
basis (and, if such non-U.S. holder is a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, potentially an additional “branch profits tax” at a
30% rate or such lower rate as specified by an applicable income tax treaty);

 

 

(ii) such non-U.S. holder is an individual present in the United States for at least 183 days during the taxable year that includes the effective
time and certain other conditions are met, in which case such non-U.S. holder will generally be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a rate of
30% on the amount by which such non-U.S. holder’s capital gains allocable to U.S. sources, including gain from the disposition pursuant to
the Merger, exceed any capital losses allocable to U.S. sources, except as otherwise required by an applicable income tax treaty; or

 

 
(iii) Fairmount Santrol is as of the effective time, or has been at any time during the Merger Testing Period (as defined herein) a USRPHC, in

which case such non-U.S. holder will be subject to the FIRPTA Tax if such non-U.S. holder is a Significant Shareholder (as defined herein).

With respect to clause (iii), it is possible that Fairmount Santrol may have been a USRPHC at one or more times during the prior five years.

The remainder of this discussion assumes that the Mergers will be treated as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders of the Mergers

A U.S. holder that exchanges its shares of Fairmount Santrol common stock for a combination of shares of the combined company common stock
and cash (including cash received in lieu of fractional shares, if any) in the Merger will generally recognize gain (but not loss) in an amount equal to the
lesser of: (i) the amount of cash (including cash received in lieu of fractional shares, if any) received by such holder in exchange for its shares of
Fairmount Santrol common stock in the Merger; and (ii) the excess, if any, of (a) the sum of the amount of cash (including cash received in lieu of
fractional shares, if any) plus the fair market value of the shares of the combined company common stock at the effective time received by such holder
in exchange for its shares of Fairmount Santrol common stock in the Merger, over (b) such holder’s tax basis in its shares of Fairmount Santrol common
stock exchanged. A U.S. holder’s tax basis in its shares of Fairmount Santrol common stock will generally be equal to the amount paid for such stock.

Any recognized gain will generally be capital gain. Any capital gain will be long-term capital gain if, as of the effective time, the U.S. holder’s
holding period with respect to the surrendered shares of Fairmount Santrol common stock exceeds one year. A non-corporate U.S. holder’s long-term
capital gain may be taxed at lower rates. Losses will not be permitted to be recognizd. Realized gain or loss must be calculated separately for each
identifiable block of shares (i.e. shares acquired at different times and prices) exchanged in the Merger, and a loss realized in the exchange of one block
cannot be used to offset a gain recognized on the exchange of another block. Any gain recognized by a non-corporate U.S. holder may be subject to a
3.8% Medicare tax on net investment income.

Table of Contents

The aggregate tax basis of the shares of the combined company common stock a U.S. holder receives as a result of the Merger will be the same as
such holder’s aggregate tax basis in its shares of Fairmount Santrol common stock surrendered in the Merger, decreased by the amount of cash
(including cash received in lieu of fractional shares, if any) such holder receives and increased by the amount of gain, if any, such holder recognizes in
the Merger. The holding period of the shares of the combined company common stock received by a U.S. holder in the Merger will include such
holder’s holding period of the shares of Fairmount Santrol common stock surrendered in the Merger.

Tax Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders of the Mergers

A non-U.S. holder that exchanges its shares of Fairmount Santrol common stock for a combination of shares of combined company common stock
and cash (including cash received in lieu of fractional shares, if any) in the Merger will recognize gain (but not loss) on the exchange in the same
manner as set forth above for U.S. holders in “Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders of the Mergers,” but, subject to the discussion below in “FIRPTA Tax
in Respect of the Mergers,” such non-U.S. holder generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on any gain recognized on the exchange
unless:
 

 

(i) the gain (if any) is effectively connected with such non-U.S. holder’s conduct of a U.S. trade or business (and, where a tax treaty applies, is
attributable to the holder’s U.S. permanent establishment or fixed base), in which case such gain will be taxed on a net income basis (and, if
such non-U.S. holder is a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, potentially an additional “branch profits tax” at a 30% rate or
such lower rate as specified by an applicable income tax treaty); or

 

 

(ii) such non-U.S. holder is an individual present in the United States for at least 183 days during the taxable year of disposition and certain
other conditions are met, in which case such non-U.S. holder will generally be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a rate of 30% on the
amount by which such non-U.S. holder’s capital gains allocable to U.S. sources, including gain from the disposition pursuant to the Merger,
exceed any capital losses allocable to U.S. sources, except as otherwise required by an applicable income tax treaty.

FIRPTA Tax in Respect of the Mergers

A non-U.S. holder that is not a Significant Shareholder (as defined herein) should not be subject to the FIRPTA Tax. A non-U.S. holder that is a
Significant Shareholder and that receives shares of combined company common stock in the Merger will be subject to U.S. federal net income tax under
Section 897 of the Code (the “FIRPTA Tax”) on any gain realized if (i) Fairmount Santrol is or has been a USRPHC at any time during the Merger
Testing Period (as defined herein) and (ii) any of the following conditions are met:
 

 •  the combined company is not a USRPHC immediately after the Mergers;
 

 
•  the Significant Shareholder does not own, actually or constructively, more than 5% of the combined company common stock immediately

after the Mergers; or
 

 •  certain U.S. federal income tax filing requirements are not satisfied by the Significant Shareholder.

This discussion assumes that: (i) Fairmount Santrol common stock is “regularly traded” (within the meaning of Section 897 of the Code) on the
NYSE at all times during the year in which the Mergers occur; and (ii) the combined company common stock received in the Merger will be “regularly
traded” (within the meaning of Section 897 of the Code) on the NYSE following the effective time.

A corporation generally is characterized as a USRPHC if the fair market value of the “United States real property interests” (“USRPIs”) owned by
the corporation and certain of its subsidiaries equals or exceeds 50% of the sum of the fair market value of (i) the USRPIs owned by the corporation and
certain of its subsidiaries, (ii) interests in real property located outside of the United States owned by the corporation and certain of its subsidiaries and
(iii) other assets used or held for use by the corporation and certain of its subsidiaries in a trade or business. USRPIs include any interest (other than an
interest solely as a creditor) in real property located in the United States or the Virgin Islands and in another USRPHC. Real property generally includes
land and unsevered natural products of the land, improvements on land and personal property associated with the use of real property within the
meaning of applicable Treasury regulations. It is possible that Fairmount Santrol may have been a

USRPHC at one or more times during the prior five years. Unimin believes that there is a significant risk that the combined company will be a USRPHC
immediately after the Merger, and this discussion assumes that the combined company will be a USRPHC immediately after the Merger.

As used herein, “Merger Testing Period” means, with respect to a non-U.S. holder, the shorter of (i) the five-year period immediately preceding
the effective time and (ii) the period during which the non-U.S. holder held its Fairmount Santrol common stock, and “Significant Shareholder” means a
non-U.S. holder that has owned, actually or constructively, more than 5% of Fairmount Santrol common stock at any time during the Merger Testing
Period.

The amount of gain recognized by a Significant Shareholder that is subject to the FIRPTA Tax will equal the excess of (i) the sum of the amount
of cash (including cash received in lieu of fractional shares, if any) plus the fair market value of the combined company common stock at the effective
time received by such non-U.S. holder in exchange for its shares of Fairmount Santrol common stock in the Merger over (ii) such non-U.S. holder’s tax
basis in the Fairmount Santrol common stock exchanged therefor. Loss generally may not be recognized by a Significant Shareholder in connection with
the Merger. If the FIRPTA Tax applies to a non-U.S. holder that is treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, an additional “branch
profits tax” at a 30% rate or such lower rate as specified by an applicable income tax treaty may apply.

A Significant Shareholder subject to the FIRPTA Tax will be required to file a U.S. federal income tax return with the IRS. In the case of a
Significant Shareholder that is subject to the FIRPTA Tax, such holder’s aggregate tax basis in the combined company common stock received in the
Merger will generally equal such combined company common stock’s fair market value at the time of receipt, and such holder’s holding period in the
combined company common stock received in the Merger will begin the day after the effective time.

Non-U.S. holders are urged to consult their tax advisors to determine the possible application of the FIRPTA Tax and other potential U.S. federal
income tax consequences of the Merger.

Tax Reporting with respect to the Mergers

In general, each U.S. holder of Fairmount Santrol common stock who receives shares of combined company common stock in the Merger will be
required to retain records pertaining to the Merger pursuant to applicable Treasury regulations. In addition, each U.S. holder of Fairmount Santrol
common stock that receives combined company common stock in the Merger and that owned immediately before the Merger (i) 5% or more by vote or
value of the Fairmount Santrol common stock or (ii) Fairmount Santrol securities with a tax basis of $1,000,000 or more will be required to file a
statement with such U.S. holder’s U.S. federal income tax return setting forth such U.S. holder’s tax basis in the shares of Fairmount Santrol common
stock surrendered in the Merger, the fair market value of the shares of Fairmount Santrol common stock surrendered in the Merger, the date of the
Merger and the name and employer identification number of the combined company and Fairmount Santrol will be required to retain permanent records
of this information.

Exchange of Fairmount Santrol Common Stock Solely for Cash Pursuant to Stockholder Appraisal Rights under Delaware Law

U.S. holders. A U.S. holder that properly exercises its appraisal rights under Section 262 and surrenders all of its shares of Fairmount Santrol
common stock solely in exchange for cash generally will recognize capital gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount of cash received by
such U.S. holder and the U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Fairmount Santrol common stock exchanged therefor. Any gain or loss on a sale or other
disposition of Fairmount Santrol common stock solely in exchange for cash generally will be long-term capital gain or loss if the holder has held the
shares of Fairmount Santrol common stock for more than one year. Long-term capital gains of non-corporate taxpayers are generally eligible for
preferential rates of taxation. Deductions for capital losses are subject to limitations. Any gain recognized by a non-corporate U.S. holder may be subject
to a 3.8% Medicare tax on net investment income.

Table of Contents

Non-U.S. holders. A non-U.S. holder who properly exercises its appraisal rights under Section 262 and surrenders all of its shares of Fairmount
Santrol common stock solely in exchange for cash generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on its exchange of Fairmount Santrol
common stock for cash unless:
 

 

(i) the gain (if any) is effectively connected with such non-U.S. holder’s conduct of a U.S. trade or business (and, where a tax treaty applies, is
attributable to the non-U.S. holder’s U.S. permanent establishment or fixed base), in which case such gain will be taxed on a net income
basis (and, if such non-U.S. holder is a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, potentially an additional “branch profits tax” at a
30% rate or such lower rate as specified by an applicable income tax treaty);

 

 

(ii) such non-U.S. holder is an individual present in the United States for at least 183 days during the taxable year that includes the effective
time and certain other conditions are met, in which case such non-U.S. holder will generally be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a rate of
30% on the amount by which such non-U.S. holder’s capital gains allocable to U.S. sources, including gain from the disposition pursuant to
the Merger, exceed any capital losses allocable to U.S. sources, except as otherwise required by an applicable income tax treaty; or

 

 
(iii) Fairmount Santrol is as of the effective time, or has been at any time during the Merger Testing Period, a USRPHC, in which case such

non-U.S. holder will be subject to the FIRPTA Tax if such non-U.S. holder is a Significant Shareholder.

With respect to clause (iii), it is possible that Fairmount Santrol may have been a USRPHC at one or more times during the prior five years.

U.S. Federal Income Taxation of Holding Combined Company Common Stock

Taxation to U.S. Holders

Dividends

Distributions paid by the combined company out of its current or accumulated earnings and profits (as determined for U.S. federal income tax
purposes) generally will be taxable to a U.S. holder as ordinary dividend income. Corporate U.S. holders should generally be eligible for the dividends
received deduction and non-corporate U.S. holders should generally qualify for reduced rates applicable to qualified dividend income, assuming, in each
case, that a minimum holding period and certain other generally applicable requirements are satisfied. Distributions in excess of current and
accumulated earnings and profits will be treated as a non-taxable return of capital to the extent of the U.S. holder’s tax basis in shares of the combined
company common stock and thereafter as capital gain. U.S. holders should consult their own tax advisors with respect to the appropriate U.S. federal
income tax treatment of any distribution received from the combined company. Dividends received by a non-corporate U.S. holder may be subject to a
3.8% Medicare tax on net investment income.

Sales or other dispositions of combined company common stock

A U.S. holder generally will recognize capital gain or loss on the sale or other disposition of combined company common stock in an amount
equal to the difference between the amount realized from the disposition and the U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in its combined company common
stock. Any gain or loss on a sale or other disposition of combined company common stock generally will be treated as arising from U.S. sources and
will be long-term capital gain or loss if the holder has held the shares of combined company common stock for more than one year. Long-term capital
gains of non-corporate taxpayers are generally eligible for preferential rates of taxation. Deductions for capital losses are subject to limitations. Any gain
recognized by a non-corporate U.S. holder may be subject to a 3.8% Medicare tax on net investment income.

Taxation to Non-U.S. Holders

Dividends

Distributions on combined company common stock that are characterized as “dividends” (as determined under “Taxation to U.S. Holders—
Dividends”) paid to a non-U.S. holder generally will be subject to withholding
 

182



9/26/2019 DEFM14A

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1010858/000119312518134923/d493258ddefm14a.htm 198/315

Table of Contents

of U.S. federal income tax at 30% or such lower rate as may be provided by an applicable income tax treaty. To receive the benefit of a reduced treaty
rate, a non-U.S. holder must furnish to the combined company or its paying agent a properly completed and executed IRS Form W-8 (or applicable
successor form) certifying such holder’s qualification for the reduced rate. This certification must be provided to the combined company or its paying
agent prior to the payment of dividends and must be updated periodically. A non-U.S. holder who qualifies for a reduced treaty rate but does not timely
provide the combined company or the payment agent with the required certification, may be entitled to a credit against their U.S. federal income tax
liability or a refund of the tax withheld, which the non-U.S. holder may claim by filing the appropriate claim form refund with the IRS.

Dividends that are treated as “effectively connected” with a trade or business conducted by a non-U.S. holder within the United States (and, if an
applicable income tax treaty so provides, are also attributable to a U.S. permanent establishment or fixed base of such non-U.S. holder) are not subject to
the withholding tax, provided the non-U.S. holder satisfies certain certification and disclosure requirements (e.g., by providing the combined company
or its paying agent with a properly completed and executed IRS Form W-8ECI (or applicable successor form)). Instead, such dividends, net of specified
deductions and credits, are taxed at the same graduated U.S. federal income tax rates applicable to U.S. persons. To the extent a dividend is effectively
connected with a U.S. trade or business, non-corporate non-U.S. holders may be eligible for taxation at reduced U.S. federal tax rates applicable to
qualified dividend income. Any such effectively connected dividends received by a non-U.S. holder that is a corporation may, under certain
circumstances, be subject to an additional “branch profits tax” at a 30% rate or such lower rate as specified by an applicable income tax treaty.

Sales or other dispositions of the combined company common stock

Subject to the discussions under “—Backup Withholding and Information Reporting,” “—FATCA” and “—The FIRPTA Tax in respect of
combined company common stock” below, a non-U.S. holder will generally not be subject to any U.S. federal income tax or withholding tax on any
gain realized upon such holder’s sale or other disposition of combined company common stock. Gain on the sale of combined company common stock
may be subject to U.S. net income tax if the gain is effectively connected with a trade or business of such non-U.S. holder in the U.S. (and, if required
by an applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to a permanent establishment or fixed base of such non-U.S. holder within the U.S.). Additionally, a
non-U.S. holder that is an individual who is present in the U.S. for 183 days or more in the taxable year of the disposition and meets certain other
requirements will be subject to a flat 30% tax on the amount of gain derived from the sale that, together with certain other U.S. source capital gains
realized during such year, exceed certain U.S. source capital losses realized during such year.

FIRPTA Tax in respect of combined company common stock

Unimin believes that there is a significant risk that the combined company will be a USRPHC immediately after the Mergers. Accordingly, for so
long as the shares of combined company common stock are considered regularly traded on an established securities market, a non-U.S. holder generally
would not be subject to a FIRPTA Tax on a sale or other disposition of combined company stock unless such non-U.S. holder were to actually or
constructively own more than 5% of the combined company common stock during the Combined Company Testing Period. The “Combined Company
Testing Period” is the shorter of (i) the period during which the non-U.S. Holder held its shares of combined company common stock and (ii) the five-
year period ending on the disposition date. In addition, if the shares of combined company common stock cease to be considered regularly traded on an
established securities market, all non-U.S. holders will potentially be subject to the FIRPTA Tax on a sale or disposition of combined company common
stock if the combined company was considered a USRPHC during the Combined Company Testing Period.

If the FIRPTA tax applies to a non-U.S. holder’s sale or disposition of combined company common stock, such non-U.S. holder will generally be
taxable in the same manner as if it were a U.S. holder. Non-U.S. holders that are considered corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes may also
be subject to an additional “branch profits tax” at a 30% rate or such lower rate as specified by an applicable income tax treaty. A non-U.S. holder that is
subject to the FIRPTA Tax will be required to file a U.S. federal income tax return with the IRS.

Table of Contents

An exemption from the FIRPTA Tax or a reduced tax rate may be available under certain U.S. income tax treaties.

Non-U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the combined company’s potential status as a USRPHC and the tax considerations
relevant to them of selling or disposing of combined company common stock.

FATCA

Certain sections of the Code, which are commonly known as “FATCA,” impose a 30% withholding tax on certain types of payments (including
dividends on shares of combined company common stock) made to “foreign financial institutions” and certain other non-U.S. entities unless (i) the
foreign financial institution undertakes certain diligence and reporting obligations or (ii) the foreign non-financial entity either certifies it does not have
any substantial U.S. owners or furnishes identifying information regarding each substantial U.S. owner. If any payee, whether or not it is a beneficial
owner or an intermediary with respect to a payment, is a foreign financial institution that is not subject to special treatment under certain
intergovernmental agreements, it must enter into an agreement with the U.S. Treasury requiring, among other things, that it undertakes to identify
accounts held by certain U.S. persons or U.S.-owned foreign entities, annually report certain information about such accounts and withhold 30% on
payments to account holders whose actions prevent them from complying with these reporting or other requirements. Withholding under this legislation
on withholdable payments to foreign financial institutions and certain non-financial foreign entities will also apply after December 31, 2018 with respect
to the gross proceeds of a disposition of combined company common stock (which will include sales, redemptions and returns on capital). Failure by a
non-U.S. holder (or any intermediary through which it will hold its shares of combined company common stock) that is subject to FATCA to comply
with its certification and reporting requirements, or properly document its status as a person not subject to FATCA withholding, could result in
withholding at a rate of 30% on withholdable payments made to the non-U.S. holder. Foreign financial institutions located in jurisdictions that have an
intergovernmental agreement with the U.S. governing FATCA are generally subject to different rules that eliminate withholding in most cases. More
than 100 foreign jurisdictions have such an intergovernmental agreement with the U.S. Prospective investors should consult their tax advisors regarding
the FATCA legislation and any intergovernmental agreements that apply.

Backup Withholding and Information Reporting

In general, information reporting requirements may apply to the cash payments made to U.S. holders and non-U.S. holders in connection with the
Merger and in respect of shares of combined company common stock, unless an exemption applies. Backup withholding tax may apply to amounts
subject to reporting if the U.S. holder or non-U.S. holder fails to provide an accurate taxpayer identification number or fails to report all interest and
dividends required to be shown on its U.S. federal income tax returns. U.S. holders and non-U.S. holders can claim a credit against their U.S. federal
income tax liability for the amount of any backup withholding tax and a refund of any excess, provided that all required information is timely provided
to the IRS. U.S. holders and non-U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors as to their qualification for exemption from backup withholding and the
procedure for establishing an exemption.

THE DISCUSSION ABOVE IS A GENERAL SUMMARY. IT DOES NOT COVER ALL TAX MATTERS THAT MAY BE OF
IMPORTANCE TO A PARTICULAR HOLDER. EACH HOLDER IS URGED TO CONSULT ITS OWN TAX ADVISOR ABOUT THE TAX
CONSEQUENCES TO IT OF THE MERGER AND OF HOLDING COMBINED COMPANY COMMON STOCK IN LIGHT OF THE
INVESTOR’S OWN CIRCUMSTANCES.

THE MERGER AGREEMENT

The following discussion summarizes the material provisions of the Merger Agreement. This summary does not purport to be complete and may
not contain all of the information about the Merger Agreement that is important to you. The rights and obligations of the parties are governed by the
express terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement and not by this summary or any other information contained in this proxy statement/prospectus.
Fairmount Santrol stockholders are urged to read the Merger Agreement carefully and in its entirety, as well as this proxy statement/prospectus, before
making any voting decisions. This summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Merger Agreement, a copy of which is attached as Annex A to
this proxy statement/prospectus and is incorporated by reference herein. In reviewing the Merger Agreement and this summary, please remember that
they have been included to provide you with information regarding the terms of the Merger Agreement and are not intended to provide any other factual
information about Unimin, Fairmount Santrol or any of their respective subsidiaries.

The Merger Agreement contains representations and warranties by each of the parties to the Merger Agreement as of certain dates, which are
summarized below. These representations and warranties have been made solely for the benefit of the other parties to the Merger Agreement and:
 

 
•  were not intended as statements of fact, but rather as a way of allocating the risk to one of the parties to the Merger Agreement if those

statements prove to be inaccurate;
 

 
•  have been qualified by certain confidential disclosures that were made to the other party in connection with the negotiation of the Merger

Agreement, which disclosures are not reflected in the Merger Agreement;
 

 •  are qualified by information in disclosure schedules provided by Fairmount Santrol to Unimin and by Unimin to Fairmount Santrol; and
 

 •  may apply standards of materiality in a way that is different from what may be viewed as material by you or other investors.

Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the representations and warranties in the Merger Agreement and described below may
have changed since December 11, 2017 and subsequent developments or new information qualifying a representation or warranty may have been
included in this proxy statement/prospectus. In addition, if specific material facts arise that contradict the representations and warranties in the Merger
Agreement, Fairmount Santrol may disclose those material facts in the public filings that it makes with the SEC in accordance with, and to the extent
required by, applicable law. Accordingly, the representations and warranties and other provisions of the Merger Agreement should not be read alone, but
instead should be read together with the information provided elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus and in the documents incorporated by
reference into this proxy statement/prospectus. See “Where You Can Find Additional Information” beginning on page  372.

Closing

The closing of the Merger will occur at 10:00 a.m., New York time, on the date that is the later of (i) the third business day after the satisfaction or
waiver of all of the closing conditions contained in the Merger Agreement (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be fulfilled at closing,
including the HPQ Carveout, but subject to fulfillment or waiver of such conditions) and (ii) March 31, 2018, unless another time or date is agreed to in
writing by Unimin and Fairmount Santrol. For a description of the conditions to the closing of the Merger, see “—Conditions to Closing of the Merger”
beginning on page 203 of this proxy statement/prospectus. The closing of the Second Merger will take place immediately following the effective time
unless another time or date is agreed to in writing by Unimin and Fairmount Santrol.

Effective Time

Subject to the provisions of the Merger Agreement, as soon as practicable on the closing date of the Merger, the parties to the Merger Agreement
will cause the Merger to be consummated by filing with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware a certificate of merger, duly executed and
completed in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL, and will make all other filings or recordings required under the DGCL in order to
give effect to the Merger. The Merger will become effective at the effective time, unless a later time is agreed in writing by Unimin and Fairmount
Santrol and specified in the certificate of merger.

Immediately following the effective time, and subject to the provisions of the Merger Agreement, the parties to the Merger Agreement will cause
the Second Merger to be consummated by filing with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware a second certificate of merger, duly executed and
completed in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL and the DLLCA, and will make all other filings or recordings required under the
DGCL and the DLLCA in order to give effect to the Second Merger. The Second Merger will become effective upon the filing of the second certificate
of merger, unless a later time is agreed in writing by Unimin and Fairmount Santrol and specified in the second certificate of merger.

Effects of the Merger; Merger Consideration

As of the effective time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of any of the parties to the Merger Agreement or the holders of
any shares of Fairmount Santrol common stock, each issued and outstanding share of Fairmount Santrol common stock (other than (1) shares owned by
Fairmount Santrol or any wholly owned subsidiary of Fairmount Santrol (or held in the treasury of Fairmount Santrol) immediately prior to the effective
time, (2) shares owned by Sibelco or any of its subsidiaries immediately prior to the effective time and (3) shares held by any stockholder who is entitled
to appraisal rights and has properly exercised and perfected (and not effectively withdrawn or lost) such stockholder’s demand for appraisal rights under
the DGCL) will be converted into the right to receive:
 

 
(a) the Stock Consideration, consisting of such number of shares of the combined company common stock equal to the Exchange Ratio (as

defined herein);
 

 
(b) the Cash Consideration, consisting of an amount in cash equal to the result of (x) $170,000,000, divided by (y) the fully diluted Fairmount

Santrol share number (as defined herein), without interest; and
 

 (c) cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any, without interest.

The “Exchange Ratio” is equal to “y” where the product of (A) the sum of (1) 229,895,367 plus (2) the aggregate number of shares of Fairmount
Santrol common stock issued between December 8, 2017 and the effective time (excluding shares of Fairmount Santrol common stock issued in
connection with the settlement of Fairmount Santrol equity awards outstanding as of December 8, 2017), plus (3) in respect of any Fairmount Santrol
RSU awards and Fairmount Santrol PSU awards granted between December 8, 2017 and the effective time, the aggregate number of shares of
Fairmount Santrol common stock subject to such Fairmount Santrol RSU awards and Fairmount Santrol PSU awards immediately prior to the effective
time, and (B) y, is equal to the Aggregate Foxtrot Shares. The Aggregate Foxtrot Shares is equal to 0.35 multiplied by x (where 0.65 multiplied by x is
equal to the aggregate number of shares of issued and outstanding Unimin stock that Sibelco and its

affiliates own immediately prior to the effective time after giving effect to the HPQ Redemption and the Cash Redemption).

The “fully diluted Fairmount Santrol share number” is equal to the sum of (in each case, as of immediately prior to the effective time): (i) the
aggregate number of shares of issued and outstanding Fairmount Santrol common stock; (ii) the aggregate number of shares of Fairmount Santrol
common stock subject to Fairmount Santrol RSU awards; (iii) the aggregate number of shares of Fairmount Santrol common stock subject to 2016
Fairmount Santrol PSU awards assuming achievement of 100% of target performance; (iv) the aggregate number of shares of Fairmount Santrol
common stock subject to 2017 Fairmount Santrol PSU awards assuming achievement of 133% of target performance; and (v) for each in-the-money
Fairmount Santrol Stock Option outstanding immediately prior to the effective time, the product of (A) the aggregate number of shares of Fairmount
Santrol common stock subject to the in-the-money Fairmount Santrol Stock Option and (B) the quotient, calculated to two decimal places and rounded
down, of (a) the difference between (1) the volume weighted average price per share of Fairmount Santrol common stock in respect of the 30
consecutive trading days ending with the second complete trading day immediately prior to the closing date of the Merger (the “Company Share Value”)
and (2) the exercise price for such in-the–money Fairmount Santrol Stock Option and (b) the Company Share Value.

As of the effective time, all shares of Fairmount Santrol common stock will no longer be outstanding and will automatically be cancelled and
retired and will cease to exist. As of the effective time, each holder of a certificate or book-entry share representing any shares of Fairmount Santrol
common stock (other than Dissenting Shares) will cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive, upon the surrender thereof,
the Merger Consideration in accordance with the Merger Agreement. The shares of common stock of Unimin issued in the Merger to Fairmount Santrol
stockholders will represent, including certain equity awards, approximately 35% of the total number of shares of combined company common stock
outstanding as of that time.

In addition, at the effective time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of any of the parties to the Merger Agreement or the
holders of any shares of Fairmount Santrol common stock, each share of common stock of Merger Sub, par value $0.01 per share, issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the effective time will be cancelled and, in exchange for the cancellation of the shares of Merger Sub common stock
and the provision of the aggregate Merger Consideration by Unimin, Fairmount Santrol, as the surviving corporation in the Merger, will issue an
equivalent number of fully paid and non-assessable shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, all of which shares will be held by Unimin, and
which will constitute the only outstanding shares Fairmount Santrol common stock, as the surviving corporation, immediately following the effective
time.

The Merger Consideration to be received by the Fairmount Santrol stockholders will be adjusted appropriately to reflect the effect of any stock
split, reverse stock split, share consolidation, share subdivision, share bonus issue or stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities
convertible into Fairmount Santrol common stock or Unimin common stock, as applicable), reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification,
combination, exchange of shares or other like change with respect to the number of shares of Fairmount Santrol common stock or Unimin common
stock issued and outstanding after December 11, 2017 and prior to the effective time.

Exchange of Fairmount Santrol Shares

Prior to the effective time, Unimin or Merger Sub will designate a bank, trust company or nationally recognized stockholder services provider to
act as the exchange agent for the purpose of delivering or causing to be delivered to each holder of Fairmount Santrol common stock the Merger
Consideration such holder is entitled to receive. Unimin will consult with, and consider in good faith the views of, Fairmount Santrol in relation to the
selection of the exchange agent. Fairmount Santrol will have the right to approve the selection of the exchange agent, and the contract pursuant to which
Unimin or Merger Sub appoints the exchange agent must be in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Fairmount Santrol.

Table of Contents

At or prior to the effective time, Unimin or Merger Sub will deposit or cause to be deposited with the exchange agent, for the benefit of holders of
shares of Fairmount Santrol common stock, (i) shares of Unimin common stock representing the aggregate amount of shares of combined company
common stock sufficient to deliver the Stock Consideration, in the aggregate, to all persons entitled thereto and (ii) immediately available funds
sufficient to pay the Cash Consideration, in the aggregate, to all Fairmount Santrol stockholders and Fairmount Santrol equity award holders entitled
thereto (such cash and shares, together with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto, the “exchange fund”). The exchange agent will deliver
the Merger Consideration to holders of Fairmount Santrol common stock out of the exchange fund.

As soon as reasonably practicable after the effective time, the exchange agent will mail to each holder of record of a certificate or book-entry share
that immediately prior to the effective time represented outstanding shares of Fairmount Santrol common stock, whose shares were converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration, (A) a letter of transmittal and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the certificates and book-
entry shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration.

Upon surrender of a certificate or book-entry share, as applicable, for cancellation to the exchange agent or to such other agent or agents as may
be appointed by Unimin, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the
exchange agent, the holder of such certificate or book-entry share will be entitled to receive in exchange therefor that number of whole shares of
combined company common stock and that amount of cash (including cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any) that such holder has the right to receive
pursuant to the Merger Agreement, and the certificate or book-entry share so surrendered will be cancelled.

Treatment of Fairmount Santrol Equity Awards

Fairmount Santrol Stock Options. As of the effective time, and subject to the terms of the Merger Agreement, each Fairmount Santrol Stock
Option outstanding immediately prior to the effective time, whether vested or unvested, will be converted, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of the holder of that Fairmount Santrol Stock Option, into a stock option exercisable for that number of shares of combined company
common stock equal to the product of (A) the aggregate number of shares of Fairmount Santrol common stock for which such Fairmount Santrol Stock
Option was exercisable multiplied by (B) the Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole share. The exercise price per share of such converted
stock option will be equal to (x) the exercise price per share of such Fairmount Santrol Stock Option immediately prior to the effective time divided by
(y) the Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest cent. Each such converted stock option will have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions
(including any continuing vesting requirements) set forth in the applicable Fairmount Santrol equity plan and the stock option agreement pursuant to
which the stock option was granted, as in effect immediately prior to the effective time. If the employment of a stock option holder is terminated without
cause or if the holder of the stock option terminates his or her employment for good reason during the one year period following the closing of the
merger, such option holder’s unvested and unexerciseable converted stock options will become fully vested and exercisable upon such termination of
employment. Further, all vested converted stock options will remain exercisable for a minimum period of 12 months following the option holder’s
termination of employment at any time and for any reason other than for cause or, if earlier, until the original expiration date of the Fairmount Santrol
Stock Option.

In addition, Unimin will, or will cause a subsidiary to, pay each holder of an in-the-money Fairmount Santrol Stock Option that is outstanding
immediately prior to the effective time a lump sum cash amount equal to (A) the Cash Consideration, multiplied by (B) (i) the aggregate number of
shares of Fairmount Santrol common stock subject to the in-the-money Fairmount Santrol Stock Option, multiplied by (ii) a fraction, calculated to two
decimal places and rounded down, where (1) the numerator equals the Company Share Value less the exercise price for such in-the-money Fairmount
Santrol Stock Option and (2) the denominator is the Company Share Value, less applicable withholding taxes, if any. Such cash payment will be paid to
the option holder within seven days of the closing date of the Merger.

Fairmount Santrol RSU Awards. Each Fairmount Santrol RSU award, whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior to the
effective time will, as of the effective time, and subject to the terms of the

Merger Agreement, automatically and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into a combined company RSU award with
respect to the aggregate number of shares of combined company common stock equal to the product of (A) the number of shares of Fairmount Santrol
common stock subject to such Fairmount Santrol RSU award immediately prior to the effective time and (B) the Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the
nearest whole unit. Each converted Fairmount Santrol RSU award will have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions (including any continuing
vesting requirements) set forth under the applicable Fairmount Santrol equity plan and award agreement in effect immediately prior to the effective time.
If the employment of a holder of a converted Fairmount Santrol RSU award is terminated without cause or if the holder terminates his or her
employment for good reason during the one year period following the closing of the Merger, such holder’s converted Fairmount Santrol RSU award will
become fully vested, nonforfeitable and payable upon such termination of employment.

In addition, Unimin will, or will cause a subsidiary to, pay to each holder of a Fairmount Santrol RSU award that is outstanding immediately prior
to the effective time a lump sum cash amount equal to (A) the Cash Consideration multiplied by (B) the number of shares of Fairmount Santrol common
stock subject to such Fairmount Santrol RSU award immediately prior to the effective time, less applicable withholding taxes, if any. Such cash payment
will be paid to the holder within seven days of the closing date of the Merger.

Fairmount Santrol PSU Awards. Each Fairmount Santrol PSU award, whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior to the
effective time will, as of the effective time, automatically and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into a combined
company RSU award with respect to the aggregate number of shares of combined company common stock equal to the product of (A) (x) for 2016
Fairmount Santrol PSU awards, the number of shares of Fairmount Santrol common stock subject to such 2016 Fairmount Santrol PSU award assuming
achievement of 100% of target performance and (y) for 2017 Fairmount Santrol PSU awards, the number of shares of Fairmount Santrol common stock
subject to such 2017 Fairmount Santrol PSU awards assuming achievement of 133% of target performance and (B) the Exchange Ratio, rounded up or
down to the nearest whole unit. Each converted PSU award shall have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions as set forth under the applicable
Fairmount Santrol equity plan and award agreement in effect immediately prior to the effective time, except that (x) such converted PSU award will be
subject to forfeiture based only on continued service requirements in the applicable award agreement and not on achievement of any performance
criteria, and (y) if the holder of a converted PSU award is terminated without cause or if the holder terminates his or her employment for good reason
during the one year period following the closing of the Merger, such holder’s converted PSU award will become fully vested, nonforfeitable and payable
upon such termination of employment.

In addition, Unimin will, or will cause a subsidiary to, pay (A) to each holder of a 2016 Fairmount Santrol PSU award that is outstanding
immediately prior to the effective time a lump sum cash amount equal to (1) the Cash Consideration multiplied by (2) the number of shares of Fairmount
Santrol common stock subject to such 2016 Fairmount Santrol PSU award assuming achievement of 100% of target performance, less applicable
withholding taxes, if any, and (B) each holder of a 2017 Fairmount Santrol PSU award that is outstanding immediately prior to the effective time a lump
sum cash amount equal to (1) the Cash Consideration multiplied by (2) the number of shares of Fairmount Santrol common stock subject to such 2017
Fairmount Santrol PSU awards assuming achievement of 133% of target performance, less applicable withholding taxes, if any. Such cash payment will
be paid to the holder within seven days of the closing date of the Merger.

Assumption by the Combined Company. Effective as of the effective time, the combined company will assume (A) the Fairmount Santrol Stock
Options, Fairmount Santrol RSU awards and Fairmount Santrol PSU awards that were outstanding immediately prior to the effective time in accordance
with the terms of the Merger Agreement and (B) sponsorship of each Fairmount Santrol equity plan. References to Fairmount Santrol in the Fairmount
Santrol equity plan shall be deemed references to the combined company, and references to Fairmount Santrol common stock therein shall be deemed
references to combined company common stock with appropriate equitable adjustments to reflect the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement. Prior to the effective time, the Fairmount Board and Unimin Board or the appropriate committees thereof will adopt resolutions and

Table of Contents

take all other actions as may be necessary to provide for the treatment of Fairmount Santrol’s equity awards and the Fairmount Santrol equity plans in
the manner contemplated above.

Fractional Shares

No fractional shares of combined company common stock will be issued, and in lieu thereof, each holder of Fairmount Santrol common stock who
would otherwise be entitled to a fractional share of combined company common stock will receive an amount in cash, without interest. If, prior to the
effective time, Unimin elects to contribute such cash amount to the exchange agent, then each holder’s cash amount will be determined by multiplying
such holder’s fractional interest by the closing price for a single share of combined company common stock on the NYSE on the first business day
immediately following the effective time. Otherwise, as soon as practicable after the effective time, the exchange agent will sell an amount of shares of
combined company common stock equal to the sum of all of the fractional share interests owed to all holders at then prevailing prices on the NYSE. As
soon as practicable after the determination of the amount of cash, if any, to be paid to holders in respect of their fractional share interests, the exchange
agent will promptly pay such amounts to such holders subject to and in accordance with the Merger Agreement.

Lost, Stolen and Destroyed Certificates

If a Fairmount Santrol common stock certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, the person claiming the lost, stolen or destroyed stock
certificate must deliver an affidavit of that fact and, if required by Unimin or the exchange agent, post a bond in such reasonable amount as Unimin or
the exchange agent, as applicable, may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such certificates before the
exchange agent will deliver the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect of the shares of Fairmount Santrol common stock represented by the lost,
stolen or destroyed stock certificate, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of combined company common stock and unpaid dividends and distributions on
combined company common stock deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to the Merger Agreement.

Shares of Dissenting Stockholders

To the extent that holders of Fairmount Santrol common stock are entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262, shares of Fairmount Santrol
common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time and held by a person who has properly exercised and perfected his or her
appraisal rights under Section 262 and not effectively withdrawn or lost such rights to appraisal (a “dissenting stockholder” and such shares, “Dissenting
Shares”) will not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration. If the Merger is consummated, any Dissenting Shares will be entitled
to receive such consideration as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery in accordance with Section 262. If any dissenting stockholder fails to
perfect or effectively withdraws or loses his, her or its right to appraisal and payment under the DGCL (whether before, at or after the effective time),
Dissenting Shares held by such dissenting stockholder will be treated as though such dissenting shares had been converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration as of the effective time without any interest thereon. For more information regarding appraisal rights, see the section entitled
“Appraisal Rights of Fairmount Santrol Stockholders” in this proxy statement/prospectus. In addition, the full text of Section 262 of the DGCL is
attached as Annex E to this proxy statement/prospectus.

Governance and Management of the Combined Company

Following the Merger, the Combined Company Board will be comprised of 11 directors. Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement,
Fairmount Santrol and Unimin will cooperate and take all actions as are necessary to cause, effective as of the effective time, the Combined Company
Board to be comprised of:
 

 •  the six Unimin-nominated directors;
 

 •  the four Fairmount-nominated directors; and
 

 •  the Chief Executive Officer of the combined company as of the effective time, who will be Jenniffer D. Deckard.

At least three of the Fairmount-nominated directors must qualify as independent directors under NYSE corporate governance rules. If, prior to the
effective time, any individual designated to serve on the Combined

Table of Contents

Company Board is unable or unwilling to serve, Unimin or Fairmount Santrol, as applicable, will designate another individual to serve on the Combined
Company Board.

Additional governance-related provisions are set forth in the Stockholders Agreement and the combined company’s certificate of incorporation
and the combined company’s bylaws. See “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions—Relationship with Sibelco—Stockholders
Agreement” and “Description of Combined Company Capital Stock.”

Representations and Warranties

The Merger Agreement contains representations and warranties made by Sibelco, Unimin, Merger Sub and Merger Sub LLC to Fairmount Santrol
and by Fairmount Santrol to Unimin. Certain of the representations and warranties in the Merger Agreement are subject to materiality or material
adverse effect qualifications (that is, they will not be deemed to be untrue or incorrect unless their failure to be true or correct is material or would result
in a material adverse effect). In addition, certain of the representations and warranties in the Merger Agreement are subject to knowledge qualifications,
which means that those representations and warranties would not be deemed untrue or incorrect as a result of matters of which certain officers of the
party making the representation did not have knowledge.

The Merger Agreement provides that a “material adverse effect” means, with respect to Fairmount Santrol or Unimin, as the case may be, any
fact, circumstance, effect, change, event or development that would, or would reasonably be expected to, materially adversely affect the business,
properties, financial condition or results of operations of Fairmount Santrol and its subsidiaries, or Unimin and its subsidiaries (excluding HPQ Co), in
each case taken as a whole, respectively. However, no effect resulting from or arising out of the following will be taken into account in determining
whether there has been a material adverse effect:
 

 
•  general economic or political conditions or securities, credit, financial or other capital markets conditions, in each case in the United States

or any foreign jurisdiction;
 

 

•  any failure, in and of itself, by Fairmount Santrol or Unimin to meet any internal or published projections, forecasts, estimates or predictions
in respect of revenues, earnings or other financial or operating metrics for any period (however, the facts or occurrences giving rise to or
contributing to such failure may be deemed to constitute, or be taken into account in determining whether there has been or will be, a
material adverse effect, unless otherwise excluded in this list);

 

 
•  any change, in and of itself, in the market price or trading volume of Fairmount Santrol’s securities (however, the facts or occurrences giving

rise to or contributing to such change may be taken into account in determining whether there has been or will be a material adverse effect,
unless otherwise excluded in this definition);

 

 •  any change in U.S. GAAP or International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) (or authoritative interpretation thereof);
 

 
•  geopolitical conditions, the outbreak or escalation of hostilities, any acts of war, sabotage or terrorism, or any escalation or worsening of any

such acts of war, sabotage or terrorism threatened or underway as of the date December 11, 2017;
 

 •  any hurricane, tornado, flood, earthquake or other natural disaster; or
 

 

•  any action expressly required by the covenant in the Merger Agreement requiring Fairmount Santrol, Unimin, Sibelco, Merger Sub and
Merger Sub LLC to use their reasonable best efforts to consummate the Merger and to obtain required governmental consents and approvals
(for additional details, see the sections entitled “—Efforts to Complete the Merger” and “—Regulatory Approvals” beginning on page 199
of this proxy statement/prospectus);

except in the case of the first, fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh bullets above to the extent any such effect affects either Fairmount Santrol and its
subsidiaries or Unimin and its subsidiaries, as applicable, in a materially disproportionate manner as compared to other companies that participate in the
businesses that Fairmount Santrol

businesses between December 11, 2017 and the effective time. In general, except as consented to by the other party in writing (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), each of Unimin and Fairmount Santrol has agreed to, and to cause their respective subsidiaries to, and
Sibelco has agreed to cause Unimin and Unimin’s subsidiaries to, carry on their respective businesses in the ordinary course consistent with past practice
and, to the extent consistent therewith, use reasonable best efforts to preserve intact their current business organizations, preserve their assets and
properties in good repair and condition, keep available the services of their current officers and other key employees and preserve their relationships

the satisfaction of any of the conditions to the Merger.

No Solicitation by Fairmount Santrol

Fairmount Santrol has agreed not to, and to cause its controlled affiliates and each of its and their respective officers, directors and employees not
to, and to direct its investment bankers, financial advisors, attorneys, accountants and other representatives retained by it or any of its controlled
affiliates not to, directly or indirectly through another person:
 

 
•  solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage (including by way of furnishing information), or knowingly take any other action designed to

facilitate, any inquiries regarding, or the making of, any proposal the consummation of which would constitute a Company Alternative
Transaction (as defined below);

 

 

•  engage or participate in any substantive discussions or negotiations, or cooperate in any way with any person (or group of persons) with
respect to any inquiries regarding, or the making of, any proposal the consummation of which would constitute a Company Alternative
Transaction, except to notify such person (or group of persons) as to the existence of the provisions of the Merger Agreement summarized in
this section;

 

 

•  grant any waiver or release under (1) any standstill provision in any contract to which Fairmount Santrol is a party or (2) any confidentiality
provision in any contract to which Fairmount Santrol is a party other than any waiver or release in a confidentiality provision in any
agreement entered into by Fairmount Santrol which is not related to or in contemplation of a Company Alternative Transaction (except if the
failure to do so would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of Fairmount Board); or

 

 •  resolve, publicly propose or agree to any of the foregoing.

A “Company Alternative Transaction” means any of:
 

 

(i) a transaction or series of transactions pursuant to which any person (or group of persons), other than Unimin and its subsidiaries (including
Merger Sub and Merger Sub LLC) (such person (or group of persons), a “Company Third Party”), acquires or would acquire, directly or
indirectly, beneficial ownership (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) of more than 20% of the issued and outstanding shares
of Fairmount Santrol common stock or securities (or options, rights or warrants to

purchase, or securities convertible into or exchangeable for, such securities) representing 20% or more of the voting power of Fairmount
Santrol voting stock, whether from Fairmount Santrol or pursuant to a tender offer or exchange offer or otherwise;

 

 
(ii) a merger, consolidation, share exchange or similar transaction pursuant to which any Company Third Party acquires or would acquire,

directly or indirectly, assets or businesses of Fairmount Santrol or any of its subsidiaries representing 20% or more of the revenues, net
income or assets (in each case on a consolidated basis) of Fairmount Santrol and its subsidiaries taken as a whole;

 

 

(iii) any transaction pursuant to which any Company Third Party acquires or would acquire, directly or indirectly, control of assets (including for
this purpose the outstanding equity securities of subsidiaries of Fairmount Santrol and any entity surviving any merger or combination
including any of them) of Fairmount Santrol or any of its subsidiaries representing 20% or more of the revenues, net income or assets (in
each case on a consolidated basis) of Fairmount Santrol and its subsidiaries taken as a whole; or

 

 
(iv) any disposition of assets to a Company Third Party representing 20% or more of the revenues, net income or assets (in each case on a

consolidated basis) of Fairmount Santrol and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

Notwithstanding the restrictions on the solicitation of Company Alternative Transactions, the Merger Agreement provides that (X) Fairmount
Santrol and its representatives may contact such person or group of persons (that makes any proposal the consummation of which would constitute a
Company Alternative Transaction) for the purpose of clarifying the terms and conditions of any such proposal and (Y) if at any time prior to obtaining
Fairmount Santrol stockholder approval, the Fairmount Board determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor
of nationally recognized reputation) that any proposal that contemplates a Company Alternative Transaction did not result from a material breach of the
non-solicitation obligations of the Merger Agreement and constitutes or could reasonably be expected to result in a Company Superior Proposal (as
defined herein), then Fairmount Santrol and its representatives may (i) furnish information with respect to itself and its subsidiaries to the person (or
group of persons) making such proposal (and its representatives and financing sources) pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement containing
terms as to confidentiality generally no less restrictive than the terms of the confidentiality agreement entered into between Unimin and Fairmount
Santrol (provided that (x) all such information must have been previously provided to Unimin or must be provided to Unimin prior to or substantially
concurrently with the time it is provided to such person and (y) such confidentiality agreement need not include any “standstill” terms but shall not
prohibit Fairmount Santrol from providing information to Unimin as provided above) and (ii) participate in discussions or negotiations regarding such
proposal with the person (or group of persons) making such proposal (and its representatives and financing sources).

The Merger Agreement also requires Fairmount Santrol to: (i) as promptly as reasonably practicable, after receipt thereof, advise Unimin in
writing of any request for information or of any proposal relating to a Company Alternative Transaction, the material terms and conditions of such
request or proposal (including any changes thereto) and the identity of the person making such request or proposal; (ii) keep Unimin reasonably
informed of the status and details (including amendments or proposed amendments) of any such request or proposal on a reasonably current basis; and
(iii) provide to Unimin, as soon as reasonably practicable after receipt or delivery thereof, copies of all correspondence and other written materials
exchanged between Fairmount Santrol or its subsidiaries or any of their representatives, on the one hand, and any person making such request or
proposal, on the other hand, in each case that describes in any material respect any of the material terms or conditions of any such request or proposal
(including any material change to any material term).

Company Recommendation Change and Company Superior Proposals

The Fairmount Board recommends that Fairmount Santrol stockholders vote “FOR” the Fairmount Santrol Merger proposal.

The Merger Agreement provides that, subject to the exceptions described below, neither the Fairmount Board nor any committee thereof shall
(i) withdraw, qualify or modify, or propose publicly to withdraw, qualify

or modify, or fail to make, in each case in a manner adverse to Unimin, the approval or recommendation by the Fairmount Board or such committee of
the Merger or the Merger Agreement, (ii) approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend, any Company Alternative Transaction
(any action in clause (i) or this clause (ii) being referred to as a “Company Recommendation Change”), or (iii) cause Fairmount Santrol or any of its
affiliates to enter into any letter of intent, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement or other agreement related to any Company Alternative
Transaction.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that, prior to obtaining Fairmount Santrol stockholder approval, the Fairmount Board determines in
good faith, after it has received a Company Superior Proposal (as defined below), and after consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor of
nationally recognized reputation, that the failure to do so would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law, the
Fairmount Board may (subject to compliance with this and the following sentences) effect a Company Recommendation Change and/or cause Fairmount
Santrol to terminate the Merger Agreement and concurrently with such termination enter into a definitive agreement providing for such Company
Superior Proposal, but only at a time that is after the fifth business day following Unimin’s receipt of written notice from Fairmount Santrol advising
Unimin that the Fairmount Board has received a Company Superior Proposal specifying the material terms and conditions of such Company Superior
Proposal, identifying the person making such Company Superior Proposal and stating that it intends to make a Company Recommendation Change
and/or terminate the Merger Agreement; provided that in the event of a subsequent modification to the material terms and conditions of such Company
Superior Proposal, the Fairmount Board may only effect a Company Recommendation Change and terminate the Merger Agreement after the third
business day following Unimin’s receipt of written notice from Fairmount Santrol advising Unimin of the modification to such terms and conditions;
and provided further that during the foregoing notice periods, as applicable, Fairmount Santrol engages (to the extent requested by Unimin) in good faith
negotiations with Unimin to amend the Merger Agreement in such a manner that the proposal to enter into a Company Alternative Transaction no longer
constitutes a Company Superior Proposal.

For purposes of the Merger Agreement, a “Company Superior Proposal” means any bona fide written proposal (on its most recently amended or
modified terms, if amended or modified) made by a Company Third Party to enter into a Company Alternative Transaction (with all references to 20%
in the definition of Company Alternative Transaction being treated as references to 50% for these purposes) that (A) did not result from a material
breach of the non-solicitation covenant in the Merger Agreement and (B) is on terms that the Fairmount Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) to be more favorable to Fairmount Santrol stockholders
than the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, taking into account all relevant factors (including any changes to the Merger Agreement
that may be proposed by Unimin in response to such proposal to enter into a Company Alternative Transaction, and the relative likelihood that such
Company Alternative Transaction would be completed, taking into account all financial, regulatory, legal and other aspects of such proposal).

In addition, notwithstanding anything in the Merger Agreement to the contrary, at any time prior to obtaining Fairmount Santrol stockholder
approval, if the Fairmount Board determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized
reputation) that the failure to do so would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law, the Fairmount Board
may effect a Company Recommendation Change in response to any effect that materially affects (A) the business, financial condition or results of
operations of Fairmount Santrol and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (B) the Fairmount Santrol stockholders (including the benefits of the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement to Fairmount Santrol or Fairmount Santrol stockholders), in either case that (x) is first occurring
after December 11, 2017, (y) does not involve or relate to a proposal the consummation of which would constitute a Company Alternative Transaction
and (z) is not known and was not reasonably foreseeable to the Fairmount Board as of December 11, 2017, but only at a time that is after the third
business day following Unimin’s receipt of written notice from Fairmount Santrol advising Unimin of all material information with respect to any such
effect and stating that it intends to make a Company Recommendation Change and providing a full description of its rationale therefor.

For purposes of the Merger Agreement, each of the parties to the Merger Agreement agreed that “reasonable best efforts” include proposing,
negotiating, committing to and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, the sale, divestiture, licensing, testing, zoning,
recharacterizing, expanding other development of or disposition of such assets, businesses, relationships, contractual rights or arrangements of
Fairmount Santrol, Sibelco, Unimin or their respective subsidiaries or affiliates as may be required in order to avoid the entry of, or to effect the
dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining order or other order in any suit or proceeding that would otherwise have the effect of preventing or
materially delaying the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements; provided, however,
that the effectiveness of any such sale, divestiture, licensing or disposition shall be conditioned upon the closing of the Merger. In addition, under the
Merger Agreement, each of Sibelco, Unimin and Fairmount Santrol shall use its reasonable best efforts to defend through litigation on the merits any
claim asserted in court by any party in order to avoid entry of, or to have vacated or terminated, any order of any governmental entity (whether
temporary, preliminary or permanent) that would prevent the closing of the Merger. Notwithstanding any other provision in the Merger Agreement to the
contrary, no provision in the Merger Agreement shall require Fairmount Santrol, Unimin and their respective subsidiaries or affiliates, collectively, to
agree to or effect a Material Divestiture.

Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance of Directors and Officers

The Merger Agreement provides that the combined company will, and will cause Fairmount Santrol as the surviving corporation in the Merger
and Merger Sub LLC as the surviving company in the Second Merger to, from and after the effective time, indemnify and hold harmless each individual
who was as of December 11, 2017, or becomes prior to the effective time, a director or officer of Unimin, Fairmount Santrol or any of their respective
subsidiaries and each person who was serving as a director or officer of another person at the request of Unimin, Fairmount Santrol or any of their
respective subsidiaries to the same extent as such indemnified parties were indemnified as of December 11, 2017 pursuant to the organizational
documents of Fairmount Santrol or Unimin, as applicable, or any of their subsidiaries, and any indemnification agreements in existence as of
December 11, 2017. In the event of any such claim, action, suit or proceeding, each indemnified party will be entitled to advancement of expenses
incurred in the defense of any such claim, action, suit or proceeding to the same extent as such indemnified parties are entitled to advance of expenses as
of December 11, 2017, provided that any person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking, if and only to the extent required by
Delaware law, the organizational documents of Fairmount Santrol or Unimin, and any indemnification agreements in existence as of the date of the
Merger Agreement, to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to indemnification.

The Merger Agreement also requires Merger Sub LLC, as the surviving company in the Second Merger, for a period of six years following the
effective time, to either cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance
maintained by Fairmount Santrol or any of its subsidiaries or provide substitute policies for not less than the existing coverage and having other terms
not less favorable to the insured persons with respect to claims arising from facts or events occurring at or before the effective time, except that in no
event will the combined company or Merger Sub LLC as the surviving company in the Second Merger be required to pay with respect to such insurance
policies (or substitute insurance policies) of Fairmount Santrol in respect of any one policy year more than 300% of the annual premium payable by
Fairmount Santrol for such insurance for the prior 12 months. If the combined company or Fairmount Santrol as the surviving corporation of the Merger
is unable to obtain the required insurance, it must obtain as much comparable insurance as possible for the years within such six-year period for an
annual premium equal to the maximum amount in respect of each policy year within such period. In lieu of the foregoing, Fairmount Santrol may obtain
at or prior to the effective time a six-year “tail” policy under its existing directors and officers insurance policy providing equivalent coverage to that
described above for a cost, on an annual basis, not to exceed the maximum amount.

Employee Benefit Matters

With respect to current employees of Fairmount Santrol and its subsidiaries whose terms and conditions of employment are subject to a collective
bargaining agreement, Unimin has agreed to comply, or to cause its subsidiaries to comply, with the terms and conditions of each such applicable
collective bargaining agreement, in a manner consistent with applicable law.

For all purposes under the employee benefit plans of the combined company and its subsidiaries (including Fairmount Santrol) providing benefits
after the effective time (the “new plans”) to any employee of Fairmount Santrol or its subsidiaries who continues employment with the combined
company (each, a “continuing employee”), and subject to applicable law, the Merger Agreement provides that each continuing employee will be credited
with his or her years of service with Fairmount Santrol or any of its subsidiaries or their predecessors before the effective time, to the same extent as
such employee was entitled to credit for such service before the effective time, except to the extent that such credit would result in a duplication of
benefits and except for benefit accruals under any defined benefit pension plan. In addition, to the extent commercially reasonable and subject to any
applicable law, each continuing employee will be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all new plans to the extent
coverage under such new plan replaces coverage under a comparable Fairmount Santrol plan in which such continuing employee participated
immediately before the effective time. For purposes of each new plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical, and/or vision benefits to any
continuing employee, the combined company or its subsidiaries will cause any expenses incurred by such continuing employee and his or her covered
dependents during the portion of the plan year, ending on the date of the continuing employee’s participation in the corresponding new plan, of any
employee benefit plan such continuing employee participated in immediately before the effective time to be taken into account under the corresponding
new plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance, and maximum out-of-pocket requirements as if such amounts had been paid in
accordance with the new plan.

Unimin has also agreed to cause all bonus amounts under annual bonus, sales and other cash incentive plans of Fairmount Santrol and its
subsidiaries in respect of the fiscal year in which the closing of the Merger occurs and any prior fiscal years that remain unpaid as of the closing date of
the Merger to be calculated and paid in accordance with the terms of the applicable benefit plans or agreements. Unimin will cause all such amounts to
be paid in the ordinary course of business to all eligible continuing employees.

Stock Exchange Listing

Each of Fairmount Santrol, Unimin, Merger Sub, Merger Sub LLC and Sibelco has agreed to use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Unimin
common stock, which will become the combined company common stock, to be approved for listing on the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance,
as promptly as practicable after December 11, 2017, and in any event prior to the closing date of the Merger.

Deregistration

Each of Fairmount Santrol, on the one hand, and Unimin, Merger Sub, Merger Sub LLC and Sibelco, on the other hand, has agreed to cooperate
with the other in taking, or causing to be taken, all actions necessary to delist the Fairmount Santrol common stock from the NYSE and terminate its
registration under the Exchange Act, including filing all applicable documents with the NYSE and the SEC, provided that such delisting and
deregistration shall become effective as soon as reasonably practicable after the effective time and Fairmount Santrol will not be required to take any
such actions unless conditioned upon the occurrence of the effective time.

Section 16 Matters

Fairmount Santrol and Unimin shall each take all such steps as are reasonably necessary to cause the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and any other dispositions of Fairmount Santrol equity securities (including derivative securities) or
acquisitions of Unimin equity securities (including derivative securities) in connection with the Merger by any individual who is a director or officer of
Fairmount Santrol or at the effective time will become a director or officer of the combined company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under
the Exchange Act.

materially less favorable, taken as a whole, to Unimin.

In addition, prior to the effective time, Fairmount Santrol has agreed to, and to cause its subsidiaries to, use reasonable best efforts to provide to

Santrol’s failure to perform any of its material obligations under the Merger Agreement has been the primary cause of, or primarily resulted

Specific Performance

The parties to the Merger Agreement have agreed that irreparable damage would occur and that monetary damages, even if available, would not
be an adequate remedy in the event that any of the provisions of the Merger Agreement are not performed in accordance with their specific terms or are
otherwise breached. The parties to the Merger Agreement have agreed that prior to any termination of the Merger Agreement, they will be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of the Merger Agreement and to enforce specifically the performance of its terms and provisions, without
proof of actual damages, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. The parties to the Merger Agreement have further

remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy for any breach.

Except as stated below, Fairmount Santrol is not entitled to specifically enforce Sibelco’s, Unimin’s, Merger Sub’s or Merger Sub LLC’s
obligations, as applicable, to effect the closing of the Merger or pay or issue the Merger Consideration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Fairmount

VOTING AND SUPPORT AGREEMENT

Concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, Unimin and Merger Sub entered into the Voting and Support Agreement with ASP
FML Holdings, LLC and Charles D. Fowler (collectively, the “Supporting Stockholders”), who collectively own approximately 26.4% of the
outstanding shares of Fairmount Santrol common stock.

Pursuant to the Voting and Support Agreement, the Supporting Stockholders agreed to take all actions as may be reasonably required to cause
their shares of Fairmount Santrol common stock to be present in person or by proxy at the special meeting and to vote their shares of Fairmount Santrol
common stock during the term of the Voting and Support Agreement (1) in favor of the Fairmount Santrol Merger proposal and (2) in favor of the
Fairmount Santrol adjournment proposal, if necessary or appropriate, including to solicit additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes to approve
the Fairmount Santrol Merger proposal. For the avoidance of doubt, the Supporting Stockholders agreed to vote all their shares of Fairmount Santrol
common stock beneficially owned as of the date they entered into the Voting and Support Agreement with Unimin and Merger Sub as well as any
additional shares of which either Supporting Stockholder becomes the record or beneficial owner before the special meeting (collectively, 59,304,771
shares, representing approximately 26.4% of the then outstanding shares of Fairmount Santrol common stock as of April 2, 2018).

The Supporting Stockholders also agreed to vote their shares of Fairmount Santrol common stock against (1) any Company Alternative
Transaction, (2) any action that would reasonably be expected to result in a breach of or failure to perform any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement of Fairmount Santrol under the Merger Agreement or of such Supporting Stockholder under the Voting and Support Agreement, (3) any
action that would reasonably be expected to prevent, impede, frustrate, interfere with, delay, postpone or adversely affect the closing of the Merger or
the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements (in contravention of the terms and conditions of the Merger
Agreement), (4) any merger agreement or merger (other than the Merger Agreement and the Merger), consolidation, combination, material business
transaction, sale of assets, reorganization, recapitalization, dissolution, liquidation or winding up of Fairmount Santrol or its subsidiaries and (5) any
amendment of Fairmount Santrol’s organizational documents that would reasonably be expected to impair the ability of Fairmount Santrol, Unimin or
Merger Sub to complete the Merger, or that would or would reasonably be expected to prevent, impede, frustrate, interfere with, delay, postpone or
adversely affect the closing of the Merger.

Each Supporting Stockholder appointed Unimin and any designee of Unimin as such Supporting Stockholder’s proxy and attorney-in-fact to vote
at the special meeting with respect to such Supporting Stockholder’s shares of Fairmount Santrol common stock during the term of the Voting and
Support Agreement. The proxy granted by each Supporting Stockholder is irrevocable during the term of the Voting and Support Agreement. In
addition, each Supporting Stockholder agreed during the term of the Voting and Support Agreement not to (1) sell, transfer, pledge, assign or otherwise
dispose of any of the shares of Fairmount Santrol common stock it owned or enter into any contract with respect to such disposition of, or limitation on
the voting rights of, such shares or any economic interest therein, (2) grant any proxies or powers of attorney with respect to such shares, deposit such
shares into a voting trust or enter into a voting agreement with respect to such shares, in each case with respect to any vote on the approval of the
Fairmount Santrol Merger proposal, (3) form, join, encourage, influence, advise or participate in any “group” with any persons with respect to any
Fairmount Santrol securities or (4) commit or agree to take any of the foregoing actions. The foregoing restrictions do not apply to (i) transfers by a
Supporting Stockholder of its shares of Fairmount Santrol common stock to any affiliate of such Supporting Stockholder who has agreed in writing to be
bound by the terms of the Voting and Support Agreement or (ii) transfers of such shares with Unimin’s prior written consent.

Each Supporting Stockholder also agreed that it would not, and would cause certain affiliates and each of its and their respective representatives
not to, directly or indirectly, (a) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage (including by way of furnishing information) or knowingly take any other action
designed to facilitate any inquiries regarding, or the making of, any proposal the consummation of which would be a Company Alternative Transaction,
(b) engage or participate in any substantive discussions or negotiations, or cooperate in any way

MANAGEMENT AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
OF THE COMBINED COMPANY AFTER THE MERGER

Board of Directors of the Combined Company

Following the Merger, the Combined Company Board will be comprised of 11 directors. Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement,
Fairmount Santrol and Unimin will cooperate and take all actions as is necessary to cause, effective as of the effective time, the Combined Company
Board to be comprised of:
 

 
•  the six Unimin-nominated directors, who initially will be Kurt Decat, Jean-Luc Deleersnyder, Michel Delloye, Jean-Pierre Labroue, Olivier

Lambrechts and one additional director (intended to be an independent director, as that term is defined under the terms of the NYSE), to be
selected prior to the closing of the Merger, who will be the chairman of the Combined Company Board;

 

 
•  the four Fairmount-nominated directors, who initially will be William E. Conway, Charles D. Fowler, Matthew F. LeBaron and one

additional director (intended to be an independent director, as that term is defined under the terms of the NYSE), to be selected prior to the
closing of the Merger; and

 

 •  the Chief Executive Officer of the combined company as of the effective time, who will be Jenniffer D. Deckard.

At least three of the Fairmount-nominated directors must qualify as independent directors under NYSE corporate governance rules. If, prior to the
effective time, any individual designated to serve on the Combined Company Board after the effective time is unable or unwilling to so serve, Unimin or
Fairmount Santrol, as applicable, will designate another individual to serve in such individual’s capacity.

Under the terms of the Stockholders Agreement, from the effective time until the day following the third annual meeting of the combined
company stockholders following the effective time, Sibelco and the other combined company stockholders who are parties to the Stockholders
Agreement will vote all voting shares of combined company stock owned by them, and take all other necessary actions within his, her or its control
(including in his, her or its capacity as a stockholder, director, member of a board committee, officer of the combined company or otherwise), and the
combined company and its directors will take all necessary actions within its and their control:
 

 •  to ensure that the number of directors constituting the Combined Company Board is fixed at 11 directors;
 

 
•  prior to the Trigger Date, to nominate and vote to elect the Unimin-nominated directors and the Fairmount-nominated directors as described

above in accordance with the Merger Agreement; and
 

 •  from and after the Trigger Date,
 

 
•  to cause the number of Unimin-nominated directors to be reduced so that the number of Unimin-nominated directors is at all times

equal to the product of (x) Sibelco’s percentage ownership of outstanding shares of combined company common stock and (y) the
total number of directors authorized to serve on the Combined Company Board (rounded down to the nearest whole number); and

 

 •  to nominate and vote to elect as directors:
 

 
•  the number of Unimin-nominated directors calculated as described above (reflecting Sibelco’s percentage ownership of

outstanding shares of combined company common stock);
 

 
•  the number of individuals equal to the difference between six and the number of Unimin-nominated directors, nominated in

accordance with the Stockholders Agreement (including the provisions regarding filling vacancies described below);
 

 •  the Fairmount-nominated directors; and
 

 •  the Chief Executive Officer of the combined company, from time to time.

The “Trigger Date” is defined as the earlier of (i) the close of business on the tenth business day following the date on which Sibelco and its
affiliates no longer beneficially own more than 50% of the outstanding shares

of combined company common stock and (ii) the close of business on the business day following public announcement by Sibelco that Sibelco has
made an election that the “Trigger Date” has occurred.

For the avoidance of doubt, subject to the provisions in the Stockholders Agreement related to vacancies, at no time prior to the third annual
meeting of combined company stockholders following the effective time may the number of Unimin-nominated directors be more than one more than
half of the total Combined Company Board.

In addition, from the effective time until the third annual meeting date, if a vacancy is created on the Combined Company Board at any time due
to the death, disability, retirement, resignation or removal of a director, then:
 

 
•  if such director is a Unimin-nominated director, the remaining Unimin-nominated directors have the right to designate an individual to fill

such vacancy;
 

 
•  if such director is a Fairmount-nominated director, then the remaining Fairmount-nominated directors have the right to designate an

individual to fill such vacancy;
 

 

•  prior to the Trigger Date, if the vacancy is caused by the death, disability, retirement, resignation or removal of a Fairmount-nominated
director, and the Fairmount-nominated directors do not fill such vacancy for more than 30 days after notice from the combined company of
such failure to fill the vacancy, then the vacant position will be filled by an individual designated by the Unimin-nominated directors then in
office, but any such individual will be removed if the remaining Fairmount-nominated directors so direct and simultaneously designate a
new director; and

 

 

•  if a vacancy is created on the Combined Company Board because of the removal of a Unimin-nominated director due to a decrease in
Sibelco’s percentage ownership of outstanding shares of combined company common stock as described above, then the remaining directors
will have the right to immediately designate a replacement for the removed director to fill such vacancy; provided that any such replacement
must be an independent director.

In addition, from the effective time until the third annual meeting date, if the Chief Executive Officer of the combined company is removed or
resigns as Chief Executive Officer of the combined company pursuant to the terms of such officer’s employment agreement, then such individual will
also be removed as a director, and the successor Chief Executive Officer of the combined company will be appointed to the Combined Company Board
in accordance with the combined company’s certificate of incorporation and the combined company’s bylaws.

From and after the third annual meeting date, the size and composition of the Combined Company Board may be adjusted by the Combined

Combined Company Board. Due to this experience, he is particularly well qualified to serve on the Combined Company Board.

Controlled Company Exemption and Director Independence

Controlled Company

Initially, the combined company will be a “controlled company” within the meaning of the rules of the NYSE because Sibelco will own more than
50% of the outstanding shares of combined company common stock. Consequently, the combined company is not required to comply with certain of the
NYSE listed company requirements. In particular, the combined company may not comply with the requirement to have a majority of “independent”
directors on the Combined Company Board or, subject to the determination of the Combined Company Board, the requirements to have a
nominating/corporate governance committee or a compensation committee.

Director Independence

In connection with the closing of the Merger, the Combined Company Board intends to undertake a review of the independence of each director.
Based on information provided by each director identified in this proxy statement/prospectus concerning his or her background, employment and
affiliations, including family relationships, it is expected that the Combined Company Board will determine that William E. Conway, Michel Delloye,
Charles D. Fowler, Jean-Pierre Labroue and Matthew F. LeBaron do not have any material relationship with the combined company and that each of
these directors will be an independent director as that term is defined under the rules of the NYSE. In making these determinations, the Combined
Company Board will consider the current and prior relationships that each non-employee director has with the combined company and all other facts
and circumstances that the Combined Company Board deems relevant in determining their independence, including the beneficial ownership of
combined company common stock by each non-employee director (and related entities) and the transactions involving them described in the section
entitled “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions.”

With respect to the one additional director to be selected prior to the closing of the Merger by Unimin, and the one additional director to be
selected prior to the closing of the Merger by Fairmount Santrol, each of Unimin and Fairmount Santrol intends that the director it selects will be an
independent director, as that term is defined under the rules of the NYSE.

Board Committees

The Combined Company Board will have the authority to appoint committees to perform certain management and administration functions. It is
expected that, in connection with the closing of the Merger, the Combined Company Board will establish an audit committee in accordance with the
NYSE and SEC regulations. The anticipated composition and responsibilities of the audit committee is described below. Members will serve on the
audit committee until their resignation or until otherwise determined by the Combined Company Board.

The combined company’s audit committee will assist the Combined Company Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities regarding the
integrity of the combined company’s financial statements, compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, qualifications, independence and
performance of the combined company’s independent auditors and the effectiveness and performance of the combined company’s internal audit
function. It is currently expected that the combined company’s audit committee will be responsible for, among other things:
 

 
•  the appointment, compensation, retention and oversight of the work of the combined company’s independent auditors, including discussing

with management the recommendations of the independent registered public accounting firm regarding financial reporting;
 

 •  approving engagements of the independent registered public accounting firm to render any audit or permissible non-audit services;
 

 •  reviewing the qualifications and independence of the independent registered public accounting firm;
 

 
•  reviewing and discussing with management the combined company’s financial statements and related disclosures and reviewing the

combined company’s critical accounting policies and practices;
 

 
•  establishing procedures for the receipt, retention and treatment of complaints received by the combined company regarding accounting,

internal accounting controls or auditing matters;
 

 •  overseeing the combined company’s internal audit function; and
 

 •  reviewing the adequacy of the combined company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Upon the closing of the Merger, the combined company will have an audit committee that will be selected from among the independent directors
on the Combined Company Board. All members of the audit committee will be “financially literate” under the applicable rules and regulations of the
SEC and the NYSE. At least one member of the audit committee will be an audit committee financial expert within the meaning of Item 407(d) of
Regulation S-K under the Securities Act and will have the requisite financial experience as defined by the NYSE corporate governance rules.

Upon the effective time, each member of the audit committee will be independent within the meaning of the rules of the NYSE and the SEC.
Upon the closing of the Merger, the combined company’s audit committee will operate under a written charter that will satisfy the applicable standards
of the SEC and the NYSE. Following the closing of the Merger, the Combined Company Board will have authority to determine the responsibilities of
the audit committee, subject to any requirements of applicable law.

Corporate Governance Guidelines and Code of Business Conduct

In accordance with the NYSE rules, in connection with the Merger, the combined company will adopt Corporate Governance Guidelines and a
Code of Business Conduct and Ethics in a form customary for a NYSE-listed company.

The Corporate Governance Guidelines will cover such matters as director qualifications and responsibilities, responsibilities of key committees,
director compensation and matters relating to succession planning.

The Code of Business Conduct and Ethics will contain provisions with respect to confidentiality, fair dealing, conflicts of interest, protection and
proper use of the combined company’s assets and compliance with law.

In accordance with the SEC rules, in connection with the Merger, the combined company will also adopt a code of ethics for senior financial
officers.

UNIMIN COMPENSATION INFORMATION

Compensation Discussion and Analysis

The purpose of this compensation discussion and analysis is to provide information about the material elements of compensation that are paid,
awarded to, or earned by, Unimin’s “named executive officers” (“NEOs”), who consist of Unimin’s principal executive officer, principal financial
officer (or individual serving in such capacity) and the three other most highly compensated executive officers.

For 2017, Unimin’s NEOs were:
 

Name   Role
Campbell J. Jones   President & Chief Executive Officer
Andrew D. Eich   Principal Financial Officer
Andrew G. Bradley*   Global Vice President, Safety, Health & Sustainability
Scott J. Preston**   Chief Operating Officer
Mark B. Oskam   Senior Vice President, Corporate Development

 
 * Mr. Bradley retired from Unimin, effective as of January 2, 2018.
 

 ** Mr. Preston separated from service with Unimin effective as of December  31, 2017.

Executive Summary

Unimin is managed with a long-term perspective. Unimin invests for the future and manages for the next decade, with emphasis on growth,
diversification and sustainable development. Unimin’s business model is built upon the strategic alignment of superior mineral deposits, advanced
production technologies and skilled and innovative people to deliver performance and value to Unimin’s customers.

Likewise, Unimin’s executive compensation program is managed and structured with a long-term perspective. Unimin aligns management and
stakeholder interests through the prudent use of short- and long-term incentives, which encourage executives to focus and execute upon Unimin’s long-
term strategic goals, thereby creating long-term, sustainable growth.

Note on Historical Compensation Decisions

Unimin’s compensation approach is tied to its stage of development. Prior to the Merger, Unimin has been a privately-owned company. As a
result, Unimin has not been subject to any stock exchange listing or SEC rules requiring a majority of the Unimin Board to be independent or relating to
the formation and functioning of board committees, including audit, compensation and nominating committees. Most, if not all, of Unimin’s prior
compensation policies and determinations, including those made for 2017, were based on an annual budgeting process looking at national market
conditions both within and outside of Unimin’s industry, taking into account local conditions where appropriate. Based on this, compensation
recommendations were made to and then approved by the Unimin Chief Executive Officer or the direct managers of the NEOs. Compensation
recommendations for Unimin’s Chief Executive Officer were made by Sibelco’s Chief Executive Officer and approved by Sibelco’s Remuneration
Committee on an annual basis.

Compensation Framework

Unimin’s executive compensation program has included several compensation elements that have each been tailored to reward specific aspects of
company and individual performance. Prior to the Merger, primary elements of Unimin’s executive compensation program have included base salary, an
annual cash bonus, and cash-based performance rights.
 

Base Salary

  

Base salaries are set to be competitive to the marketplace. Base salaries are not automatically adjusted annually, but
they are reviewed on an annual calendar basis. They may also be adjusted when warranted due to changes in an
executive officer’s responsibilities, demonstrated performance or relevant market data.

Table of Contents

Short-Term Incentives

  

Cash incentives reward the achievement of annual corporate and individual goals. For the year ended December 31,
2017, annual incentives were based on established financial targets (EBITDA and Free Operating Cash Flow), as
well as an assessment of individual contribution and performance.

Long-Term Incentives

  

Long-term incentives are used to motivate executives to deliver long-term stockholder value, while also providing a
retention vehicle for Unimin’s executive talent. Going forward as a public company, the combined company intends
to use its 2018 Omnibus Equity Plan to deliver long-term equity awards to its executive team.

Target Pay Mix

Unimin utilizes the particular elements of compensation described above because Unimin believes that these elements provide a well-proportioned
mix of secure compensation, retention value and at-risk compensation, which produces short-term and long-term performance incentives and rewards.
By following this approach, Unimin incentivizes its executives to focus on business metrics that will produce a high level of short-term and long-term
performance for Unimin and long-term wealth creation for the executive, as well as reducing the risk of recruitment of top executive talent by
competitors.

For key executives, including the NEOs, the mix of compensation is weighted toward variable, at-risk pay (annual incentives and long-term
incentives). Maintaining this pay mix results fundamentally in a pay-for-performance orientation for Unimin’s executives, which is aligned with
Unimin’s stated compensation philosophy of providing compensation commensurate with performance.

Compensation Philosophy and Objectives

Unimin has strived to create an executive compensation program that balances short-term versus long-term payments and awards, cash payments
versus equity awards and fixed versus contingent payments and awards in ways that it believes are most appropriate to motivate its executive officers.
Unimin’s executive compensation program is designed to:
 

 •  attract and retain talented and experienced executives in Unimin’s industry;
 

 •  reward executives whose knowledge, skills and performance are critical to Unimin’s success;
 

 
•  align the interests of Unimin’s executive officers and stockholders by motivating executive officers to increase stockholder value and

rewarding executive officers when stockholder value increases;
 

 •  ensure fairness among the executive management team by recognizing the contributions each executive makes to Unimin’s success;
 

 
•  foster a shared commitment among executives by aligning their individual goals with the goals of the executive management team and

Unimin; and
 

 •  compensate Unimin’s executives in a manner that incentivizes them to manage Unimin’s business to meet its long-range objectives.

The compensation paid to Unimin’s NEOs for 2017 is not necessarily indicative of how the combined company will compensate its NEOs
following the closing of the Merger. It is expected that following the closing of the Merger the Combined Company Board will implement new
compensation plans and potentially modify Unimin’s current compensation plans in order to tie a substantial portion of the executives’ overall
compensation to key strategic financial and operational goals.

Role of Compensation Consultants

In connection with the determination of compensation in 2017, Sibelco’s Remuneration Committee engaged the Korn Ferry Hay Group to conduct
a market review and analysis with respect to the appropriateness of certain elements of senior executives’ compensation, including that of Unimin’s
Chief Executive Officer. The data provided by the Korn Ferry Hay Group includes compensation information from more than 2,000 companies
 

223



9/26/2019 DEFM14A

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1010858/000119312518134923/d493258ddefm14a.htm 239/315

Table of Contents

from different industries and of different sizes, including companies in the retail, services, transportation, construction & materials, fast moving
consumer goods, financial, high technology, industrial goods, life sciences, natural resources, oil and gas and other industries. The data considered in
connection with the review by Sibelco’s Remuneration Committee included data from the Korn Ferry Hay Group from 140 organizations (which are not
individually identified) within the United States, spread across various industries and of various sizes. In addition, in evaluating Unimin’s Chief
Executive Officer, who has been employed by Sibelco Australia Ltd and has been working for Unimin in the United States as an expatriate, Sibelco’s
Remuneration Committee also looked at a Korn Ferry Hay Group survey of 473 Australian companies, across a wide range of industries, which included
data on executive level compensation from approximately 170 Australian companies. While no specific percentile within any peer group was targeted in
setting compensation levels, including the level of Unimin’s Chief Executive Officer’s base salary, such data was considered in the broader context of
general comparability with respect to other large U.S. companies (and, with respect to Unimin’s Chief Executive Officer, other large Australian
companies).

Separately, in connection with the Merger and the transition forward as a publicly-traded company, and in order to obtain a better understanding of
the market practices of its peers, Unimin has been working with Aon Hewitt in order to conduct a peer group analysis of compensation practices at peer
competitors. The work with Aon Hewitt is still continuing and was not utilized in determining the compensation of Unimin’s NEOs for 2017.

As Unimin transitions forward as a publicly-traded company, the combined company must continue to ensure that it compensates its executives
appropriately. To that end, the combined company may choose to retain an outside, independent compensation consultant. If and when the combined
company decides to engage a compensation consultant, the combined company will consider the firm’s independence to the extent required by
applicable law.

Risk Assessment of Compensation Programs

Unimin has determined that any risks arising from its current compensation programs and policies are not reasonably likely to have a material
adverse effect on Unimin. Unimin’s compensation programs and policies mitigate risk by combining performance-based, long-term compensation
elements with payouts that are highly correlated to the value delivered to stockholders. The combination of performance measures for annual bonuses
and the equity compensation programs, as well as the multiyear vesting schedules for long-term awards, encourage employees to maintain both a short
and a long-term view with respect to Unimin’s performance.

Elements of Compensation

Unimin’s current executive compensation program consists of the following components:
 

 •  base salary;
 

 •  annual cash incentive awards linked to both Sibelco’s and Unimin’s overall performance;
 

 •  long-term equity-based compensation based on value creation for Sibelco; and
 

 •  other executive benefits and perquisites.

Unimin combines these elements in order to formulate compensation packages that provide competitive pay, reward the achievement of financial,
operational and strategic objectives and align the interests of Unimin’s executive officers and other senior personnel with those of Unimin’s
stakeholders.

Base Salary

A primary component of executive compensation has historically been base salary. The base salary established for Unimin’s executive officers is
intended to reflect each individual’s:
 

 •  responsibilities;
 

 •  experience;
 

 •  prior performance; and

 •  other discretionary factors deemed relevant by Sibelco’s Chief Executive Officer and Remuneration Committee.

In 2017, Sibelco’s Chief Executive Officer and Sibelco’s Remuneration Committee determined base salaries with reference to internal relativities,
factors such as job size and external market data.

The base salaries paid to Unimin’s NEOs in 2017 were as follows:
 

Name   2017 Base Salary 
Campbell J. Jones   $ 751,319 
Andrew D. Eich   $ 408,250 
Andrew G. Bradley   $ 449,128 
Scott J. Preston   $ 409,750 
Mark B. Oskam   $ 338,400 

Base salaries are reviewed during the first quarter of the fiscal year by Sibelco’s Chief Executive Officer and Remuneration Committee for
Unimin’s Chief Executive Officer’s compensation and by the Unimin Chief Executive Officer or the direct manager of the NEOs and may be adjusted
from time to time based on the results of this review. In past years, the appropriate leaders reviewed the performance of all executive officers and, based
on this review and any relevant informal competitive market data made available to him or them during the past year, set the base salary and executive
compensation package for each executive officer for the coming year.

At the request of Sibelco’s Remuneration Committee, a formal market review was conducted by the Korn Ferry Hay Group to ensure Unimin’s
Chief Executive Officer and other senior management are appropriately compensated. The benchmarking data considered in connection with the review
included data from 140 organizations within the United States, spread across various industries and of various sizes. While no specific percentile within
any peer group was targeted in setting compensation levels, including the level of Unimin’s Chief Executive Officer’s base salary, such data was
considered in the broader context of general comparability with respect to similarly situated organizations of similar size.

Annual Incentives

Sibelco’s Chief Executive Officer and Sibelco’s Remuneration Committee have the authority to award annual cash bonuses to Unimin’s executive
officers and others who directly report to Unimin’s Chief Executive Officer. The annual cash bonuses of other positions, including the other NEOs, must
be approved by Unimin’s Chief Executive Officer and the direct manager following consultation with the Remuneration Committee. The annual cash
bonuses are intended to offer incentive compensation by rewarding the achievement of corporate and individual performance objectives.

Typically, at the commencement of an executive officer’s employment with or promotion within Unimin, Sibelco’s Chief Executive Officer and
Remuneration Committee and the Unimin Chief Executive Officer or the executive officer’s direct managers set a target level of bonus compensation
that is structured as a percentage of such executive officer’s annual base salary.

Performance targets are established at the beginning of every plan year. For 2017, Unimin’s short-term incentive plan utilized three types of
objectives: financial, individual, and outperformance.

For participants with a group-wide role, including Mr. Bradley, the weighting of the objectives is as follows:
 

Group Financial (80% weighting)
 

•   70% Group EBITDA (Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization);
•   30% Group FOCF (Free Operating Cash Flow before dividend and growth capex)

Table of Contents

Personal (20% weighting)
 

•   Subjective evaluation by Sibelco’s Chief Executive Officer and by Unimin’s Chief Executive Officer
or the direct managers of the executive officers

Outperformance targets  •   Up to 30% additional bonus opportunity for outperformance in excess of financial targets

For other participants serving in a regional management role, including Messrs. Jones, Eich, Preston and Oskam, the weighting of the objectives is
as follows;
 

Group Financial (50% weighting)
 

•   70% EBITDA (Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization)
•   30% FOCF (Free Operating Cash Flow before growth capex)

Regional Financial (30% weighting)
 

•   70% EBITDA (Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization)
•   30% FOCF (Free Operating Cash Flow before growth capex)

Personal (20% weighting)
 

•   Subjective evaluation by Sibelco’s Chief Executive Officer and by Unimin’s Chief Executive
Officer or the direct managers of the executive officers

Outperformance targets
 

•   Up to 30% additional bonus opportunity for outperformance in excess of financial targets (62.5%
based on Group Performance/37.5% on Regional Performance).

These corporate and individual performance objectives are designed to be challenging but achievable. The corresponding U.S. GAAP measures
for the financial objectives described under Unimin’s short-term incentive plan are net income and net cash flows from operating activities, respectively.

Sibelco’s Chief Executive Officer and Remuneration Committee have the discretion to determine whether and in what amounts such bonuses are
paid based upon his or their subjective and quantitative evaluation of whether the executive officers have achieved their respective objectives and the
impact of their performance on overall corporate objectives. While bonus determinations have typically been formulaic, Sibelco’s Chief Executive
Officer and Remuneration Committee have retained discretion over the ultimate annual bonus determinations. In addition, Sibelco’s Chief Executive
Officer and/or Remuneration Committee may adjust bonuses due to extraordinary or nonrecurring events, such as significant financings, equity offerings
or acquisitions.

For 2017, Sibelco’s Chief Executive Officer and Remuneration Committee established the target percentage amounts for the cash bonuses for
Unimin’s Chief Executive Officer. The Unimin Chief Executive Officer or the direct manager of each of Unimin’s NEOs established the target
percentage amounts for their cash bonuses. For 2017, Messrs. Jones, Eich, Bradley, Preston and Oskam were eligible to receive annual target cash
bonuses up to 65%, 60%, 70%, 50% and 55%, respectively, of their 2017 base salaries. Depending upon corporate and individual performance, each
executive officer could receive an amount in excess of his or her target bonus amount.

Table of Contents

For the 2017 plan year, Unimin’s Chief Executive Officer and other NEOs received a bonus payment equal to 130% of their target bonus. For
2017, Messrs. Jones, Eich and Oskam received an additional flat bonus amount in addition to their target bonus in the amounts of $100,000, $75,000,
and $75,000, respectively. Actual earned cash bonuses in 2017 for Unimin’s NEOs were as follows:
 

Name   

2017
Annual
Bonus  

Campbell J. Jones   $ 684,736 
Andrew D. Eich   $ 395,600 
Andrew G. Bradley   $ 411,300 
Scott J. Preston   $ 268,450 
Mark B. Oskam   $ 319,600 

Unimin believes that establishing cash bonus opportunities helps Unimin attract and retain qualified and highly skilled executives. Annual cash
bonuses are intended to reward executive officers who have a positive impact on corporate results.

Long-Term Incentives

Unimin believes that equity-based compensation awards enable Unimin to attract, motivate, retain and adequately compensate executive talent.
Unimin’s executives have traditionally participated in Sibelco’s Long Term Incentive Plan (the “LTIP”). The LTIP is designed to:
 

 •  align management objectives with stockholders’ long term return, by allowing management to share in the value creation in Sibelco;
 

 •  retain key executives;
 

 •  provide a tool for evaluating and rewarding strategic decisions over a longer time period (more than one year);
 

 •  provide a compensation scheme that is competitive to the market; and
 

 •  align the overall compensation of Sibelco executives with an external market reference.

In 2017, each of Unimin’s NEOs received a grant of rights under the LTIP. These rights would vest at the earliest of three years after the grant date
based on Equity Value Creation (as defined in the LTIP plan document). Equity Value is determined by a formula that considers various financial
performance parameters, such as EBITDA, EBIT and Net Result (as defined in the LTIP plan document). Value Creation in any given period is the
difference between the Equity Value as determined based on the audited financial statements of the year preceding the year of grant and of the second,
third, fourth, fifth or sixth year following the year of grant. If any rights vest, and a participant exercises those rights, a participant can receive a cash
bonus.

Historically, Sibelco’s Chief Executive Officer and Remuneration Committee have made all long-term incentive grant decisions with respect to
Unimin’s executive officers. Following the closing of the Merger, any equity awards made to the combined company’s executive officers will be made
pursuant to the combined company’s 2018 Omnibus Incentive Plan. See the section entitled “Description of 2018 Omnibus Incentive Plan” below for a
full description of the combined company’s proposed 2018 Omnibus Incentive Plan.

Other Executive Policies and Provisions

Executive Benefits and Perquisites

Unimin provides the following benefits to its executive officers on the same basis as other eligible employees:
 

 •  health insurance;
 

 •  vacation, personal holidays and sick days;
 

227



9/26/2019 DEFM14A

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1010858/000119312518134923/d493258ddefm14a.htm 243/315

Table of Contents

 •  life insurance and supplemental life insurance;
 

 •  short-term and long-term disability;
 

 
•  a 401(k) plan with matching contributions, which, for certain executives, includes a component with annual company contributions pursuant

to Section 401(a) of the Code; and
 

 •  Unimin’s Pension and Restoration Plan (for Campbell Jones and Andrew Bradley).

Unimin believes that these benefits are generally consistent with those offered by other companies and specifically with those companies with
which Unimin competes for employees.

Employment Agreements and Severance and Change of Control Benefits

Unimin believes that a strong, experienced management team is essential to the best interests of Unimin and its stockholders. Unimin recognizes
that the possibility of a change in control could result in the departure or distraction of members of its management team to the detriment of Unimin and
its stockholders. Accordingly, Unimin determined to enter into employment agreements with certain of its NEOs in order to minimize employment
security concerns and allow them to focus on their duties to Unimin. These benefits, which are payable in connection with certain terminations of
employment, are enumerated and quantified in the section captioned “—Employment Agreements and Severance Letter.”

Section 162(m) Compliance

Section 162(m) of the Code limits Unimin to a deduction for federal income tax purposes of no more than $1 million of compensation paid to
certain executive officers in a taxable year. Section 162(m) of the Code did not apply to Unimin’s 2017 fiscal year, as Unimin did not have publicly held
common stock during this fiscal year. Recent changes in U.S. federal tax law have substantially modified the rules governing the deductibility of
compensation under Section 162(m) of the Code. Following the closing of the Merger, the combined company will consider the requirements of
Section 162(m) of the Code in determining the amounts and structure of compensation to be paid to executive officers covered by Section 162(m) of the
Code, but the combined company expressly preserves flexibility to award compensation that may not be deductible under Section 162(m) of the Code.

Section 409A Considerations

Section 409A of the Code affects the manner by which deferred compensation opportunities are offered to employees because Section 409A of the
Code requires, among other things, that “non-qualified deferred compensation” be structured in a manner that limits employees’ abilities to accelerate or
further defer certain kinds of deferred compensation. Unimin intends to operate its existing compensation arrangements that are covered by
Section 409A of the Code in accordance with the applicable rules thereunder, and the combined company will continue to review and amend its
compensation arrangements where necessary to comply with Section 409A of the Code.

Pension Restoration Plan

The Unimin Corporation Pension Restoration Plan is intended to ensure that employees participating in the Unimin Corporation Pension Plan,
whose funded benefits are or will be limited by the compensation limitations imposed by Section 401(a)(17) of the Code, receive the level of benefits
anticipated to be paid under the Unimin Corporation Pension Plan based on the Unimin Corporation Pension Plan’s definition of compensation, applied
without limitation. The Unimin Corporation Pension Restoration Plan is completely separate and does not qualify for any special tax treatment under the
Code. Campbell Jones and Andrew Bradley are the only executives currently participating in the Unimin Corporation Pension Restoration Plan.

Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718

Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718 (“Topic 718”) requires a public company to measure the cost
of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award. Unimin intends to ensure
that its equity awards to its

executive officers are structured to comply with the requirements of Topic 718 to maintain the appropriate equity accounting treatment, and it is
anticipated that the combined company will takes such accounting treatment into account when designing and implementing its compensation programs.

Employment Agreements and Severance Letter

Campbell J. Jones

Unimin entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Jones effective from May 1, 2015 to April 30, 2018. Under the agreement, Unimin has
employed Mr. Jones as its Chief Executive Officer. Pursuant to the employment agreement, Unimin pays Mr. Jones his base salary in U.S. dollars in
monthly installments, provided that Mr. Jones may elect to receive up to 50% in Australian dollars. Mr. Jones’s salary is subject to annual review by
Sibelco’s Chief Executive Officer and Remuneration Committee. During the term of his employment, Mr. Jones is entitled to participate in Sibelco’s
short term cash incentive plan, with the opportunity set at 65% of base salary. Mr. Jones may also be selected to participate in the LTIP. In connection
with Mr. Jones’s relocation from Australia to the United States to become Unimin’s Chief Executive Officer, the agreement includes typical expatriate
provisions, including tax equalization, tax return preparation, a housing allowance, including utility reimbursement, relocation costs and the cost of
airfare for Mr. Jones and his family for one round trip visit per year to/from the United States and Australia. Mr. Jones is also entitled to a company car
or, at his election, to receive the equivalent value in cash.

Unimin’s employment agreement with Mr. Jones contains non-competition and confidentiality provisions. Under the non-competition provision,
during the term of the employment agreement and for a period of two years thereafter, Mr. Jones may not, directly or indirectly, manage, operate,
control, participate in, accept employment or a consulting position with, render any services to, or otherwise advise or assist or be connected with or
directly or indirectly own or have any interest in (other than ownership of less than 2% of the outstanding shares of any class of) any enterprise in any
competitive business in any defined geographic area. A “competitive business” is described as any business operating in any line of business in which
Unimin generates more than $500,000 per year in revenue, and the “geographic area” is generally described as the area within a circle with Unimin’s
location at the center and encompassing locations that contain customer sites representing 80% of Unimin’s revenue with respect to the competing
product or within five miles of a railroad line operated by Unimin. Under the confidentiality provision, Mr. Jones may not disclose any trade secrets or
confidential information during the term of the agreement or thereafter, except as required in the performance of his duties.

If Mr. Jones’s employment terminates due to his death or disability, Mr. Jones or his personal representatives would be entitled to receive, in
addition to any amounts earned and accrued but unpaid as of the date of such termination, (i) 100% of the maximum bonus plan compensation payable
in respect of the year in which such termination occurs, adjusted for the portion of the year worked before such termination, and (ii) 50% of his base
salary for two years after termination.

Upon the expiration of the employment agreement and any extension thereof, in the event that Sibelco is unable to offer Mr. Jones an executive
role in Australia on terms no less favorable than those immediately in effect prior to Mr. Jones’s secondment to the United States, Unimin would be
obligated to pay Mr. Jones (i) separation pay (redundancy) in an amount equal to four (4) weeks’ pay for each year of service with Unimin or any entity
owned or controlled by Sibelco, together with any annual leave or long service leave to which Mr. Jones may otherwise be entitled, and (ii) within six
(6) months following the expiration or termination of the employment agreement for any reason other than “for cause”, reimbursement of reasonable
costs in connection with Mr. Jones’s family’s relocation to Australia. Pursuant to the employment agreement, “for cause” is described as theft, fraud or
embezzlement, or misappropriation of funds from Unimin or failure to follow any lawful directive of Sibelco’s Chief Executive Officer. See “—
Completion Bonus Letter Agreements; Change in Control Agreements” for information on severance payments to Mr. Jones under his Change in
Control Agreement.

In connection with the Merger, Unimin has entered into a supplemental severance agreement with Mr. Jones. Pursuant to the agreement, Unimin
agreed that if from the date of the agreement through 60 months after the closing date of the Merger, Unimin terminates his employment for other than
cause (as defined therein), or if between the 25th and 60th month after the closing date of the Merger Mr. Jones resigns his employment for any reason
(as defined therein), Mr. Jones shall be entitled to receive (1) a lump-sum severance payment equal to 24 months of his total base salary package in
effect as of the date of the agreement or the date of termination of his employment, whichever is greater ($790,465 as of February 21, 2018), (2) six
months of continued health benefits program coverage for Mr. Jones and his dependents, (3) a pro-rata portion of 100% of Mr. Jones’ maximum bonus
compensation that could have been awarded to him for the year in which termination or resignation occurs, (4) reimbursement of the actual cost of
support to complete any tax returns in Australia and the United States for two years after termination, and (5) reimbursement for the cost of relocating
and for certain relocation costs of Mr. Jones’ family. This agreement will continue for 60 months after the closing date of the Merger.

Scott J. Preston

Unimin entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Preston effective February 29, 2016. Under the agreement, Unimin agreed to employ
Mr. Preston as its Chief Operating Officer for an initial term of three years, through March 1, 2019, with automatic renewal terms of one year unless
Unimin gives 60 days’ notice of its intent not to renew. The agreement provides that Mr. Preston would receive annual reviews of his base salary by
Unimin’s President, that Mr. Preston is entitled to participate in Sibelco’s short term cash incentive plan, with the opportunity set at a minimum of 50%
of his base salary, and that Mr. Preston may also be selected to participate in the LTIP.

Unimin’s employment agreement with Mr. Preston contains a covenant not to compete. Under this provision, during the term of Mr. Preston’s
employment and for a period of one year thereafter, Mr. Preston may not hold a competitive position with a competitor in a restricted territory. A
“competitive position” includes a position in which Mr. Preston might disclose confidential information or assist a company whose business is the same
as Unimin’s concerning production of products that will compete with Unimin’s products or any third party whose business or major segment thereof is
the mining, production or processing of silica or other industrial minerals or materials for use as a proppant in the hydraulic fracturing process or for any
other extraction or excavation process in the oil, gas or other energy related industry, and who is engaged in direct competition with Unimin; or any third
party who owns or operates, intends to own or operate, or is preparing to own or operate a subsidiary, affiliate, or business line or business segment
whose business is or is expected to be engaged in the activities described above, and who is engaged in direct competition with Unimin. The “restricted
territory” generally means the area within a circle with Unimin’s location at the center and encompassing locations that contain customer sites
representing 80% of Unimin’s revenue with respect to the competing product or within five miles of a railroad line operated by Unimin. Under the
confidentiality provision, Mr. Preston may not disclose Unimin’s confidential information or trade secrets during the term of the agreement or thereafter,
except as required in the performance of his duties or if required by law.

As noted above, Mr. Preston left his position as Unimin’s Chief Operating Officer effective December 31, 2017, and entered into a settlement
agreement and mutual general release with Unimin. Pursuant to the terms of the settlement agreement, subject to Mr. Preston’s re-execution and
non-revocation of the agreement, which includes a mutual release of claims, Unimin agreed to (i) pay Mr. Preston a lump sum amount of $920,000
within thirty days of December 31, 2017, (ii) pay on behalf of Mr. Preston premiums or equivalent premiums for Mr. Preston’s and his family’s coverage
under Unimin’s group medical and group dental plans to the extent that Mr. Preston elects continued coverage thereunder pursuant to COBRA for the
eighteen month period beginning on January 1, 2018 through June 30, 2019, (iii) transfer all rights, title and ownership interest in the Unimin
automobile in Mr. Preston’s possession to Mr. Preston and (iv) provide up to six (6) months of outplacement services at no cost to Mr. Preston.

Pursuant to Mr. Preston’s settlement agreement with Unimin, Mr. Preston (i) received a lump sum payment of $920,000, (ii) will receive 18
months’ of Unimin-paid COBRA premiums approximately totaling $46,620 for the period beginning on January 1, 2018 through June 30, 2019, (iii)
received $45,762.50, representing the

approximate book value of the transfer of all rights, title and ownership interest in the Unimin automobile in Mr. Preston’s possession to Mr. Preston,
and (iv) received $4,500, representing the approximate value of six (6) months of outplacement services for Mr. Preston.

Andrew G. Bradley

Pursuant to a severance letter with Mr. Bradley, in the event that Mr. Bradley resigns on or prior to July 31, 2018, or if Unimin were to
involuntarily terminate Mr. Bradley’s employment at any time for any reason, in either case with at least three months’ notice, subject to Mr. Bradley’s
execution of a general release of claims in favor of Unimin, Unimin agreed to provide Mr. Bradley with severance equal to 18 months of his then current
base salary, an amount in respect of his annual incentive for the year in which such termination occurs, and continuation of health insurance benefits for
a specified period.

As noted above, Mr. Bradley retired from his position as Unimin’s Global Vice President, Safety, Health & Sustainability, effective
January 2, 2018. Under the letter agreement with Mr. Bradley, and following his execution of a standard general release of claims, Mr. Bradley received
(i) a lump sum severance equal to 18 months of his base salary, or $677,850, (ii) an amount in respect of his annual incentive for 2017, or $411,300, (iii)
18 months of Unimin-paid COBRA premiums totaling approximately $15,660 for the period beginning on January 1, 2018 through June 20, 2019 and
(iv) $35,015, representing the approximate book value of the transfer of all rights, title and ownership interest in the Unimin automobile in Mr. Bradley’s
possession. Mr. Bradley will also receive a lump sum distribution of his accrued pension pursuant to the plan documents.

Andrew Eich

In connection with the Merger, Unimin has agreed to pay certain relocation expenses that may be incurred by Andrew Eich. The total relocation
package will not exceed $250,000.

Completion Bonus Letter Agreements; Change in Control Agreements

Unimin has entered into bonus letter agreements with each of Messrs. Jones, Eich and Oskam. Pursuant to the bonus letter agreements, so long as
(i) the executives remain continuously employed by Unimin until December 31, 2018 and do not voluntarily resign their employment other than for
Good Reason (as defined in the bonus letter agreements) or are involuntary terminated by Unimin other than for Cause (as defined in the bonus letter
agreements) and (ii) the transactions contemplated by the Merger are consummated on or prior to December 31, 2018, each of Messrs. Jones, Eich and
Oskam will receive a lump sum payment of 450,000AUD, $200,000 and $150,000, respectively, on or before December 31, 2018. Pursuant to the bonus
letter agreements, in the event that the executives voluntarily terminate their employment with Unimin for Good Reason (as defined in the CIC
Agreements described below) at any time after the Closing Date (as defined in the Merger Agreement) but before December 31, 2018, or are
involuntarily terminated by Unimin for reasons other than for Cause, the executives will be paid the entire lump sum payment upon such termination of
employment.

In November 2017 and December 2017, each of Messrs. Jones, Eich and Oskam entered into a Change in Control Agreement (each, a “CIC
Agreement”) that was approved by the Sibelco Remuneration Committee. Under the CIC Agreements, if Unimin terminates such NEO’s employment
other than for “cause” (as defined in the CIC Agreements), or if such NEO voluntarily terminates for “good reason” (as defined in the CIC Agreements),
in either case, from the date of the agreement until 36 months following shareholder approval of any merger or statutory plan of exchange involving
Unimin, then such NEO will be entitled to (i) a lump sum severance payment (24 months’ annual base salary for Mr. Jones and 18 months’ annual base
salary for Messrs. Eich and Oskam), (ii) a lump sum payment equal to a pro-rata portion of 100% of the maximum bonus compensation payable under
the applicable short term incentive plan for each such NEO for the year in which such termination occurs, and (iii) Unimin paid COBRA premiums (24
months for Mr. Jones and 18 months for Messrs. Eich and Oskam).

As a condition to receiving such severance benefits, such NEO must execute and not revoke a standard release of claims relating to his
employment. If such NEO has any other agreement with Unimin that provides for severance payments and/or continued health benefits program
coverage, such NEO will be entitled to receive the greater of the benefits under the other agreement or those under the CIC Agreement, but not both.

Potential Payments upon Termination or in Connection with a Change in Control

The following paragraphs set forth quantitative estimates of the benefits that would have accrued to certain of Unimin’s NEOs upon various
terminations of employment or in connection with a change in control if the applicable event occurred on December 31, 2017.

Campbell J. Jones

In the event that Mr. Jones was terminated by Unimin for reasons other than for Cause (as defined in the CIC Agreement), or voluntarily resigned
his employment with Unimin for Good Reason (as defined in the CIC Agreement), in either case, on December 31, 2017, pursuant to his CIC
Agreement, and subject to his execution and non-revocation of a standard release of claims in favor of Unimin, Mr. Jones would receive (i) a lump sum
severance payment of $1,580,930, representing 24 months’ annual base salary for Mr. Jones, (ii) a lump sum payment equal to $513,802, representing
100% of the maximum bonus compensation payable under the applicable short term incentive plan for 2017, and (iii) 24 months’ of Unimin-paid
COBRA premiums approximately totaling $41,640. In addition, Mr. Jones would receive a lump sum payment of 450,000AUD pursuant to his bonus
letter agreement.

Andrew D. Eich

In the event that Mr. Eich was terminated by Unimin for reasons other than for Cause (as defined in the CIC Agreement), or voluntarily resigned
his employment with Unimin for Good Reason (as defined in the CIC Agreement), in either case, on December 31, 2017, pursuant to his CIC
Agreement, and subject to his execution and non-revocation of a standard release of claims in favor of Unimin, Mr. Eich would receive (i) a lump sum
severance payment of $616,500, representing 18 months’ annual base salary for Mr. Eich, (ii) a lump sum payment equal to $246,600, representing
100% of the maximum bonus compensation payable under the applicable short term incentive plan for 2017 and (iii) 18 months’ of Unimin-paid
COBRA premiums approximately totaling $46,620. In addition, Mr. Eich would receive a lump sum payment of $200,000 pursuant to his bonus letter
agreement.

Mark B. Oskam

In the event that Mr. Oskam was terminated by Unimin for reasons other than for Cause (as defined in the CIC Agreement), or voluntarily
resigned his employment with Unimin for Good Reason (as defined in the CIC Agreement), in either case, on December 31, 2017, pursuant to his CIC
Agreement, and subject to his execution and non-revocation of a standard release of claims in favor of Unimin, Mr. Oskam would receive (i) a lump sum
severance payment of $513,000, representing 18 months’ annual base salary for Mr. Oskam, (ii) a lump sum payment equal to $188,100, representing
100% of the maximum bonus compensation payable under the applicable short term incentive plan for 2017 and (iii) 18 months’ of Unimin-paid
COBRA premiums approximately totaling $46,620. In addition, Mr. Oskam would receive a lump sum payment of $150,000 pursuant to his bonus letter
agreement.

Director Compensation

Unimin has not historically provided cash compensation to directors for their services as directors or members of committees of the Unimin
Board. Unimin has reimbursed and will continue to reimburse its non-employee directors for their reasonable expenses incurred in attending meetings of
the Unimin Board and its committees. Following the closing of the Merger, it is anticipated that the Combined Company Board will adopt a
compensation program for its directors.

Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation

Unimin is a wholly owned subsidiary of its parent company, Sibelco, a privately-owned Belgian company. During the last fiscal year, Unimin did
not have a compensation committee or any other committee of the Unimin Board performing equivalent functions. Compensation recommendations for
Unimin’s Chief Executive Officer were made by Sibelco’s Chief Executive Officer and approved by Sibelco’s Remuneration Committee. Compensation
of Unimin’s other executive officers was approved by the Unimin Chief Executive Officer or the

direct managers of the respective executive officer following the principle that compensation changes must be approved by the manager of the manager
of the compensation recipient (i.e. a two-up principle). Unimin’s Chief Executive Officer participated in deliberations regarding executive officer
compensation. For a discussion of various transactions between Sibelco and the combined company, see “Certain Relationships and Related Party
Transactions—Relationship with Sibelco.”

Limitations of Liability and Indemnification Matters

The combined company will adopt provisions in its certificate of incorporation that will limit the liability of its directors for monetary damages for
breach of their fiduciary duties, except for liability that cannot be eliminated under the DGCL. Delaware law provides that a corporation’s directors will
not be personally liable for monetary damages for breach of their fiduciary duties as directors, except for liability for any of the following:
 

 •  any breach of their duty of loyalty to the corporation or its stockholders;
 

 •  acts or omissions not in good faith or that involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law;
 

 •  unlawful payments of dividends or unlawful stock repurchases or redemptions as provided in Section 174 of the DGCL; or
 

 •  any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit.

This limitation of liability does not apply to liabilities arising under the federal securities laws and does not affect the availability of equitable
remedies such as injunctive relief or rescission.

The combined company’s certificate of incorporation and the combined company’s bylaws also will provide that the combined company will
indemnify its directors and executive officers and may indemnify its other officers and employees and other agents to the fullest extent permitted by law.
It is believed that indemnification under the combined company’s bylaws covers at least negligence and gross negligence on the part of indemnified
parties. The combined company’s bylaws also permit the combined company to secure insurance on behalf of any officer, director, employee or other
agent for any liability arising out of his or her actions in this capacity, regardless of whether the bylaws would permit indemnification.

Description of 2018 Omnibus Incentive Plan

In connection with the closing of the Merger, the combined company intends to adopt the 2018 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “2018 Plan”). The
2018 Plan will provide for grants of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, other stock-based awards and other cash-based awards.
Directors, officers and other employees of the combined company and its subsidiaries, as well as others performing consulting or advisory services for
the combined company, will be eligible for grants under the 2018 Plan. The purpose of the 2018 Plan is to provide incentives that will attract, retain and
motivate high performing officers, directors, employees and consultants by providing them with appropriate incentives and rewards either through a
proprietary interest in the combined company’s long-term success or compensation based on their performance in fulfilling their personal
responsibilities. Set forth below is a summary of the material terms of the 2018 Plan.

Administration. The 2018 Plan will be administered as determined by the Combined Company Board. For purposes of this discussion, the body
that administers the 2018 Plan is referred to as the “Administrator.” Among the Administrator’s powers is to determine the form, amount and other
terms and conditions of awards; clarify, construe or resolve any ambiguity in any provision of the 2018 Plan or any award agreement; amend the terms
of outstanding awards; and adopt such rules, forms, instruments and guidelines for administering the 2018 Plan as it deems necessary or proper. The
Administrator has authority to administer and interpret the 2018 Plan, to grant discretionary awards under the 2018 Plan, to determine the persons to
whom awards will be granted, to determine the types of awards to be granted, to determine the terms and conditions of each award, to determine the
number of shares of common stock to be covered by each award, to make all other determinations in connection with the 2018 Plan and the awards
thereunder as the Administrator deems necessary or desirable and to delegate authority under the 2018 Plan to the combined company’s executive
officers. To the extent the combined company seeks

Table of Contents

to obtain the benefit of exemptions available under Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act or Section 162(m) of the Code, the applicable compensation
may be approved by “non-employee directors” or “outside directors,” respectively.

Available Shares. The aggregate number of shares of combined company common stock that may be issued or used for reference purposes under
the 2018 Plan or with respect to which awards may be granted will be determined by the Combined Company Board. The number of shares available for
issuance under the 2018 Plan may be subject to adjustment in the event of a reorganization, stock split, merger or similar change in the corporate
structure or the outstanding shares of common stock. In the event of any of these occurrences, the combined company may make any adjustments it
considers appropriate to, among other things, the number and kind of shares, options or other property available for issuance under the plan or covered
by grants previously made under the 2018 Plan. The shares available for issuance under the 2018 Plan may be, in whole or in part, either authorized and
unissued shares of combined company common stock or shares of common stock held in or acquired for the combined company’s treasury. In general, if
awards under the 2018 Plan are for any reason cancelled, or expire or terminate unexercised, the shares covered by such awards may again be available
for the grant of awards under the 2018 Plan.

The 2018 Plan includes certain annual grant limitations that historically were included in plans of this type in order to satisfy the requirements for
the performance-based compensation exception under Section 162(m) of the Code. In light of recent changes in U.S. federal tax law, these limitations
may no longer be necessary for purposes of Section 162(m) of the Code, but due to uncertainty with respect to Section 162(m) of the Code, the 2018
Plan has included these limitations to remain consistent with historical compensation practices in the market. To the extent that applicable law, market
compensation practices or other rules or regulations governing the combined company no longer require these annual grant limitations (other than the
annual grant limitation described below for non-employee directors), the Administrator will have the ability to disapply these limitations as it determines
to be appropriate in its sole discretion. To the extent that the annual grant limitations remain applicable, the Combined Company Board will determine
the following parameters: (i) the maximum number of shares of combined company common stock with respect to which any stock option, stock
appreciation right, shares of restricted stock or other stock-based awards that may subject to the attainment of specified performance goals and may be
granted under the 2018 Plan during any fiscal year to any eligible individual (per type of award), (ii) the maximum number of total shares of combined
company common stock with respect to all awards that may be granted under the 2018 Plan during any fiscal year to any eligible individual, (iii) the
maximum number of shares of combined company common stock subject to any performance award that may be granted under the 2018 Plan during
any fiscal year to any eligible individual, and (iv) the maximum value of a cash payment made under a performance award which may be granted under
the 2018 Plan during any fiscal year to any eligible individual. In addition, the aggregate grant date fair value (computed as of the date of grant in
accordance with applicable financial accounting rules) of all types of awards granted under the 2018 Plan to any individual non-employee director in
any fiscal year (excluding awards made pursuant to deferred compensation arrangements in lieu of all or a portion of cash retainers and any stock
dividends payable in respect of outstanding awards, as well as, for the avoidance of doubt, any cash retainers) will not exceed the maximum amount to
be determined by the Combined Company Board. There are no annual limits on the number of shares of combined company common stock with respect
to an award of restricted stock that are not subject to the attainment of specified performance goals to eligible individuals.

Eligibility for Participation. Members of the Combined Company Board, as well as employees of, and consultants to, the combined company or
any of its subsidiaries and affiliates, are eligible to receive awards under the 2018 Plan.

Award Agreement. Awards granted under the 2018 Plan are evidenced by award agreements, which need not be identical, that provide additional
terms, conditions, restrictions and/or limitations covering the grant of the award, including, without limitation, additional terms providing for the
acceleration of exercisability or vesting of awards in the event of a change of control or conditions regarding the participant’s employment, as
determined by the Administrator.

Table of Contents

Stock Options. The Administrator may grant nonqualified stock options to eligible individuals and incentive stock options only to eligible
employees. The Administrator will determine the number of shares of combined company common stock subject to each option, the term of each option,
which may not exceed 10 years, or five years in the case of an incentive stock option granted to a 10 percent stockholder, the exercise price, the vesting
schedule, if any, and the other material terms of each option. No incentive stock option or nonqualified stock option may have an exercise price less than
the fair market value of a share of combined company common stock at the time of grant or, in the case of an incentive stock option granted to a
10 percent stockholder, 110% of such share’s fair market value. Options will be exercisable at such time or times and subject to such terms and
conditions as determined by the Administrator at grant, and the exercisability of such options may be accelerated by the Administrator.

Stock Appreciation Rights. The Administrator may grant stock appreciation rights (“SARs”) either with a stock option, which may be exercised
only at such times and to the extent the related stock option is exercisable (a “Tandem SAR”), or independent of a stock option (a “Non-Tandem SAR”).
An SAR is a right to receive a payment in shares of combined company common stock or cash, as determined by the Administrator, equal in value to the
excess of the fair market value of one share of combined company common stock on the date of exercise over the exercise price per share established in
connection with the grant of the SAR. The term of each SAR may not exceed 10 years. The exercise price per share covered by a SAR will be the
exercise price per share of the related stock option in the case of a Tandem SAR and will be the fair market value of combined company common stock
on the date of grant in the case of a Non-Tandem SAR. The Administrator may also grant limited SARs, either as Tandem SARs or Non-Tandem SARs,
which may become exercisable only upon the occurrence of a change in control, as defined in the 2018 Plan, or such other event as the Administrator
may designate at the time of grant or thereafter.

Restricted Stock. The Administrator may award shares of restricted stock. Except as otherwise provided by the Administrator upon the award of
restricted stock, the recipient generally has the rights of a stockholder with respect to the shares, including the right to receive dividends, the right to vote
the shares of restricted stock and, conditioned upon full vesting of shares of restricted stock, the right to tender such shares, subject to the conditions and
restrictions generally applicable to restricted stock or specifically set forth in the recipient’s restricted stock agreement. The Administrator may
determine at the time of award that the payment of dividends, if any, will be deferred until the expiration of the applicable restriction period.

Recipients of restricted stock will be required to enter into a restricted stock agreement with the combined company that states the restrictions to
which the shares are subject, which may include satisfaction of pre-established performance goals, and the criteria or date or dates on which such
restrictions will lapse.

If the grant of restricted stock or the lapse of the relevant restrictions is based on the attainment of performance goals, the Administrator will
establish for each recipient the applicable performance goals, formulae or standards and the applicable vesting percentages with reference to the
attainment of such goals or satisfaction of such formulae or standards while the outcome of the performance goals are substantially uncertain. Such
performance goals may incorporate provisions for disregarding, or adjusting for, changes in accounting methods, corporate transactions, including,
without limitation, dispositions and acquisitions, and other similar events or circumstances. The performance goals for performance-based restricted
stock generally maybe based on one or more of the objective criteria set forth in the 2018 Plan and are discussed in general below.

Other Stock-Based Awards. The Administrator may, subject to limitations under applicable law, make a grant of such other stock-based awards,
including, without limitation, PSUs, dividend equivalent units, stock equivalent units, RSUs and deferred stock units under the 2018 Plan that are
payable in cash or denominated or payable in or valued by shares of combined company common stock or factors that influence the value of such
shares. The Administrator may determine the terms and conditions of any such other awards, which may include the achievement of certain minimum
performance goals and/or a minimum vesting period. The performance goals for performance-based other stock-based awards generally may be based
on one or more of the objective criteria set forth in the 2018 Plan and discussed in general below.

Table of Contents

Other Cash-Based Awards. The Administrator may grant awards payable in cash. Cash-based awards will be in such form, and dependent on such
conditions, as the Administrator will determine, including, without limitation, being subject to the satisfaction of vesting conditions or awarded purely as
a bonus and not subject to restrictions or conditions. If a cash-based award is subject to vesting conditions, the Administrator may accelerate the vesting
of such award in its discretion.

Performance Awards. The Administrator may grant a performance award to a participant payable upon the attainment of specific performance
goals. If the performance award is payable in cash, it may be paid upon the attainment of the relevant performance goals either in cash or in shares of
restricted stock, based on the then current fair market value of such shares, as determined by the Administrator. Based on service, performance and/or
other factors or criteria, the Administrator may, at or after grant, accelerate the vesting of all or any part of any performance award.

Performance Goals. Awards that are granted, vest or are paid based on attainment of specified performance goals may be subject to any one or
more of the following performance measures or such other performance measures as determined by the committee in its sole discretion taking into
account the requirements of applicable law and customary market compensation practices. These performance goals may be based on the attainment of a
certain target level of, or a specified increase or decrease in, one or more of the following measures selected by the committee: (1) earnings per share;
(2) operating income; (3) gross income; (4) net income, before or after taxes; (5) cash flow; (6) gross profit; (7) gross profit return on investment;
(8) gross margin return on investment; (9) gross margin; (10) operating margin; (11) working capital; (12) earnings before interest and taxes;
(13) earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization; (14) return on equity; (15) return on assets; (16) return on capital; (17) return on
invested capital; (18) net revenues; (19) gross revenues; (20) revenue growth; (21) annual recurring revenues; (22) recurring revenues; (23) license
revenues; (24) sales or market share; (25) total shareholder return; (26) economic value added; (27) specified objectives with regard to limiting the level
of increase in all or a portion of our bank debt or other long-term or short-term public or private debt or other similar financial obligations, which may
be calculated net of cash balances and other offsets and adjustments as may be established by the Administrator; (28) the fair market value of a share of
combined company common stock; (29) the growth in the value of an investment in combined company common stock assuming the reinvestment of
dividends; or (30) reduction in operating expenses.

To the extent permitted by law, the Administrator may also exclude the impact of an event or occurrence that the Administrator determines should
be appropriately excluded, such as: (1) restructurings, discontinued operations, unusual or infrequently occurring events or non-recurring charges; (2) an
event either not directly related to the combined company’s operations or not within the reasonable control of management; or (3) a change in
accounting standards required by generally accepted accounting principles.

Performance goals may also be based on an individual participant’s performance goals, as determined by the Administrator.

In addition, all performance goals may be based upon the attainment of specified levels of combined company performance, or the performance of
a subsidiary, division or other operational unit, under one or more of the measures described above relative to the performance of other corporations.

BUSINESS

Unimin is an application-focused minerals company providing materials solutions to its customers drawing from a diversified product portfolio
with 28 million tons of production capacity as of December 31, 2017. Unimin produces a wide range of specialized silica sand, micro crystalline silica,
feldspar, nepheline syenite, calcium carbonate, clay, kaolin, lime and limestone for use by energy and industrial customers in North America and around
the world. Its 31 mining facilities with reserves (including one facility currently under construction) and nine processing facilities (one of which is
inactive) span the United States, Mexico and Canada and have access to more than 475 million tons of mineral reserves (as defined by the SEC).
Unimin’s frac sand facilities are among the largest, most flexible and cost-efficient facilities in the industry, and Unimin’s industrial assets are located in
close proximity to key industrial customers. Unimin’s parent company, SCR-Sibelco NV, is a 145 year global leader in the production of industrial
minerals with operations in over 40 countries. This heritage brings a strong history and expertise in operational excellence, customer collaboration and
application development that is coupled with a global perspective and market understanding, sustainability and durable, returns-oriented investing.
During the year ended December 31, 2017, Unimin had revenue of approximately $1.44 billion and sold more than 23 million tons of minerals.

Unimin operates through two reporting segments, an Energy segment and an Industrial segment:
 

 

•  Energy. Unimin’s Energy segment is a leading global supplier of sand-based proppants, with more than 13 million tons of low cost raw frac
sand capacity and 350,000 tons of resin coated sand capacity (both active and idle) as of December 31, 2017. Unimin offers the oil and gas
industry a comprehensive portfolio of raw frac sand, resin coated sands, well cementing additives, gravel packing media and drilling mud
additives that meet or exceed American Petroleum Institute (“API”) standards. In order to serve the energy industry, Unimin has developed
one of the most comprehensive supply chains in the proppant industry with large, unit train capable processing facilities situated on the
Union Pacific, Canadian Pacific, CSX and BNSF railroads. Unimin’s supply chain capabilities in the Energy segment include 32 operating
terminals, approximately 9,900 railcars as well as barging capabilities. Unimin’s high quality Northern White, regional frac sand and resin
portfolio, together with its leading logistics network, makes Unimin a supplier of choice in the industry. In 2017, Unimin further expanded
its capacity at several Northern White locations and began development of a new 3 million ton greenfield facility in West Texas in order to
serve customers in the Permian basin. These expansions are expected to increase Unimin’s production capacity to 17.8 million tons in 2018.
During the year ended December 31, 2017, Unimin’s Energy segment generated revenue of $655.9 million and sold more than 11.2 million
tons of minerals.

 

 

•  Industrial. Unimin’s Industrial segment sells value-added products to the glass, ceramics, construction, coatings, polymers, foundry and
various other industries. For Unimin, these industries are characterized by stable volumes, a blue chip customer base and predictable
performance. Unimin differentiates itself in the Industrial segment by providing a diverse portfolio of products and solutions together with
deep technical application know-how that improves the performance of its industrial customers’ processes and products. Unimin sells its
products from high quality, low cost facilities, which are typically located in close proximity to its customers in industries such as glass and
foundry. In addition, Unimin is Sibelco’s exclusive North American distributor for specialty clays and other high value minerals, which
Unimin sells to its core customers. These characteristics make Unimin the supplier of choice for many of the largest industrial companies in
North America. During the year ended December 31, 2017, Unimin’s Industrial segment generated revenue of $639.2 million and sold over
12.1 million tons of minerals.

Unimin serves a broad range of industries, minerals and geographies. During 2017, approximately 52% of Unimin’s volume was sold in the
Industrial segment, with the remaining 48% sold in the Energy segment (excluding the Electronics segment which will not be part of the combined
company following the Merger). Unimin’s Industrial segment services a wide range of industries through sales of multiple minerals that, as a whole,
have delivered stable volumes historically, particularly as compared to the Energy segment. Unimin’s

sales are geographically diverse, with significant mineral sales in Mexico, particularly in the glass and ceramics industries. This diversification creates a
highly resilient business model with strong cash flow generation and significant opportunities for both organic and inorganic growth.

Strengths of the Combined Company

Unimin believes that, following the closing of the Merger, the combined company will demonstrate the following strengths, which will
differentiate the combined company from its peers:

A Leading North American Industrial Silica and Minerals Producer. Following the closing of the Merger, the combined company will be a
leading industrial silica and minerals producer in North America, with more than 50 processing and coating facilities, total processing capacity of
approximately 45 million tons and approximately 1.4 billion tons of mineral reserves (as defined by the SEC). The combined company will also have a
distinct asset base, with leading Northern White sand facilities, two in-basin facilities in the Permian basin and a major nepheline syenite deposit. The
combined company’s frac sand facilities are among the largest facilities in the industry, and the combined company’s industrial assets are located in
close proximity to key industrial customers. Unimin believes that these characteristics will make the combined company a compelling supplier to
customers, who rely on the consistent delivery of raw materials from a stable, long-term partner. Unimin expects that the combined company will be a
leader in sales of raw frac sand and resin coated proppants to the oil and gas industry, as well as in sales to glass, foundry and coatings and
polymers producers.

Longstanding Customer Relationships Built On Differentiated Capabilities. Both Unimin and Fairmount Santrol have longstanding customer
relationships built on their respective differentiated capabilities. Unimin has enjoyed long-term relationships with a strong blue chip customer base
(consisting of numerous S&P 500 and similar leading companies across North America), in both its Energy segment and in its Industrial segment.
Unimin believes these relationships derive from its broad product offering across multiple minerals and its dedication to quality, consistency and product
innovation. Unimin’s experience in multiple minerals and industries has afforded Unimin access to an extensive network of technical capabilities,
including advanced mineral processing, coating technologies, resins, blending and mineral systems engineering. These capabilities enable Unimin to
collaborate with its customers to improve the performance of their products and equipment and develop new products to meet their needs. Similarly,
Fairmount Santrol has been a trusted partner for its customers with significant long-term relationships, including deep relationships with U.S. pressure
pumping companies as well as many oilfield service companies. These customer relationships have been driven by Fairmount Santrol’s ability to
enhance its customers’ operations and profitability by delivering a full suite of high-quality proppant products, where, when and as-needed.

Broad Based Distribution Network and Unit Train Capabilities. The combined company will have a leading supply chain network in North
America with intrinsic transportation advantages. The combined company will have a highly complementary large-scale terminal network, with a
combined 94 terminals, including 19 unit train terminals and access to all of the major Class 1 railroads. Unimin’s private railroad in West Virginia, New
Jersey, Virginia and Maryland (“Winchester & Western”) further enhances the combined company’s industrial supply chain logistics. The combined
company will have strategically located facilities and terminals throughout the Permian basin, including combined in-basin capacity in the Permian
basin of 6 million tons via two new flagship facilities under construction with expected completion in the second quarter of 2018. These capabilities will
provide an unmatched, low cost and highly flexible supply chain for the combined company’s customers.

Diversification Across Assets, Geographies, Minerals and Industries Served Providing Cash Flow Stability. The combined company will serve
a broad range of industries, minerals and geographies. We estimate that, on a pro forma basis for the year ended December 31, 2017, the combined
company generated approximately 40.4% of its volume in the Industrial sector and approximately 59.5% of its volume in the Energy sector. The
combined company will generate revenue from sales of a diverse range of minerals, including sales of silica, nepheline syenite, feldspar, clays and other
minerals, to customers in a diverse range of industries, including the glass, coatings, ceramics, construction and foundry industries, and on a geographic
basis the combined company will serve customers throughout the United States, Canada and Mexico and, to a lesser

extent, in South America, Europe and Asia. This diversification creates a highly resilient business model with strong cash flow.

Strong Management Team with Extensive Industry Experience. Following the closing of the Merger, the combined company will be run by a
talented management team consisting of leading executives from both Unimin and Fairmount Santrol. The combined company’s senior executives will
have significant experience in geology, mining, logistics and end product customer requirements, positioning the combined company to achieve
attractive returns over the long run in the North American industrial minerals and global energy businesses.

Majority Stockholder with Significant Expertise in Global Industrial Minerals. The combined company’s majority stockholder, Sibelco, is a
world leader in industrial minerals, with a multi-mineral product offering at over 200 facilities in more than 40 countries. Founded in 1872, Sibelco has a
long history as Unimin’s principal stockholder and nominees of Sibelco will constitute a majority of the members of the Combined Company Board
following the closing of the Merger. This will provide the combined company with access to leading technologies in mineral processing with a unique
research and development platform, in-depth knowledge of global markets, a long track record and expertise in managing a global industrial minerals
company and a global platform and distribution network, which can help the combined company grow in its customer base. Unimin also intends to
leverage Sibelco’s expertise in order to further develop its North American nonsilica mineral portfolio and to incrementally grow its Industrial segment.

Business Strategy of the Combined Company

Unimin’s objective is to create long-term and sustainable value for its stakeholders, and Unimin believes the combination of its business with
Fairmount Santrol will help to accelerate the execution of its business strategy. Unimin intends to create this value through the execution of the
following strategies following the closing of the Merger:

Realize Targeted Synergies of the Combined Company. Following the Merger, the combined company will have more than 50 processing and
coating facilities, more than 20,000 railcars and 94 terminals across complementary Class 1 railroads serving both its energy and industrial customers.
Unimin believes that substantial synergies exist in integrating and optimizing the supply chains of Unimin and Fairmount Santrol in order to reduce
logistics costs, improve mine yields, decrease cycle times of the companies’ combined rail fleet and optimize the combined company’s footprint. The
combined company is targeting synergies of approximately $150 million annually, with 50% expected in the first year after the closing of the Merger.

Identify New Synergies of the Combined Company. Unimin expects that, after the closing of the Merger, the combined company will be able to
evaluate potential additional synergies in order to create additional value for combined company stockholders, such as applying Fairmount Santrol’s
coating technologies to other minerals and applications in industries Unimin serves, advancing both companies’ collective dust control technologies,
growing Fairmount Santrol’s blending businesses across Unimin’s assets and leveraging the best operational and commercial excellence programs of
each company across the combined business.

Strengthen the Combined Company’s Energy Segment Operations and Portfolio. Unimin intends to continue to invest in, strengthen and
diversify its production facilities, distribution footprint and product offerings in its Energy segment. During 2018, Unimin expects to complete
construction on its facility in West Texas with capacity of 3 million tons annually, for a total expected investment in the range of $90 million to $100
million. During the same period, Fairmount Santrol expects to complete construction of a facility in West Texas with similar annual capacity. Unimin
aims to grow its combined raw frac sand capacity from 13.8 million tons in 2017 to 17.9 million tons by the end of 2018 through the construction of a
greenfield facility in West Texas and brownfield expansions at its Utica facility. The new West Texas facility is expected to be commissioned in
mid-2018 and is expected to achieve run rate productive capacity of 3 million tons by September 2018. In addition, Unimin will seek to add new
minerals to its portfolio and enhance its value-added product offerings. Drawing on Sibelco’s global footprint, market insight and customer base,
Unimin believes the combined company will be well positioned to identify new customers for frac sand and new mineral platforms serving the energy
industry.

Grow the Combined Company’s Industrial Segment Production and Product Offerings Through Both Organic and Inorganic Growth.
Working collaboratively with its customers, Unimin expects to invest in various brownfield investments in the U.S., Canada and Mexico over the next
three years in order to grow its industrial business. Unimin believes that certain of the end markets and geographies where it has operations have strong
growth potential and will seek to make ongoing investments to support the growth of its customer base. Unimin also intends to evaluate growth
opportunities by reinvesting in both its existing product offering as well as the extension of its product portfolio through the identification of adjacent
minerals. Particularly given the expertise and market knowledge of Unimin’s majority stockholder, Sibelco, Unimin believes it is well positioned to
identify and execute value-accretive transactions.

Seek to Remain Cash Flow Positive Throughout the Business Cycle. Unimin’s cash generative industrial business is a critical element of its
strategy to maintain a strong balance sheet and preserve financial flexibility. Unimin has generated positive cash flow throughout the business cycle,
including during the 2016 oil and gas downturn, which it believes differentiates Unimin and will differentiate the combined company from its peers who
are more exclusively energy-focused. In addition, by maintaining a strong balance sheet, Unimin preserves the option to lead industry consolidation
through value-added business development and to invest in high return projects at opportune times. Unimin also believes that its stable industrial
business allows it to more easily weather a business downturn without having to rely on third party funding.

History of Unimin’s Business

Unimin was founded in 1970 by William Woods Jr., a former executive of the Pennsylvania Glass Sand Company, through the acquisition of silica
companies in Virginia and Minnesota. In 1973, Sibelco acquired 67% of Unimin. In 1976, Unimin started to produce frac sand at its Ottawa facility and
in 1982 Unimin completed construction on an additional frac sand facility in Kasota, Minnesota. In 1983, Unimin purchased the industrial sand division
of Martin Marietta, totaling 10 facilities and 3.3 million tons of additional capacity, promoting Unimin to a leading position in sales to industrial sand
customers.

In 1989, Unimin acquired a microcrystalline silica facility in Elco, Illinois. In 1990, Unimin acquired nepheline syenite quarries and processing
factories in Blue Mountain and Nephton, Ontario, Canada. In 1997, Unimin purchased a Mexican producer of silica sand, silica flour and feldspar,
which today operates under the company Grupo Materias Primas. In 2000, Unimin purchased two facilities in Georgia, which produce kaolin. In 2006,
Sibelco acquired 100% control of Unimin. In 2007, Unimin acquired a company that produces 400,000 tons of lime per year. In 2013, Unimin acquired
a 200,000 ton resin coated sand processing facility in Sibley, Louisiana. Since 2010, Unimin has invested more than $1 billion to expand both raw sand
and resin coated sand capacity through greenfield and brownfield expansions in order to better serve the energy industry. Today, Unimin is one of the
leading suppliers to the oil and gas industry and a leading silica producer serving industrial customers. For a discussion of sales and segment gross profit
of each of Unimin’s segments see note 16 of the notes to Unimin’s audited historical consolidated financial statements, copies of which are attached as
Annex F to this proxy statement/prospectus.

Industry Background

Energy Segment

Unimin’s Energy segment serves customers in the oil and gas industry, providing a variety of proppants and other oilfield minerals for use in
hydraulic fracturing in the U.S., Canada and internationally. The oil and natural gas proppant industry is comprised of businesses involved in the mining
or manufacturing, distribution and sale of the propping agents used in hydraulic fracturing, the most widely used method for stimulating increased
production from lower permeability oil and natural gas reservoirs.

Proppant Characteristics

Advances in oil and gas extraction techniques, such as horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, have allowed for significantly greater
extraction of oil and gas trapped within shale formations. The hydraulic fracturing process consists of pumping fluids down a well at pressures sufficient
to create fractures in the targeted hydrocarbon- bearing rock formation in order to increase the flow rate of hydrocarbons from the well. A granular
material, called proppant, is suspended and transported in the fluid and fills the fracture, “propping” it open once high-pressure pumping stops. The
proppant filled fracture creates a conductive channel through which the hydrocarbons can flow more freely from the formation into the wellbore and
then to the surface. Proppants therefore perform the vital function of promoting the flow, or conductivity, of hydrocarbons over a well’s productive life.
In fracturing a well, operators select a proppant that is transportable into the fracture, is compatible with frac and wellbore fluids, permits acceptable
cleanup of frac fluids and can resist proppant flowback. In addition, the proppant must be resistant to crushing under the earth’s closure stress and
reservoir temperature.

There are three primary types of proppant that are utilized in the hydraulic fracturing process: raw frac sand, resin coated sand and manufactured
ceramic beads. These proppant types are produced at various sizes depending on customer needs. Customers choose among these proppant types based
on the geology of the reservoir, expected well pressures, proppant flowback concerns and product cost. Given price differences and well specific
considerations, E&P companies are continually evaluating the optimal mix of lower cost, lower conductivity frac sand and higher cost, higher
conductivity resin coated sand and ceramics in order to best address the geology of the well and to maximize well productivity and economic returns.

Frac sand is generally mined from the surface or underground, and then cleaned and sorted into consistent sizes or grades referred to as mesh
sizes. Frac sand can generally be delineated into three main naturally-occurring types: (a) Northern White frac sand; (b) Brady Brown frac sand; and
(c) in-basin frac sand, for example, from West Texas serving the Permian basin. Northern White frac sand is a specific type of white sand mined
primarily in Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Illinois, and generally considered to be of higher quality than Brady Brown and in-basin frac sand for use as a
proppant due to its crush strength, coarseness, sphericity and monocrystalline grain structure. Brady Brown frac sand has lower crush strength due to its
polycrystalline structure. Emerging West Texas frac sands are very fine (100 mesh and some 40/70 mesh) with a crush strength that may vary as
compared to Northern White sands and depending on grade. The API has identified thresholds that various physical characteristics of proppants should
pass, and Northern White frac sand consistently meets these thresholds. Across all sand types, finer sand grades have better crush resistance due to their
greater relative surface area.

API specification proppants must meet stringent technical specifications set forth by the API including, among others, coarseness, crush
resistance, sphericity, roundness, acid solubility, purity and turbidity (dustiness). These characteristics are of particular importance because they have a
significant impact on hydrocarbon conductivity, and directly impact the production and profitability of a well. Conductivity is a function of the
permeability of the proppant and the width of the fracture, which dictates the proppant’s ability to prop open a fracture while allowing hydrocarbons to
flow to the surface.

Logistics

Transportation is a critical element for the total delivered frac sand cost. Regional and in-basin sand typically has a cost advantage over Northern
White frac sand due to shorter transportation distances, but is usually of lower quality when compared to comparable Northern White mesh sizes.

Frac sand is sold at the mine gate, in-basin at a terminal or directly to the end user at a wellsite. For sand sold at the mine, the purchaser is
responsible for the transportation of the frac sand. For in-basin sales of frac sand, the supplier is typically responsible for transporting the sand to either
the terminal or the wellsite, which requires an efficient and integrated logistics network for low cost delivery. Efficient and integrated logistics
capabilities, including direct rail access from the processing facility, unit train capable facilities, scale and location of in-basin terminals and efficiency
of logistics operations are critical to a supplier’s ability to deliver sand at a competitive cost to its customers.

Table of Contents

E&P companies’ and oilfield service providers’ preferences and expectations have been evolving in recent years. Breadth of product offerings,
sufficient capacity to meet growing well needs and logistics capabilities have become an important differentiating factor when competing for business,
on both a spot and contract basis.

Rail is the predominant method of delivery of Northern White frac sand into the key oil and gas basins. For this reason, direct access to Class 1
rail lines is an important differentiator in the industry. Rail shipment can occur via manifest or unit trains. Manifest trains, also called mixed-freight
trains, are considered less efficient because these trains switch cars at various intermediate junctions in transit and routinely encounter delays. By
contrast, unit trains, which typically consist of 100 rail cars or more, travel directly from origin to destination at a higher speed than manifest traffic. The
ability to ship via unit train (which can transport more than 10,000 tons of frac sand each), and simultaneously manage multiple trains at the production
facility and in-basin, increases the reliability and cost-effectiveness of delivery to in-basin terminals, and ultimately the wellsite. Our extensive
distribution and unit train capabilities reduce in-basin cost and increase effective utilization of our facilities and railcars.

From the in-basin terminals, frac sand is typically delivered to the wellsite via truck where it is then delivered to a wellsite storage unit. In-basin
terminals and wellsite delivery and storage of frac sand are becoming increasingly important to meet the needs of customers such as inventory
management and quick response times, particularly as customers shift activity towards pad drilling and “zipper frac” completions which require greater
volumes of frac sand on the wellsite. As more E&P companies take responsibility for securing their own frac sand, they may ask proppant suppliers to
provide solutions for last mile delivery. This requires further coordination and adds a layer of complexity to an already multifaceted supply chain.
Solutions can take the form of an acquisition of transport or storage technologies or strategic partnerships with third party specialists.

Demand

Demand for proppant is predominantly influenced by the level of drilling and completions activity by oil and natural gas exploration and
production companies, which, in turn, depends largely on the current and anticipated profitability of developing oil and natural gas reserves. In 2015 and
2016, relatively low oil and natural gas prices resulted in reduced capital spending on drilling and completions activity leading to an 80% decline in the
United States land rig count from recent peak levels in November 2014 to the low in May 2016 according to Baker Hughes Incorporated’s North
American Rig Count. Production declines resulting from reduced drilling activity in North America, and recent agreements by OPEC members to reduce
oil production quotas have provided upward momentum for oil prices. West Texas Intermediate benchmark pricing has more than doubled to US$61.15
per barrel as of March 7, 2018 from lows of US$26.21 per barrel in February 2016.

In response to the improved returns generated by these increases in hydrocarbon prices, oil and natural gas exploration and production companies
have increased their capital spending on drilling and completion activities since the second half of 2016, and the demand for oilfield activities has
increased. According to Baker Hughes Incorporated’s North American Rig Count, the number of active total land drilling rigs in the United States has
increased from a low of 380 rigs as reported on May 27, 2016 to 967 active drilling rigs as reported on March 2, 2018.

Unimin has a positive outlook on the proppant industry and expects the following industry trends to impact proppant demand growth over the next
few years:
 

 

•  Increasing drilling activity and wells per rig. Over the past decade, E&P companies have increasingly focused on exploiting the vast
hydrocarbon reserves contained in North America’s oil and gas reservoirs. While the well counts have remained relatively stable, drilling
activity and the number of wells per rig has increased dramatically through the increased use of pad drilling. With the establishment of
advanced techniques such as horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, E&P companies initially focused on establishing and delineating
their large acreage positions. Using these advanced techniques, their development plans were largely driven by a desire to grow production
quickly, but were not yet optimized for maximum efficiency and economic returns.

•  DUCs decouple frac sand demand and production from rig count. The downturn in oil and gas during 2014 and 2015 saw the decoupling
of the traditional indicator of rig count from frac sand demand and thus total oil and gas production. This occurred as companies completed
far fewer wells compared to the number being drilled resulting in an inventory of what has become known as drilled but uncompleted wells
(DUCs). According to the EIA, as of January 2018, the DUC count was 7,609 wells across all major basins representing over 50 million tons
of backlogged demand at today’s well intensity levels. The industry completed approximately 1,100 wells per month through late 2017 and
early 2018.

 

 

•  Increasing proppant intensity per well. In recent years, with their acreage positions largely established, E&P companies have evolved their
capital plans to focus on full-scale, long term development, with the underlying goals of increased efficiencies and optimizing their returns
on invested capital. This has led to new development techniques, such as longer lateral lengths and shorter intervals between frac stages,
which results in more fracturing stages per well. In addition, the amount of proppant used per stage has increased dramatically,
compounding the increase in total demand for proppant per well. In recent months, individual horizontal wells were completed with an
average of more than 6,000 tons of proppant, which is the equivalent of 60 railcars or 240 truckloads.

 

U.S. HORIZONTAL LAND RIG COUNT

•  Increased focus on regional and in-basin sand. The Permian basin is expected to be one of the key drivers of demand growth in the near
term with demand expected to grow significantly since 2016 while other basins are also expected to grow significantly over this period.
Permian demand will be a combination of 100 mesh, 40/70 mesh, coarse sand and resin coated products. Unimin expects that the largest
source of Permian in-basin supply will be 100 mesh, leading to insufficient Permian production of coarse sand and 40/70 mesh, but an
oversupply of 100 mesh. A large portion of 40/70 and all coarser grades of Permian demand will therefore need to continue to be supplied
from outside of the Permian. Overall, Unimin believes that demand to be supplied from sources outside the Permian will represent the
majority of Permian demand. Unimin believes the combined company’s footprint in the Permian provides it with a competitive advantage
with two in-basin production plants coming online in 2018, several unit-train capable terminal facilities providing Northern White sand and
one of the most expansive product portfolios in the market.

As a result of the trends described above, the North American proppant market has increased rapidly over the past decade, with the U.S. being the
single largest consumer of proppants. Following the downturn in 2015 and 2016, the U.S. proppant market made a strong recovery in 2017.

Supply

Throughout the market downturn in 2016 the frac sand market was oversupplied with a total capacity above 100 million tons serving much less
demand (for example, demand in 2016 was only 42 million tons). However, the stabilization of WTI oil prices above $50 a barrel (and more recently
$60), and industry projections of increased demand for frac sand, have spurred new development. This is taking place across several modes of

supply, from expansions of mines supplying Northern White sands to greenfield projects in the rapidly expanding Permian basin.

In response to the expected demand from the Permian basin, significant new Permian in-basin supply is expected to be commissioned in
2018. While the total announced capacity additions exceed 60 million tons, Unimin believes fewer actual projects will be commissioned. In addition,
Unimin believes effective capacity levels of commissioned projects will be lower than nameplate capacity given the difficulties companies will face in
maintaining daily nameplate production levels without adequate supply chain infrastructure to absorb variability in daily customer demand. Unimin
believes that the new supply in the Permian will be mostly 100 mesh and that a significant portion of Permian demand for 40/70 mesh and all coarser
grades will continue to be supplied from outside the Permian. Unimin believes that key differentiators for success in the Permian will be a broad product
offering, the right grade mix and an integrated operations and logistics network. Companies with strategically located terminals will be able to distribute
both local and Northern White sands. Additionally, terminals in the Permian basin will help bridge timing gaps between Permian production and
customer orders.

Industrial Segment

Unimin’s Industrial segment sells value-added products to the glass, ceramics, construction, coatings, polymers, foundry and various other
industries. Unimin’s sales to these industries correlate strongly with overall economic activity levels as reflected in the gross domestic product, vehicle
production and growth in the housing market. Within these industries, certain sectors provide above-average growth due to consumer, regulatory and
manufacturing trends.

Glass

The glass industry includes four primary sub-sectors: container glass (primarily bottles); flat glass (i.e., architectural and automotive glass);
fiberglass; and specialty display glass (touch screens). The main raw materials necessary for the production of glass are silica sand, alumina bearing
minerals, feldspar and nepheline syenite.

Primary container glass products are beer, wine and soda bottles, food containers and tableware. Container glass demand in the United States
tends to follow U.S. GDP growth and has driven stable volumes for suppliers of silica, feldspar and nepheline syenite. In Mexico, growth in the
worldwide consumption of Mexican beer produced and bottled in Mexico has increased the demand by Mexican breweries for glass bottles, which has
increased demand for high quality low iron silica sand. Unimin expects that these trends will fuel growth in the North American container glass sector
over the next several years. Major container glass companies include Owens-Illinois, Ardagh Group S.A. and Anchor Glass. The main products Unimin
supplies for container glass production are Glassil whole grain silica, feldspar and nepheline syenite.

Flat glass includes automotive glass and windows for both residential and commercial applications, among others. Flat glass is produced by large
glass companies, including Pilkington, Vitro (PPG), AGC, Guardian Industries and Cardinal Glass. The main product Unimin supplies into the flat glass
industry is Glassil whole grain silica.

The fiberglass industry produces fine filament fiber used in fiberglass reinforced plastic, which is used in boats, autos and other industrial
applications as well as the production of fiberglass for home and business insulation. Major producers of fiberglass include PPG, Owens Corning, Johns
Manville and CertainTeed. Demand for fiberglass products tends to correlate with construction activity and automotive sales, but Unimin believes that
fiberglass demand may experience faster growth in the automotive industry as a result of the replacement of metal with reinforced engineering polymers
and composites. The ultimate goals of material replacement are lower manufacturing costs and the increased fuel efficiency of lighter-weight vehicles.
Another growing application of fiberglass is in composites for wind turbines designed to generate electric power. The main products Unimin supplies to
the fiberglass industry include ground silica (200 Mesh) commercialized under the Glassil brand and fiberglass grade kaolin (FG).

Unimin offers one of the largest multi-facility and multi-product mineral portfolios serving the glass industry. Unimin’s longstanding customer
relationships and reputation for quality provide Unimin with a significant competitive advantage. Unimin also has the broad-based multi-facility
capability that is able to service large multi-plant glass customers. Glassil, Unimin’s glass industry brand and primary product for sale to

the glass industry, is produced from decidedly pure silica sand deposits throughout North America. Glass batch formulations determine the raw material
requirements of the glass manufacturer and differ based upon the requirements of the end-use product. In addition to Glassil, Unimin provides a number
of other products to the glass industry, including low-iron Puresil grades (in response to increased requirements for high transmissivity solar energy
panels), nepheline syenite and feldspar.

Construction

The construction industry, driven by urbanization, including new homes, remodeling & repair and commercial buildings, drives demand for the
majority of Unimin’s products.

The U.S. home improvement industry is large, fueled by the highest levels of home equity since 2009. The key fundamentals that support
residential growth are population growth, the increase in household formation, strong economic conditions (including low unemployment and growing
incomes) and low mortgage rates (with mortgage rates still at historic lows even as the U.S. Federal Reserve contemplates increasing interest rates).
Even when new home construction may slow in times of hardship (recession and higher interest rates), spending on home improvement / remodeling
can increase—many homeowners who cannot afford a new home can still afford to repair or upgrade their existing home. For instance, according to
Plastics News, over 90% of composite decking revenues were generated by repair-and-replace activities rather than new home construction. Oldcastle
Business Intelligence’s U.S. National Construction Forecast estimates that the U.S. residential market will grow by approximately 6% in 2018.

The commercial portion of the construction industry includes education and public buildings, hotels, stadiums, office construction, roads and
buildings and healthcare. Customers in the construction industry seek suppliers who can offer multi-product (mineral) offerings, multi-plant production
capabilities, diversified and low-cost logistics solutions and superior customer and technical service. Understanding the features of its products and the
benefits they deliver to its customers’ processes and products is a key characteristic that reinforces Unimin as a market driven leader in the industries it
serves. They also seek reliable and consistent suppliers of minerals, which vary by size, shape, chemistry or other physical characteristics. Unimin is
well-situated to serve customers in the construction industry due to its mine locations and manufacturing footprint, which provide exceptional
geographic coverage and privileged access to customers either by truck or rail.

The non-residential construction market has been forecasted by Oldcastle Business Intelligence to grow approximately 4% in 2018, led by growth
in the roads and bridges end market (forecast to grow 6% in 2018). Geographically, the southern portion of the United States, where Unimin owns
multiple deposits and operates many processing facilities, is forecasted by Oldcastle Business Intelligence to experience the largest growth in 2018, with
projected growth of 6%. The rebuilding of areas hit hard by hurricanes Harvey and Irma as well as earthquake devastated Mexico City are expected to
boost demand for construction in 2018 and beyond.

Coatings

The architectural coatings and industrial coatings industries include coatings and specialty materials for customers in a wide array of end uses,
including industrial equipment and components, packaging material, aircraft and marine equipment and automotive original equipment as well as for
other industrial and consumer products. Paint and coatings manufacturers also serve commercial and residential new build and maintenance customers
by supplying coatings to painting and maintenance contractors and directly to consumers for decoration and maintenance.

The architectural coatings industry is highly competitive and consists of several large firms with global presence and many smaller firms serving
local or regional customers. Major global companies in the architectural coating business include Akzo Nobel N.V., BASF Corporation, Benjamin
Moore, PPG Industries Inc. and the Sherwin-Williams Company. Price, product performance, technology, cost effectiveness, quality and technical and
customer service are major competitive factors in the industrial, automotive OEM, packaging coatings and coatings services businesses.

Unimin’s coatings products are sold through Sibelco, its exclusive distributor for coatings and polymers in North America, under a number of
brands, including Minex and Minex IG (nepheline syenite), Imsil

(microcrystalline silica), Snobrite (kaolin) and Silverbond (silica). Unimin’s silica-deficient ground nepheline syenite is a filler in decorative paints and
its use is increasing due to several growth drivers, including (1) paint manufacturers are seeking alternatives to silica due to regulatory concerns over
respirable crystalline silica, (2) nepheline syenite has demonstrated superior performance compared to carbonates in paint, (3) a dynamic housing
market, including both new home starts and a sizeable home improvement market (fueled by higher home equity), has increased demand for decorative
paints, (4) customer consolidation and (5) the development of new Minex grades that provide functionality in new applications.

Polymers

Polymers are chemical compounds or a mixture of compounds formed by polymerization and consisting essentially of repeating structural units.
Because of their low density and their ability to be shaped and molded at relatively low temperatures compared to traditional materials such as metals,
polymers are widely used across several industrial customer segments. Parts and components that have traditionally been made of wood, metal, ceramic
or glass are now being redesigned with polymers.

Packaging, construction, transportation and electrical & electronic (E&E) are the four largest polymer sub-sectors. While packaging is the largest
application in terms of volume, applications such as construction, transportation and electrical offer more value with intense use of additives and fillers.
Megatrends driving polymer demand are building activity, stricter and broader adoption of safety standards, a sharper focus on cost efficiencies,
lightweighting, longer food preservation and water transportation and management.

Additives, fillers and reinforcements are used to change and improve the physical and mechanical properties of plastics. In general, reinforcing
fibers increase the mechanical properties of polymer composites while particular fillers of various types increase the modulus. In general, mineral
functional fillers are relatively cheap, solid substances that are added in fairly high percentages to plastics, paints and paper to adjust volume, weight,
costs or technical performance. The selection of the optimal mineral filler is very critical and depends on the properties required in the intermediate or
end product. Global demand for mineral fillers, flame retardants and reinforcements is expected to grow above U.S. GDP growth rates as polymers
continue to displace metal, glass, wood and ceramics in traditional and emerging applications.

A plastic is any synthetic or semi-synthetic organic polymer. New home construction and repair-and-replace construction work increase the
demand for plastic products such as window and door frames, decking, fencing, siding, roofing and carpets. Parts and components that have traditionally
been made out of wood, metal, ceramic or glass are increasingly being redesigned with plastics. The replacement of metals by plastics in domestic
appliances has been ongoing for many years primarily due to the reduction in weight, corrosion resistance and cost-effectiveness of plastics. Also, the
manufacturing processes for metal parts typically involves multiple product steps and requires capital investment, whereas the molds and parts for
plastics can be made in one step.

In North America, Unimin’s polymer business is highly concentrated in nepheline syenite sales. Unimin’s polymers applications sales have been
growing due to a number of factors, including dedicated sales coverage through Unimin’s exclusive distributor, Sibelco, an expanded customer base as a
result of FDA approval of food-contact applications and development of new products in composites, color concentrates and building & construction
products (window and door frames, vinyl sidings and fencing).

Unimin’s products for the polymers industry are sold through its exclusive distributor and largest stockholder, Sibelco, under a number of brands,
including Minbloc (nepheline syenite), Hifill (calcium carbonate), Silverbond (crystalline silica) and Snobrite (kaolin).

Ceramics

The ceramics manufacturing industry includes a diverse mix of products. Among the main types of ceramics produced are sanitaryware (ceramic
ware used in bathrooms such as toilets, wash basins, pedestals, bidet, urinals, sinks and bathtubs) and clay brick and tiles (frequently used in residential
construction). Sanitaryware is made with three main raw materials: clay (ball clay or China clay); quartz; and feldspar. The majority of sanitaryware sold
in the U.S. is produced in Mexico, while the ceramic tile industry has continued to grow as Italian

Table of Contents

manufacturers have established production facilities in the U.S. Activity in ceramics tends to follow residential and commercial construction activity
(new build and remodel), with housing construction being the main driver for growth in the United States and Mexico in both sanitaryware and tile
applications.

The clay brick and product manufacturing industry produces a range of materials used in downstream construction (structural and decorative
ceramic floor, wall and roofing tiles and clay bricks, pavers, pipes, drains and fittings) and refractory products to line kilns and furnaces. Major sectors
include the residential sector and the primary steel and nonferrous metal manufacturing sectors. Increased demand from these sectors has benefited the
industry in recent years. Over the five years ended 2017, IBISWorld estimates that industry revenue has grown primarily due to rebounding demand for
clay brick and tile products from the revitalized residential construction sector.

Several characteristics of clay and ceramic products make them appealing to a variety of industries. Clay bricks have historically been popular in
the construction of single family homes, giving walls and roofs a classic red and brown tint. Ceramic tiles are also popular as flooring material in
residential and nonresidential buildings. In the industrial sector, the particularly high heat resistance of clay and similar ceramic materials has made
these products integral in the primary production and processing of most metal, cement, glass and petroleum products. The residential construction
industry is the principal source of demand for clay bricks, ceramic floor tiles, wall tiles and terracotta roof tiles, especially in housing starts. Design
trends continue to see increasing quantities of tiles being used for domestic purposes, particularly in the warmer southern states. This industry is
particularly sensitive to fluctuations in the construction of new single-family housing units, which rely heavily on clay bricks and ceramic tiles.

Unimin participates in the ceramics industry through the sale of its branded products Spectrum (nepheline syenite), Cerasil (granular silica),
Quantum (potassium feldspar), Premiere (pressing clays), Starcast (ceramic casting clays), Vantage (refractory grade clays), Prestige (plastic forming
clays) and Maxum (sodium feldspar). Additionally, Unimin distributes Sibelco U.K. ball clay and kaolin, along with Ukrainian ball clay, potassium
feldspar from India and French pebbles used as grinding media. These products are used in the production of white wares (tableware and/or sanitary
ware) and tiles. Unimin’s low cost production and geographic proximity to customers combined with a broad product offering are major factors
contributing to Unimin’s successful market position in the ceramics industry.

Foundry and Metallurgical

Foundries are factories that produce metal castings. Metals are cast into shapes by melting them into a liquid, pouring the metal in a mold and
removing the mold material or casting after the metal has solidified as it cools. The most common metals processed are aluminum and cast iron.
However, other metals, such as bronze, brass, steel, magnesium and zinc, are also used to produce castings in foundries. Aluminum casting has been
growing faster than steel and iron based alloys driven mainly by a trend for lighter vehicles. Limited steel growth is expected in mature geographies
compared to Asia and Middle East, but lighter weight stainless steel used in construction, appliance and automotive manufacturing may experience
higher growth rates globally. Steel production in North America has increased recently due to the development of unconventional sources of energy but
is still not expected to achieve historical levels of production. Growth in Mexico outpaces both Mexico’s and the United States’ GDP growth rate due to
robust automotive industry activity. Foundry activity in the United States, and to some extent Mexico, is expected to capitalize on the “reshoring” of
metal castings from China. Another trend is the shift in manufacturing and assembly locations due to protectionism and trade wars globally. Growth
expectations are also limited by already high (and consistently increasing) sand recycling rates.

Metallurgical fluxes are a key component of the metals production process, but few minerals meet the demanding criteria of the metals production
industry. A metallurgical flux is an additive for purifying and improving metallic ores. Its primary purpose is to combine with impurities in molten ore
(such as phosphorous, silica, sulfur and zinc) to form a slag that can be separated from the metal. Dolomite, limestone, olivine and fluorspar are the most
common slag conditioners/fluxing agents used in steel production. Owing to its higher magnesia content and its ability to enable reduced energy and
coke consumption and lower CO2 emissions, olivine is recognized in the industry as a cost-effective additive for pig iron production but requires iron
ore to

have less than 5% silica. Its potential is therefore limited in geographies where iron ore with high silica content is preeminent.

Unimin supplies foundries with metallurgical consumables, which are required by all metal refining and casting operations. Its coarse grades of
limestone and olivine grades, combined with quicklime additions, are essential components in the refining process to control slag chemistry and protect
and extend furnace refractory life. Engineered sizes of olivine are also employed as a refractory plug in energy-efficient eccentric bottom tapping
electric arc furnaces. Engineered grades of olivine and silica sand are the principal mineral refractories supplied for foundry core and mold production,
which is the compulsory first step before pouring ferrous and non-ferrous metals to create finished cast shapes. Unimin also supplies ground silica and
olivine as refractory washes and slurries for the highly accurate precision investment casting process.

Unimin’s silica sand foundry activities are typically local by nature and developed in conjunction with other industries to maximize productivity
and profitability of existing assets. Foundry sand availability in North America is strongly influenced by heavy industries, including glass, automotive,
equipment and oil and gas. Unimin serves the foundry industry through multiple product offerings, including its Incast (silica), Quantum (potassium
feldspar), Uniblast (silica sand), Olivine (Oliflux and Thermtech) and Silverbond (ground silica) products.

Other Industrial Applications

Unimin markets a diverse mineral portfolio for an equally diverse group of industrial and commercial applications, including water filtration and
treatment, soil stabilization, neutralization applications and sports and recreation. Demand drivers for these markets vary and include weather, municipal
and private investment spending. Unimin provides high-quality industrial sands and gravels under the Filtersil brand (silica sand) in a wide variety of
water and wastewater filtration applications as well as Snofil (kaolin), Tracsand and Unipar (silica sand), which serves sports and recreation
applications. Unimin also provides Hi-Cal (lime) for neutralization applications.

Customers

Unimin’s strategy since its founding has been to partner with the largest and most important companies in the industries it serves. The strength of
Unimin’s customer base is driven by its collaborative approach to product innovation and development, reputation for high quality, the consistency and
reliability of its products and the scale of its operations and logistics network. Unimin currently serves approximately 1,500 customers across a variety
of industries in the United States, Canada, Mexico and the rest of the world. A significant portion of Unimin’s sales by volume was derived from
customers with whom Unimin has long-term relationships. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, Unimin’s largest customer, Halliburton
Energy Services, accounted for approximately 12% of Unimin’s revenue in each such year. No other customer accounted for more than 10% of
Unimin’s revenue.

Unimin sells its products under supply agreements with terms that vary by contract. Certain agreements require the customer to purchase a
specified percentage of its requirements from Unimin. Other agreements require the customer to purchase a minimum volume from Unimin. These
minimum volume contracts typically include provisions that trigger penalties if the purchased volume does not meet the required minimums. Specific
custom orders are generally filled upon request, and backlog is not a material factor.

Products

Unimin’s mineral portfolio reflects the wide diversity of physical, chemical and performance requirements of its customers. Unimin employs a
range of beneficiation technologies (the process by which commercially valueless material is removed from ore) to isolate and deliver the specific
functional properties sought by its customers. Chemical purity and particle size, shape and strength are statistically controlled for predictable results in
the customer’s application.

Unimin’s products are mined throughout the United States, Canada and Mexico. In addition, Unimin distributes certain products mined and
processed by Sibelco overseas. Unimin utilizes a strict mine planning

process within its owned facilities. Performance requirements are used to identify ore bodies with specific mineralogical properties for processing and
optimization. Continual exploration and reinvestment ensure that these essential raw materials remain a uniform and sustainable resource for Unimin’s
customers.

Besides chemical and mechanical processing of ores, which include crushing, screening, chemical washing, drying, floatation, air classification,
magnetic separation, scalping and grinding, Unimin is capable of surface-treating minerals to improve performance attributes as well as to mitigate dust
formation during product handling in terminals, discharge points and at its customers’ plants.

Silica

Silica sand, sometimes called industrial sand, is defined as having a high content of quartz, the predominant mineral of crystalline silica
(chemically, SiO2). It is derived from naturally occurring unconsolidated quartz sand or from consolidated quartzite or sandstone. Silica sand is an
essential raw material for the glassmaking industry (container, float glass and fiberglass), where it usually comprises about two-thirds of the raw
material input. Silica is also used in the foundry industry to create casting molds and cores as well as in oil and gas production, where it is a proppant
known as frac sand that is pumped “down hole” to stimulate flow. Silica sand is also used as a functional and structural component in other diverse
applications, such as filtration media towers, building products and synthetic sports turf. In its ground form, silica is used to manufacture ceramics and
fiberglass and as a filler in several applications (paint and adhesives, for example).

Unimin mines quartz-rich rock and sandstone deposits throughout North America to produce industrial silica sand. Unimin’s silicon dioxide
resources enable it to supply its customers with silica sand across a wide range of mineralogical complexity, from mature and nearly pure quartz
concentrations to geologically “new” feldspar-rich sands. High purity silica is an essential chemical component in glass, ceramic and silicate

manufacturing and a durable structural element in a wide range of construction, filtration and energy service applications.

Depending on the application, certain size, shape, uniformity, purity, mechanical properties and/or chemical features of silica sands are more or
less critical. The oil and gas industry uses industrial sands (commonly known as proppants or hydraulic fracturing sands, or simply frac sand) to
stimulate the production of oil and gas in existing wells. High purity, high crush resistance, roundness and sphericity are the key qualities necessary to
produce superior hydraulic fracturing sand. Frac sand is pumped “down hole” under pressure, in a mixture of water and polymer. The polymer is then
flushed from the hole, leaving this special sand in place “propping” open the newly fractured fissures. The sands increase hydrocarbon production by
allowing more oil and gas to flow through those fissures to the well, which can turn uneconomic and/or under-producing wells into economic wells with
profitable production rates. Proppants therefore perform the vital function of promoting the flow, or conductivity, of hydrocarbons over a well’s
productive life.

Unimin has some of the largest sand reserves and processing asset bases in the industry, including low iron content silica, which is preferred for its
whiteness and chemical properties. Unimin’s portfolio for oil and gas customers in the Energy segment include Northern White frac sand, considered to
be the highest quality raw frac sand available and known for its high crush resistance, roundness and sphericity and monocrystalline grain structure.

Unimin’s geographically advantaged footprint provides significant transportation advantages. The strategic location of Unimin’s facilities and its
logistics capabilities enable the company to enjoy high customer retention and a larger addressable market. In addition, customers who seek supply
consistency and assurance value Unimin’s ability to manufacture products similar in chemical and physical properties at multiple locations.

Silica comprises the largest share of Unimin’s business, with silica sand mining and processing in all of its geographic segments. Unimin offers
various physical and chemical combinations of silica sand for application specific solutions under trademarks registered in the U.S. and globally,
including Accupack, Accusand, Cerasil, Filtersil, Glassil, Granusil, Imsil, Incast, Minbloc, Minispheres, Propstar, Propstar Elite, Propstar Cyoset,

Nepheline Syenite

Nepheline syenite is a light-colored feldspathic rock composed largely of soda and potash feldspars and nepheline syenite, which has valuable
physical, chemical and optical properties. In glass making, nepheline syenite provides alumina and alkali and as a flux lowers the melting temperature,
providing faster melting and fuel savings. Nepheline syenite is also used as a flux in ceramic sanitaryware, dinnerware, floor and wall tile and industrial
ceramics, where it is regarded as a superior substitute for feldspar because of higher sodium and alumina and lower iron content as well as for melting at
lower temperatures. In coatings, nepheline syenite is preferred for being virtually crystalline silica free.

Nepheline syenite is a unique mineral with a compelling value proposition for many processes and products. While in the glass and ceramics
industries there are cost-effective alternative materials that limit the growth of nepheline syenite in those industries, Unimin expects the coatings and
polymers business will continue to be the main driver for nepheline syenite sales growth in the future, with a healthy split between long-term, high
volume, consistent usage in paint applications, and highly attractive and profitable growth opportunities in polymers applications. Growth in the
coatings and polymers industries is expected due to customers’ growth, health and safety concerns around silica dust and new products and applications.

Approximately 15% of Unimin’s nepheline syenite is further refined to produce functional fillers for paint, powder coatings and plastics where
Unimin utilizes Sibelco as its exclusive distribution agent. This type of nepheline syenite is produced at Unimin’s Canadian facilities and Sibelco’s
Norwegian operations. Unimin and Sibelco are two of the world’s leading producers of such low iron nepheline syenite from commercial quality
deposits. Nepheline syenite is sold worldwide under the global tradenames Hifill N, Matrix, Minbloc, Minex, Spectrum and White Lightening.

Feldspar

Feldspar is an alumina silicate with varying amounts of sodium, potassium and calcium and is a critical mineral in the production of glass and
ceramics. In glassmaking, feldspar acts as a flux and provides alumina, which promotes hardness, durability and resistance to chemical corrosion.
Feldspar is an important raw material in the manufacture of glass because it reduces the melting temperature of quartz and helps to control the viscosity
of glass. In ceramics, feldspar is used as a flux, lowering the vitrifying temperature of a ceramic body during firing and forming a glassy phase. Feldspar
improves the strength, toughness and durability of the ceramic body and cements the crystalline phase of other ingredients, softening, melting and
wetting other batch constituents. Most glass and almost all ceramics are manufactured with a feldspathic mineral as an ingredient, most typically
feldspar or nepheline syenite. End uses of feldspar products include ceramic wall and floor tiles, plumbing fixtures, dinnerware, electrical porcelain,
glass and glass fiber insulation.

Unimin concentrates sodium and potassium feldspar by crushing and sizing select granitic rock deposits. Unimin is the leading producer of
feldspar in Mexico and also distributes feldspar produced as a byproduct at Sibelco’s high purity quartz facilities in Spruce Pine, North Carolina.
Together with nepheline syenite, a feldspathic product, Unimin is the leading North American manufacturer of feldspathic products. Unimin’s main
feldspar brands are Matrix, Maxum and Quantum.

Lime and Limestone

Lime (quicklime and hydrated lime) and limestone provide chemical functionality in a diverse range of industrial applications. Lime and
limestone are used extensively in iron and steel basic oxygen and electric arc furnaces to remove impurities and adjust final chemistry. Lime is also
essential in the smelting, refining and recovery process of copper, zinc, nickel and precious minerals production. Highly reactive and soluble lime is
essential for pulp and paper manufacturing. High calcium and magnesium contribution is also essential for potable water treatment, industrial and
sludge/waste treatment, stack emissions and CO2 management as well as agricultural, animal feed and food processing. Unimin produces high calcium
lime (CaO) and hydrated quicklime (Ca(OH)2) from high purity limestone ore bodies. Lime is commercialized under various brands according to
product specifications and end uses, including Calsource Hi-Cal, Calsource Hydrate, Chemflux, Element and Utility Lime.

Kaolin Clay

Unimin mines kaolinite clays at multiple locations in Georgia. Kaolin clays mined from these weathered feldspar deposits provide a consistently
uniform source of alumina. Air flotation and processing eliminates accessory minerals, including quartz, feldspar, mica, calcite and sometimes pyrite
impurities, to yield fiberglass, ceramic and functional filler grades. Kaolin clay is used extensively in the ceramic industry, where its high fusion
temperature and white burning characteristics makes it particularly suitable for the manufacture of whiteware (china), porcelain and refractories. In the
manufacture of whiteware, the kaolin is usually mixed with silica, feldspar and ball clay in order to obtain the proper properties of plasticity, shrinkage
and vitrification for forming and firing the ware. Unimin’s application-specific kaolins are sold under the brands S Premiere, Royale (slurry), Snobrite,
Snofil, Starcast, Vantage and FG Fiberglass.

Ball Clay

Unimin produces ball clays from its operations in Texas and Indiana. Kaolinite-rich deposits containing varying quantities of illite, sericite mica,
smectite clays and organic matter are selectively mined and blended to fulfill plasticity and fired-strength specifications in ceramic applications. Ball
clay deposits are relatively scarce due to the combination of geological factors needed for their formation and preservation. Ball clay is commonly used
in the construction of ceramics, due to its white color and ability to impart plasticity or to aid rheological stability during the shaping processes. Ball
clay also delivers structural, reinforcing and rheological functionality in rubberized products, membranes and flexible coatings. Unimin’s ball clay
brands include Apex, Premiere and Vantage.

Calcium Carbonates

High brightness calcite and calcium carbonate feedstocks are processed and air-classified for structural fillers in plastic, paint, adhesives and
sealants. Engineered fillers and surface treated grades add reinforcing properties in PVC plastic, flexible film and paint applications. Unimin’s calcium
carbonate brands are Hifill (ground) and Hiwhite (precipitated).

Microcrystalline Silica

Unimin mines bone-white microcrystalline quartz deposits unique to North America and rare throughout the world. Composed of individual
grains of microscopic quartz, the formation is concentrated in soft earthy beds intermixed with chert masses (a microcrystalline or cryptocrystalline
sedimentary rock material composed of silicon dioxide). Microcrystalline silica has a textural grape-like structure that adds functional performance to
paints, plastics, rubber and composite materials. Unimin’s microcrystalline silica is sold under the trademarks Imsil and Minbloc MC.

Distributed Products

Unimin is the North American distributer for a wide range of products produced by Sibelco throughout the world. These products are sold
primarily to Unimin’s industrial customers, including U.K. ball clays and Ukrainian ball clays, and allow Unimin to distribute a diverse product
portfolio of both domestic and internationally unique products.

Table of Contents

According to SEC Industry Guide 7, reserves are defined as that part of a mineral deposit which could be economically and legally extracted or
produced at the time of the reserve determination. Reserves are categorized into proven (measured) reserves and probable (indicated) reserves, which are
defined as follows:
 

 

•  Proven (measured) reserves. Reserves for which (1) quantity is computed from dimensions revealed in outcrops, trenches, workings or drill
holes; grade and/or quality are computed from the results of detailed sampling and (2) the sites for inspection, sampling and measurement
are spaced so closely and the geologic character is so well defined that size, shape, depth and mineral content of reserves are well-
established.

 

 

•  Probable (indicated) reserves. Reserves for which quantity and grade and/or quality are computed from information similar to that used for
proven (measured) reserves, but the sites for inspection, sampling and measurement are farther apart or are otherwise less adequately
spaced. The degree of assurance, although lower than that for proven (measured) reserves, is high enough to assume continuity between
points of observation.

Unimin’s reserves meet the definition of proven or probable reserves in accordance with SEC Industry Guide 7. Unimin estimates that it had more
than 475 million tons of proven or probable recoverable mineral reserves as of December 31, 2017. Mineral reserve estimated quantities and
characteristics at Unimin’s properties are overseen by its internal geologists and engineers and validated by an independent third party consulting
company, GZA GeoEnvironmental, Inc. Prospective properties are surveyed, drilled and analyzed to determine the quality and quantity of the reserve.
Reserves are delineated by Unimin’s mine planning staff and are based on engineering analyses of three dimensional deposit block models developed by
the geology staff. Legal and economic considerations are also incorporated into the reserve analyses. In addition to meeting the Guide 7 definition of
reserves, Unimin’s reserves are also JORC classified. Guide 7 and applicable SEC interpretations do not permit disclosure of mineral “resources” in
SEC filings, although the SEC has proposed rules that would permit disclosure of resource data. If the SEC proposed rules regarding resource data were
in effect, Unimin would disclose resource amounts significantly greater than its disclosed reserves.

In general, the economic viability of Unimin’s reserves is established through the application of a five-year mine plan for each operation or project
providing a positive net present value on a cash-forward looking basis. Economic viability is demonstrated using historical performance, and when
appropriate with forward adjustments based on planned process improvements, changes in production volumes and in fixed and variable proportions of
costs. Unimin’s reserve estimates are updated annually in order to reflect new geological information and current mine plan and business strategies.
Unimin’s reserve estimates are based on saleable net tons which have been discounted for losses due to mining and facility processing.

In addition, Unimin assesses the economic viability of its mineral reserves through the calculation of a “break even stripping ratio” at each
facility. In mining, a stripping ratio refers to the amount of overburden (waste material) required to be handled in order to extract a ton of mineral. For
example, a 3:1 stripping ratio means that mining one ton of minerals will require mining three tons of waste. In general, mining at a lower stripping ratio
is more profitable than mining at a higher stripping ratio, because a higher ratio means that more waste must be removed for an equivalent volume of
revenue generating minerals. If the ratio is too high given a particular price of ore and the associated cost of mining, it may be determined not to be
economical to conduct mining at a particular facility.

Unimin’s internal policy requires that a deposit may be mined until the “break even stripping limit” of that deposit is reached—this is the point
where continued mining would be considered no longer economically viable. This limit is established for each deposit pursuant to an economically
derived stripping ratio (calculated in terms of cubic yards of overburden (waste) divided by tons sold). As the stripping ratio increases, the cost of
mining a unit of ore increases. Unimin will mine a particular deposit as its stripping ratio increases up until the point where the margin for the last unit of
ore mined at such facility is zero; for this purpose, margin is defined as the sales revenue per ton sold less the plant cost per ton sold. This point is the
break even stripping limit and all mining at each deposit is confined within this limit.

Table of Contents

When the margin for any given deposit (revenue, less production cost, divided by stripping cost, on a per ton basis) equals a specific amount of
waste per ton sold, the deposit has reached its break even stripping limit and mining at such facility will no longer be viable. Utilizing this formula, all of
Unimin’s mining facilities are currently economically viable—meaning that none of Unimin’s facilities have reached their break even stripping limit.

The following map identifies the locations of Unimin’s 31 mining facilities with reserves (including one facility currently under construction) and
nine processing facilities (including one inactive facility).

reserves in North America, Unimin is one of North America’s leading industrial mineral producers.

Mining Facilities with Reserves (31 Sites)

The following is a detailed description of Unimin’s 31 mining facilities with reserves (including one facility currently under construction). The
mineral rights and access to mineral reserves for the majority of Unimin’s facilities are secured through land that is owned. There are no underlying
agreements or royalties associated with these properties. When there are agreements or royalties associated with properties, more information is
provided in the facility descriptions below. Unimin is required to pay production royalties on a per ton basis pursuant to its mineral reserve leases. For
the year ended December 31, 2017, Unimin paid $3.3 million in royalty payments representing approximately 0.2% of its total revenue. Unimin
generally performs comprehensive title and survey due diligence prior to entering into leases.

Utica, Illinois

Unimin acquired its Utica facility in 1980 from Bellrose Silica. The facility is located in Utica, La Salle County, Illinois and consists of over 2,800
acres of owned real property. It is approximately 10 miles west of Ottawa and is accessible via State Highway 178. The Utica facility utilizes natural gas
and electricity to process sand. The facility is unit train capable and has over 33,000 linear feet of rail. Processed sand is shipped via truck and rail using
the CSX railroad. Product can also be shipped via barge at a transload facility within 10 miles of the Utica facility.

The facility’s mining operations are completed year-round and utilize drill and blast processes in an open-pit environment to produce feed for the
facility. There are three operating facilities on site that utilize the ore body (Utica 1, Utica 2 and Utica 3). Utica 1 and Utica 3 utilize in-pit crushing,
screening and secondary crushing. Utica 2 transports material from the mine to the crushing area with ridged frame haul trucks. All three facilities
utilize the same primary size reduction technology to feed the classification processing stages. Utica 1 material is hydraulically transported from an

uses electricity to process its material and has an annual capacity of approximately 138,000 tons. The average utilization rate over the past three years
was 88%.

The Benito Juárez facility produces sodium feldspar, which is supplied to ceramics, sanitary-ware and tiles manufacturers who are in the same
industrial area as the facility. Feldspar for the facility is supplied from the Ahuazotepec facility via truck. The Benito Juárez facility produces ground
products with particle sizes less than 75 microns and they are shipped via bulk trucks over short distances to end users.

Lampazos, Nuevo León, Mexico

Unimin acquired its Lampazos facility from Mexican glass producer Vitro in 1997, but the facility has been operating since 1970. The facility is in
Lampazos County, Nuevo León and consists of owned real property. The facility is located 98 miles north of Monterrey and is accessed via
Interstate NL1 road. The Lampazos facility utilizes heavy fuel oil and electricity to process its material. The processes at the facility are leaching,
drying, magnetic separation and grinding. The annual capacity is approximately 441,000 tons and the average utilization rate over the past three years
was 73% .

Table of Contents

The Lampazos facility produces silica sands for tableware glass, ceramics and, to a lesser extent, foundry markets. The facility’s supply comes
from the Canoitas facility, where it is transported as wet sand. The Lampazos facility mainly produces silica sand with low iron oxide content for the
tableware glass market. It also generates ground products from 75 to 45 microns for ceramics industry manufacturers mainly located in the city of
Monterrey. Finished material is shipped either in bulk or large bags via truck.

San Jose, Guanajuato, Mexico

Unimin acquired its San Jose facility from Vitro in 1997, but the facility has been in operation for more than 40 years. The facility is located in
San José Iturbide County, Guanajuato and consists of owned real property. It is located 35 miles north of Querétaro and is accessed via Highway 57
Queretaro-San Luis Potosi. The San Jose facility generates two main products: silica sand and potassium feldspar. The facility utilizes electricity to
process its material. The current primary process at the San Jose facility is grinding and its annual production capacity is approximately 55,000 tons. The
average utilization rate over the past three years was 23%.

Ground silica sand and feldspar produced at the San Jose facility are supplied mainly to the electric ceramics industry. The potassium feldspar is
supplied by a third party and silica sand as raw material is supplied by the Jáltipan facility. The products produced at the San Jose facility are shipped via
bulk truck.

Tlaxcala, Tlaxcala, Mexico

Unimin completed greenfield construction of its Tlaxcala milling facility in 2010. This facility is in Tetla County, Tlaxcala and consists of owned
real property. It is located 25 miles northeast of the city of Tlaxcala and is accessed via the road 119 Apizaco-Ciudad de Mexico. The facility utilizes
electricity to produce ground products of silica sand. The annual capacity is approximately 105,000 tons and the average utilization rate over the past
three years was 91%.

The Tlaxcala facility produces ground silica for the fiberglass industry. The silica sand is supplied from the Jáltipan facility. The Tlaxcala facility
generates ground products with particle sizes from 75 to 45 microns and its processed material is shipped via bulk truck.

Sibley, Louisiana (inactive)

Unimin purchased the resin coated sand processing facility in Sibley, Louisiana, in 2013 from Patriot Proppants. The Sibley facility has two
process lines, with a total capacity to coat approximately 400 million pounds, or 200,000 tons, of substrate. The facility has the flexibility to coat
numerous substrates using phenolic novolac or resole resin coating technology. Sand can be received and shipped both by truck and rail in order to help
meet customer requirements. The facility has the capability to ship via the Kansas City Southern interconnected to the Union Pacific railroad to many
key locations throughout the United States.

Product Delivery

Among the most important purchasing criteria of Unimin’s customers is the ability to deliver products they demand at the desired time and
location at the lowest possible cost. Unimin has one of the most comprehensive and diversified supply chain networks in the industries it serves, offering
Unimin a competitive advantage. In 2017, Unimin shipped its products via rail, barge and truck to approximately 1,500 customers in North America.
Unimin’s size and scale provides it with broad supply chain flexibility, which Unimin optimizes on a weekly basis using leading technology. As of
December 31, 2017, Unimin’s logistics network includes 32 proppant rail distribution terminals, of which one also has barge capability, and six
industrial terminals. The network also includes five origin transloads, two of which have barge capabilities. Unimin serves these locations with a fleet of
approximately 9,900 railcars (which includes approximately 2,700 customer railcars).

Unimin’s facilities are situated on five Class 1 railroads providing unit train service to every major oil and gas basin in the United States. The
ability to ship proppant through unit trains (a train made up of 100 or more railcars in which all cars carry the same commodity and are not split up or
stored en route) is important in order to cost-effectively provide large quantities of frac sand into shale plays. Unimin has unit train capabilities at four of
its production facilities and seven of its terminals can receive unit trains. Additionally, Unimin ships unit

trains to 18 customer facilities. In 2017, Unimin shipped approximately 13 million tons via rail, of which approximately 3.6 million tons were shipped
by unit train. Unimin also owns and operates the Winchester & Western railroad, a private railroad in New Jersey, West Virginia, Virginia and Maryland
. Unimin uses the Winchester & Western railroad to move minerals from its Dividing Creek and Gore facilities to customers via access to the Norfolk
Southern and CSX railroads.

Unimin believes that its private rail fleet enables it to maximize efficiency and reduce costs in its supply chain. Unimin is one of the few North
American mineral producers capable of Class 1 railroad deliveries in each of North America’s major oil and gas producing basins. It generally ships
products to either a terminal location, where it is stored until utilized by a customer, or to one of its processing facilities for value-added processing. The
direct rail access of Unimin’s processing and distribution facilities significantly reduces handling costs and lead-times while enhancing production
throughput, resulting in improved responsiveness to its customers.

The following map identifies the locations of Unimin’s 32 energy terminals, six industrial terminals and five transload facilities.

Foreign Operations

Unimin operates facilities throughout the United States, Mexico and Canada and sells products in North America, Mexico and to several countries
around the world. Although Unimin’s sales are geographically diverse, with significant mineral sales in Mexico, particularly in the glass and ceramics
industries, none of Unimin’s segments is dependent upon foreign operations. Unimin’s international operations are subject to various risks attendant to
doing business abroad. For a discussion of these risks, see the section entitled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Unimin’s Business—Unimin’s
international operations expose it to risks inherent in doing business abroad.” For additional information about Unimin’s operations outside of the
United States for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, see note 18 of the notes to Unimin’s audited historical consolidated financial
statements, copies of which are attached as Annex F to this proxy statement/prospectus.

Employees

As of December 31, 2017, Unimin has approximately 2,400 employees. Unimin believes that it maintains good relations with its workforce.
Unimin maintains an active dialogue with employees and provides salaried and hourly employees a comprehensive benefits package, including medical,
life and accident insurance, incentive bonus programs and a 401(k) plan with an employer match and discretionary employer contribution, company
pension (for certain employees) as well as various employee training and development programs that have been developed by Unimin or through a third
party.

As of December 31, 2017, approximately 40% of Unimin’s employees at 26 facilities are parties to collective bargaining agreements. Most of
these employees are members of the United Steelworkers of America union. Unimin believes it has strong relationships with and maintains an active
dialogue with union representatives. Unimin has historically been able to successfully extend and renegotiate collective bargaining agreements as they
expire. Unimin has not experienced a significant work stoppage or strike at any of its facilities in nearly 20 years.

Unimin believes that its compelling company culture provides a competitive advantage, creating a workplace where “exploring possibilities” and
“delivering on promise” are fostered and a given. Unimin’s management and employees pride themselves on being market driven, execution oriented
with a disciplined

capital investment philosophy. Unimin promotes from within, recognizing that leadership and skills development of its people will drive long term value
to stockholders. Likewise, Unimin does not compromise on its principles regarding sustainable development. Unimin believe these traits make it an
employer of choice and have resulted in significantly lower turnover rates compared to industry standards.

Raw Materials

Unimin’s products are dependent on the availability of certain raw materials, including natural gas or propane, limestone, resins and additives,
bagging supplies and other raw materials. These are readily available from a variety of sources and Unimin is not dependent on any one supplier of raw
materials.

Intellectual Property

Unimin’s intellectual property consists primarily of patents, trade secrets, know-how, trademarks, including the name Unimin, and products,
including but not limited to Unifrac, Minex, Glassil, Propstar, Imsil, Granusil and Puresil. Unimin holds numerous U.S. and foreign granted patents that
are still in force as well as many U.S. and foreign patent applications that are still pending. Unimin owns several patents in a number of product lines.
Unimin has not granted any third party rights with respect to its patents. The majority of Unimin’s patents have an expiration date after 2025. With
respect to trade secrets and know-how, Unimin’s extensive experience with a variety of different products enables Unimin to offer its customers a wide
range of products for their particular applications.

Research and Development

Unimin has a proven track record for developing industrial mineral-based solutions with and for its customers in the oil and gas, glass, industrial,
ceramic and other industries that it serves. Unimin invests significantly in the people, equipment and facilities required for analytical service, technical
service and research and development activities. Unimin possesses significant technical expertise in analytics, resource selection, extraction, separation,
processing, engineering, material science, application development, field testing and technical sales support of its products. In addition, Unimin has
historically been able to access the global research and development capabilities of Sibelco which has more than 25 research and development facilities
worldwide.

Unimin operates four laboratories in the United States and Mexico, which provide mineral processing, analytics and materials research for product
and application development across the oil and gas, glass, ceramics, coatings and polymers industries. Staffing across these four facilities comprises
over 40 professionals in analytical chemistry, mineral processing, mineralogy, inorganic chemistry, material science, coatings science, polymer science
and related fields. Unimin also employs technical sales expertise covering its core target industries.

Seasonality

Unimin’s business is affected to some extent by seasonal fluctuations that impact its production levels and its customers’ business needs. For
example, demand for many of the products Unimin sells in the construction and coatings sectors tends to correlate with construction activity, which is
lowest in the fourth quarter. Inclement weather may also cause temporary slowdowns for Unimin’s customers, which in turn impacts its volumes. All of
Unimin’s facilities are all weather facilities providing a consistent supply source to customers.

Regulation and Legislation

Mining and Workplace Safety

Federal Regulation

MSHA is the primary regulatory organization governing the industries in which Unimin operates. Accordingly, MSHA regulates quarries, surface
mines, underground mines and the industrial mineral processing facilities associated with quarries and mines. The mission of MSHA is to administer the
provisions of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 and to enforce compliance with mandatory safety and health standards. MSHA works
closely with the Industrial Minerals Association, a trade association, in pursuing this mission. As part of MSHA’s oversight, representatives perform at
least two unannounced inspections annually for each above-ground facility and four unannounced inspections annually for each underground facility. To
date these inspections have not resulted in any citations for violations of MSHA standards at Unimin’s facilities which had a material adverse effect on
Unimin’s results of operations or financial condition.

Unimin is also subject to the requirements of the OSHA and comparable state statutes that regulate the protection of the health and safety of
workers. In addition, the OSHA Hazard Communication Standard requires that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced
in operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and the public. OSHA regulates users of
commercial silica and provides detailed regulations requiring employers to protect employees from overexposure to silica through the enforcement of
permissible exposure limits.

Internal Controls

Unimin adheres to a strict occupational health program aimed at controlling exposure to silica dust, which includes dust sampling, a respiratory
protection program, medical surveillance, training and other components.

Table of Contents

Unimin’s safety program is designed to ensure compliance with the standards of both OSHA and MSHA regulations. For both health and safety issues,
extensive training is provided to employees. Unimin has safety committees at its facilities made up of salaried and hourly employees. Unimin performs
annual internal health and safety audits and conducts annual crisis management drills to test its facilities’ abilities to respond to various situations.
Health and safety programs are administered by Unimin’s corporate health and safety department with the assistance of local environmental, health and
safety coordinators.

Environmental Matters

Unimin and its competitors are subject to extensive governmental regulation on, among other things, matters such as permitting and licensing
requirements, plant and wildlife protection, hazardous materials, air and water emissions, and environmental contamination and reclamation. A variety
of federal, state and local agencies, as well as foreign regulatory authorities, implement and enforce these regulations.

U.S. Federal Regulation

Clean Water Act. Unimin’s facilities in the United States are subject to the U.S. Clean Water Act, which regulates the discharge of pollutants into
U.S. waters and regulates quality standards for surface waters. In particular, Unimin may be required to obtain permits under Section 404 of the Clean
Water Act from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the United States, including wetlands and
streams. In addition, Unimin may be required to obtain permits under Section 402 of the Clean Water Act from the EPA, or from the relevant state
environmental agency in states where the federal permit program has been delegated to the state, with respect to discharges of pollutants into waters of
the United States, including discharges of wastewater or storm water runoff associated with construction activities. Any failure to obtain these required
permits or to comply with their terms could subject Unimin to administrative, civil and criminal penalties as well as injunctive relief.

Clean Air Act. The U.S. Clean Air Act and comparable state laws regulate emissions of various air pollutants through air emissions permitting
programs and the imposition of other requirements, such as monitoring and reporting requirements. These regulatory programs may require Unimin to
install expensive emissions abatement equipment, modify its operational practices and obtain permits for its existing operations, and before commencing
construction on a new or modified source of air emissions, such laws may require the company to obtain pre-approval for the construction or
modification of certain projects or facilities that are expected to produce or significantly increase air emissions. In addition, air permits are required for
Unimin’s processing and terminal operations and for its frac sand mining operations that result in the emission of regulated air contaminants. The time
and effort required in obtaining air emissions permits has the potential to delay the development or continued performance of Unimin’s operations.
Unimin may be required to incur increased capital and operating costs because of these regulations, and Unimin could be subject to administrative, civil
and criminal penalties as well as injunctive relief for noncompliance with air permits or other requirements of the U.S. Clean Air Act and comparable
state laws and regulations.

Greenhouse Gases. Methane, a primary component of natural gas, and carbon dioxide, a byproduct of the burning of natural gas, are examples of
greenhouse gases. In recent years, the U.S. Congress has considered legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. It presently appears unlikely
that comprehensive climate legislation will be passed by either house of Congress in the near future, although energy legislation and other regulatory
initiatives may be proposed that may be relevant to greenhouse gas emissions issues.

The EPA has adopted regulations controlling greenhouse gas emissions under its existing authority under the Clean Air Act. In 2009, the EPA
officially published its findings that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases present a danger to human health and the
environment because emissions of such gases are, according to the EPA, contributing to the warming of the earth’s atmosphere and other climate
changes. These findings by the EPA allowed the agency to proceed with the adoption and implementation of regulations that would restrict emissions of
greenhouse gases under existing provisions of the Clean Air Act. In 2010, the EPA published a final rule expanding its greenhouse gas emissions
reporting rule for certain petroleum and natural gas facilities that emit 25,000 metric tons or more of carbon dioxide equivalent per year. Unimin is
subject to annual greenhouse gas reporting obligations for its operations in Calera, Alabama.

Table of Contents

Although it is not currently possible to predict how any proposed or future greenhouse gas legislation or regulation will impact Unimin’s business,
any legislation or regulation of greenhouse gas emissions that may be imposed in areas in which Unimin conducts business (whether in the United
States, Mexico, Canada or otherwise) could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions or reduced demand for Unimin’s
services and could have a material adverse effect Unimin’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

Use and Storage of Petroleum Products. As part of its operations, Unimin utilizes or stores petroleum products and other substances such as diesel
fuel, lubricating oils and hydraulic fluid. Unimin is subject to regulatory programs pertaining to the storage, use, transportation and disposal of these
substances, including spill prevention, control and countermeasure planning requirements. Spills or releases may occur in the course of Unimin’s
operations, and Unimin could incur substantial costs and liabilities as a result of such spills or releases, including those relating to claims for damage or
injury to property and persons.

CERCLA. Some of Unimin’s operations are located on properties that historically have been used in ways that resulted in the release of
contaminants, including hazardous substances, into the environment, and Unimin could be held liable for the remediation of such historical
contamination. CERCLA and comparable state laws impose joint and several liability, without regard to fault or legality of conduct, on classes of
persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of hazardous substances into the environment. These persons include the owner or operator
of the site where the release occurred and anyone who disposed or arranged for the disposal of a hazardous substance released at the site. Under
CERCLA, such persons may be subject to liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances, for damages to natural resources and for the
costs of certain health studies. In addition, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and
property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment.

RCRA. In the course of its operations, Unimin generates industrial solid wastes that may be regulated as hazardous wastes. The U.S. Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and comparable state statutes regulate the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, disposal and
cleanup of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. The EPA and the individual states, to which the EPA has delegated portions of the RCRA program for
local implementation, administer the RCRA program.

Hydraulic Fracturing. Although Unimin does not directly engage in hydraulic fracturing activities, Unimin supplies sand-based proppants to
hydraulic fracturing operators in the oil and natural gas industry. Hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals, under
pressure, into a formation to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. The hydraulic fracturing process is typically regulated by state or
local governmental authorities. However, the practice of hydraulic fracturing has become controversial in some areas and is undergoing increased
scrutiny. Several federal agencies and regulatory authorities are investigating the potential environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing and whether
additional regulation may be necessary. The EPA has asserted limited federal regulatory authority over hydraulic fracturing and has indicated it may
seek to further expand its regulation of hydraulic fracturing. The Bureau of Land Management has proposed regulations applicable to hydraulic
fracturing conducted on federal and Indian oil and gas leases. Congress has from time to time considered the adoption of legislation to provide for
federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing. In addition, various state, local and foreign governments have implemented, or are considering, increased
regulatory oversight of hydraulic fracturing through additional permitting requirements, operational restrictions, disclosure requirements and temporary
or permanent bans on hydraulic fracturing in certain areas such as environmentally sensitive watersheds. Numerous states have imposed disclosure
requirements on hydraulic fracturing well owners and operators. Some local governments have adopted and others may seek to adopt ordinances
prohibiting or regulating the time, place and manner of drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing activities within their jurisdictions.

The adoption of new laws, regulations or enforcement policies at the federal, state, local or foreign levels imposing reporting obligations on, or
otherwise limiting or delaying, the hydraulic fracturing process could make it more difficult for Unimin to complete oil and natural gas wells, increase
Unimin’s customer’s costs of

Table of Contents

compliance and doing business, and otherwise adversely affect the hydraulic fracturing services Unimin performs, which could negatively impact
demand for Unimin’s sand-based proppants.

NEPA. Unimin’s operations may also be subject to broad environmental review under the National Environmental Policy Act (“NEPA”). NEPA
requires federal agencies to evaluate the environmental impact of all “major federal actions” significantly affecting the quality of the human
environment. The granting of a federal permit for a major development project, such as a mining operation, may be considered a “major federal action”
that requires review under NEPA. Therefore, Unimin’s projects may require review and evaluation under NEPA. As part of this evaluation, the federal
agency considers a broad array of environmental impacts, including, among other things, impacts on air quality, water quality, wildlife (including
threatened and endangered species), historical and archeological resources, geology, socioeconomics and aesthetics. NEPA also requires the
consideration of alternatives to the project. The NEPA review process, especially the preparation of a full environmental impact statement, can be time
consuming and expensive. The purpose of the NEPA review process is to inform federal agencies’ decision-making on whether federal approval should
be granted for a project and to provide the public with an opportunity to comment on the environmental impacts of a proposed project. Though NEPA
requires only that an environmental evaluation be conducted and does not mandate a result, a federal agency could decide to deny a permit, or impose
certain conditions on its approval, based on its environmental review under NEPA, or a third party may challenge the adequacy of a NEPA review and
thereby delay the issuance of a federal permit or approval.

Endangered Species. Federal agencies granting permits for Unimin’s operations also must consider impacts to endangered and threatened species
and their habitat under the Endangered Species Act. Unimin must comply with and is subject to liability under the Endangered Species Act, which
prohibits and imposes stringent penalties for the harming of endangered or threatened species and their habitat. Some of Unimin’s operations are
conducted in areas where protected species or their habitats are known to exist. In these areas, Unimin may be obligated to develop and implement plans
to avoid potential adverse effects to protected species and their habitats, and Unimin may be prohibited from conducting operations in certain locations
or during certain times, such as breeding and nesting seasons, when its operations could have an adverse effect on the species. Federal agencies also
must consider a project’s impacts on historic or archeological resources under the National Historic Preservation Act, and Unimin may be required to
conduct archeological surveys of project sites and to avoid or preserve historical areas or artifacts.

Canadian Mining and Environmental Regulation

Unimin currently conducts mining operations in two Canadian provinces, Ontario and Quebec. In Canada, the provinces play an important role
with respect to air, water, waste and spill regulation. Both Ontario and Quebec have a Mining Act, which governs and regulates prospecting, mineral
exploration, mine development and rehabilitation in their respective provinces. The Ontario Ministry of Northern Development and Mines (“MNDM”)
manages mining leases on Ontario properties.

Mine Closures. Rehabilitation of mine sites protects public health and safety, alleviates environmental damage and facilitates the productive use of
the land upon completion of the mining project. The MNDM is responsible for the filing of site-specific closure plan documents and associated financial
assurance of the estimated closure cost using qualified professionals and third-party contractors, with no credit for salvage value. The Director of Mine
Rehabilitation requires every mine to submit a closure plan for the mining project site to ensure rehabilitation of the site. In Ontario, the closure plan
must include financial assurance in the form of cash, a letter of credit or a performance bond. Amendments to the closure plan require submission of a
Notice of Material Change and potential Closure Plan Amendments.

Tree Cutting Approvals. Crown mining leases and patents often withhold ownership of trees on the relevant property. Consequently, tree cutting
and harvesting approvals must be obtained from the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry (MNFR). Tree cutting may also impact species
at risk or migratory birds, and any tree cutting must include an assessment of the impact to natural resources.

Environmental Reporting. Canada’s federal Minister of Environment and Climate Change publishes an annual notice in the Canada Gazette
requiring any person who meets certain criteria to submit information to the

Table of Contents

government on their annual releases to air, water or land and transfers for disposal or recycling, including discharges to tailings. For most substances,
reporting is required for any person who has operated a facility at which employees have worked a total of not less than 20,000 hours during the
previous year and which has manufactured or otherwise used a prescribed mass of any of the substances listed in a schedule, which currently contains
more than 300 substances. This reporting requirement applies to both of Unimin’s Canadian facilities.

Fisheries Act. The Canadian Fisheries Act is a federal act that is primarily concerned with conserving and protecting fish resources in Canada’s
coastal and internal waters. The Canadian Fisheries Act applies to mining operations that discharge effluent into streams, rivers, lakes or oceans. From
time to time, the expansion of mining and processing activities into fish-bearing waters requires authorization from the Department of Fisheries and
Oceans. This authorization usually requires mitigation and compensation for the loss of fish and/or fish habitat. If, as a consequence of mining activities,
fish rescue is required, the mining company must obtain a license from the applicable province.

Environmental Emergency Plans. The objectives of the Environmental Emergency Regulations (E2 Regulations) under the Canadian
Environmental Protection Act, 1999 (CEPA 1999) are to reduce the frequency and consequences of uncontrolled, unplanned or accidental releases of
hazardous substances into the environment. Environmental Emergency (E2) Plans are generated for chemicals stored on-site in excess of prescribed
quantities. The purpose of the E2 Plans is to ensure appropriate prevention, preparedness, response and recovery measures are adhered to in managing
chemical storage and transfer. Currently, propane storage is regulated at some of Unimin’s facilities. This requires notifications and preparation and
implementation of Environmental Emergency Plans.

Greenhouse Gases. Canadian regulations govern the emissions of greenhouse gases. Unimin is required to calculate greenhouse gas emissions
annually at its operations in Nephton, Ontario and St. Canut, Quebec. Emissions at both locations are currently below regulatory reporting thresholds. In
addition, beginning in 2018, greenhouse gas emitters exceeding 25,000 metric tons will be taxed per ton of emission; this requirement will not directly
affect Unimin’s operations in Canada but will indirectly affect Unimin to the extent the tax is passed on to Unimin from suppliers in the form of higher
fuel and energy costs.

Endangered Species. The Canadian Species at Risk Act seeks to prevent wildlife species in Canada from disappearing, to provide for the recovery
of wildlife species that are extirpated, endangered or threatened as a result of human activity, and to manage species of special concern to prevent them
from becoming endangered or threatened. A series of measures applicable across Canada provides the means to accomplish these goals. Some of these
measures establish how governments, organizations and individuals in Canada work together, while others implement a species assessment process to
ensure the protection and recovery of species. Some measures provide for sanctions for noncompliance.

Aboriginal Community’s Rights. In Canada, the duty to consult and accommodate with Aboriginal communities arises when the Crown (comprised
of both the federal and provincial governments of Canada) contemplates actions or decisions that may affect an Aboriginal person’s aboriginal or treaty
rights. This duty arises most often in the context of natural resource extraction, such as mining. Although in many provinces industry proponents consult
with Aboriginal rights holders, the ultimate substantive duty to ensure proper consultation and accommodation lies with the Crown. When permitting
activities may cause environmental impacts to aboriginal traditional and treaty territories, consultation is conducted, usually as part of the permit
process, to identify and mitigate potential issues.

Mexican Environmental Regulation

Unimin’s Mexican facilities are subject to numerous Mexican federal, state and municipal government environmental laws and regulations.
Mexico’s principal federal environmental law is the General Law of Ecological Balance and the Protection of the Environment, under which various
specific rules regulate the control of emissions to the atmosphere, environmental impact assessment, territorial ecological ordering, protected natural
areas and voluntary environmental audits. There are other substantive general laws in Mexico for national water management, sustainable forest
development, prevention and integral management of waste,

climate change, wildlife and liability for environmental damage. Mexico’s General Water Law can require companies to obtain permits for the discharge
of process wastewater and for the use of groundwater or surface water. Other Mexican regulations require stationary sources of air pollution to obtain an
operating license for emissions. With respect to the use and storage of various petroleum products and other substances, Unimin may be subject to
feasibility studies of environmental risk, depending on the amount and type of substances Unimin utilizes or stores. As a result of these and other laws
and regulations, Unimin may be required to incur increased capital and operating costs and could be subject to administrative, civil and criminal
penalties as well as injunctive relief for noncompliance with applicable Mexican regulations.

Hazardous Waste. Mexican law prohibits companies from generating, storing, transporting or disposing of hazardous waste without appropriate
permits. Mexico’s General Law for the Prevention and Integral Management of Wastes regulates the generation, characterization and comprehensive
management of hazardous waste; the identification and remediation of contaminated sites; the establishment of liabilities and responsibilities for
generators, importers, exporters, dealers, consumers, and waste management service providers; the promotion of waste minimization and
characterization; and the requirements and prohibitions on the import and export of waste. Unimin’s facilities in Mexico are subject to these provisions.

Greenhouse Gases. Mexico adopted the General Law on Climate Change in 2012. This law established legally binding metrics for renewable
sourcing and emission reduction, setting goals of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 30% by 2020 from 2000 levels and by 50% by 2050. It also
established a goal of obtaining 35% of the country’s electricity from renewable sources before 2024. Additionally, pursuant to Mexico’s 2014 tax
reform, Mexico applies a special tax on fossil fuels that varies depending on carbon content and can be paid directly or through carbon bonds. Unimin’s
Mexican facilities are subject to measurement and reporting requirements with respect to certain emissions based on the size and scope of their
operations. Unimin’s Mexican operations may in the future become subject to new and additional emissions rules related the laws described above.

Liability for Environmental Damage. Mexico adopted the Environmental Liability Law in 2013. This statute in general provides for and regulates
individual and corporate liability derived from environmental damage, which is defined as the “measurable adverse loss, deterioration, harm, affectation
or modification of the chemical, physical and biological conditions of habitats, ecosystems, natural elements and resources as well as of their interaction
relationships and the environmental services provided by the same.” The Environmental Liability Law provides that those individuals or legal entities
responsible for causing environmental damage are obliged to undertake the corresponding damage reparation or compensation actions (when damage
reparation is not possible). The reparation of environmental damages involves the restitution of habitats, ecosystems, elements and natural resources to
their original state through restoration, reestablishment, treatment, recovery or remediation actions. When environmental damage is proved to be
intentional, the law provides that the responsible party may be subject to an economic fine. If any of Unimin’s facilities are found to have caused
environmental damage within the meaning of and pursuant to the Environmental Liability Law, then Unimin could be liable for reparations costs and
other monetary sanctions.

Forest Conservation. Unimin’s Mexican facilities are subject to and must comply with Mexico’s General Law for Sustainable Forest
Development, which aims to protect and restore forests and to ensure biodiversity conservation and the protection of people affected by forest changes.
The law seeks to promote conservation and restoration of forest ecosystems and sets targets for sustainable forest development, including increasing the
percentage of sustainably harvested forest resources, increasing the percentage of restored or rehabilitated forest area, reducing the annual net
deforestation rate and avoiding CO2 emissions from deforestation and forest degradation.

Wildlife Protection. Unimin’s Mexican facilities are subject to and must comply with Mexico’s General Wildlife Law, which governs the
conservation and sustainable use of wildlife and its habitat in Mexico. The law seeks to promote the conservation of genetic diversity, as well as the
protection, restoration and comprehensive management of natural habitats. The law also includes preventive measures for maintaining appropriate
conditions for the evolution, viability and continuity of ecosystems, habitats and populations in their natural surroundings; participation of owners and
rightful holders in conservation, restoration and the benefits derived from sustainable

use; and criteria for sanctions that not only penalize but also translate into actions that contribute and stimulate the transition to sustainable development.
Unimin’s operations in Mexico may require permits for land use change in forest land. These permits may include conditions such as requiring the
payment of fees for environmental compensation for government restorations as well as requiring reclamation commitments.

State, Provincial and Local Regulation

Because its operations are located in numerous states, provinces and municipalities, Unimin is also subject to a variety of different state,
provincial and local environmental review and permitting requirements. Some states and provinces in which Unimin’s projects are located or are being
developed have state and provincial laws similar to NEPA; thus Unimin’s development of new sites or the expansion of existing sites may be subject to
comprehensive state or provincial environmental reviews even if it is not subject to federal requirements. In some cases, the state or provincial
environmental review may be more stringent than the federal review. Unimin’s operations may require state or provincial law-based permits in addition
to federal or local permits, requiring state agencies to consider a range of issues, many the same issues reviewed by the federal agencies, including,
among other things, a project’s impact on wildlife and their habitats, historic and archaeological sites, aesthetics, agricultural operations and scenic
areas. Some states also have specific permitting and review processes for commercial silica mining operations, and states may impose different or
additional monitoring or mitigation requirements than federal agencies. The development of new sites and Unimin’s existing operations also are subject
to a variety of local environmental and regulatory requirements, including land use, zoning, building and transportation requirements.

Some local communities have expressed concern regarding silica sand mining operations. These concerns have generally included exposure to
ambient silica sand dust, truck traffic, water usage and blasting. In response, certain state and local communities have developed or are in the process of
developing regulations or zoning restrictions intended to minimize dust from getting airborne, control the flow of truck traffic, significantly curtail the
amount of practicable area for mining activities, require compensation to local residents for potential impacts of mining activities and, in some cases,
ban issuance of new permits for mining activities. To date, Unimin has not experienced any material impact to its existing mining operations or planned
capacity expansions as a result of these types of concerns.

Any expansion of Unimin’s mining and production capacity or construction and operation of related facilities in new communities could be
significantly impacted by increased regulatory activity. Difficulties or delays in obtaining or the inability to obtain new mining permits, or increased
costs of compliance with future state, provincial and local regulatory requirements, could have a material negative impact on Unimin’s ability to grow its
business. In an effort to minimize these risks, Unimin continues to be engaged with local communities in order to grow and maintain strong
relationships with residents and regulators.

Costs of Compliance

Unimin may incur significant costs and liabilities as a result of environmental, health and safety requirements applicable to its activities. For
example, in 2018, Unimin plans to invest approximately $4.4 million in environmental systems at its Blue Mountain, Canoitas and Jaltipan facilities.
Failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, imposition of
investigatory, cleanup and site restoration costs and liens, the denial or revocation of permits or other authorizations and the issuance of injunctions to
limit or cease operations. Compliance with these laws and regulations may also increase the cost of the development, construction and operation of
Unimin’s projects and may prevent or delay the commencement or continuance of a given project. In addition, claims for damages to persons or
property may result from environmental and other impacts of Unimin’s activities. In addition, the clear trend in environmental regulation is to place
more restrictions on activities that may affect the environment and thus, any changes in, or more stringent enforcement of, these laws and regulations
that result in more stringent and costly pollution control equipment, waste handling, storage, transport, disposal or remediation requirements could have
a material adverse effect on Unimin’s operations and financial position.

The process for performing environmental impact studies and reviews for federal, state and local permits for Unimin’s operations involves a
significant investment of time and monetary resources. Unimin cannot control

Table of Contents

the permit approval process. Unimin cannot predict whether all permits required for a given project will be granted or whether such permits will be the
subject of significant opposition. The denial of a permit essential to a project or the imposition of conditions with which it is not practicable or feasible
to comply could impair or prevent Unimin’s ability to develop a project. Significant opposition by neighboring property owners, members of the public
or other third parties, as well as any delay in the environmental review and permitting process, could impair or delay Unimin’s ability to develop or
expand a project. Additionally, the passage of more stringent environmental laws could impair Unimin’s ability to develop new operations and have an
adverse effect on Unimin’s financial condition and results of operations.

Sustainability Practices

Sustainability

Sustainable and responsible business practice is the guiding principle of Unimin’s operational management. Unimin has historically sustained its
economic growth through continuous improvement and innovation. With disciplined application, Unimin’s sustainability programs facilitate the
balanced pursuit of economic performance, environmental stewardship and social responsibility. Exploration activity, mine modeling and strategic
decisions reflect corporate edicts to balance current and future demand with prudent resource management and environmental stewardship.

Unimin is committed to the efficient use of the natural resources in its care. Unimin’s facilities operate with advanced technologies to minimize
water and energy consumption and to preserve the air quality and noise levels of its communities. Good resource management also means optimized
utilization of the resource to ensure sustainable performance. Mine planning, process engineering and production management are organized to optimize
operational performance while reducing operational footprint.

Unimin is a corporate partner with the University of Wisconsin Eau Claire Responsible Mining Initiative. The company provides varying levels of
annual scholarships, sponsors the geology field camp for students and provides paid internship opportunities annually.

Safety

Safety is a team effort at Unimin. Engagement of the entire team in the safety process is the key to Unimin’s safety record. Unimin’s employees’
hand-on experience brings valuable insights to its safety initiatives and yields practical programs that are collaboratively conceived and collectively
implemented.

Employee ownership of Unimin’s safety programs is also the key to the company’s “Zero Harm” initiative, otherwise known as “Going for Zero.”
The “Going for Zero” program is a comprehensive, step-change approach to safety that combines training, rigorous adherence to lifesaving rules and
peer practice intended to make every employee a safety leader. “Going for Zero” at work and at home represents a behavior change and an anticipated
new safety benchmark for Unimin.

Unimin’s forward-thinking team of health and safety professionals has collaborated for many years with scientists and engineers from the National
Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). These collaboration efforts have resulted in the development of the NIOSH clothes cleaning
booth technology, the Helmet-CAM and EVADE (Enhanced Video Analysis of Dust Exposure) technology and the NIOSH Dust Control Handbook for
Industrial Minerals Mining and Processing.

Implementation of Unimin’s health and safety program is supported by a health and safety policy manual, the requirements of which are
comprehensively field audited on an ongoing basis by Unimin’s staff of certified industrial hygienists and safety professionals. While Unimin’s goal is
to prevent all injuries and illnesses, when one does occur, Unimin rigorously investigates and then implements corrective/preventative measures through
its incident cause analysis method.

Desired safe behaviors are positively reinforced on an ongoing basis through Unimin’s Safety Starts with Me process. The engagement of the
entire team in the health and safety process, combined with Unimin’s “Going for Zero” program, has consistently delivered injury and illness
performance well below the national average for

the non-metallic minerals and mining industry. Unimin’s lost time incident rate remains 3-4 times below the national average and its rate of reportable
incidents remains approximately one-half the national average.

Community Relations

Unimin encourages responsible and sustainable mining practices through community outreach, industry association and university scholarship
programs. At each level, these programs foster a better understanding of mining and industrial minerals in our society and reinforce best operational and
environmental practices. Unimin’s support of universities engaged in the study of geology, hydrogeology, restorative ecology and regulatory policy
underscores Unimin’s commitment to a sustainable and environmentally sound future for the mining and mineral processing industry.

Unimin takes great pride in its community relations and values the constructive exchange that exists between Unimin, its neighbors and its many
local stakeholders. Locally formulated community action plans reflect that pride and Unimin’s genuine desire to be an involved community member.
These plans can include financial participation, sponsorship and volunteer service to benefit school, scouting and sports programs, public safety, fire
prevention and conservation initiatives. Unimin also encourages its facilities to spend locally and source as much as 80% of its operating consumables
from local vendors. The multiplier effect of these expenditures cascades through local contractor, business and service industries to benefit all who live
in the community.

Unimin opens its restored lands for Boy and Girl Scouting adventures, community outings and educational field trips. Through the Wildlife
Habitat Council program of Corporate Lands for Learning, Unimin has certified and made its properties accessible as outdoor classrooms, wildlife
observatories and recreational spaces. Unimin hosts more than 10,000 students, scouts and outdoor enthusiasts on its properties each year. Facility tours
provide a different, but equally valuable, educational experience. Unimin opens its doors to school groups and neighbors to share the science and
sustainability of mining.

Biodiversity Preservation

An important component of Unimin’s resource management program is its commitment to preserve and enhance biodiversity on the lands it
manages. Working with community and national organizations, Unimin has transformed more than 100,000 acres into healthy and diverse ecosystems
for wildlife, including wood ducks, whitetail deer, wild turkey, bluebirds, screech owls and an abundance of fish species.

Unimin is recognized by the Wildlife Habitat Council (“WHC”) for its preservation efforts and has certified 32 of its sites through WHC’s
Wildlife at Work program. Unimin is a recipient of the Wildlife Habitat Council’s most prestigious Corporate Habitat of the Year Award, recognizing
Unimin’s conservatory projects designed to reintroduce and protect displaced species.

Unimin has partnered with Ducks Unlimited to advance the restoration and rehabilitation of wetland habitats in the communities where it operates.
With many of its sites located along key waterfowl, song bird and pollinator migration routes, Unimin has committed to providing $1 million to Ducks
Unlimited to advance wetland and pollinator habitats in all three countries where it operates.

Employee Health

Unimin’s Wellness Program – “Wellness Rocks!” – aims to support employee health by providing programs that target identified health risks,
offer tools and educational opportunities to mitigate those health risks, measure health maintenance and improvement and reward healthy outcomes. The
Wellness Rocks! Program accomplishes this by incorporating resources of all health and welfare benefits (including health and disability insurance, the
Employee Assistance Program and Workers’ Compensation) and the Safety and Health Department, to specifically offer employees and their spouses
annual voluntary health screenings, health risk assessments, disease management, tobacco cessation one-on-one coaching, educational programs and
fitness programs.

Employee Training

Unimin delivers more than 35,000 hours of technical training, personal development and safety education each year. Training and education is a
continuing, life-long endeavor at Unimin, and Unimin encourages employees to

participate in the many programs organized under the Unimin University and Sibelco banner. Classroom seminars and technical training ensure that the
team is educated and equipped to create value for Unimin’s customers and Unimin. Courses in safety and health, engineering and industrial operations,
geology and the environment and leadership and managerial skills continually prepare employees for their next challenge and job responsibility.

Unimin also sponsors a New Graduate Training Program (“NGTP”) to provide engineers and technically-oriented employees with immediate and
substantive exposure to the many facets of Unimin’s operations. NGTP allows new employees to work in several different departments and to interact
with Unimin’s management team before deciding on any one department in which to work.

Legal Proceedings

Unimin is subject to various legal proceedings, claims and governmental inspections, audits or investigations arising out of its business, which
cover matters such as general commercial, governmental regulations, FCPA requirements, antitrust and trade regulations, product liability,
environmental, intellectual property, employment and other actions. Although the outcomes of these claims cannot be predicted with certainty, in the
opinion of Unimin’s management, except as stated below, the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on Unimin’s
financial position or results of operations.

On November 13, 2017, Unimin received a letter and proposed settlement agreement from the EPA in the amount of $0.7 million regarding the
Ward Transformer Superfund Site in Raleigh, Wake County, North Carolina. The EPA alleges that Unimin may be liable with respect to the site as an
arranger who, by contract or agreement, arranged for the disposal, treatment or transportation of hazardous substances to the site. In November 2016, the
EPA entered into a consent decree with 173 parties (but not Unimin) related to this site. In early 2017, two private party suits that named Unimin as a
defendant in relation to this matter were dismissed. Unimin is currently engaged in settlement discussions with the EPA. Unimin does not expect the
amount of any such settlement to be significant to Unimin or to the combined company.

Unimin and/or its predecessors have been named as a defendant, usually among many defendants, in numerous product liability lawsuits alleging
damages caused by silica exposure, mostly brought by or on behalf of current or former employees of their customers. As of December 31, 2017, there
were 137 active silica-related products liability claims pending in which Unimin is a defendant. During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016,
Unimin was named as a defendant in 10 and five new claims, respectively, and resolved seven and five claims, respectively. Many of the claims pending
against Unimin arise out of the alleged use of its silica products in foundries or as an abrasive blast media and have been filed in the states of Ohio and
Mississippi, although cases have been brought in many other jurisdictions over the years. In accordance with Unimin’s insurance obligations, these
claims are being defended by Unimin’s subsidiaries’ insurance carriers, subject to Unimin’s payment of a percentage of the defense costs. Based on
information currently available, management cannot reasonably estimate a loss at this time. Although the outcomes of these claims cannot be predicted
with certainty, in Unimin’s view, none of these cases, individually or in the aggregate are probable to have a material adverse effect on Unimin’s
business, financial condition and results of operations.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF UNIMIN

The following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of Unimin Corporation (for purposes of this section,
“Unimin” or the “Company”) should be read together with the section entitled “Business” and the consolidated financial statements of Unimin and
related notes thereto and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus. The following discussion contains
forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. See the section entitled “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-
Looking Statements” beginning on page 94 of this proxy statement/prospectus. Unimin’s actual results could differ materially from those contained in
forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including those discussed in the section entitled “Risk Factors” beginning on page 46 of this
proxy statement/prospectus and elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus. The following discussion contains certain non-GAAP financial measures,
including EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. See “—Key Metrics Used to Evaluate Unimin’s Business” for a reconciliation of net income (loss) to EBITDA
and Adjusted EBITDA.

Overview

Unimin is an application-focused minerals company providing materials solutions to its customers drawing from a diversified product portfolio
with 28 million tons of annual production capacity. Unimin produces a wide range of specialized silica sand, feldspar, nepheline syenite, calcium
carbonate, clay, kaolin, lime and limestone products for use in the energy and industrial end markets in North America and around the world. Its 31
mining facilities with reserves (including one facility currently under construction) and nine processing facilities (including one inactive facility) span
the United States, Mexico and Canada and have access to more than 475 million tons of mineral reserves (as defined by the SEC). Unimin’s frac sand
facilities are among the largest, most flexible and cost-efficient facilities in the industry, and Unimin’s industrial assets are located in close proximity to
key industrial customers. Unimin’s parent company, Sibelco, is a 145 year old family-owned global leader in the production of industrial minerals with
operations in over 40 countries. This heritage brings a strong history and expertise in operational excellence, customer collaboration and application
development that is coupled with a global perspective and market understanding, sustainability and durable, returns-oriented investing. During the year
ended December 31, 2017, Unimin sold 23.4 million tons of minerals and had revenue of $1,444.5 million, net income of $154.2 million and Adjusted
EBITDA of $292.6 million.

Unimin’s operations are organized into four segments based on the primary industries served—an Energy segment, an Industrial segment, an
Electronics segment and a Corporate & Other segment. Unimin’s Energy segment is a leading global supplier of sand-based proppants, with more than
13 million tons of low cost raw frac sand capacity and 350,000 tons of annual resin coated sand capacity (both active and idle). Unimin offers the oil and
gas industry a comprehensive portfolio of raw frac sand, resin coated sands, well cementing additives, gravel packing media and drilling mud additives
that meet or exceed API standards. For the year ended December 31, 2017, Unimin’s Energy segment sold 11.2 million tons of minerals and generated
revenue of $655.9 million (45% of total Company revenue) and segment gross profit of $181.7 million.

Unimin’s Industrial segment sells value-added products to the glass, ceramics, construction, coatings, polymers, foundry and various other
industries. For Unimin, these industries are characterized by stable volumes, a blue-chip customer base and predictable performance. Unimin
differentiates itself in the Industrial markets by providing a diverse portfolio of products and solutions together with deep technical application
know-how that improves the performance of its industrial customers’ processes and products. Unimin sells its products from high quality, cost-efficient
facilities, which are typically located in close proximity to its customers in industries such as glass and foundry. During the year ended December 31,
2017, Unimin’s Industrial segment sold 12.1 million tons of minerals and had revenue of $639.2 million (44% of total Company revenue) and segment
gross profit of $181.2 million.

Unimin’s Electronics segment serves the global high purity fused quartz market for applications which include semiconductors, solar energy,
specialty lighting and fiber optics industries. For the year ended December 31, 2017, Unimin’s Electronics segment sold 123,000 tons of minerals and
had revenue of

$149.4 million (11% of total Company revenue) and segment gross profit of $48.6 million. Unimin’s Electronics segment will be distributed to Sibelco
immediately before the closing of the Merger and will no longer constitute a segment of the combined company following the Merger.

Unimin’s Corporate & Other segment consists of its wholly owned subsidiaries, Unimin do Brasil Ltda. (“Unimin Brazil”) and Sociedad Unimin
de Venezuela Company (“Unimin Venezuela”). In April 2016, Unimin sold its investment in Unimin Venezuela for $0.01 million to an unrelated third
party and recorded a loss on the sale of $12.9 million, which has been recorded in Other expense, net in Unimin’s consolidated statements of income
(loss). In March 2016, Sibelco made the decision to transfer ownership of Unimin’s Brazilian operations to another subsidiary of Sibelco. As a result,
Unimin transferred its entire ownership interest in Unimin Brazil to a wholly owned subsidiary of Sibelco for nominal consideration. Accordingly, this
segment has generated no revenue subsequent to April 2016. During the year ended December 31, 2017, Unimin’s Corporate & Other segment did not
generate revenue or segment gross profit, as the Brazilian and Venezuelan operations were sold or transferred during 2016 and were no longer a part of
Unimin.

Unimin has developed one of the largest and most comprehensive supply chains in the industry with large, unit train capable processing facilities
situated on the Union Pacific, Canadian Pacific, CSX and BNSF railroads, which shipped approximately 300 unit trains in 2017. In addition to its 31
mining facilities with reserves (one of which is under construction), nine processing facilities (one of which is inactive), 38 terminals (including 32
proppant rail distribution terminals, one of which also has barge capability, and six industrial terminals) and approximately 9,900 railcars, Unimin’s
operations have direct access to five origin transload locations, of which two have barge capabilities. Unimin also owns and operates the Winchester &
Western railroad, a shortline railroad operating in New Jersey, West Virginia, Virginia and Maryland. The results of the Winchester & Western railroad
are reported as part of Unimin’s Industrial segment.

Recent Trends

Unimin’s business is significantly influenced by global market trends in the end markets it serves. Recent trends affecting demand for Unimin’s
products include the following:

Energy segment market trends
 

 

•  Volatility of drilling activity. Through 2014, growth in the use of horizontal drilling utilizing hydraulic fracturing as a means to extract
hydrocarbons from shale formations dramatically increased onshore oil and gas activity in North America. This contributed to substantial
growth in demand for proppants from 2009 to 2014. In 2015, due to the increasing global supply of oil and slowing growth of global oil
demand, crude oil prices declined, which caused various exploration and production companies to reduce capital programs resulting in
significantly reduced completion activity. U.S. horizontal land rig counts fell from an average of 730 rigs throughout 2015 to an average of
400 rigs in 2016. Likewise, completion crews fell from a high over 530 in 2014 to a low of 151 in 2016. This volatility and cyclicality in
U.S. onshore oil and gas resulted in reduced demand for proppants throughout 2015 and 2016. In 2017, prices for oil rebounded and the
market experienced a turnaround as oilfield activity increased significantly, which caused an increase in demand for proppant across most
basins, especially the Permian basin. The increased demand resulted in market pricing rising for proppants throughout the year.

 

 

•  Shifts in drilling activity affect the mix of proppants customers require. Well design and completion trends in oil and gas have an impact on
demand for and the mix of proppants Unimin sells. In 2013 and 2014, well designs centered around guar and crosslinked gel utilizing coarse
grade proppants with high conductivity. Exploration and production companies also were often using resin coated proppants for added
strength and flowback control. In 2015 and 2016, lower crude oil prices caused exploration and production companies to seek ways to
reduce short-term operating costs. This resulted in operators experimenting with slickwater designs utilizing longer laterals and high loading
of lower priced, finer grades of proppant. Further, lower crude oil prices have caused many operators to experiment with pure raw sand well
design which has had an adverse impact on the demand for coated proppants.

Table of Contents

 

•  Volatility in selling prices for proppants. The rapid growth in demand for proppants in 2014 driven by relatively high oil and gas prices and
high levels of drilling activity caused selling prices for proppants to increase as the market for proppants was generally undersupplied. This
imbalance of supply and demand caused many proppant suppliers to expand production capacity in anticipation of continued growth in
demand. However, the rapid decline in oil and gas prices that occurred later in 2014 and into 2016 led to reduced drilling activity and
reduced demand for proppants. As a result, the proppant market was in a position of oversupply, which caused selling prices for all
proppants to decline throughout the majority of 2016. In 2017, the market experienced a turnaround and proppant pricing increased across
all basins as growth outpaced the ability to add idled and new capacity back to the market.

 

 

•  Increased demand for in-basin delivery of proppants. A proppant vendor’s logistics capabilities have become an important differentiating
factor when competing for business, on both a spot and contract basis. In recent years, many customers have sought to outsource proppant
logistics and to purchase material from a supplier’s own terminal (e.g., in-basin), allowing them to focus on their core competencies,
minimize inventory costs and maximize flexibility. In 2017 and 2016, approximately 51% and 46%, respectively, of Unimin’s proppant sales
volume was sold via in-basin terminals. Unimin’s terminal network continues to be a key differentiator for customers and enables Unimin to
provide proppants closer to the well site. With Unimin’s increasing capability to provide low-cost unit train shipments directly to large
customers while also shipping unit trains to certain of its own in-basin terminals, Unimin is well-equipped to take advantage of growing
proppant demand.

 

 

•  Emerging in-basin supply. In 2017, multiple sand suppliers announced greenfield projects in the Permian basin and, to a lesser extent, basins
in Texas and Oklahoma. Locating a plant in-basin significantly reduces the logistics costs, and therefore the overall delivered product cost.
Unimin is building a plant in the county of Crane, Texas which will have a nameplate capacity of 3 million tons annually. The Crane facility
has been substantially contracted and allows Unimin to offer low cost in-basin, high quality northern white and resin coated proppants.

 

 

•  Increased demand for unit train deliveries. With the shift of larger oilfield services customers toward shipments taken directly from
Unimin’s facilities, there is also a greater demand for shipments via unit trains to improve the economics of deliveries. Unit trains are
typically made up of 100 or more railcars that are all shipped from the same origin to the same destination without being split. During 2017,
Unimin shipped approximately 300 unit trains representing approximately 33% of its Energy segment volumes. Unimin is well-positioned to
help its customers meet their proppant needs with unit train capable terminals to lower their costs and improve delivery.

 

 

•  Proppant intensity has continued to increase. Despite declining volumes throughout 2015 and 2016, overall proppant intensity per well
continued to increase in 2017 as well laterals have become longer, frac stages have tightened and proppant per lateral foot has increased. The
result is substantially higher volumes of sand per well which in turn increases the overall demand for proppants, though across fewer frac
jobs.

 

 
•  Shift toward finer proppant grades. Slickwater frac designs, which are generally less expensive, have become the dominant method for

fracturing wells beginning in 2016 and continuing in 2017. These designs rely on a higher percentage of fine grade sands compared to
coarse grades. Currently, the market is around 80% fine grade (40/70 and 100 mesh) compared to roughly 55% fine grade back in 2014.

 

 

•  Exploration & Production (“E&P”) direct sales. Recently in an effort to control cost and have better visibility across the entire supply
chain, some E&P companies are buying proppant directly from proppant suppliers. This presents the opportunity to work directly with the
end user and provides improved communication between supplier and consumer with respect to job or grade changes. Concurrently with
these direct sales, many E&P companies are looking to the supplier to coordinate the “last mile” of the supply chain, or the moving of
product from the in-basin terminal to the well site. Many solutions are available, but no one solution works for all parties or across all shale
plays.

Industrial segment market trends
 

 

•  Continued stable demand in industrial end markets. The primary end markets served by Unimin’s production in its Industrial segment are
glass, construction, ceramics, foundry, coatings, polymers and various other industries. Demand in the Industrial segment’s end markets is
relatively stable and is primarily influenced by key macroeconomic drivers such as housing starts, light vehicle sales, repair and remodel
activity, industrial production as well as consumer trends. To the extent these demand drivers continue on their current trends, Unimin
expects that demand for its products will remain relatively stable.

 

 
•  Favorable housing, commercial constructions and consumer trends. Certain submarkets and geographies within Unimin’s Industrial

segment continue to grow at attractive growth rates driven by attractive housing, commercial construction and various consumer trends
which favor end products that utilize Unimin products.

 

 
•  Inflationary pressures and severe weather events in Mexico impacted industrial results. Throughout 2017, Mexico experienced above-

average inflation in energy costs with electricity and diesel costs increasing by more than 30% and 50%, respectively, at Unimin’s operations
during the year. In addition, Mexico faced a number of severe weather-related events during the year that resulted in higher operating costs.

How Unimin Generates Sales

Unimin derives its sales by mining and processing silica sand products and other minerals that its customers purchase for use in a wide variety of
applications. Unimin’s sales are primarily a function of the price per ton paid by the customer and the number of tons sold to the customer. The price
invoiced reflects the cost of production, the cost of transportation to the Company’s distribution terminals or customer site and the cost of transloading
the product from railcars to trucks, as applicable.

Energy Segment

Unimin’s Energy segment represented 45% and 32% of the Company’s revenues for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
Unimin’s Energy segment is a leading global supplier of sand-based proppants, with more than 13 million tons of low cost raw frac sand capacity and
350,000 tons of annual coated resin sand capacity (both active and idle). Unimin’s Energy segment offers the oil and gas industry a comprehensive
portfolio of raw frac sand, resin coated sands, well cementing additives, gravel packing media and drilling mud additives that meet or exceed API
standards.

Unimin’s Energy segment sold approximately 51% and 46% of its North American silica volume in 2017 and 2016, respectively, through its
network of terminals at selling prices that are set by local market dynamics. The remaining volume in the Energy segment is sold to customers directly
from Unimin’s mining and production facilities. The average selling prices for products sold through Unimin’s terminals are higher than the average
selling prices for comparable products sold from Unimin’s production facilities due to costs incurred to handle and transport the products from the
production facilities to the Company’s distribution terminals.

Generally, logistics costs can comprise up to 70% of the delivered cost of products sold by the Energy segment, depending on the basin into which
the product is delivered.

Unimin’s Energy segment primarily sells products under supply agreements with varying terms. A substantial portion of Unimin Energy
segment’s frac sand is sold to customers under long-term contracts, with terms expiring between 2018 and 2022. The contracts include both fixed price
contracts and variable price contracts. Fixed price contracts have prices set for up to one or more years. Variable price contracts are subject to quarterly
or bi-annual price adjustments generally tied to market pricing or other market-related indices. Unimin’s Energy segment contracts have a variety of
volume provisions. While certain of Unimin Energy segment’s contracts have no minimum volume requirements, several of the agreements require the
customer to purchase a specified percentage of its proppant requirements or a minimum volume of proppant from Unimin. Certain of these minimum
volume contracts include a provision that may trigger penalties if the purchased volume does not meet the required minimums.

Table of Contents

A few of Unimin’s contracts in the Energy segment include take-or-pay provisions. These take-or-pay contracts have initial terms expiring
between 2019 and 2022. These take-or-pay agreements define, among other commitments, the volume of product that Unimin’s customers must
purchase, the volume of product that Unimin must provide and the price that Unimin will charge and that its customers will pay for each product. Prices
under these agreements are generally fixed.

During the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, the Energy segment’s top 10 customers collectively represented 39%, 28% and 43%
of Unimin’s revenues. During the same periods, sales in the aggregate to Unimin’s top customer, Halliburton Energy Services, accounted for 12%, 12%
and 22%, respectively, of Unimin’s revenues. A large portion of Unimin’s Energy segment sales are generated by a limited number of customers, and the
loss of, or a significant reduction in purchases by, Unimin’s largest customers could adversely affect its operations. Top customers may not continue to
purchase the same levels of product in the future due to a variety of reasons, notwithstanding any contract requirements.

Industrial Segment

Unimin’s Industrial segment represented 44% and 58% of Unimin’s revenue for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. With
more than 1,400 customers across all of its end markets, the Industrial segment’s products are sold to customers in the glass, construction, ceramics,
foundry, coatings, polymers and various other industries. In its Industrial segment, Unimin uses its production facilities and its network of industrial
distribution terminals to sell products. For certain products, Unimin’s Industrial segment uses distributors that sell the product to the end user. In
addition, Unimin’s Industrial segment acts as a sales agent or distributor in North America for certain products produced by Sibelco. Outside of North
America, Sibelco may act as Unimin’s agent or distributor for certain products produced by Unimin.

Unimin’s Industrial segment primarily sells products under supply agreements with terms that vary by contract. A substantial portion of Unimin’s
Industrial segment volumes are sold to customers with whom Unimin has long-term contracts, which have current terms expiring between 2018 and
2021. These contracts are multi-year supply agreements with fixed price arrangements and minimum volume requirements.

Electronics Segment

Unimin’s Electronics segment represented 11% and 10% of Unimin’s revenue for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
Unimin’s Electronics segment products consist of high purity quartz sands and other minerals used primarily in the fused quartz markets for the
production of semiconductor and solar crucibles, quartz solids, lamp-tubing and fiber optic cables. In its Electronics segment, the majority of Unimin’s
products by value are shipped overseas directly to customers or to distributors that sell the product into the local market. Historically, Unimin has not
entered into long term take-or-pay contracts with its customers in the Electronics segment because of the high cost to its customers of switching
providers. With these customers, Unimin often enters into multi-year supply agreements with fixed price arrangements and minimum volume
requirements.

Corporate & Other Segment

Unimin’s Corporate & Other segment did not generate any revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017, as the Brazilian and Venezuelan
operations were sold or transferred during 2016 and were no longer a part of Unimin. Historically, within this segment, Unimin’s products were sold to
customers in the local Brazilian and Venezuelan markets, in the glass, construction, ceramics, foundry, coatings and polymers industries. The
Corporate & Other segment historically used its production facilities to sell its products.

Key Costs of Unimin’s Business

The principal costs involved in operating Unimin’s business are: logistics costs associated with transporting products from Unimin’s production
facilities to its terminals; labor costs; maintenance and repair costs at Unimin’s production facilities; raw material costs; energy costs; stripping costs;
and corporate operating costs. Unimin owns or leases most of its sand and other mineral reserves. Unimin believes that the combination of owned and
leased reserves helps it maintain a very competitive cost position.

Table of Contents

Logistics Costs

Logistics costs, including freight, railcar leases, demurrage and terminal handling, represented approximately 31%, 30% and 40% of Unimin’s
revenue during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Freight costs primarily represent costs to transport Unimin’s product
by rail, while Unimin also ships product by truck and barge. In order to move product by rail, Unimin generally leases a substantial number of railcars
under operating leases with durations ranging from three to 15 years. Unimin currently has approximately 9,900 railcars (which includes approximately
2,700 customer railcars). Demurrage costs are charged by the railroads based on the time a railcar spends on the railroad property in excess of an allotted
time, these costs can vary significantly from period to period. Handling costs are incurred at Unimin’s distribution and terminal facilities to move
product from one mode of transportation to another (e.g., railcar to truck) and to move product into storage facilities. Railcar storage costs are incurred
when railcars are temporarily stored at a rail yard or storage facility.

Labor Costs

Labor costs associated with employees at Unimin’s processing facilities represent the most significant cost of converting raw frac sand to finished
product. Labor costs, including wages and benefits, represented approximately 13%, 15% and 11% of Unimin’s revenue during the years ended
December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Approximately 40% of Unimin’s workforce was party to collective bargaining contracts as of
December 31, 2017.

Maintenance and Repair Costs

Unimin capitalizes the costs of its mining and processing equipment and depreciates them over their expected useful lives. Depreciation, depletion
and amortization costs represented approximately 8%, 11% and 9% of Unimin’s revenue during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015,
respectively. Repair and maintenance costs that do not involve the replacement of major components of Unimin’s equipment and facilities are expensed
as incurred. These repair and maintenance costs can be significant due to the abrasive nature of Unimin’s products and represented approximately 4%,
6% and 5% of Unimin’s revenue during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Raw Material Additives Costs

Unimin uses a significant amount of raw material additives in the production of products for its Energy, Industrial and Electronics segments.
Unimin purchases these products under supply agreements that contain annual pricing adjustments based on market costs. Raw material additive costs
represented approximately 6%, 6% and 5% of Unimin’s revenue during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Energy Costs

Unimin consumes energy, including natural gas, diesel and electricity, for mine and plant production. Natural gas is the primary fuel source used
for drying sand in the commercial silica production process. Energy costs are typically negotiated on an annual or multi-year basis and certain input
costs are subject to prevailing market prices for the underlying commodity (e.g. natural gas, diesel), which can vary during the year.

Stripping Costs

Stripping costs include the costs of removing a strip of overlying soil and rock before excavation of minerals near the surface can commence.
Unimin’s stripping costs are not a significant part of its overall cost structure.

Corporate Operating Costs

Unimin’s selling, general and administrative costs represented approximately 8%, 10% and 8% of Unimin’s revenue during the years ended
December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. These costs are related to Unimin’s corporate operations, including costs for the sales and marketing,
information technology, finance, legal and environmental, research and development, health and safety functions of Unimin.

Merger with Fairmount Santrol

On December 11, 2017, Sibelco, Unimin, Merger Sub, Merger Sub LLC and Fairmount Santrol entered into the Merger Agreement in connection
with the proposed combination of the businesses of Unimin and Fairmount Santrol. The Merger Agreement provides that, upon the satisfaction or
waiver of the conditions to the Merger, Merger Sub will be merged with and into Fairmount Santrol, with Fairmount Santrol surviving the Merger as a
direct wholly owned subsidiary of Unimin. Immediately following the Merger, Fairmount Santrol (as the surviving company in the Merger) will be
merged with and into Merger Sub LLC after which Fairmount Santrol will cease to exist as a separate corporate entity. Merger Sub LLC will continue as
the surviving entity in the Second Merger as a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Unimin and will succeed to and assume all the rights, privileges,
immunities, properties, powers and franchises of Fairmount Santrol.

Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, Fairmount Santrol stockholders will have the right to receive, with respect
to each share of Fairmount Santrol common stock they hold at the effective time (other than (1) shares owned by Fairmount Santrol or any wholly
owned subsidiary of Fairmount Santrol (or held in the treasury of Fairmount Santrol), (2) shares owned by Sibelco or any of its subsidiaries and
(3) shares held by any Fairmount Santrol stockholder who is entitled to appraisal rights and has properly exercised and perfected (and not effectively
withdrawn or lost) such stockholder’s demand for appraisal rights under the DGCL), the Merger Consideration, consisting of the Stock Consideration,
the Cash Consideration and cash paid in lieu of fractional shares, if any, without interest. For a more detailed description of the Merger Consideration,
see “The Merger Agreement—Effects of the Merger; Merger Consideration.” Upon the closing of the Merger, Sibelco will own, directly or indirectly,
approximately 65% of the issued and outstanding shares of the combined company common stock and holders of Fairmount Santrol common stock
immediately prior to the effective time will hold in the aggregate, including certain equity awards, approximately 35% of the issued and outstanding
shares of combined company common stock.

Upon the closing of the Merger, the combined company will own more than 50 processing and coating facilities throughout North America with
approximately 1.4 billion tons of proven and probable mineral reserves and will operate 94 terminals across the United States and Canada. For the year
ended December 31, 2017, the combined company would have had pro forma revenue of approximately $2.3 billion. The proposed Merger is also
expected to result in synergies of approximately $150 million.

Upon the closing of the Merger, the combined company will need to incur additional expenses, including, but not limited to, transaction-related
expenses, expenses to integrate the operations of Unimin and Fairmount Santrol and additional legal, accounting and other expenses in connection with
being a public company. The combined company will be subject to reporting, disclosure control and other obligations under the Exchange Act, the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Act and the rules and regulations of the SEC and the NYSE. See the section entitled “Risk Factors—Risks Related
to the Proposed Merger—Unimin and Fairmount Santrol will incur substantial transaction fees and costs in connection with the proposed Merger and the
integration of their businesses” beginning on page 73 of this proxy statement/prospectus.

The HPQ Carveout

As contemplated by the Merger Agreement, Sibelco will retain the global high purity quartz business, which consists of Unimin’s Electronics
segment. Prior to, and as a condition to, the closing of the Merger, Unimin will contribute certain of its assets to HPQ Co, in exchange for all of the
stock of HPQ Co and the assumption by HPQ Co of certain liabilities related to the business being transferred, in accordance with the Contribution
Agreement. Unimin will then distribute 100% of the stock of HPQ Co to Sibelco in exchange for certain shares of Unimin common stock held by
Sibelco, in accordance with the Contribution Agreement. The HPQ Carveout will also include certain personnel and assets historically part of Unimin
that support coatings and polymers sales and research activities together with certain related intellectual property.

Prior to the effective time of the HPQ Carveout, Unimin, Sibelco and HPQ Co will enter into the Tax Matters Agreement governing their
respective rights, responsibilities and obligations relating to tax liabilities, the filing of tax returns, the control of tax contests and other tax matters.
Under the Tax Matters Agreement, the

combined company and HPQ Co (and their affiliates) will be responsible for income taxes required to be reported on their respective separate and group
tax returns; however, HPQ Co will be responsible for any unpaid income taxes (as of the date of the HPQ Redemption) attributable to the HPQ business
prior to the date of the HPQ Carveout. HPQ Co will be responsible for any unpaid non-income taxes (as of the date of the HPQ Redemption) attributable
to the HPQ business (whether arising prior to the HPQ Carveout or not) and the combined company will be responsible for all other non-income taxes.
HPQ Co and the combined company will equally bear any transfer taxes imposed on the HPQ Carveout. Rights to refunds in respect of taxes will be
allocated in the same manner as the responsibility for tax liabilities.

The Cash Redemption

In connection with the closing of the Merger, Unimin expects to redeem shares of Unimin common stock currently held by Sibelco in exchange
for an amount in cash equal to approximately (1) $660 million plus interest accruing at 5.0% per annum for the period from June 30, 2017 through the
closing of the Merger less (2) $170 million, which will be paid to Fairmount Santrol stockholders as consideration in the Merger.

Key Metrics Used to Evaluate Unimin’s Business

Unimin’s management uses a variety of financial and operational metrics to analyze Unimin’s performance across its Energy, Industrial,
Electronics and Corporate & Other segments. The determination of segments is based on the primary industries Unimin serves, its management structure
and the financial information that is reviewed by Unimin’s chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance.
Unimin evaluates the performance of these segments based on their volumes sold, average selling price, segment gross profit and associated per ton
metrics. Additionally, Unimin considers a number of factors in evaluating the performance of the business as a whole, including total volumes sold,
average selling price, segment gross profit, associated per ton metrics and Adjusted EBITDA. Unimin views these metrics as important factors in
evaluating its profitability and reviews these measurements frequently to analyze trends and make decisions.

Segment Gross Profit

Unimin’s management uses segment gross profit to evaluate the operating performance of Unimin’s segments. Segment gross profit is defined as
segment revenue less segment cost of sales, not including depreciation, depletion and amortization expenses and does not include any selling, general
and administrative costs or corporate costs.

EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA

EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are supplemental non-GAAP financial measures that are used by management and certain external users of
Unimin’s financial statements in evaluating its operating performance. Unimin defines EBITDA as net income before interest expense, income tax
expense (benefit) and depreciation, depletion and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA before non-cash impairment of assets and
certain non-operational income and expenses including restructuring charges.

Unimin’s management believes EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are useful because they allow Unimin management to more effectively evaluate
its normalized operations from period to period as well as provide an indication of cash flow generation from operations before investing or financing
activities. Accordingly, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not take into consideration Unimin’s financing methods, capital structure or capital
expenditure needs. Adjusted EBITDA excludes certain non-operational income and/or costs, the removal of which improves comparability of operating
results across reporting periods. However, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered as
alternatives to, or more meaningful than, net income as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP as indicators of Unimin’s operating performance.
Certain items excluded from EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are significant components in understanding and assessing a company’s financial
performance, such as a company’s cost of capital and tax structure, as well as the historic costs of depreciable assets, none of which are components of
EBITDA or Adjusted EBITDA.

Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow for management’s discretionary use, as it does not consider
certain cash requirements such as interest payments, tax payments and

Table of Contents

debt service requirements. Adjusted EBITDA contains certain other limitations, including the failure to reflect Unimin’s cash expenditures, cash
requirements for working capital needs and cash costs to replace assets being depreciated and amortized, and excludes certain non-operational charges.
Management compensates for these limitations by relying primarily on Unimin’s U.S. GAAP results (and IFRS results) and by using Adjusted EBITDA
only as a supplement.

Although Unimin attempts to determine EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in a manner that is consistent with other companies in its industry,
Unimin’s computation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential
inconsistencies in the methods of calculation. Unimin believes that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are widely followed measures of operating
performance.

The following table sets forth a reconciliation of net income (loss), the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure, to EBITDA and
Adjusted EBITDA:
