BLUE NILE, INC.

411 First Avenue South, Suite 700
Seattle, Washington 98104

December 28, 2016

To the stockholders of Blue Nile, Inc.:

On November 6, 2016, your Board of Directors approved an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) by and
among Blue Nile, Inc. (“Blue Nile,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”), BC Cyan Parent Inc. (“Parent”) and BC Cyan Acquisition
Inc. (“Merger Sub”), which are legal entities formed by funds managed by Bain Capital Private Equity to facilitate its acquisition of
Blue Nile. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will be merged into Blue Nile, each outstanding share of our
common stock will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive $40.75 in cash (without interest) and Blue Nile will become a
privately held subsidiary of Parent. We refer to this transaction as the “Merger.” We cannot complete the Merger until our stockholders
have adopted the Merger Agreement. Accordingly, you are cordially invited to attend a company stockholder meeting (the “Company
Stockholder Meeting”) of Blue Nile to be held on February 2, 2017, at 8:00 a.m., Pacific Time, at 411 First Avenue South, Suite 210,
Seattle, WA 98104 in order to vote on a proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement.

At the Company Stockholder Meeting, you will be asked to consider and vote on a proposal to postpone or adjourn the Company
Stockholder Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger
Agreement at the time of the Company Stockholder Meeting, and a proposal to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, certain
compensation that will or may become payable by Blue Nile to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger.

If our stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement in accordance with applicable law, the other closing conditions in the Merger
Agreement are satisfied and the Merger is completed, our stockholders will be entitled to receive $40.75 in cash, without interest and
less applicable withholding tax, for each share of Blue Nile common stock (the “Company Common Stock”) held at the effective time
of the Merger. This price represents a premium of approximately 33.9% from the closing price of $30.44 on November 4, 2016, the last
trading day prior to the execution of the Merger Agreement.

After considering the factors more fully described in the enclosed proxy statement, your Board of Directors unanimously
(1) determined that it is in the best interests of Blue Nile and Blue Nile’s stockholders, and declared it advisable, to enter into
the Merger Agreement and consummate the Merger upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein; (2)
approved the execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement by Blue Nile, the performance by Blue Nile of its covenants and
other obligations thereunder, and the consummation of the Merger upon the terms and conditions set forth therein; and (3)
recommended that Blue Nile’s stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement in accordance with the Delaware General
Corporation Law (“DGCL”).

Accordingly, your Board of Directors recommends that you vote (1) “FOR” the adoption of the Merger Agreement; (2)
“FOR” the proposal to adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if
there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Company Stockholder Meeting; and (3) “FOR”
the proposal to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, certain compensation that will or may become payable by Blue Nile to
its named executive officers in connection with the Merger.

Table of Contents

The enclosed proxy statement provides detailed information about the Merger Agreement and the Merger, as well as the
Company Stockholder Meeting. In addition, a copy of the Merger Agreement is attached as Annex A to the proxy statement. The
enclosed proxy statement also describes the process by which the Board of Directors considered, negotiated and ultimately approved
the Merger Agreement and the Merger, as well as the reasons the Board of Directors approved the Merger Agreement and recommends
that Blue Nile’s stockholders adopt it. We encourage you to read the proxy statement and its annexes, including the Merger
Agreement, carefully and in their entirety, as they contain important information. You may also obtain more information about
Blue Nile from documents Blue Nile has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).

Whether or not you plan to attend the Company Stockholder Meeting in person, please sign, date and return, as promptly as
possible, the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying prepaid reply envelope or grant your proxy electronically over the internet or by
telephone. If you attend the Company Stockholder Meeting and vote in person by ballot, your vote will revoke any proxy that you have
previously submitted. The failure of any stockholder to vote will have the same effect as a vote against adopting the Merger
Agreement.

If you hold your shares in “street name,” you should instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your shares in
accordance with the voting instruction form that you will receive from your bank, broker or other nominee. Your bank, broker or other
nominee cannot vote on any of the proposals, including the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, without your instructions.

We cannot complete the Merger unless the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement is approved by the affirmative vote of
the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock entitled to vote. For this purpose, non-votes
will be counted as votes against the Merger Agreement and the Merger. Your affirmative vote is very important regardless of
the number of shares of Company Common Stock that you own.

If you have any questions or need assistance voting your shares, please contact our Proxy Solicitor:

Sincerely,

 

Harvey Kanter
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President

The accompanying proxy statement is dated December 28, 2016 and, together with the enclosed form of proxy card, is first being
mailed to stockholders of Blue Nile on or about December 28, 2016.

Neither the SEC nor any state securities commission has approved or disapproved the Merger, passed upon the merits or
fairness of the Merger Agreement or the proposed Merger, or passed upon the adequacy or accuracy of the information
contained in this proxy statement. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense.

ENCOURAGE YOU TO SUBMIT YOUR PROXY AS PROMPTLY AS POSSIBLE (1) BY TELEPHONE; (2) THROUGH THE
INTERNET; OR (3) BY SIGNING AND DATING THE ENCLOSED PROXY CARD AND RETURNING IT IN THE POSTAGE-

into the accompanying proxy statement, carefully and in their entirety. If you have any questions concerning the Merger, the Company

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

The following constitutes a “Safe Harbor” statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995: This proxy
statement, the documents incorporated by reference in this proxy statement and information included in oral statements or other written
statements made or to be made by us or on our behalf contain “forward-looking statements” that do not directly or exclusively relate to
historical facts. You can typically identify forward-looking statements by terms such as “would,” “could,” “may,” “will,” “should,”
“expect,” “intend,” “plan,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “might,” “predict,” “potential,” “targets,” “seek,” or “continue,” the
negative of these terms or other variations of such terms. In addition, any statements that refer to the expected completion and timing
of the Merger and other expectations relating to the Merger are forward-looking statements. These statements are only predictions
based upon assumptions made that are believed to be reasonable at the time and are subject to risk and uncertainties. Therefore, actual
events or results may differ materially and adversely from those expressed in any forward-looking statement. These risks and
uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the risks detailed in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”),
including in our most recent filings on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, factors and matters described or incorporated by reference in this proxy
statement, and the following factors:
 

 

•  the inability to complete the Merger due to the failure to obtain the requisite vote to adopt the Merger Agreement (as defined
in the section captioned “Summary”) by stockholders of Blue Nile or failure to satisfy the other conditions to the completion
of the Merger, including the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act and the Austrian
Cartel Act;

 

 
•  the risk that the Merger Agreement may be terminated in circumstances that require Blue Nile to pay Parent (as defined in

the section captioned “Summary”) a termination fee of up to $17.4 million, as further described in the Merger Agreement;
 

 •  the outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted against us and others related to the Merger Agreement;
 

 
•  the fact that receipt of the all-cash Per Share Price (as defined in the section of this proxy statement captioned “Summary—

The Merger and the Per Share Price”) would be taxable to stockholders that are treated as U.S. holders for U.S. federal
income tax purposes;

 

 
•  the fact that, if the Merger is completed, stockholders will forgo the opportunity to realize the potential long-term value of

the successful execution of Blue Nile’s current strategy as an independent company;
 

 
•  the possibility that Parent could, at a later date, engage in unspecified transactions, including restructuring efforts, special

dividends or the sale of some or all of Blue Nile’s assets to one or more as yet unknown purchasers, which would
conceivably produce a higher aggregate value than that available to stockholders in the Merger;

 

 
•  the fact that under the terms of the Merger Agreement, Blue Nile is unable to solicit other acquisition proposals after the

Cut-Off Date (as defined in the section captioned “Summary-Acquisition Proposals; Change in the Recommendation of Blue
Nile’s Board of Directors”) during the then-remaining pendency of the Merger;

 

 

•  the effect of the announcement or pendency of the Merger on our business relationships, operating results and business
generally, including the risk of delays or deferments of certain business decisions by our customers, suppliers and other
business partners, the risk that the pendency of the Merger diverts management’s or employees’ attention from ongoing
business operations, and the risk that the pendency of the Merger adversely effects our ability to retain or recruit key
employees;

 

 

•  the inability to pursue alternative business opportunities or make appropriate changes to our business because of
requirements of the Merger Agreement and the related equity and debt financing commitments that we conduct our business
in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice and not engage in certain kinds of transactions prior to the
completion of the Merger;

 •  the amount of the costs, fees, expenses and charges related to the Merger Agreement or the Merger; and
 

 •  risks that our stock price may decline significantly if the Merger is not completed.

Consequently, all of the forward-looking statements that we make in this proxy statement are qualified by the information
contained or incorporated by reference herein, including (1) the information contained under this caption; and (2) the information
contained under the caption “Risk Factors” and information in our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our
most recent filings on Forms 10-K and 10-Q. No assurance can be given that these are all of the factors that could cause actual results
to vary materially from the forward-looking statements.

Except as required by applicable law, we undertake no obligation to publicly update forward-looking statements, whether as a
result of new information, future events or otherwise. Stockholders are advised to consult any future disclosures that we make on
related subjects as may be detailed in our other filings made from time to time with the SEC.

Merger Agreement, which will be available to fund the aggregate purchase price and certain other payments contemplated by, and
subject to the terms and conditions of, the Merger Agreement. In addition, Bain Capital Fund XI, L.P. (“Bain Capital Fund XI”) has
also provided Blue Nile with a limited guaranty in favor of Blue Nile, which guarantees the payment of the Parent Termination Fee
that may become payable by Parent under the Merger Agreement.

The Merger and the Per Share Price (Pages 31 and 32)

Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into Blue Nile, with
Blue Nile continuing as the surviving corporation and as a wholly-owned direct subsidiary of Parent (the “Surviving
Corporation”). As a result of the Merger, at the Effective Time, Blue Nile will cease to be a publicly traded company and all
outstanding shares of Blue Nile common stock (“Company Common Stock”) will be cancelled and converted into the right to
receive $40.75 in cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding tax (the “Per Share Price”), and you will no longer
own any shares of the capital stock or any other rights or interest in the Surviving Corporation. After the Merger is completed, you
will have the right to receive the Per Share Price, but you will no longer have any rights as a stockholder.

Each holder of shares of Company Common Stock will be entitled to receive, upon (i) surrender to the payment agent of a
certificate or certificates, together with a properly completed letter of transmittal, or (ii) receipt of an “agent’s message” by the
payment agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the payment agent would reasonably request) in the case of a book-
entry transfer of uncertificated shares, the Per Share Price payable for each share of Company Common Stock represented by a
certificate or for each uncertificated share, without interest.

At the Effective Time, each outstanding Company Option, whether unvested or vested, that has an exercise price per share
less than $40.75 will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal, to $40.75 (less the exercise price
per share attributable to such Company Option), multiplied by the total number of shares of Company Common Stock that are
issuable upon full exercise of such Company Option, less any applicable tax withholdings. At the Effective Time, each outstanding
Company Option, whether unvested or vested, that has an exercise price per share equal to or greater than $40.75 will be cancelled
without payment of any consideration.

At the Effective Time, each outstanding RSU that is only subject to time-vesting requirements, whether vested or unvested,
will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to $40.75, multiplied by the total number of shares
subject to such RSUs, less any applicable tax withholdings. At the Effective Time, each outstanding RSU that is subject to time-
and performance-based requirements, will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to $40.75,
multiplied by the total number of shares determined to be performance vested, with the performance goals deemed achieved at the
maximum levels and with the remaining time-vesting requirements deemed satisfied, less any applicable tax withholdings.
Amounts payable to the holders of Company Option and RSUs will be payable no later than the second payroll cycle of the
Surviving Corporation following the Effective Time.

Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger (Page 73)

For U.S. federal income tax purposes, the receipt of cash by a U.S. Holder (as defined in the section of this proxy statement
captioned “The Merger—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger”) in exchange for such U.S. Holder’s
shares of Company Common Stock in the Merger generally will result in the recognition of gain or loss in an amount measured by
the difference, if any, between the amount of cash that such U.S. Holder receives in the Merger and such U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax
basis in the shares of Company Common Stock surrendered in the Merger.

A Non-U.S. Holder (as defined in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger—Material U.S. Federal Income
Tax Consequences of the Merger”) generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax with respect to the exchange of
Company Common Stock for cash in the Merger, unless such Non-U.S. Holder has certain connections to the United States.

Stockholders should consult their own tax advisors concerning the U.S. federal income tax consequences relating to
the Merger in light of their particular circumstances and any consequences arising under U.S. federal non-income tax laws
or the laws of any state, local or non-U.S. tax jurisdiction.

Appraisal Rights (Page 68)

If the Merger is consummated, Blue Nile stockholders who do not vote their shares of Company Common Stock in favor of
the adoption of the Merger Agreement, who continuously hold such shares of Company Common Stock through the Effective
Time, who properly perfect appraisal of their shares of Company Common Stock and who meet certain other conditions (including
relating to the amount of stock ownership) will be entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the Merger under Section 262 of
the DGCL. This means that such stockholders would be entitled to have their shares of Company Common Stock appraised by the
Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive payment in cash of the “fair value” of their shares of Company Common Stock,
exclusive of any elements of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest to be paid
on the amount determined to be fair value, if any, as determined by the court (subject, in the case of interest payments, to any
voluntary cash payments made by the Surviving Corporation pursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262 of the DGCL). Due to the
complexity of the appraisal process, stockholders who wish to seek appraisal of their shares of Company Common Stock are
encouraged to seek the advice of legal counsel with respect to the exercise of appraisal rights. Stockholders considering seeking
appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares of Company Common Stock as determined pursuant to Section 262 of
the DGCL could be more than, the same as or less than the value of the consideration that they would receive pursuant to the
Merger Agreement if they did not seek appraisal of their shares of Company Common Stock. For more information, please see the
section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger—Appraisal Rights,” beginning on page 68.

Conditions to the Merger (Page 98)

Each party’s obligation to consummate the Merger is subject to the satisfaction or (where permitted by applicable law) written
waiver of the following conditions:
 

 
•  at and as of the Closing, the adoption of the Merger Agreement by the requisite affirmative vote of the holders of a

majority of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock entitled to vote;
 

 
•  at and as of the Closing, the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act and the

Austrian Cartel Act;
 

 
•  at and as of the Closing, the consummation of the Merger not being restrained, enjoined, rendered illegal or otherwise

prohibited by any applicable law or order of any governmental authority;
 

 
•  at or prior to the Effective Time, the absence of any continuing change, event, violation, inaccuracy, effect or

circumstance at Blue Nile that, individually or in the aggregate, generally: (1) is or would

reasonably be expected to be materially adverse to Blue Nile’s business, financial condition or results of operations,
taken as a whole; or (2) would reasonably be expected to prevent or materially impair or delay the consummation of the
Merger;

 

 
•  at or prior to the Effective Time, the accuracy of the representations and warranties of Blue Nile, Parent and Merger Sub

in the Merger Agreement, subject to materiality qualifiers, made at and as of the Closing Date or the date in respect of
which such representation or warranty was specifically made;

 

 
•  at or prior to the Effective Time, the performance in all material respects by Blue Nile, Parent and Merger Sub of their

respective covenants and obligations required to be performed by them under the Merger Agreement at or prior to the
Closing;

 

 
•  at or prior to the Effective Time, receipt of certificates executed by authorized officers of Blue Nile, on the one hand, and

Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, to the effect that the conditions described in the preceding two bullets have
been satisfied; and

 

 
•  the absence of any Company Material Adverse Effect (as defined in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The

Merger Agreement—Representations and Warranties”) having occurred after the date of Merger Agreement that is
continuing.

Financing (Page 66)

The completion of the Merger is not subject to any financing conditions. Although the obligation of Parent and Merger Sub to
consummate the Merger is not subject to any financing condition, the Merger Agreement provides that the Closing of the Merger
will not occur earlier than the third Business Day after the expiration of the “marketing period” during which Parent’s debt
financing sources will be afforded an opportunity to syndicate portions of their debt financing commitment to other third parties
(the “Marketing Period”). Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, the Marketing Period is the first period of twenty (20)
consecutive Business Days commencing on the date that is the first Business Day after the later of (a) the date this proxy statement
is mailed to stockholders and (b) January 2, 2017 throughout which (y) Parent has received certain financial information from Blue
Nile necessary to syndicate any debt financing and (z) certain conditions to the consummation of the Merger are satisfied (other
than the requisite stockholder approval, conditions to Blue Nile’s obligations to effect the Merger and other than those conditions
by their nature can only be satisfied at Closing). For more information, please see the section of this proxy statement captioned
“The Merger—Financing of the Merger.”

Recommendations of the Board of Directors (Page 45)

After considering various factors more fully described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger—
Recommendation of the Board of Directors and Reasons for the Merger,” the Board of Directors of Blue Nile (the “Board of
Directors”) has unanimously (1) determined that it is in the best interests of Blue Nile and Blue Nile’s stockholders, and declared it
advisable, to enter into the Merger Agreement and consummate the Merger upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
therein; (2) approved the execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement by Blue Nile, the performance by Blue Nile of its
covenants and other obligations thereunder, and the consummation of the Merger upon the terms and conditions set forth therein;
and (3) recommended that Blue Nile’s stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement in accordance with the DGCL.

Accordingly, the Board of Directors recommends that you vote (1) “FOR” the adoption of the Merger Agreement; (2) “FOR”
the proposal to postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if
there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Company Stockholder Meeting; and (3) “FOR” the
proposal to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, certain compensation that will or may become payable by Blue Nile to its
named executive officers in connection with the Merger.

Table of Contents

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an Intervening Event (as defined in the Merger Agreement) occurs at any time prior to the
adoption of the Merger Agreement by Blue Nile’s stockholders, the Board of Directors may withdraw or change its
recommendation regarding the Merger Agreement and the Merger, provided that the Board of Directors determines in good faith,
after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties
of the Board of Directors under the applicable law, as further described and subject to compliance with the obligations described in
the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger Agreement—Other Covenants Under the Merger Agreement—
Acquisition Proposals; Change in the Recommendation of Blue Nile’s Board of Directors.”

In addition, at any time prior to the adoption of the Merger Agreement by Blue Nile’s stockholders, if Blue Nile receives a
bona fide written competing acquisition proposal for Blue Nile that was not solicited in material breach of the non-solicitation
provisions of the Merger Agreement and that the Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial
advisor and outside legal counsel, that the acquisition proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal (within the meaning of the Merger
Agreement), then the Board of Directors may (i) withdraw or change its recommendation regarding the Merger Agreement and the
Merger, or (ii) terminate the Merger Agreement to concurrently enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such Superior
Proposal, provided that in either case the Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel, that the failure to take the actions described in clauses (i) or (ii) above would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of
the Board of Directors under the applicable law.

Opinion of Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated (Page 48)

In connection with the Merger, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated (“BofA Merrill Lynch”), Blue Nile’s
financial advisor, delivered to the Board of Directors a written opinion, dated November 6, 2016, as to the fairness, from a financial
point of view and as of the date of the opinion, of the Per Share Price to be received in the Merger by holders of Company
Common Stock (other than Owned Company Shares and Dissenting Company Shares (each as defined in the Merger
Agreement)). The full text of the written opinion, dated November 6, 2016, of BofA Merrill Lynch, which describes, among other
things, the assumptions made, procedures followed, factors considered and limitations on the review undertaken, is attached as
Annex B to this document and is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.

BofA Merrill Lynch provided its opinion to the Board of Directors (in its capacity as such) for the benefit and use of
the Board of Directors in connection with and for purposes of its evaluation of the Per Share Price from a financial point of
view. BofA Merrill Lynch’s opinion does not address any other aspect of the Merger and no opinion or view was expressed
as to the relative merits of the Merger in comparison to other strategies or transactions that might be available to Blue Nile
or in which Blue Nile might engage or as to the underlying business decision of Blue Nile to proceed with or effect the
Merger. BofA Merrill Lynch’s opinion does not address any other aspect of the Merger and does not constitute a
recommendation to any stockholder as to how to vote or act in connection with the proposed Merger or any related matter.

For a more complete description, please see the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger—Opinion of
Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated.”

Interests of Blue Nile’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger (Page 60)

When considering the recommendation of the Board of Directors that you vote to adopt the Merger Agreement, you should be
aware that our directors and executive officers have interests in the Merger that are different from, or in addition to, your interests
as a stockholder. In (i) evaluating and negotiating the Merger Agreement; (ii) adopting the Merger Agreement; and
(iii) recommending that the Merger Agreement be adopted

Table of Contents

by Blue Nile’s stockholders, the Board of Directors was aware of and considered these interests to the extent that they existed at the
time, among other matters. These interests include the following:
 

 
•  accelerated vesting and cash out of Company Options and RSUs at the Effective Time, with the performance conditions

applicable to outstanding performance RSUs (including those held by executive officers) deemed to have been achieved
at the maximum levels and with the remaining time-vesting requirements deemed satisfied;

 

 

•  the entitlement of each executive officer to receive payments and benefits under the 2015 Change of Control Severance
Plan and his or her individual participation notice thereunder previously entered into with Blue Nile (each, a “Change of
Control Agreement”), upon either (1) an involuntary termination of service other than for “Cause,” death, or disability or
(2) voluntary resignation for “Good Reason,” in each case, as set forth in the applicable Change of Control Agreement,
and, in each case, occurring within the 12-month period (or 24-month period for Mr. Kanter and Mr. Binder) following
the Effective Time. These payments and benefits may include:

 

 
•  a lump sum severance payment equal to a percentage of the executive officers’ annual base salary and annual

target bonus; and
 

 •  payment of the premium costs for continuing health benefits for a period of time following termination; and
 

 •  continued indemnification and directors’ and officers’ liability insurance.

If the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement is approved, the shares of Company Common Stock held by our directors and
executive officers will be treated in the same manner as outstanding shares of Company Common Stock held by all other
stockholders.

Termination Fees (Page 100)

Except in specified circumstances, whether or not the Merger is completed, Blue Nile, on the one hand, and Parent and
Merger Sub, on the other hand, are each responsible for all of their own respective costs and expenses incurred in connection with
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, Blue Nile has agreed to pay Parent a termination fee of $7.4 million if Blue Nile
terminates the Merger Agreement in connection with entering into an alternative acquisition agreement with an Excluded Party on
or prior to the Cut-Off Date. If the termination fee becomes payable under any other circumstance, the amount of the termination
fee will be $17.4 million. Additionally, if the Merger Agreement is terminated by either Parent or Blue Nile due to: (i) failure to
consummate the Closing by the Outside Date if Blue Nile has not held the Company Stockholder Meeting by that date, or (ii)
failure of the Blue Nile stockholders to adopt the Merger Agreement at the Company Stockholder Meeting, Blue Nile must also
reimburse Parent for its out-of-pocket expenses up to an aggregate of $5.0 million. For more information, please see the section of
this proxy statement captioned “The Merger Agreement—Termination of the Merger Agreement; Termination Fees.”

Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, Parent has agreed to pay Blue Nile a fee of $32.2 million in the event that (1) the
Merger is not consummated within five Business Days of the first date upon which Parent is required to consummate the Closing
pursuant to the Merger Agreement; (2) Blue Nile is in compliance with all conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement; (3) Blue
Nile has irrevocably notified Parent in writing that it is ready, willing and able to consummate the Closing and has satisfied or is
capable of satisfying all conditions laid out in the Merger Agreement that are to be consummated by the Closing; (4) Blue Nile has
provided Parent five Business Days written notice stating its intention to terminate the Merger Agreement if Parent and Merger
Sub fail to consummate the Merger on the date required by the Merger Agreement; and (5) Parent and Merger Sub fail to
consummate the Merger Sub on the later of (x) the expiration of the five Business Day period contemplated by the foregoing
clause, and (y) the date of Closing contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

Pursuant to the limited guaranty delivered by Bain Capital Fund XI in favor of Blue Nile, dated as of November 6, 2016 (the
“Limited Guaranty”), Bain Capital Fund XI has guaranteed the payment of the Parent Termination Fee if it becomes payable under
the Merger Agreement, subject to an aggregate cap equal to $32.2 million.

Remedies

Blue Nile, Parent and Merger Sub agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be
an adequate remedy would occur in the event that the parties do not perform the provisions of the Merger Agreement (including
any party failing to take such actions as are required of it thereunder in order to consummate the Merger Agreement) in accordance
with its specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and Blue Nile, on the other
hand, will be entitled, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity, to an injunction, specific

performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches (or threatened breaches) of the Merger Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is explicitly agreed that Blue Nile will have the
right to an injunction, specific performance or other equitable remedies in connection with enforcing Parent’s and Merger Sub’s
obligations to consummate the Merger and cause the Equity Financing to be funded to fund the Merger (including to cause Parent
to enforce the obligations of the Guarantor under the Equity Commitment Letter in order to cause the Equity Financing to be timely
completed in accordance with and subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Equity Commitment Letter) if and only if (1)
the Marketing Period has ended and all conditions to each party’s obligations to effect the Merger and conditions to the obligations
of Parent and Merger Sub have been satisfied (other than those conditions that, by their nature, are to be satisfied at the Closing
(provided such conditions would be satisfied as of such date)) at the time when the Closing would have occurred pursuant the
Merger Agreement but for the failure of the Equity Financing to be funded, (2) the Debt Financing has been funded or will be
funded at the Closing on the terms set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter or the Definitive Agreement if the Equity Financing is
funded to fund the Merger at the Closing, and (3) Blue Nile has irrevocably confirmed in writing to Parent that if specific
performance is granted and the Equity Financing is funded, then the Closing pursuant the Merger Agreement will occur. However,
Blue Nile may not be entitled to receive both a grant of specific performance that results in the occurrence of the Closing and
monetary damages (including any monetary damages in lieu of specific performance and all or any portion of a termination fee
paid by Parent).

Common Stock at the close of business on December 21, 2016 (the “record date”). You will have one vote at the Company
Stockholder Meeting for each share of Company Common Stock that you owned and are entitled to vote at the close of business on
the record date. If you own shares that are registered in the name of someone else, such as a broker, you need to direct that person
to vote those shares or obtain an authorization from them and vote the shares yourself at the meeting.

Purpose

At the Company Stockholder Meeting, we will ask stockholders to vote on proposals to (1) adopt the Merger Agreement;
(2) adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting to a later date or dates to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to
adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Company Stockholder Meeting; and (3) to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote,
certain compensation that will or may become payable by Blue Nile to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger.

Quorum

As of the record date, there were 11,730,389 shares of Company Common Stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the
Company Stockholder Meeting. The stockholders of Blue Nile representing a majority of the voting power of the issued and
outstanding Company Common Stock of Blue Nile entitled to vote, present in person or represented by proxy, will constitute a
quorum for purposes of transacting business at the Company Stockholder Meeting.

Required Vote

The affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock of Blue Nile entitled to vote is
required to adopt the Merger Agreement. Abstentions and, because the required votes of Blue Nile stockholders are based upon the
number of outstanding shares of Company Common Stock with respect to the stockholder approval and not based on the number of
shares represented in person or by proxy at the Company Stockholder Meeting, a failure to vote your shares of Company Common
Stock or a broker non-vote, will all have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Merger Agreement proposal.

Approval of the proposal to adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting, if a quorum is present at the Company Stockholder
Meeting, requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of Company Common Stock present or represented
by proxy at the Company Stockholder Meeting and entitled to vote thereon. Abstentions will have the same effect as a vote
“AGAINST” the adjournment proposal, and a failure to vote your shares of Company Common Stock or a broker non-vote will
each have no effect on the outcome of the proposal.

Approval, by non-binding, advisory vote, of certain compensation that will or may become payable to Blue Nile’s executive
officers in connection with the Merger requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of Company Common
Stock having present or represented by proxy at the Company Stockholder Meeting and entitled to vote thereon. Abstentions will
have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the compensation proposal, and a failure to vote your shares of Company Common
Stock or a broker non-vote will each have no effect on the outcome of the proposal.

Share Ownership of Our Directors and Executive Officers

As of the record date, our directors and executive officers beneficially owned and were entitled to vote, in the aggregate,
702,073 shares of Company Common Stock, representing approximately 5.7% of the shares of Company Common Stock
outstanding on the record date. All of our directors and executive officers have informed us that they intend to vote all of their
shares of Company Common Stock (1) “FOR” the adoption of the Merger Agreement; (2) “FOR” the proposal to adjourn the
Company Stockholder Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the
Merger Agreement at the time of the Company Stockholder Meeting; and (3) “FOR” the proposal to approve, by non-binding,
advisory vote, certain compensation that will or may become payable by Blue Nile to its named executive officers in connection
with the Merger.

Voting and Proxies

Any stockholder of record entitled to vote at the Company Stockholder Meeting may submit a proxy by returning a signed
proxy card by mail in the accompanying prepaid reply envelope or granting a proxy electronically over the internet or by
telephone, or may vote in person by appearing at the Company Stockholder Meeting. If you are a beneficial owner and hold your
shares of Company Common Stock in “street name” through a bank, broker or other nominee, you should instruct your bank,
broker or other nominee on how you wish to vote your shares of Company Common Stock using the instructions provided by your
bank, broker or other nominee. Under applicable stock exchange rules, banks, brokers or other nominees have the discretion to vote
on routine matters. The proposals to be considered at the Company Stockholder Meeting are non-routine matters, and banks,
brokers and other nominees cannot vote on these proposals without your instructions. Therefore, it is important that you cast
your vote or instruct your bank, broker or nominee on how you wish to vote your shares.

If you are a stockholder of record on the record date, you may change your vote or revoke your proxy at any time before it is
voted at the Company Stockholder Meeting by (1) signing another proxy card with a later date

and returning it to us prior to the Company Stockholder Meeting; (2) submitting a new proxy electronically over the internet or by
telephone after the date of the earlier submitted proxy; (3) delivering a written notice of revocation to our corporate secretary; or
(4) attending the Company Stockholder Meeting and voting in person by ballot.

If you hold your shares of Company Common Stock in “street name,” you should contact your bank, broker or other nominee
for instructions regarding how to change your vote. You may also vote in person at the Company Stockholder Meeting if you
obtain a “legal proxy” from your bank, broker or other nominee.

All shares represented by properly executed proxies received in time for the Company Stockholder Meeting will be voted at
the Company Stockholder Meeting in accordance with the instructions of the stockholder. Properly executed proxies that do not
contain voting instructions will be voted (1) “FOR” the proposal regarding adoption of the Merger Agreement; (2) “FOR” the
proposal to adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are
insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Company Stockholder Meeting; and (3) “FOR” the proposal to
approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, certain compensation that will or may become payable by Blue Nile to its named
executive officers in connection with the Merger.

Shares of Company Common Stock represented at the Company Stockholder Meeting but not voted, including shares of
Company Common Stock for which proxies have been received but for which stockholders have abstained, will be treated as
present at the Company Stockholder Meeting for purposes of determining the presence or absence of a quorum for the transaction
of all business.

Only shares affirmatively voted for the proposal regarding adoption of the Merger Agreement, including properly executed
proxies that do not contain specific voting instructions, will be counted “FOR” that proposal. If you abstain from voting, it will
have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal regarding adoption of the Merger Agreement, the proposal to adjourn the
Company Stockholder Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the
Merger Agreement, and the proposal to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, certain compensation that will or may become
payable by Blue Nile to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger. If you do not execute a proxy card and do not
attend the Company Stockholder Meeting in person, it will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal regarding
adoption of the Merger Agreement, but will not have any effect on the other proposals.

Effect on Blue Nile if the Merger is Not Completed (Page 31)

If the Merger Agreement is not adopted by stockholders or if the Merger is not completed for any other reason, Blue Nile’s
stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of Company Common Stock. Instead, Blue Nile will remain an
independent public company, Company Common Stock will continue to be listed and traded on NASDAQ and registered under the
Exchange Act and we will continue to file periodic reports with the SEC. Under specified circumstances, Blue Nile will be
required to pay to Parent a termination fee upon the termination of the Merger Agreement.

If you hold your shares in “street name,” you should instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your shares in
accordance with the voting instruction form that you will receive from your bank, broker or other nominee. Your broker or other
agent cannot vote on any of the proposals, including the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, without your instructions. If
you hold your shares in “street name,” you may not vote your shares in person at the Company Stockholder Meeting unless you
obtain a “legal proxy” from your bank, broker or other nominee.

 
Q: What is the proposed Merger and what effects will it have on Blue Nile?
 

A: The proposed Merger is the acquisition of Blue Nile by Parent. If the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement is approved by
stockholders and the other closing conditions under the Merger Agreement have been satisfied or waived, Merger Sub will merge
with and into Blue Nile with Blue Nile continuing as the Surviving Corporation. As a result of the Merger, Blue Nile will become
a private subsidiary of Parent, and Company Common Stock will no longer be publicly traded and will be delisted from
NASDAQ. In addition, Company Common Stock will be deregistered under the Exchange Act, and we will no longer file
periodic reports with the SEC.

 
Q: What will I receive if the Merger is completed?
 

A: Upon completion of the Merger, you will be entitled to receive the Per Share Price for each share of Company Common Stock
that you own. For example, if you own 100 shares of Company Common Stock, you will receive $4,075.00 in cash in exchange
for your shares of Company Common Stock, less any applicable withholding taxes.

 
Q: How does the Per Share Price compare to the unaffected market price of the Company Common Stock?
 

A: The relationship of the Per Share Price to the trading price of the Company Common Stock constituted a premium of
approximately 33.9% to the closing price of $30.44 on November 4, 2016, the last trading day prior to the execution of the
Merger Agreement.

 
Q: What do I need to do now?
 

A: We encourage you to read this proxy statement, the annexes to this proxy statement and the documents that we refer to in this
proxy statement carefully and consider how the Merger affects you. Then sign, date and return, as promptly as possible, the
enclosed proxy card in the accompanying reply envelope, or grant your proxy electronically over the internet or by telephone, so
that your shares can be voted at the Company Stockholder Meeting. If you hold your shares in “street name,” please refer to the
voting instruction forms provided by your bank, broker or other nominee to vote your shares. Please do not send your stock
certificates with your proxy card.

 
Q: Should I send in my stock certificates now?
 

A: No. After the Merger is completed, you will receive a letter of transmittal containing instructions for how to send your stock
certificates to the payment agent in order to receive the appropriate cash payment for the shares of Company Common Stock
represented by your stock certificates, as described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger Agreement—
Exchange of Certificates and Payment Procedures.” You should use the letter of transmittal to exchange your stock certificates for
the cash payment to which you are entitled. Please do not send your stock certificates with your proxy card.

If your shares are held in “street name” by your broker, bank, or other nominee, you will receive instructions from your broker,
bank or other nominee as to how to effect the surrender of your shares held in “street name.”

Q: What happens if I sell or otherwise transfer my shares of Company Common Stock after the record date but before the
Company Stockholder Meeting?

 

A: The record date for the Company Stockholder Meeting is earlier than the date of the Company Stockholder Meeting and the date
the Merger is expected to be completed. If you sell or transfer your shares of Company Common Stock after the record date but
before the Company Stockholder Meeting, unless special arrangements (such as provision of a proxy) are made between you and
the person to whom you sell or otherwise transfer your shares and each of you notifies Blue Nile in writing of such special
arrangements, you will transfer the right to receive the Per Share Price, if the Merger is completed, to the person to whom you sell
or transfer your shares, but you will retain your right to vote those shares at the Company Stockholder Meeting. Even if you sell
or otherwise transfer your shares of Company Common Stock after the record date, we encourage you to sign, date and
return the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying reply envelope or grant your proxy electronically over the internet or
by telephone.

 
Q: How does the Board of Directors recommend that I vote?
 

A: The Board of Directors, after considering the various factors described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The
Merger—Recommendation of the Board of Directors and Reasons for the Merger,” has unanimously (1) determined that it is in
the best interests of Blue Nile and Blue Nile’s stockholders, and declared it advisable, to enter into the Merger Agreement and
consummate the Merger upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein; (2) approved the execution and delivery of
the Merger Agreement by Blue Nile, the performance by Blue Nile of its covenants and other obligations thereunder, and the
consummation of the Merger upon the terms and conditions set forth therein; and (3) recommended that Blue Nile’s stockholders
adopt the Merger Agreement in accordance with the DGCL.

The Board of Directors recommends that you vote (1) “FOR” the adoption of the Merger Agreement; (2) “FOR” the proposal to
adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes
to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Company Stockholder Meeting; and (3) “FOR” the proposal to approve, by
non-binding, advisory vote, certain compensation that will or may become payable by Blue Nile to its named executive officers in
connection with the Merger.

 
Q: What happens if the Merger is not completed?
 

A: If the Merger Agreement is not adopted by stockholders or if the Merger is not completed for any other reason, stockholders will
not receive any payment for their shares of Company Common Stock. Instead, Blue Nile will remain an independent public
company, Company Common Stock will continue to be listed and traded on NASDAQ and registered under the Exchange Act,
and we will continue to file periodic reports with the SEC. Please see the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger—
Effect on Blue Nile if the Merger is Not Completed.”

Under specified circumstances, Blue Nile will be required to pay Parent a termination fee upon the termination of the Merger
Agreement, as described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger Agreement—Termination of the Merger
Agreement; Termination Fees.”

 
Q: What constitutes a quorum?
 

A: Stockholders of Blue Nile representing a majority of the voting power of the issued and outstanding Company Common Stock of
Blue Nile entitled to vote, present in person, or represented by proxy, will constitute a quorum for the transaction of any business
at such meeting. As of the record date, 11,730,389 shares of Company Common Stock will be required to obtain a quorum.
Abstentions and any broker non-votes are considered as present for the purpose of determining the presence of a quorum.

Table of Contents

Q: What vote is required to adopt the Merger Agreement?
 

A: The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock entitled to vote is required
to adopt the Merger Agreement.

The failure of any stockholder of record to (1) submit a signed proxy card; (2) grant a proxy over the internet or by telephone; or
(3) vote in person by ballot at the Company Stockholder Meeting will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to
adopt the Merger Agreement. If you hold your shares in “street name” and a quorum is present at the Company Stockholder
Meeting, the failure to instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your shares will have the same effect as a vote
“AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. Abstentions will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the
proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement.

 
Q: What vote is required to approve any proposal to adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting, if necessary or appropriate,

to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Company
Stockholder Meeting?

 

A: Approval of the proposal to adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the voting
power of the shares present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote at the Company Stockholder Meeting.

The failure of any stockholder of record to: (1) submit a signed proxy card; (2) grant a proxy over the Internet or by telephone; or
(3) vote in person by ballot at the Company Stockholder Meeting will not have any effect on the adjournment proposal. If you
hold your shares in “street name,” the failure to instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your shares will not have
any effect on the adjournment proposal. Abstentions will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the adjournment proposal.

 
Q: What vote is required to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, certain compensation that will or may become payable

by Blue Nile to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger?
 

A: Approval, by non-binding, advisory vote, of certain compensation that will or may become payable by Blue Nile to its named
executive officers in connection with the Merger requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the voting power of the shares
present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote at the Company Stockholder Meeting.

The failure of any stockholder of record to (1) submit a signed proxy card; (2) grant a proxy over the internet or by telephone; or
(3) vote in person by ballot at the Company Stockholder Meeting will not have any effect on the proposal to approve, by non-
binding advisory vote, of certain compensation that will or may become payable by Blue Nile to its named executive officers in
connection with the Merger. If you hold your shares in “street name,” the failure to instruct your bank, broker or other nominee
how to vote your shares will not have any effect on the compensation proposal. Abstentions will have the same effect as a vote
“AGAINST” the compensation proposal.

 
Q: Why am I being asked to cast a non-binding, advisory vote regarding certain compensation that will or may become

payable by Blue Nile to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger?
 

A: SEC rules require Blue Nile to seek a non-binding, advisory vote regarding certain compensation that will or may become payable
by Blue Nile to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger.

 
Q: What is the compensation that will or may become payable by Blue Nile to its named executive officers in connection with

the Merger for purposes of this advisory vote?
 

A: The compensation that will or may become payable by Blue Nile to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger is
certain compensation that is tied to or based on the Merger and payable to

certain of Blue Nile’s named executive officers. For further detail, please see the section in this proxy statement captioned
“Proposal 3: Advisory, Non-Binding Vote to Approve Certain Merger Related Executive Compensation Arrangements.”

 
Q: What will happen if stockholders do not approve the compensation that will or may become payable by Blue Nile to its

named executive officers in connection with the Merger at the Company Stockholder Meeting?
 

A: Approval of the compensation that will or may become payable by Blue Nile to its named executive officers in connection with
the Merger is not a condition to completion of the Merger. The vote with respect to the compensation that will or may become
payable by Blue Nile to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger is an advisory vote and will not be binding on
Blue Nile or Parent. If the Merger Agreement is adopted by the stockholders and the Merger is completed, the compensation that
will or may become payable by Blue Nile to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger may be paid to Blue
Nile’s named executive officers even if stockholders fail to approve the payment of that compensation.

 
Q: Are there any other risks to me from the Merger that I should consider?
 

A: Yes. There are risks associated with all business combinations, including the Merger. For further detail, please see the section of
this proxy statement captioned “Forward-Looking Statements.”

 
Q: What is the difference between holding shares as a stockholder of record and as a beneficial owner?
 

A: If your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, you
are considered, with respect to those shares, to be the “stockholder of record” as of the record date. In this case, this proxy
statement and your proxy card have been sent directly to you by Blue Nile.

If your shares are held through a bank, broker or other nominee as of the record date, you are considered the “beneficial owner”
of shares of Company Common Stock held in “street name.” In that case, this proxy statement has been forwarded to you by your
bank, broker or other nominee who is considered, with respect to those shares, to be the stockholder of record. As the beneficial
owner, you have the right to direct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your shares by following their instructions for
voting. You are also invited to attend the Company Stockholder Meeting. However, because you are not the stockholder of record,
you may not vote your shares in person at the Company Stockholder Meeting unless you obtain a “legal proxy” from your bank,
broker or other nominee.

 
Q: Will my shares held in “street name” or another form of record ownership be combined for voting purposes with shares I

hold of record?
 

A: No. For voting purposes, any shares you may hold in “street name” will be deemed to be held by a different stockholder than any
shares you hold of record, and as a result, any shares held in “street name” will not be combined for voting purposes with shares
that you hold of record. Similarly, if you own shares in various registered forms, such as jointly with your spouse, as trustee of a
trust or as custodian for a minor, you will receive, and will need to sign and return, a separate proxy card for the shares held in
each such form, because they are held in a different form of record ownership. Shares of Company Common Stock held by a
corporation or business entity must be voted by an authorized officer of the entity.

 
Q: How may I vote?
 

A: If you are a stockholder of record (that is, if your shares of Company Common Stock are registered in your name with American
Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, our transfer agent), there are four ways to vote:

 

 •  by signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying prepaid reply envelope;
 

 •  by visiting the internet at the address on your proxy card;

Table of Contents

 •  by calling toll-free (within the U.S. or Canada) the phone number on your proxy card; or
 

 •  by attending the Company Stockholder Meeting and voting in person by ballot.

A control number, located on your proxy card, is designed to verify your identity and allow you to vote your shares of Company
Common Stock, and to confirm that your voting instructions have been properly recorded when voting electronically over the
internet or by telephone. Please be aware that, although there is no charge for voting your shares, if you vote electronically over
the internet or by telephone, you may incur costs such as internet access and telephone charges for which you will be responsible.

Even if you plan to attend the Company Stockholder Meeting in person, you are strongly encouraged to vote your shares of
Company Common Stock by proxy. If you are a record holder or if you obtain a “legal proxy” to vote shares that you beneficially
own, you may still vote your shares of Company Common Stock in person by ballot at the Company Stockholder Meeting even if
you have previously voted by proxy. If you are present at the Company Stockholder Meeting and vote in person by ballot, your
previous vote by proxy will not be counted.

If your shares are held in “street name” through a bank, broker or other nominee, you may vote through your bank, broker or
other nominee by completing and returning the voting form provided by your bank, broker or other nominee, or, if such a service
is provided by your bank, broker or other nominee, electronically over the internet or by telephone. To vote over the internet or by
telephone through your bank, broker or other nominee, you should follow the instructions on the voting form provided by your
bank, broker or nominee.

 
Q: If my broker holds my shares in “street name,” will my broker vote my shares for me?
 

A: No. Your bank, broker or other nominee is permitted to vote your shares on any proposal currently scheduled to be considered at
the Company Stockholder Meeting only if you instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote. You should follow the
procedures provided by your bank, broker or other nominee to vote your shares. Without instructions, your shares will not be
voted on such proposals, which will have the same effect as if you voted against adoption of the Merger Agreement, but will have
no effect on the proposal to adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if
there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Company Stockholder Meeting, or the proposal to
approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, certain compensation that will or may become payable by Blue Nile to its named
executive officers in connection with the Merger.

 
Q: May I change my vote after I have mailed my signed proxy card?
 

A: Yes. If you are a stockholder of record, you may change your vote or revoke your proxy at any time before it is voted at the
Company Stockholder Meeting by:

 

 
•  signing another proxy card with a later date and returning it to us in accordance with the instructions therein prior to the

Company Stockholder Meeting;
 

 •  submitting a new proxy electronically over the internet or by telephone after the date of the earlier submitted proxy;
 

 •  delivering a written notice of revocation to the corporate secretary; or
 

 •  attending the Company Stockholder Meeting and voting in person by ballot.

If you hold your shares of Company Common Stock in “street name,” you should contact your bank, broker or other nominee for
instructions regarding how to change your vote. You may also vote in person at the Company Stockholder Meeting if you obtain a
“legal proxy” from your bank, broker or other nominee.

Table of Contents

Q: What is a proxy?
 

A: A proxy is your legal designation of another person, referred to as a “proxy,” to vote your shares of Company Common Stock.
The written document describing the matters to be considered and voted on at the Company Stockholder Meeting is called a
“proxy statement.” The document used to designate a proxy to vote your shares of Company Common Stock is called a “proxy
card.” David Binder and Harvey Kanter are the proxy holders for the Company Stockholder Meeting.

 
Q: If a stockholder gives a proxy, how are the shares voted?
 

A: Regardless of the method you choose to vote, the proxy holders will vote your shares in the way that you indicate. When
completing the internet or telephone process or the proxy card, you may specify whether your shares should be voted for or
against or to abstain from voting on all, some or none of the specific items of business to come before the Company Stockholder
Meeting.

If you properly sign your proxy card but do not mark the boxes showing how your shares should be voted on a matter, the shares
represented by your properly signed proxy will be voted (1) “FOR” the adoption of the Merger Agreement; (2) “FOR” the
proposal to adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are
insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Company Stockholder Meeting; and (3) “FOR” the proposal
to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, certain compensation that will or may become payable by Blue Nile to its named
executive officers in connection with the Merger.

 
Q: What should I do if I receive more than one set of voting materials?
 

A: Please sign, date and return (or grant your proxy electronically over the internet or by telephone) each proxy card and voting
instruction card that you receive.

You may receive more than one set of voting materials, including multiple copies of this proxy statement and multiple proxy
cards or voting instruction cards. For example, if you hold your shares in more than one brokerage account, you will receive a
separate voting instruction card for each brokerage account in which you hold shares. If you are a stockholder of record and your
shares are registered in more than one name, you will receive more than one proxy card.

 
Q: Where can I find the voting results of the Company Stockholder Meeting?
 

A: Blue Nile intends to publish final voting results in a Current Report on Form 8-K to be filed with the SEC following the Company
Stockholder Meeting. All reports that Blue Nile files with the SEC are publicly available when filed. Please see the section of this
proxy statement captioned “Where You Can Find More Information.”

 
Q: Will I be subject to U.S. federal income tax upon the exchange of Company Common Stock for cash pursuant to the

Merger?
 

A: If you are a U.S. Holder (as defined in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger—Material U.S. Federal Income
Tax Consequences of the Merger”), the exchange of Company Common Stock for cash pursuant to the Merger will be a taxable
transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes, which generally will require a U.S. Holder to recognize gain or loss for U.S.
federal income tax purposes in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received by such U.S.
Holder in the Merger and such U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the shares of Company Common Stock surrendered in the
Merger.

A Non-U.S. Holder (as defined in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax
Consequences of the Merger”) generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax with respect to the exchange of Company
Common Stock for cash in the Merger unless such Non-U.S. Holder has certain connections to the United States.

Table of Contents

Because particular circumstances may differ, we recommend that you consult your own tax advisor to determine the U.S. federal
income tax consequences relating to the Merger in light of your own particular circumstances and any consequences arising under
U.S. Federal non-income tax laws or the laws of any state, local or non-U.S. tax jurisdiction. A more complete description of the
material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger is provided in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The
Merger—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger.”

 

Q: What will the holders of Company Options and RSUs receive in the Merger?
 

A: At the Effective Time, each outstanding Company Option, whether unvested or vested, that has an exercise price per share less
than $40.75 will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to $40.75 (less the exercise price per
share attributable to such Company Option), multiplied by the total number of shares of Company Common Stock that are
issuable upon full exercise of such Company Option, less any applicable tax withholdings. At the Effective Time, each
outstanding Company Option, whether unvested or vested, that has an exercise price per share equal to or greater than $40.75,
will be cancelled without payment of any consideration.

At the Effective Time, each outstanding RSU that is only subject to time-vesting requirements, whether vested or unvested, will
be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to $40.75, multiplied by the total number of shares
subject to such RSUs, less any applicable tax withholdings.

At the Effective Time, each outstanding RSU that is subject to time- and performance-based requirements, will be cancelled and
converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to $40.75, multiplied by the total number of shares determined to be
performance vested, with the performance goals deemed achieved at the maximum levels and with the remaining time-vesting
requirements deemed satisfied less any applicable tax withholdings.

Amounts payable to the holders of Company Options and RSUs will be payable no later than the second payroll cycle of the
Surviving Corporation following the Effective Time.

 
Q: What will happen to the Employee Stock Purchase Plan?
 

A: With respect to the 2004 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “ESPP”), Blue Nile has no participants in the ESPP, and new
enrollments are prohibited under the Merger Agreement.

 
Q: When do you expect the Merger to be completed?
 

A: We are working toward completing the Merger as quickly as possible and currently expect to complete the Merger in the first
calendar quarter of 2017. However, the exact timing of completion of the Merger cannot be predicted because the Merger is
subject to the closing conditions described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger Agreement—Conditions
to the Merger,” many of which are outside of our control.

 
Q: If the Merger is completed, how will I receive the cash for my shares?
 

A: If the Merger is completed and your shares of Company Common Stock are held as uncertificated shares, the payment agent will
issue and deliver to you a check or wire transfer for your shares without any further action on your part. If you are a stockholder
of record with your shares held in certificated form, you will receive a letter of transmittal with instructions on how to send your
shares of Company Common Stock to the payment agent in connection with the Merger. The payment agent will issue and deliver
to you a check or wire transfer for your shares after you comply with these instructions. Please do not send your stock
certificates with your proxy card. Please see the section in this proxy statement captioned “The Merger Agreement—Exchange
of Certificates and Payment Procedures.”

If your shares are held in “street name” by your broker, bank, or other nominee, you will receive instructions from your broker,
bank or other nominee as to how to effect the surrender of your shares held in “street name.”

Q: Am I entitled to appraisal rights under the Delaware General Corporation Law?
 

A: If the Merger is completed, stockholders who do not vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement, who continuously
hold shares through the Effective Time, and who properly demand appraisal of their shares of Company Common Stock and who
meet certain other conditions and statutory requirements described herein will be entitled, provided certain other conditions
(including relating to the amount of shares of Company Common Stock owned by stockholders seeking appraisal) are met, to
appraisal rights in connection with the Merger under Section 262 of the Delaware General Corporation law (“DGCL”). This
means that holders of shares of Company Common Stock may be entitled to have their shares of Company Common Stock
appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive payment in cash of the “fair value” of the shares of Company
Common Stock, exclusive of any elements of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with
interest to be paid on the amount determined to be fair value, if any, as determined by the court (subject, in the case of interest
payments, to any voluntary cash payments made by the Surviving Corporation pursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262 of the
DGCL). Stockholders who wish to seek appraisal of their shares of Company Common Stock are in any case encouraged to seek
the advice of legal counsel with respect to the exercise of appraisal rights due to the complexity of the appraisal process. The
DGCL requirements for exercising appraisal rights are described in additional detail in this proxy statement, and the relevant
section of the DGCL regarding appraisal rights is reproduced in Annex C to this proxy statement.

 
Q: Do any of Blue Nile’s directors or officers have interests in the Merger that differ from those of Blue Nile stockholders

generally?
 

A: Yes. In considering the recommendation of the Board of Directors with respect to the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement,
you should be aware that our directors and executive officers have interests in the Merger that are different from, or in addition to,
the interests of stockholders generally. In (i) evaluating and negotiating the Merger Agreement; (ii) adopting the Merger
Agreement and the Merger; and (iii) recommending that the Merger Agreement be adopted by stockholders, the Board of
Directors was aware of and considered these interests to the extent that they existed at the time, among other matters. For more
information, please see the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger—Interests of Blue Nile’s Directors and
Executive Officers of Blue Nile in the Merger.”

 
Q: Who can help answer my questions?
 

A: If you have any questions concerning the Merger, the Company Stockholder Meeting or the accompanying proxy statement,
would like additional copies of the accompanying proxy statement or need help voting your shares of Company Common Stock,
please contact our Proxy Solicitor:

THE COMPANY STOCKHOLDER MEETING

The enclosed proxy is solicited on behalf of the Board of Directors for use at the Company Stockholder Meeting.

Date, Time and Place

We will hold the Company Stockholder Meeting on February 2, 2017, at 8:00 a.m., Pacific Time, at 411 First Avenue South, Suite
210, Seattle, Washington 98104.

Purpose of the Company Stockholder Meeting

At the Company Stockholder Meeting, we will ask stockholders to vote on proposals to (i) adopt the Merger Agreement;
(ii) adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to
adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Company Stockholder Meeting; and (iii) approve, by non-binding, advisory vote,
certain compensation that will or may become payable by Blue Nile to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger.

Record Date; Shares Entitled to Vote; Quorum

Only stockholders of record as of December 21, 2016 (the “record date”) are entitled to notice of the Company Stockholder
Meeting and to vote at the Company Stockholder Meeting. A list of stockholders entitled to vote at the Company Stockholder Meeting
will be available at our principal executive offices, located at 411 First Avenue South, Suite 700, Seattle, WA 98104, during regular
business hours beginning for a period of no less than ten (10) days before the Company Stockholder Meeting and will be made
available at the place of the Company Stockholder Meeting during the meeting.

As of the record date, there were 11,730,599 shares of Company Common Stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the Company
Stockholder Meeting.

Stockholders of Blue Nile representing a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote, present in person or represented by
proxy, will constitute a quorum at the Company Stockholder Meeting. In the event that a quorum is not present at the Company
Stockholder Meeting, it is expected that the meeting will be adjourned to solicit additional proxies.

Vote Required; Abstentions and Broker Non-Votes

Each share of Company Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on the record date is entitled to one vote on each of
the proposals to be considered at the Company Stockholder Meeting.

The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of Company Common Stock issued, outstanding and entitled to
vote as of the close of business on the record date is required to adopt the Merger Agreement. Adoption of the Merger Agreement by
stockholders is a condition to the Closing of the Merger.

If a quorum is present, the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of Company Common Stock having voting power present
in person or represented by proxy at the Company Stockholder Meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter will have the power
to adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to
adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Company Stockholder Meeting. If a quorum is not present, then either the chairman of
the meeting or the vote of the holders of a majority of the shares represented thereat, present in person or represented by proxy, will
have the power to adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting, but no other business shall be transacted at such meeting. In the event
that a quorum is not present at the Company Stockholder Meeting, the Company currently expects that the meeting will be adjourned
to solicit additional proxies.

Table of Contents

If a stockholder abstains from voting, that abstention will have the same effect as if the stockholder voted “AGAINST” the
proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. For stockholders who attend the meeting or are represented by proxy and abstain from
voting, the abstention will have the same effect as if the stockholder voted “AGAINST” all other proposals.

Each “broker non-vote” will also count as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, but will have no
effect on the other proposals. A “broker non-vote” generally occurs when a bank, broker or other nominee holding shares of Company
Common Stock on your behalf does not vote on a proposal because the bank, broker or other nominee has not received your voting
instructions and lacks discretionary power to vote the shares of Company Common Stock. Under applicable stock exchange rules,
brokers, banks or other nominees have the discretion to vote your shares on routine matters if you fail to instruct your broker, bank or
other nominee on how to vote your shares with respect to such matters. The proposals in this proxy statement are non-routine matters,
and brokers, banks and other nominees therefore cannot vote on the proposals without your instructions.

Shares Held by Blue Nile’s Directors and Executive Officers

As of the record date, our directors and executive officers beneficially owned and were entitled to vote, in the aggregate, 702,073
shares of Company Common Stock, representing approximately 5.7% of the shares of Company Common Stock outstanding on the
record date. All of our directors and executive officers have informed us that they intend to vote, all of their shares of Company
Common Stock (1) “FOR” the adoption of the Merger Agreement; (2) “FOR” the proposal to adjourn the Company Stockholder
Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the
time of the Company Stockholder Meeting; and (3) “FOR” the proposal to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, certain
compensation that will or may become payable by Blue Nile to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger.

Voting of Proxies

If your shares are registered in your name with our transfer agent, American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, you may
cause your shares to be voted by returning a signed and dated proxy card in the accompanying prepaid envelope, or you may vote in
person at the Company Stockholder Meeting. Additionally, you may grant a proxy electronically over the internet or by telephone by
following the instructions on your proxy card. You must have the enclosed proxy card available, and follow the instructions on the
proxy card, in order to grant a proxy electronically over the internet or by telephone. Based on your proxy cards or internet and
telephone proxies, the proxy holders will vote your shares according to your directions.

If you plan to attend the Company Stockholder Meeting and wish to vote in person, you will be given a ballot at the Company
Stockholder Meeting. If your shares are registered in your name, you are encouraged to vote by proxy even if you plan to attend the
Company Stockholder Meeting in person. If you attend the Company Stockholder Meeting and vote in person by ballot, your vote will
revoke any previously submitted proxy.

Voting instructions are included on your proxy card. All shares represented by properly signed and dated proxies received in time
for the Company Stockholder Meeting will be voted at the Company Stockholder Meeting in accordance with the instructions of the
stockholder. Properly signed and dated proxies that do not contain voting instructions will be voted (1) “FOR” the adoption of the
Merger Agreement; (2) “FOR” the proposal to adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit
additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Company Stockholder Meeting; and
(3) “FOR” the proposal to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, certain compensation that will or may become payable by Blue
Nile to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger.

If you submit a signed proxy card or submit your proxy by telephone or the Internet, but do not specify how you want to vote
your shares on a particular proposal, then the proxy holders will vote your shares in accordance

Table of Contents

with the recommendations of the Board of Directors on all matters presented in this proxy statement. With respect to any other matters
properly presented for a vote at the Company Stockholder Meeting, the proxy holders will vote your shares in accordance with their
best judgment. If you fail to return your proxy card and you are a holder of record on the record date, unless you attend the Company
Stockholder Meeting and vote in person, the effect will be that your shares of Company Common Stock will not be considered for
purposes of determining whether a quorum is present at the Company Stockholder Meeting, will have the same effect as a vote against
the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and will not have any effect on the other proposals.

If your shares of Company Common Stock are held in “street name” through a bank, broker or other nominee, you may vote
through your bank, broker or other nominee by completing and returning the voting form provided by your bank, broker or other
nominee or attending Company Stockholder Meeting and voting in person with a “legal proxy” from your bank, broker or other
nominee. If such a service is provided, you may vote over the Internet or telephone through your bank, broker or other nominee by
following the instructions on the voting form provided by your bank, broker or other nominee. If you do not return your bank’s,
broker’s or other nominee’s voting form, do not vote via the Internet or telephone through your bank, broker or other nominee, if
possible, or do not attend the Company Stockholder Meeting and vote in person with a “legal proxy” from your bank, broker or other
nominee, it will have the same effect as if you voted “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, but will not have any
effect on the other proposals.

Revocability of Proxies

If you are a stockholder of record on the record date, you may change your vote or revoke your proxy at any time before it is
voted at the Company Stockholder Meeting by:
 

 •  signing another proxy card with a later date and returning it to us prior to the Company Stockholder Meeting;
 

 •  submitting a new proxy electronically over the internet or by telephone after the date of the earlier submitted proxy;
 

 •  delivering a written notice of revocation to our corporate secretary; or
 

 •  attending the Company Stockholder Meeting and voting in person by ballot.

If you have submitted a proxy, your appearance at the Company Stockholder Meeting, in the absence of voting in person or
submitting an additional proxy or revocation, will not have the effect of revoking your prior proxy.

If you hold your shares of Company Common Stock in “street name,” you should contact your bank, broker or other nominee for
instructions regarding how to change your vote. You may also vote in person at the Company Stockholder Meeting if you obtain a
“legal proxy” from your bank, broker or other nominee.

Any adjournment, postponement or other delay of the Company Stockholder Meeting, including for the purpose of soliciting
additional proxies, will allow stockholders who have already sent in their proxies to revoke them at any time prior to their use at the
Company Stockholder Meeting as adjourned, postponed or delayed.

Board of Directors’ Recommendation

The Board of Directors, after considering various factors described under the section of this proxy statement captioned “The
Merger—Recommendation of the Board of Directors and Reasons for the Merger,” has unanimously (1) determined that it is in the best
interests of Blue Nile and Blue Nile’s stockholders, and declared it advisable, to enter into the Merger Agreement and consummate the
Merger upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein; (2) approved the execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement
by Blue Nile, the performance by Blue Nile of its covenants and other obligations thereunder, and the consummation of the Merger
upon the terms and conditions set forth therein; and (3) recommended that Blue Nile’s stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement in
accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law (“DGCL”).

Table of Contents

The Board of Directors recommends that you vote (1) “FOR” the adoption of the Merger Agreement; (2) “FOR” the proposal to
postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient
votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Company Stockholder Meeting; and (3) “FOR” the proposal to approve, by
non-binding, advisory vote, certain compensation that will or may become payable by Blue Nile to its named executive officers in
connection with the Merger.

Solicitation of Proxies

The expense of soliciting proxies will be borne by Blue Nile. We have retained D.F. King & Co., Inc., a proxy solicitation firm
(the “Proxy Solicitor”), to solicit proxies in connection with the Company Stockholder Meeting at a cost of $11,500.00, plus certain
expenses. We will also indemnify the Proxy Solicitor against certain losses arising out of its provision of these services on our behalf.
In addition, we may reimburse banks, brokers and other nominees representing beneficial owners of shares for their expenses in
forwarding soliciting materials to such beneficial owners. Proxies may also be solicited by our directors, officers and employees,
personally or by telephone, email, fax, over the internet or by other means of communication. No additional compensation will be paid
for such services.

Anticipated Date of Completion of the Merger

Assuming timely satisfaction of necessary closing conditions, including the approval by stockholders of the proposal to adopt the
Merger Agreement, we anticipate that the Merger will be completed in the first calendar quarter of 2017.

Appraisal Rights

If the Merger is consummated, stockholders who do not vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement, who continuously
hold such shares through the Effective Time and who properly perfect appraisal of their shares of Company Common Stock will be
entitled, provided certain other conditions (including relating to the aggregate amount of shares of Company Common Stock owned by
stockholders seeking appraisal) are met, to appraisal of their shares of Company Common Stock in connection with the Merger under
Section 262 of the DGCL. This means that such holders of shares of Company Common Stock may be entitled to have their shares of
Company Common Stock appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive payment in cash of the “fair value” of their
shares of Company Common Stock, exclusive of any elements of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger,
together with interest to be paid on the amount determined to be fair value, if any, as determined by the court (subject, in the case of
interest payments, to any voluntary cash payments made by the Surviving Corporation pursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262 of the
DGCL), so long as they comply with the procedures established by Section 262 of the DGCL. Due to the complexity of the appraisal
process, Blue Nile stockholders who wish to seek appraisal of their shares of Company Common Stock are encouraged to seek the
advice of legal counsel with respect to the exercise of appraisal rights.

Stockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares of Company Common
Stock is determined pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL could be more than, the same as or less than the value of the Per
Share Price that they would receive pursuant to the Merger Agreement if they did not seek appraisal of their shares of
Company Common Stock.

To exercise your appraisal rights, you must (1) submit a written demand for appraisal to Blue Nile before the vote is taken on the
adoption of the Merger Agreement; (2) not vote, in person or by proxy, in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement; and
(3) continue to hold the subject shares of Company Common Stock of record through the time (the “Effective Time”) Parent, Merger
Sub and Blue Nile cause the Merger to be consummated pursuant to the DGCL. Your failure to follow exactly the procedures specified
under the DGCL may result in the loss of your appraisal rights. In addition, the Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal

proceedings as to all Blue Nile stockholders who assert appraisal rights unless (x) the total number of shares of Company Common
Stock for which appraisal rights have been pursued and perfected exceeds 1% of Blue Nile’s outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock as measured in accordance with subsection (g) of Section 262 of the DGCL or (y) the value of the aggregate Per Share Price in
respect of the shares of Company Common Stock for which appraisal rights have been pursued and perfected exceeds $1 million. The
DGCL requirements for exercising appraisal rights are described in further detail in this proxy statement, and the relevant section of the
DGCL regarding appraisal rights is reproduced and attached as Annex C to this proxy statement. If you hold your shares of Company
Common Stock through a bank, brokerage firm or other nominee and you wish to exercise appraisal rights, you should consult with
your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee to determine the appropriate procedures for the making of a demand for appraisal by such
bank, brokerage firm or nominee.

Other Matters

At this time, we know of no other matters to be voted on at the Company Stockholder Meeting. If any other matters properly
come before the Company Stockholder Meeting, your shares of Company Common Stock will be voted in accordance with the
discretion of the appointed proxy holders.

Householding of Company Stockholder Meeting Materials

Unless we have received contrary instructions, we may send a single copy of this proxy statement to any household at which two
or more stockholders reside if we believe the stockholders are members of the same family. Each stockholder in the household will
continue to receive a separate proxy card. This process, known as “householding,” reduces the volume of duplicate information
received at your household and helps to reduce our expenses.

If you would like to receive your own set of our disclosure documents, follow the instructions described below. Similarly, if you
share an address with another stockholder and together both of you would like to receive only a single set of our disclosure documents,
follow these instructions.

If you are a stockholder of record, you may contact us by writing to Blue Nile, Inc., Attention: Investor Relations, 411 First
Avenue South, Suite 700, Seattle, WA 98104. Eligible stockholders of record receiving multiple copies of this proxy statement can
request householding by contacting us in the same manner. If a bank, broker or other nominee holds your shares, please contact your
bank, broker or other nominee directly.

PROPOSAL 1: ADOPTION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT

We are asking you to adopt the Merger Agreement.

For a summary of and detailed information regarding this proposal, see the information about the Merger Agreement and the
Merger throughout this proxy statement, including the information set forth in the sections captioned “The Merger” and “The Merger
Agreement.” A copy of the Merger Agreement is attached to this proxy statement as Annex A. You are urged to read the Merger
Agreement carefully in its entirety.

Under applicable law, we cannot complete the Merger without the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock entitled to vote voting in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. If you abstain from voting or
fail to cast your vote, in person or by proxy, it will have the same effect as a vote against the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement.

The Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” this proposal.

PROPOSAL 2: ADJOURNMENT OF THE COMPANY STOCKHOLDER MEETING

We are asking you to approve a proposal for one or more adjournments of the Company Stockholder Meeting, if necessary or
appropriate and to the extent permitted by the Merger Agreement, to solicit additional proxies if we have not obtained sufficient
affirmative stockholder votes to adopt the Merger Agreement. If the stockholders of Blue Nile approve the adjournment proposal, we
could adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting, and any adjourned session of the Company Stockholder Meeting, and use the
additional time to solicit additional proxies.

If, at the Company Stockholder Meeting, the number of shares of Company Common Stock present in person or by proxy and
voting in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement is not sufficient to approve that proposal, we may move to adjourn the
Company Stockholder Meeting in order to enable our directors, officers and employees to solicit additional proxies for the adoption of
the Merger Agreement. In that event, we will ask the stockholders of Blue Nile to vote only upon the adjournment proposal, and not the
Merger Agreement proposal.

The adjournment proposal relates only to an adjournment of the Company Stockholder Meeting occurring for purposes of
soliciting additional proxies to adopt the Merger Agreement in the event that there are insufficient votes to approve that proposal. We
retain full authority to the extent set forth in our bylaws and the DGCL (subject to the terms of the Merger Agreement) to adjourn the
Company Stockholder Meeting for any other purpose without the consent of any stockholders of Blue Nile.

The Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” this proposal.

PROPOSAL 3: ADVISORY, NON-BINDING VOTE TO APPROVE
CERTAIN MERGER RELATED EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS

Section 14A of the Exchange Act, which was enacted as part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection
Act of 2010, requires that we provide stockholders with the opportunity to vote to approve, on an advisory, non-binding basis, the
payment of certain compensation that will or may become payable to Blue Nile’s named executive officers by Blue Nile in connection
with the Merger, as disclosed in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger—Interests of Blue Nile’s Directors and
Executive Officers in the Merger—Payments Upon Termination In Connection with Change of Control.”

We are asking stockholders to indicate their approval of the various compensation that will or may become payable by Blue Nile
to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger. These payments are set forth in the section of this proxy statement
captioned “The Merger—Interests of Blue Nile’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—Golden Parachute Compensation”
and the accompanying footnotes. In general, the various plans and arrangements pursuant to which these compensation payments may
be made have previously formed part of Blue Nile’s overall compensation program for our named executive officers and previously
have been disclosed to stockholders as part of the compensation discussion and analysis and related sections of our annual proxy
statements. These historical arrangements were approved and adopted by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors,
which is composed solely of non-management directors, and are believed to be reasonable and in line with marketplace norms. The
compensation that may be provided to the named executive officers in connection with any new employment agreements entered into
with Parent is not subject to this advisory, non-binding vote.

Accordingly, we are seeking approval of the following resolution at the Company Stockholder Meeting:

“RESOLVED, that the stockholders of Blue Nile, Inc. approve, on a nonbinding, advisory basis, the compensation that will or
may become payable by Blue Nile to its named executive officers by Blue Nile that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger as
disclosed pursuant to Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger—Interests of Blue
Nile’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—Golden Parachute Compensation.”

Stockholders should note that this proposal is not a condition to completion of the Merger, and as an advisory vote, the result will
not be binding on Blue Nile, the Board of Directors or Parent. Further, the underlying plans and arrangements are contractual in nature
and not, by their terms, subject to stockholder approval. Accordingly, regardless of the outcome of the advisory vote, if the Merger is
consummated, our named executive officers will be eligible to receive the compensation that is based on or otherwise relates to the
Merger in accordance with the terms and conditions applicable to those payments.

The Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” this proposal.

Table of Contents

Effect of the Merger

Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, if the Merger is completed, Merger Sub will be
merged with and into Blue Nile and Blue Nile will continue as the Surviving Corporation of the Merger and a private subsidiary of
Parent. As a result of the Merger, Company Common Stock will no longer be publicly traded and will be delisted from NASDAQ. At
this time, all of the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of Blue Nile, and Merger Sub will vest in the Surviving
Corporation; and all debts, liabilities and duties of Blue Nile and Merger Sub will become the debts, liabilities and duties of the
Surviving Corporation. In addition, all outstanding shares of Blue Nile common stock (“Company Common Stock”) will be
deregistered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), and we will no longer file periodic reports
with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). If the Merger is completed, you will not own any shares of the capital
stock or any other rights or interest in the Surviving Corporation.

The Effective Time will occur upon the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or
at such later time as would be specified in the Certificate of Merger.

Effect on Blue Nile if the Merger is Not Completed

If the Merger Agreement is not adopted by stockholders or if the Merger is not completed for any other reason, Blue Nile’s
stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares (or interests in shares) of Company Common Stock. Instead, Blue Nile will
remain an independent public company, Company Common Stock will continue to be listed and traded on NASDAQ and registered
under the Exchange Act and we will continue to file periodic reports with the SEC. In addition, if the Merger is not completed, we
expect that management will operate the business in a manner similar to that in which it is being operated today and that stockholders
will continue to be subject to the same risks and opportunities to which they are currently subject, including risks related to the highly
competitive industry in which Blue Nile operates and risks related to adverse economic conditions.

Furthermore, if the Merger is not completed, and depending on the circumstances that caused the Merger not to be completed, the
price of Company Common Stock may decline significantly. If that were to occur, it is uncertain when, if ever, the price of Company
Common Stock would return to the price at which it trades as of the date of this proxy statement. In addition, stockholders could be
exposed to significant new risks that may arise as a result of the pendency of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement
or the failure of the Merger to be completed, such as risks associated with a potential deterioration of Blue Nile’s reputation, credibility
and standing with customers and commercial partners, and impairment of its ability to retain employees and attract new employees.

Accordingly, if the Merger is not completed, we cannot assure you as to the effect of these risks and opportunities on the future
value of your shares of Company Common Stock. If the Merger is not completed, the Board of Directors of Blue Nile (the “Board of
Directors”) will continue to evaluate and review Blue Nile’s business operations, strategic direction and capitalization, among other
things, and will make such changes as are deemed appropriate. If the Merger Agreement is not adopted by stockholders or if the
Merger is not completed for any other reason, there can be no assurance that any other transaction acceptable to the Board of Directors
will be offered or that Blue Nile’s business, prospects or results of operation will not be adversely impacted.

In addition, upon termination of the Merger Agreement under specified circumstances, Blue Nile will be required to pay Parent a
termination fee. If the termination fee becomes payable by Blue Nile due to (x) Blue Nile’s termination of the Merger Agreement on or
prior to 11:59 p.m., Eastern time, on December 16, 2016 (the “Cut-Off Date”) with respect to Blue Nile entering into an alternative
acquisition agreement with an Excluded Party (as such term is defined in the Merger Agreement), the amount of the termination fee
will be $7.4 million, and (y) if the termination fee becomes payable under any other circumstance, the amount of the termination fee
will be $17.4 million. For more information please see the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger Agreement—
Termination of the Merger Agreement; Termination Fees.”

The Merger Agreement also provides that Parent will be required to pay Blue Nile a reverse termination fee of $32.2 million (the
“Parent Termination Fee”) if (i) the Closing does not occur within five (5) Business Days of the first date Parent is required to close;
(ii) all mutual, Merger Sub, and Parent closing conditions are satisfied (other than those conditions that their terms are satisfied at the
Closing, each of which are capable of being satisfied at Closing); (iii) Blue Nile has irrevocably notified Parent in writing that it is
ready, willing and able to close and that all Blue Nile’s closing conditions are satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that their
terms are satisfied at the Closing, each of which are capable of being satisfied at Closing); (iv) Blue Nile has given Parent written
notice five (5) Business Days prior to termination stating Blue Nile’s intent to terminate the Merger Agreement if Parent and Merger
Sub fail to consummate the Merger; and (v) Parent and Merger Sub fail to close on the later of five (5) Business Days of the notice and
the date Parent is otherwise required to close. For more information please see the section of this proxy statement captioned “The
Merger Agreement—Termination of the Merger Agreement; Termination Fees.”

The Per Share Price

At the Effective Time, and without any action required by any stockholder, each share of Company Common Stock that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Owned Company Shares or Dissenting Company Shares, each as such
terms are defined in the Merger Agreement) will be cancelled and extinguished, and automatically converted into the right to receive
cash in the amount equal to $40.75 without interest thereon and less any applicable withholding taxes.

After the Merger is completed, you will have the right to receive the Per Share Price, but you will no longer have any rights as a
stockholder (except that stockholders who properly exercise their appraisal rights may have the right to receive a payment for the “fair
value” of their shares of Company Common Stock as determined pursuant to an appraisal proceeding as contemplated by Delaware
law, as described below under the caption “The Merger Agreement—Appraisal Rights”).

captioned “—Interests of Blue Nile’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—Treatment of Equity-Based Awards.”

Background of the Merger

The Board of Directors regularly reviews Blue Nile’s business and operations, strategy and prospects as an independent company
with a view toward building stockholder value. As part of its evaluation, from time to time the Board of Directors has considered a
variety of strategic alternatives to Blue Nile’s business strategies as an independent company, including consideration of potential
changes to Blue Nile’s strategy, potential commercial partnerships, potential strategic acquisitions, and a sale of Blue Nile.

From time to time, Blue Nile has received inbound inquiries from, and has held discussions with, third parties regarding the
possibility of pursuing commercial partnerships or other strategic transactions involving Blue Nile. More recently, in the summer of
2015, Blue Nile engaged in conversations with Party A, a large jeweler in mainland China, who had been having ongoing discussions
with Blue Nile to explore the possibility of a commercial partnership through which Party A would acquire a minority interest in Blue
Nile and the two companies would work jointly to expand their collective footprint in China. Blue Nile was introduced to Party A
through an individual at an investment firm, who had previously worked at Party B, a Chinese department store, with whom Blue Nile
previously held discussions since late 2014 regarding the possibility of Party B acquiring Blue Nile. The conversations in the summer
of 2015 also included continued conversations with Party C, a financial sponsor, who had been having ongoing discussions with Blue
Nile throughout the previous year to explore the possibility of acquiring both Blue Nile and Party D, a private diamond and jewelry
company; separate continued conversations with Party D, who had been having discussions with Blue Nile throughout the previous two
years to explore the possibility of Blue Nile acquiring or entering into other strategic transactions

with Party D; and continued conversations with Party E, a large department store chain, regarding the possibility of a strategic
partnership between the companies or acquisition by Party E of Blue Nile. These discussions also included conversations with financial
sponsors, including Party F, with whom members of management held meetings during the summer of 2015, regarding the possibility
of Party F acquiring Blue Nile. During this time, management had regular communication with various members of the Board of
Directors, including the then lead independent director, Mr. Mike Potter.

Throughout this time, the Board of Directors held various meetings to discuss these inbound inquiries and discussions. More
recently, on June 22, 2015, the Board of Directors held a telephonic meeting. At this meeting, management updated the Board of
Directors on the various inbound inquiries from, and discussions with, financial sponsors and strategic parties referenced in the
preceding paragraph that expressed interest in exploring a potential transaction with Blue Nile. The Board of Directors discussed the
advisability of further exploring these commercial partnerships and strategic transactions, including the advisability of exploring a
potential sale of Blue Nile at that time. As part of this conversation, the Board of Directors also discussed Blue Nile’s business results,
strategic plans and opportunities as a standalone company. Following discussion, the Board of Directors authorized management to
continue the discussions with the third parties. In addition, following discussion regarding the capabilities and experience of several
financial advisors, the Board of Directors authorized management to engage BofA Merrill Lynch as Blue Nile’s financial advisor in
connection with this strategic review. The Board of Directors also held a telephonic meeting on July 24, 2015 with members of
management and representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch in attendance and held its regularly scheduled meetings on August 3 and
August 4, 2015 with members of management and representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch in attendance. The July 24, 2015 and
August 4, 2015 meetings included executive sessions with only the independent directors in attendance. During those meetings the
Board of Directors discussed and evaluated the ongoing process, and during the July 24, 2015 meeting, Ms. Neiswender, Blue Nile’s
General Counsel, led the Board of Directors in a discussion regarding the Board of directors’ fiduciary duties, among other matters. On
August 4, 2015, the Board of Directors authorized representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch to begin contacting third parties regarding
possible strategic transactions involving Blue Nile.

In accordance with the Board of Directors’ instructions, commencing in August 2015, representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch
contacted representatives of a total of thirteen strategic buyers, including strategic buyers in the e-commerce, retail distribution and
jewelry specialty market, as well as one financial sponsor, to gauge their respective interests in exploring a potential acquisition of Blue
Nile. These strategic buyers included Party G, a domestic jewelry retailer.

Throughout the second half of 2015, at the direction of the Board of Directors, Mr. Kanter, Blue Nile’s Chief Executive Officer,
held further discussions and meetings with Party A to further explore the possibility of a commercial partnership. Party A and Blue
Nile exchanged drafts of preliminary indicative term sheets for an investment by Party A in Blue Nile, and the Board of Directors held
a telephonic meeting on October 5, 2015 and regularly scheduled meetings on November 2 and November 3, 2015 (with an executive
session with only the independent directors in attendance at the November 3, 2015 meeting), at which the Board of Directors discussed
and evaluated the potential synergies, opportunities for growth, and potential execution risks of such a commercial partnership, in light
of Blue Nile’s stand-alone plan and long-term objectives, including in China. In addition, throughout the second half of 2015, at the
direction of the Board of Directors, management had further discussions and meetings with Party C regarding the possibility of Party C
acquiring Blue Nile, and Party D regarding the possibility of Blue Nile acquiring Party D. During this time the Board of Directors
discussed and evaluated the potential synergies, opportunities for growth, and potential execution risks of an acquisition of Party D at
the meetings on October 5, 2015, November 2, 2015 and November 3, 2015 referenced above.

Also in the second half of 2015, Mr. Kanter, at the direction of the Board of Directors, had preliminary conversations with third
parties who had previously contacted Blue Nile, or who had been contacted at the direction of the Board of Directors by representatives
of BofA Merrill Lynch as part of the August 2015 outreach process, regarding the possibility of an acquisition of Blue Nile.

Table of Contents

As part of the foregoing discussions, each of Party A, Party B, Party C, Party D, Party E, Party F and Party G executed a
confidentiality agreement in favor of Blue Nile. None of these confidentiality agreements contained standstill provisions with respect
to Blue Nile, except for the confidentiality agreement with Party C, which contained a standstill provision that expired in July 2015,
and the confidentiality agreements with Party E and Party G, both of which contained standstill provisions that expired in August 2016.

By the end of 2015, all of the third parties who had expressed an interest in the possibility of acquiring Blue Nile had terminated
discussions, citing, among other reasons, the difficulty in justifying a premium to Blue Nile’s then current stock price. Further, Party C
and Party E each informed Blue Nile of their respective decisions to cease discussions with respect to the possibility of a strategic
partnership at that time, citing, among other reasons, the terms of the proposed transactions and their valuation of Blue Nile. However,
at the direction of the Board of Directors, management continued discussions with Party A regarding the possibility of a commercial
partnership and Party D regarding the possibility of Blue Nile acquiring Party D.

On February 1 and 2, 2016, the Board of Directors held regularly scheduled meetings, with members of management in
attendance at the February 1 and 2, 2016 meetings and representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch in attendance at the February 1, 2016
meeting. The February 2, 2016 meeting included an executive session with only the independent directors in attendance. At these
meetings, after discussion and consultation with management, the Board of Directors decided that it was not in the best interest of the
stockholders to pursue the commercial partnership with Party A at this time, based upon, among other factors, the final terms proposed
by Party A for the commercial partnership, the execution risks of such a commercial partnership, and Blue Nile’s stand-alone plan and
long-term objectives, including in China. The Board of Directors also discussed the potential acquisition of Party D, including Party
D’s supply chain, brand, employee base and customer profile, as well as the potential integration challenges, execution risks and impact
on Blue Nile’s other initiatives and uses of capital for pursuing such a transaction. To assist the Board of Directors in evaluating the
potential acquisition of Party D, after discussion, the Board of Directors resolved to establish a committee (the “Strategic Committee”)
to assist the Board of Directors in evaluating potential acquisition targets. The Strategic Committee was also authorized to assist the
Board of Directors in evaluating a potential sale of Blue Nile and other strategic matters. The designated members of the Strategic
Committee were Blue Nile directors Ms. Mindy Meads (who, at the February 2, 2016 meeting, was appointed to be Blue Nile’s lead
independent director, replacing Mr. Potter in such role) and Messrs. Harvey Kanter, Mike Potter and Robert van Schoonenberg.

On February 29, 2016, the Board of Directors held a telephonic meeting, with members of management in attendance. At this
meeting, the Board of Directors discussed the potential acquisition of Party D, including potential synergies, integration, Party D’s
valuation, the risks and opportunities associated with acquiring Party D and the potential impact of the transaction on the Company’s
business and the Company’s stockholders.

In January of 2016, representatives of Party H, a major supplier and business partner of Blue Nile, introduced Mr. Kanter to Party
I, a financial sponsor, which also had a relationship with Party H. In March of 2016, Party H initiated a conversation between
Mr. Kanter and Party I, during which there were general discussions about the possibility of Party I pursuing an acquisition of Blue
Nile. On April 18 and 19, 2016, Mr. Kanter had additional conversations with Party I about Blue Nile’s business. These conversations
also included a discussion of the possibility of Party I pursuing an acquisition of Blue Nile in highly general terms. Party I, however,
did not make any proposal to acquire Blue Nile.

On March 3, 16 and 30, 2016 and on April 7, 2016, the Strategic Committee held telephonic meetings. At these meetings, the
Strategic Committee discussed, in consultation with management, the potential acquisition of Party D, including the valuation of Party
D, the thesis of the transaction, the potential synergies with Party D, the ability to obtain the affirmative vote of the holders of a
majority of the shares of Company Common Stock in order to consummate such an acquisition and the benefits and risks of pursuing
such an acquisition in light of Blue Nile’s initiatives over the following six to twelve months. During the April 7, 2016 meeting,
following discussion, the Strategic Committee decided it was in the best interest of stockholders to cease further discussions with Party
D.

On April 12, 2016, Party A attended an in-person meeting with Mr. Kanter and Mr. Binder in Seattle. During the course of this
meeting, Party A continued previous discussions regarding the possibility of pursuing strategic transactions between the companies,
and, in light of the Board of Directors’ view that the previously proposed commercial partnership would not be in the best interest of
Blue Nile’s stockholders, Party A explored the possibility of Party A acquiring Blue Nile. On April 18, 2016, Party A delivered to the
Board of Directors a letter, which expressed interest in the possibility of engaging in a take private transaction, strategic investment
and/or strategic partnership, but did not provide any indicative terms for any of these proposed transactions.

On April 14, 2016, Party I and Blue Nile executed a confidentiality agreement, which did not include standstill provisions with
respect to Blue Nile.

On April 20, 2016, the Strategic Committee held a telephonic meeting. At this meeting, Mr. Kanter updated the Strategic
Committee regarding his recent conversations with Party I regarding their interest in exploring a potential acquisition of Blue Nile. The
Strategic Committee also discussed the recent meeting between Mr. Kanter and Party A and the April 12, 2016 letter from Party A. The
Strategic Committee then discussed the type of transaction or partnership that it believed might be in the best interest of Blue Nile’s
stockholders. After discussion, the Strategic Committee instructed management to continue to discuss the terms of a potential strategic
transaction or partnership with Party A and Party I.

On May 2 and 3, 2016, the Board of Directors held regularly scheduled meetings. The May 3, 2016 meeting included executive
sessions with only the independent directors in attendance. At these meetings, the Board of Directors discussed Blue Nile’s ongoing
strategy and the recent discussions with third parties regarding potential strategic alternatives. The Board of Directors also received a
report from the Strategic Committee regarding these discussions and the Strategic Committee’s views and recommendation to the
Board of Directors that Blue Nile continue discussions with Party A and Party I. Following a discussion, the Board of Directors
instructed management to continue the discussions regarding the terms of a potential transaction with Party A and Party I. The Board
of Directors also received an update from management regarding Blue Nile’s first quarter financial results.

On the morning of May 5, 2016, Blue Nile announced its first quarter 2016 financial results. Such announcement stated that net
sales decreased 3.2% to $103.1 million for the first quarter ended April 3, 2016 compared to $106.5 million for the first quarter ended
April 5, 2015; operating income for the quarter totaled $1.2 million, representing an operating margin of 1.2% of net sales, compared to
$1.9 million in operating income and 1.8% operating margin for the first quarter 2015; net income totaled $1.1 million, or $0.09 per
diluted share versus $1.2 million, or $0.10 per diluted share for the first quarter 2015; and adjusted EBITDA for the quarter totaled
$3.6 million compared to $4.0 million for the first quarter 2015. The closing stock price of the Company Common Stock was $25.23
per share on this date, a decline of 4.1% from the closing price of Common Stock of $26.32 on the previous trading day.

On June 13, 2016, representatives of Party H expressed to Mr. Kanter an interest in introducing Blue Nile to Bow Street LLC
(“Bow Street”). On June 14, 2016, Mr. Kanter met with representatives of Party H and Bow Street in New York and had further
telephonic meetings with Bow Street on June 21 and 22, 2016. During the course of these meetings, representatives of Bow Street
indicated that they were interested in exploring a potential acquisition of Blue Nile and that they intended to submit a preliminary
indication of interest to the Board of Directors.

On June 13, 2016, Mr. Kanter received an email introducing Mr. Kanter to the founder of Party J, a financial sponsor, expressing
an interest in arranging an in-person meeting to discuss Blue Nile’s business. Mr. Kanter attended an in-person meeting with the
founder of Party J on June 15, 2016 in New York. On June 16, 2016, Party J and Blue Nile executed a confidentiality agreement, which
did not include standstill provisions with respect to Blue Nile. Mr. Kanter held a further telephonic meeting with representatives of
Party J on June 17, 2016. During the course of these meetings, Party J expressed interest in entering into exclusive negotiations to

pursue a possible acquisition of Blue Nile, but did not submit any indication of interest or provide any price range or other indicative
terms of such a proposal.

On June 21, 2016, the Strategic Committee held a telephonic meeting. At this meeting, Mr. Kanter updated the Strategic
Committee regarding current discussions with Party J and Bow Street, including a discussion of Party J’s request for Blue Nile to enter
into an exclusivity agreement. After deliberation, the Strategic Committee determined that Blue Nile should not enter into any
exclusive relationship with any interested party at that time, instructed management to continue discussions with both Party J and Bow
Street and instructed management to negotiate a confidentiality agreement with representatives of Bow Street and to provide Bow
Street with preliminary due diligence materials. At this meeting, Mr. Kanter also informed the Strategic Committee that he had not
received any communications from Party A since late April 2016. In addition, Mr. Kanter and Mr. Binder updated the Strategic
Committee on Blue Nile’s business and financial results.

Also on June 21, 2016, Mr. Kanter, after consulting with members of the Strategic Committee, contacted representatives of Bow
Street to discuss process. During the course of this conversation, Mr. Kanter indicated that the Board of Directors would be unlikely to
authorize continued discussions at an indicative price of less than $35.00 per share and would be unlikely to be interested in any
transaction at a price less than $40.00 per share.

On June 22, 2016, Blue Nile received an initial non-binding written indication of interest from Bow Street, proposing to acquire
Blue Nile at an indicative purchase price of $35.00 per share in cash. The proposal indicated that it was subject to due diligence. The
closing stock price of the Company Common Stock was $26.48 per share on this date.

On June 22 and 23, 2016, representatives of Party J attended in-person meetings with members of management in Seattle to
discuss Blue Nile’s business.

On June 24, 2016, Mr. Kanter, after consulting with members of the Board of Directors, including lead independent director
Ms. Meads and Mr. Potter, informed representatives of Party J that Blue Nile had received an indication of interest from another party
and requested that Party J submit an indication of interest so that the Board of Directors could consider a formal proposal.
Representatives of Party J informed Mr. Kanter that they were not interested in participating in a competitive process.

On June 24, 2016, Bow Street and Blue Nile executed a confidentiality agreement, which did not include standstill provisions
with respect to Blue Nile. Shortly thereafter, Bow Street received access to preliminary due diligence materials regarding Blue Nile.

On June 25, 2016, Mr. Kanter emailed the Board of Directors to provide several updates as to the strategic process, including the
recent meetings and discussions with Bow Street and Party J, as well as the June 22, 2016 indication of interest from Bow Street,
among other matters.

Mr. Kanter, with authorization of the Board of Directors, authorized Party H to enter into discussions with Bow Street to discuss
due diligence matters and the possibility of entering into commercial arrangements to facilitate a potential transaction between Blue
Nile and Bow Street. To that end, on June 29, 2016, Blue Nile entered into a confidentiality agreement with Party H, which did not
include a standstill provision with respect to Blue Nile.

During the months of June through August 2016, Bow Street conducted preliminary due diligence on Blue Nile. With the
permission of Blue Nile, Bow Street continued to communicate with Party H throughout the process with respect to a potential
transaction with Blue Nile, including due diligence matters and potential commercial arrangements. On July 21, 2016, representatives
of Bow Street held an in-person due diligence session in Seattle, with members of management and Party H attending. At these due
diligence sessions,

representatives of Bow Street indicated that they intended to introduce Blue Nile to additional equity partners as part of the process. On
July 29, 2016, representatives of Bow Street and Blue Nile held a subsequent telephonic meeting, with representatives of BofA Merrill
Lynch in attendance, to discuss process, during which Bow Street indicated again that they intended to engage potential equity partners
to assist in financing a portion of the transaction. On August 1, 2016, Blue Nile provided Bow Street with access to an online data
room containing certain limited preliminary information regarding Blue Nile.

During the months of July 2016 and August 2016, with the permission of Blue Nile, Bow Street contacted potential financial
sponsors, including Bain Capital Private Equity, LP (“Bain Capital”) and Party K, a financial sponsor, to discuss the possibility of their
providing a portion of the equity financing that Bow Street required to consummate a transaction with Blue Nile. Pursuant to the terms
of Bow Street’s confidentiality agreement with Blue Nile, Bow Street and Blue Nile provided due diligence materials to Bain Capital
and Party K. On August 28 and 29, 2016, Party K attended in-person due diligence sessions with members of management, and on
September 1, 2016 was provided access to the data room to evaluate participating in a potential acquisition of Blue Nile. On
September 8, 2016, representatives of Bow Street contacted Mr. Kanter to inform him that Party K had declined to participate in a
potential transaction, citing their difficulty in justifying a premium to Blue Nile’s then current stock price.

On August 1 and 2, 2016, the Board of Directors held regularly scheduled meetings. The August 2, 2016 meeting included an
executive session with only the independent directors in attendance. At these meetings, the Board of Directors discussed the terms of
the proposal from Bow Street, including a discussion of the proposed offer price, as well as strategies and methods by which the Board
of Directors may be able to extract a higher offer price from Bow Street. The Board of Directors also discussed Blue Nile’s short- and
long-term initiatives and the benefits and risks in pursuing Blue Nile’s strategic plan on a stand-alone basis. In connection with its
review of Blue Nile’s strategic plan, the Board of Directors also reviewed financial projections prepared by Blue Nile’s management
(as described further below under the heading “—Management Projections”). After discussion, the Board of Directors authorized
management to continue discussions with Bow Street regarding the terms of a potential transaction and instructed management to
provide Bow Street and its potential equity partners with further due diligence materials. The Board of Directors also discussed Blue
Nile’s second quarter financial results, including a comparison to Blue Nile’s forecast, budget and analyst expectations, as well as the
industry and competitive landscape.

On the morning of August 8, 2016, Blue Nile announced its second quarter 2016 financial results. Such announcement stated that
net sales increased to $113.8 million for the second quarter ended July 3, 2016 compared to $113.7 million for the second quarter
ended July 5, 2015; operating income for the quarter totaled $3.3 million, representing an operating margin of 2.9% of net sales,
compared to $3.4 million in operating income and 3.0% operating margin for the second quarter 2015; net income totaled $2.1 million,
or $0.18 per diluted share versus $2.3 million, or $0.20 per diluted share for the second quarter 2015; and adjusted EBITDA for the
quarter totaled $5.6 million compared to $5.7 million for the second quarter 2015. The closing stock price of the Company Common
Stock was $29.62 per share on this date, a decline of 1.4% from the closing price of Common Stock of $30.04 on the previous trading

Throughout September 2016 and October 2016, the Investor Group continued to engage in its due diligence review of Blue Nile.

On September 13, 2016, after consulting with members of the Board of Directors, including lead independent director Ms. Meads
and Mr. Potter, Mr. Kanter had a telephonic meeting with the Investor Group regarding the due diligence process and to discuss the
potential transaction process timeline. In the course of this discussion, Mr. Kanter noted that the prior June 22, 2016 offer of $35.00 per
share in cash would not be of interest to the Board of Directors and that without an offer of at least $40.00 per share, it was unlikely
that the Board of Directors would be willing to continue discussions with the Investor Group or continue to provide them access to due
diligence materials, and that the offer price would likely have to be above $45.00 to ultimately be of interest to the Board of Directors.

On September 16, 2016, Blue Nile received a non-binding written indication of interest from the Investor Group, proposing an
acquisition price of $40.00 per share in cash. The proposal indicated that it was subject to finalizing legal and accounting due diligence.
Further, the proposal described the Investor Group’s expectation that the parties would proceed on an exclusive basis during this
process, and a proposed exclusivity agreement was provided to Blue Nile. The closing stock price of the Company Common Stock was
$35.99 per share on this date. On September 16, 2016, Mr. Kanter contacted each individual member of the Board of Directors to
discuss this indication of interest from the Investor Group.

On September 17, 2016, the Board of Directors held a telephonic meeting. At this meeting, Mr. Kanter updated the Board of
Directors on recent developments in the discussions with the Investor Group, including the due diligence process and a potential
transaction timeline. The Board of Directors then discussed the terms of the proposal from the Investor Group, including a discussion
of the proposed offer price, as well as various strategies and methods by which the Board of Directors might seek to maximize
stockholder value. The Board of Directors also discussed the possibility of entering into negotiations on an exclusive basis to extract
additional value, and ultimately decided to not enter into any exclusive arrangements with potential acquirers at this time. The Board of
Directors also discussed Blue Nile’s short- and long-term initiatives and the potential opportunities and risks in pursuing Blue Nile’s
strategic plan on a stand-alone basis. During the course of this meeting, Mr. Kanter confirmed that he and other members of
management had not engaged in any conversations with the Investor Group or any other party about potential post-transaction
employment arrangements. The Board of Directors also discussed the valuation of Blue Nile, including the price ranges at which it
would be willing to continue discussions with the Investor Group, and viewed Mr. Kanter as being in the best position to continue price
negotiations based on his rapport with representatives of the Investor Group. The Board of Directors then instructed Mr. Kanter to
convey the Board of Directors’ response to the Investor Group’s latest proposal.

On September 17, 2016, Mr. Kanter contacted representatives of the Investor Group and, as instructed by the Board of Directors,
conveyed that the price of $40.00 per share would only be considered as the beginning of price negotiations and that a price in excess
of $45.00 per share would be preferable to the Board of Directors.

On September 19, 2016, the Investor Group distributed to Blue Nile, through representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch, a
presentation further explaining their offer and their valuation as set forth in the September 16, 2016 indication of interest. Later on
September 19, 2016, representatives of the Investor Group and representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch discussed the valuation
presentation and various process related matters.

On September 20 and 21, 2016, representatives of the Investor Group and management held in-person meetings, with Party H
attending, where they discussed various matters, including Blue Nile’s business prospects.

On September 23, 2016, the Board of Directors held a telephonic meeting, with representatives of Wilson Sonsini Goodrich and
Rosati (“WSGR”), Blue Nile’s outside legal advisors, and representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch in attendance. At this meeting, the
Board of Directors discussed, after consultation with management and representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch, the terms of the proposal
from the Investor Group, including a discussion

of the proposed offer price, as well as various strategies and methods by which the Board of Directors might seek to maximize
stockholder value. In the course of this discussion, representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch informed the Board of Directors of their
prior conversation with the Investor Group regarding the Investor Group’s valuation presentation. The Board of Directors also
discussed, after consultation with management and representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch, Blue Nile’s short- and long-term initiatives
and the potential opportunities and risks in pursuing Blue Nile’s strategic plan on a stand-alone basis. After deliberation, the Board of
Directors authorized management and representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch to continue negotiating the terms of a potential
transaction with the Investor Group and to continue the due diligence process with the Investor Group, but instructed Mr. Kanter to
indicate that the Board of Directors preferred a higher price. Following this meeting, Mr. Kanter contacted representatives of the
Investor Group to convey the Board of Directors’ position.

On September 26, 2016, representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch delivered to the Board of Directors a supplemental disclosure
letter regarding certain information concerning BofA Merrill Lynch’s material relationships with the Investor Group.

On September 27, 2016, the Board of Directors held a telephonic meeting, with representatives of WSGR and representatives of
BofA Merrill Lynch in attendance. This meeting included an executive session with only the independent directors in attendance. At
this meeting, representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch presented a public market and historical stock performance overview. WSGR then
reviewed with the Board of Directors its fiduciary duties, including the legal framework in which the Board of Directors should
consider any proposal that may be received from a potential acquirer in light of deal execution risks and Blue Nile’s stand-alone
operations and prospects. During the course of this meeting, Mr. Kanter confirmed that he and other members of management had not
engaged in any conversations with the Investor Group or any other party about potential post-transaction employment arrangements.
The Board of Directors then discussed various strategies and methods by which the Board of Directors might seek to maximize
stockholder value, including the parameters of the market check process. Among the topics discussed were the desire to move quickly
to a negotiated agreement, the ability of other parties to conduct due diligence on a competitive timeline, and the likely level of interest
by other parties in light of the outreach in the summer of 2015 that resulted in no indications of interest. Mr. Binder, Blue Nile’s Chief
Financial Officer, then led the Board of Directors in a discussion of the Management Projections (as defined and described further
below under the heading “—Management Projections”) and the Upside Case (as defined and described below under the heading “—
Management Projections—Sensitivity Cases”) for long-term planning and valuation purposes. Following this discussion, the Board of
Directors determined that the Management Projections were the best currently available estimates and good faith judgments of
management and the Board of Directors as to the future financial performance of Blue Nile, and instructed representatives BofA
Merrill Lynch to use the Management Projections for the purpose of performing its preliminary financial analysis. The Board of
Directors also instructed management to create a comparably plausible downside sensitivity case (as compared to the Upside Case) for
long-term planning and valuation purposes (described below under the heading “—Management Projections—Sensitivity Cases” as the
“Downside Case”) in order to provide the Board of Directors with a balanced view of the illustrative Sensitivity Cases. The Board of
Directors instructed representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch to include, solely for illustrative purposes, an appendix to its preliminary
financial analysis with the sensitivity cases consisting of both the Downside Case and the Upside Case.

On September 29, 2016, the Board of Directors held a telephonic meeting, with representatives of WSGR and representatives of
BofA Merrill Lynch attending. This meeting included an executive session with only the independent directors and WSGR in
attendance. Representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch reviewed with the Board of Directors its preliminary financial analysis of the
Investor Group’s revised proposal to acquire Blue Nile at a price of $40.00 per share in cash. The Board of Directors then continued its
discussion regarding various strategies and methods by which the Board of Directors might seek to maximize stockholder value,
including the parameters of the market check process. The Board of Directors also discussed deal execution risks and Blue Nile’s
stand-alone operations and prospects and considered whether it was the appropriate time to continue discussions regarding a potential
sale of Blue Nile. At this meeting the Board of Directors also discussed the September 26, 2016 disclosure letter from BofA Merrill
Lynch, both with representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch and without representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch in attendance during such
discussion.

Merrill Lynch.

On October 7, 2016, representatives of the Investor Group sent a preliminary accounting and legal due diligence request list to
representatives of Blue Nile.

On October 13, 2016, representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch contacted the Investor Group to request the submission by the
Investor Group of an updated proposal, as instructed by the Board of Directors. As of October 14, Mr. Kanter was no longer involved
in any direct negotiations with the Investor Group and all negotiations and conversations regarding price and other key deal terms were
between representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch, acting at the direction of the Board of Directors, and the Investor Group.

On October 14, 2016, Blue Nile received a revised non-binding written indication of interest from the Investor Group, proposing
an acquisition price of $38.50 per share in cash. The indication of interest indicated that the decrease in the proposed acquisition price
from the September 16, 2016 offer of $40.00 per share reflected the weak financial trajectory of Blue Nile, including continued year-
on-year revenue declines over the past four quarters through the third fiscal quarter of 2016. The closing stock price of the Company
Common Stock was $35.43 per share on this date. Further, the proposal described the Investor Group’s expectation that the parties
would proceed on an exclusive basis during this process, and a proposed exclusivity agreement was provided to Blue Nile.

On October 14, 2016, the Board of Directors held a telephonic meeting to review the revised indication of interest from the
Investor Group, with representatives of WSGR and representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch in attendance. This meeting included an
executive session with only the independent directors in attendance. At this meeting, Mr. Binder updated the Board of Directors on
Blue Nile’s third quarter 2016 financial results. In addition, at this meeting, representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch reviewed with the
Board of Directors its preliminary financial analysis, which had been updated to reflect the current market and the latest proposal from
the Investor Group, relating to Blue Nile. The Board of Directors discussed negotiation strategies in the ongoing discussions with the
Investor Group and the strategies and methods by which the Board of Directors might seek to maximize stockholder value. These
discussions included the possibility of contacting additional parties to gauge their interest in pursuing a potential acquisition of Blue
Nile, which, after discussion, the Board of Directors decided not to do at this time. These discussions also included the possibility of
agreeing to negotiate on an exclusive basis to extract additional value, which, after discussion, the Board of Directors decided not to do
at this time. In addition, following discussion, the Board of Directors authorized lead independent director, Ms. Meads, to formally
execute an engagement letter with BofA Merrill Lynch.

On October 16, 2016, representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch had discussions with members of the Board of Directors, including
lead independent director Ms. Meads, to discuss process and the Investor Group’s latest proposal. On October 16, 2016, representatives
of BofA Merrill Lynch, at the instruction of the Board of Directors, contacted the Investor Group to discuss the terms of their latest
proposal. During this call, representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch conveyed the Board of Directors’ response to the Investor Group’s
latest proposal. Later on October 16, 2016, representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch received an oral confirmation of a revised indication
of interest from the Investor Group, proposing an acquisition price of $39.50 per share in cash. The closing stock price of the Company
Common Stock was $35.43 per share on October 14, 2016, the last trading day before this date.

On October 17, 2016, Blue Nile formally engaged BofA Merrill Lynch by executing an engagement letter.

On October 17, 2016, the Board of Directors held a telephonic meeting to review the revised indication of interest from the

analysis, which had been updated to reflect the current market and the latest proposal from the Investor Group relating to Blue Nile.
The Board of Directors discussed negotiation strategies in the ongoing discussions with the Investor Group and the strategies and
methods by which the Board of Directors might seek to maximize stockholder value, including the parameters of the market check
process. This discussion included deliberation about whether the Board of Directors may be able to extract a higher offer price from the
Investor Group by agreeing to negotiate with the Investor Group on an exclusive basis. In light of the Investor Group’s recent reduction
in its proposed price, the Board of Directors decided to conduct a targeted market check to determine if any other possible bidders for
Blue Nile might have interest in Blue Nile at the price above the Investor Group’s latest proposal. As part of this discussion regarding
the market check process, the Board of Directors evaluated each possible acquirer, including Party E, Party G and Party L, an e-
commerce company. Following this discussion and taking into account its discussions with representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch, and
in light of the prior outreach in the summer of 2015 to a total of thirteen strategic buyers and one financial sponsor, none of which
submitted any indication of interest, the Board of Directors instructed representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch to conduct a targeted
outreach to the three strategic buyers that, in the view of the Board of Directors, were most likely to be interested in a potential
transaction. The Board of Directors also determined that it would not agree to negotiate with the Investor Group on an exclusive basis
at this time so that it could continue its outreach to these potential buyers as part of its targeted market check pre-signing to confirm
that the Investor Group’s offer continued to be higher than Blue Nile could reasonably expect from other potential buyers.

Commencing on October 17, 2016, as instructed by the Board of Directors, representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch contacted
representatives of Party E, Party G and Party L. At this time, as instructed by the Board of Directors, representatives of BofA Merrill
Lynch also contacted the Investor Group and conveyed the Board of Directors’ continuing position that the Board of Directors
preferred a higher per share price than what was included in the Investor Group’s latest proposal.

On October 17, 2016, representatives of Party E contacted representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch, and indicated that Party E was
not interested in an acquisition of Blue Nile, citing, among other reasons, that Party E was unable to justify the EBITDA multiples
implied by a transaction in the price range being considered.

On October 17, 2016, representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch received oral confirmation of a further revised indication of interest
from the Investor Group, proposing an acquisition price of $40.25 per share in cash. The closing stock price of the Company Common
Stock was $35.16 per share on this date.

On October 18, 2016, the Board of Directors held a telephonic meeting to review the revised indication of interest from the
Investor Group, with representatives of WSGR and representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch attending. Representatives of BofA Merrill
Lynch provided an update to the Board of Directors regarding the most recent proposals received from the Investor group. This
meeting included an executive session with only the independent directors in attendance. After discussion, the Board of Directors
concluded that there did not appear to be any other parties with a likely interest in acquiring Blue Nile that had not already been
contacted. The Board of Directors then discussed strategies to achieve the highest price obtainable in the ongoing negotiations with the
Investor Group, including the possibility of agreeing to exclusive negotiations, and determined to convey to the Investor Group that the
Board of Directors would carefully consider a transaction if the Investor Group raised their price to at or above $40.50 per share in
cash.

Later on the evening of October 18, 2016, representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch and the Investor Group discussed the proposed
acquisition price, in accordance with the Board of Directors’ instructions. Representatives of the Investor Group indicated orally that,
pending internal approvals, their final proposal would be to acquire Blue Nile for $40.75 per share in cash and that, assuming the
receipt of such internal approvals, a final indication of interest would follow the next day.

On October 19, 2016, representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch received confirmation from the Investor Group of a final proposed
acquisition price of $40.75 per share in cash, and substantially communicated the receipt of the Investor Group’s final proposal to the
Board of Directors. The closing stock price of the Company Common Stock was $35.46 per share on this date.

On October 19, 2016, representatives of the Investor Group sent additional due diligence request lists to representatives of Blue
Nile. On October 19, 2016, representatives of the Investor Group, Blue Nile, WSGR and Kirkland & Ellis LLP (“Kirkland”), outside
counsel to the Investor Group, and representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch held a due diligence process call, after which Blue Nile
began to populate the online data room with additional information regarding Blue Nile in response to these requests.

On October 20, 2016, representatives of Party G contacted representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch, and indicated that Party G was
not interested in exploring a possible acquisition of Blue Nile, citing, among other reasons, that such a transaction was not a strategic
focus of Party G.

On October 20, 2016, representatives of Party L contacted representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch, and indicated that Party L was
not interested in exploring a possible acquisition of Blue Nile, citing, among other reasons, concerns over Blue Nile’s growth profile.

On October 24, 2016, Kirkland delivered an initial draft of the Merger Agreement to WSGR, which included a proposed go-shop
period of 30 days. Over the next several days, WSGR, in consultation with the Board of Directors, exchanged drafts and negotiated the
terms of the Merger Agreement with Kirkland, with a significant focus on the terms of the agreement relating to closing certainty
(including certainty of the Investor Group’s financing), the length of the go-shop period and provisions relating to Blue Nile’s ability to
entertain and accept superior acquisition proposals that it might receive during the pendency of the transaction (including the
termination fees and expense reimbursements that could become payable by Blue Nile in certain circumstances). In addition, over the
next several days, the parties had several discussions regarding the confirmatory due diligence of the Investor Group.

On October 29, 2016, representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch and representatives of the Investor Group held a telephonic meeting
to discuss the progress of the Investor Group’s due diligence review and to discuss process and a potential transaction timeline.
Following this call, representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch held a telephonic meeting with lead independent director, Ms. Meads, and
provided an update on these recent discussions with the Investor Group.

On November 1 and November 2, 2016, the Board of Directors held regularly scheduled meetings, during which the Board of
Directors considered the terms of the proposed transaction, with members of management and representatives of WSGR and
representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch attending the November 2, 2016 meeting. The November 2, 2016 meeting included an executive
session with only the independent directors in attendance. At this meeting, WSGR reviewed the key terms of the latest draft Merger
Agreement, including with respect to closing conditions, the definition of “material adverse effect”, financing matters, the length of the
go-shop period, which would allow for a post-signing market check in addition to the pre-signing process Blue Nile had undergone
since 2015, alternative acquisition proposals, termination, termination fees, expense reimbursement and remedies, which had not yet
been finalized. WSGR also reviewed with the Board of Directors a proposed amendment to Blue Nile’s bylaws adopting a forum
selection clause. After this review, the Board of Directors provided feedback and direction on the remaining unresolved issues in the
latest draft Merger Agreement and instructed WSGR to seek to finalize these issues in accordance with its guidance. Later on
November 2, 2016, WSGR delivered a revised draft of the Merger Agreement to Kirkland, including, among other provisions, a 45-day
go-shop period.

On November 3, 2016, Kirkland delivered a revised draft of the Merger Agreement to WSGR. On November 4, 2016,

Merrill Lynch attending. This meeting included an executive session with only the independent directors in attendance. At this meeting,
WSGR reviewed the key terms of the latest draft Merger Agreement, including with respect to closing conditions, the definition of
“material adverse effect”, financing matters, the length of the go-shop period, alternative acquisition proposals, termination,
termination fees, expense reimbursement and remedies, which had not yet been finalized. Following this presentation, the Board of
Directors discussed the various terms of the Merger Agreement, including the length of the go-shop period. Representatives of BofA
Merrill Lynch then reviewed its revised financial analysis of the consideration to be received by Blue Nile stockholders pursuant to the
Merger Agreement. After these presentations, the Board of Directors provided feedback and direction on the remaining unresolved
issues in the Merger Agreement and instructed WSGR to seek to finalize these issues in accordance with its guidance. At this meeting
the Board of Directors also discussed the November 3, 2016 disclosure letter from BofA Merrill Lynch. On November 5, 2016, WSGR
delivered a revised draft of the Merger Agreement to Kirkland.

On November 5, 2016, representatives of the Investor Group contacted representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch to discuss the
proposed transaction. The Investor Group indicated that Blue Nile’s business fundamentals continued to weaken in their view and that
the debt financing market was weaker than they expected, which increased their cost of financing and lowered their expected returns.
The Investor Group then explored the possibility of re-opening discussions regarding price and timing and communicated that it would
be challenging for them to proceed above a price of $38.00 per share. Representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch stated that they would
need to report any revised offer to the Board of Directors but that, based on their discussions with the Board of Directors, they did not
expect the Board of Directors to be interested in a transaction below the previous proposed acquisition price. Following this call,
representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch held a telephonic meeting with lead independent director, Ms. Meads, and provided an update
on these recent discussions with the Investor Group.

On the morning of November 6, 2016, representatives of the Investor Group contacted representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch to
orally affirm the prior offer price of $40.75 per share. The representatives of the Investor Group noted, however, that they had limited
flexibility on the remaining issues in the Merger Agreement at that price. Kirkland and WSGR negotiated to resolve the remaining
open issues in the Merger Agreement.

Later on the morning of November 6, 2016, the Board of Directors held a telephonic meeting to consider the terms of the
proposed transaction, with members of management and representatives of WSGR and representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch
attending. At this meeting, representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch updated the Board of Directors on its conversations with the Investor
Group from the prior evening. WSGR then reviewed the key terms of the latest draft Merger Agreement, including with respect to
closing conditions, the definition of “material adverse effect”, financing matters, the length of the go-shop period, alternative
acquisition proposals, termination, termination fees, expense reimbursement and remedies, which had not yet been finalized. After
these presentations, the Board of Directors provided feedback and direction on the remaining unresolved issues in the Merger
Agreement and instructed WSGR to seek to finalize these issues in accordance with its guidance. The Board of Directors decided to
reconvene later in the morning to further consider the terms of the proposed transaction.

Later on the morning of November 6, 2016, the Board of Directors held a subsequent telephonic meeting to further consider the
terms of the proposed transaction, with members of management and representatives of WSGR and representatives of BofA Merrill
Lynch attending. At this meeting, representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch reviewed their latest disclosure letter from November 3, 2016
and led the Board of Directors through a review of the fees paid to BofA Merrill Lynch by the Investor Group. Representatives of
BofA Merrill Lynch then reviewed its financial analysis of the Per Share Price and delivered to the Board of Directors an oral opinion,
which was confirmed by the subsequent delivery of a written opinion dated November 6, 2016, to the effect that, as of that date and
based upon and subject to various assumptions and limitations described in its opinion, the Per Share Price to be received in the Merger
by holders of Company Common Stock (other than Owned Company Shares and Dissenting Company Shares), was fair, from a
financial point of view, to such holders. For more

information about BofA Merrill Lynch’s opinion, see the section of this proxy statement below captioned “—Opinion of Merrill Lynch,
Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated”. At this meeting the Board of Directors also discussed the November 3, 2016 disclosure letter
from BofA Merrill Lynch. After discussing potential reasons for and against the proposed transaction (see below under the heading “—
Recommendation of the Board of Directors and Reasons for the Merger), the Board of Directors unanimously (1) determined that it is
in the best interests of Blue Nile and Blue Nile’s stockholders, and declared it advisable, to enter into the Merger Agreement and
consummate the Merger upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, (2) approved the execution and delivery of the
Merger Agreement by Blue Nile, the performance by Blue Nile of its covenants and other obligations under the Merger Agreement,
and the consummation of the Merger upon the terms and conditions set forth therein, and (3) recommended that Blue Nile’s
stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement in accordance with the DGCL. In addition, after discussion, the Board of Directors also
unanimously determined that the proposed amendment to Blue Nile’s bylaws adopting a forum selection clause was advisable and in
the best interests of Blue Nile and its stockholders, finding that it would mitigate the expense associated with defending cases in
multiple forums, the difficulties in managing litigation brought by multiple plaintiffs’ firms concerning the same set of facts, the ability
of plaintiffs to “shop” between favorable forums and the risks associated with multiple inconsistent outcomes. Accordingly, the Board
of Directors approved the resolution to amend the bylaws to include a forum selection clause.

Later in the day on November 6, 2016, the Board of Directors held another telephonic meeting, with members of management
and representatives of WSGR and representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch attending. Representatives of WSGR described the final draft
of the Merger Agreement, which included certain revisions to the interim operating covenants. The Board of Directors then confirmed
its approval of the final draft of the Merger Agreement and the proposed transaction.

On November 6, 2016, Parent, Merger Sub and the Investor Group also approved the Merger Agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby, including the Merger.

On the evening of November 6, 2016, Blue Nile, Parent and Merger Sub executed the Merger Agreement. Following the
execution of the Merger Agreement, on the morning of November 7, 2016, Blue Nile issued a press release announcing the transaction.

On the morning of November 7, 2016, following the issuance of the press release announcing the transaction and at the
instruction of the Board of Directors, representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch commenced the go-shop process in accordance with the
go-shop provisions in the Merger Agreement.

Also on the morning of November 7, 2016, Blue Nile announced its third quarter 2016 financial results. Such announcement
stated that net sales decreased to $105.1 million for the third quarter ended October 2, 2016 compared to $109.9 million for the third
quarter ended October 4, 2015; operating income for the quarter totaled $1.8 million, representing an operating margin of 1.7% of net
sales, compared to $3.0 million in operating income and 2.8% operating margin for the third quarter 2015; net income totaled $1.3
million, or $0.11 per diluted share versus $2.0 million, or $0.17 per diluted share for the third quarter 2015; and adjusted EBITDA for
the quarter totaled $4.2 million compared to $5.3 million for the third quarter 2015.

After the public announcement of the transaction, Bow Street contacted the potential equity partners who had declined to
participate in the Investor Group, including Party K, and informed them that, for the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding any prior
arrangements or understandings between them and Bow Street, they were free to participate in the go-shop process and submit an
alternative proposal to acquire Blue Nile.

During the go-shop period, at the direction and under the supervision of the Board of Directors, representatives of BofA Merrill
Lynch contacted parties that, in the view of the Board of Directors, might be capable of, and might be interested in, pursuing an
acquisition of Blue Nile. During the go-shop period, and at the direction of the Board of Directors, representatives of BofA Merrill
Lynch contacted a total of 31 parties, including 21 strategic parties and 10 financial sponsors, to solicit their interest in a possible
acquisition of Blue Nile.

Of the 31 parties contacted by representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch, 6 parties executed confidentiality agreements and were
granted access to certain non-public information regarding Blue Nile. Certain of the parties that executed confidentiality agreements
asked diligence questions of, and received answers from, Blue Nile and engaged in additional discussion with representatives of BofA
Merrill Lynch. On November 18, 2016, Party M, a group of investors in Blue Nile, attended in-person meetings in Seattle with
management to discuss Blue Nile’s business and a possible acquisition of Blue Nile and was given access to the data room. On
November 28, 2016, representatives of Party M contacted representatives of Blue Nile and representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch to
indicate that they were unable to justify a purchase price above the Per Share Price. None of the 31 parties contacted, nor any other
party, has submitted an alternative acquisition proposal to Blue Nile as of the date of this proxy statement.

Recommendation of the Board of Directors and Reasons for the Merger

Recommendation of the Board of Directors

The Board of Directors has unanimously (1) determined that it is in the best interests of Blue Nile and Blue Nile’s stockholders,
and declared it advisable, to enter into the Merger Agreement and consummate the Merger upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth therein; (2) approved the execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement by Blue Nile, the performance by Blue Nile of its
covenants and other obligations thereunder, and the consummation of the Merger upon the terms and conditions set forth therein; and
(3) recommended that Blue Nile’s stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement in accordance with the DGCL.

The Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote (1) “FOR” the adoption of the Merger Agreement; (2) “FOR”
the proposal to postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there
are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Company Stockholder Meeting; and (3) “FOR” the proposal to
approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, certain compensation that will or may become payable by Blue Nile to its named executive
officers in connection with the Merger.

Reasons for the Merger

In evaluating the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the Board of
Directors consulted with management, its financial advisors and outside legal counsel. In recommending that stockholders vote in favor
of the adoption of the Merger Agreement, the Board of Directors considered a number of factors, including the following (which
factors are not necessarily presented in order of relative importance):
 

 
•  the fact that the all-cash Per Share Price would provide certainty of value and liquidity to stockholders, while eliminating the

effect of long-term business and execution risk to stockholders;
 

 •  the relationship of the Per Share Price to the trading price of the Company Common Stock, including:
 

 
•  that the Per Share Price constituted a premium of approximately 33.9% from the closing stock price per share of

Company Common Stock of $30.44 on November 4, 2016, the last trading day prior to the execution of the Merger
Agreement;

 

 
•  that the Per Share Price constituted a premium of approximately 16.8% and 19.1% from the average price per share of

Company Common Stock in the one-month period and three-month period, respectively, up to and including
November 4, 2016, the last trading day prior to the execution of the Merger Agreement; and

 

 
•  that the Per Share Price constituted a premium of approximately 53.9% from the closing stock price per share of

Company Common Stock on June 22, 2016, the day Bow Street submitted its first non-binding indication of interest
with respect to a potential strategic transaction;

 

 •  the recent and historical market prices of the Company Common Stock;

 •  the financial terms of selected precedent transactions of comparable size to the Merger;

Agreement;

operations, financial prospects and condition;

•  the Board of Directors’ evaluation of Blue Nile’s historical financial performance as well as its projected stand-alone

financial performance embodied in the Management Projections;
 

 

•  the perceived risk of continuing as an independent public company or pursuing other alternatives, including (1) the
continuation of Blue Nile’s business plan as an independent enterprise; (2) modifications to Blue Nile’s strategy; and
(3) potential expansion opportunities into new business lines through acquisitions and combinations of Blue Nile with other
businesses;

alternatives were not reasonably likely to create greater value for stockholders than the Merger, taking into account
execution risk as well as business, competitive, industry and market risk;

 

 •  the review of Blue Nile’s strategic and financial alternatives, including:
 

 
•  that Blue Nile’s financial advisors had previously contacted a total of thirteen strategic buyers and one financial

sponsors beginning in the summer of 2015, and each either declined to proceed with an evaluation of a potential
strategic transaction, or declined to submit a transaction proposal for Blue Nile;

 

 
•  that Blue Nile’s financial advisors had recently contacted a total of three strategic buyers in an effort to obtain the best

value reasonably available to stockholders and each either declined to proceed with an evaluation of a potential
strategic transaction, or declined to submit a transaction proposal for Blue Nile; and

fairness, from a financial point of view and as of the date of the opinion, of the Per Share Price to be received in the Merger
by holders of Company Common Stock (other than Owned Company Shares and Dissenting Company Shares), as more fully
described below in the section of this proxy statement captioned “—Opinion of Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith
Incorporated”

 

 •  the terms of the Merger Agreement and the related agreements, including:

payments contemplated by, and subject to the terms and conditions of, the Merger Agreement, and that Blue Nile is a
named third party beneficiary of the Equity Commitment Letter;

 

 
•  Blue Nile’s ability during a go-shop period to actively solicit alternative proposals, and Blue Nile’s ability, under

certain other circumstances after the go-shop period, to furnish information to and conduct negotiations with an
Excluded Party regarding alternative acquisition proposals;

 

 

•  Blue Nile’s ability to terminate the Merger Agreement in order to accept a Superior Proposal, subject to Parent’s right
to match such Superior Proposal and subject to paying Parent (x) a termination fee of $7.4 million, with respect to
Blue Nile entering into an alternative acquisition agreement with an Excluded Party on or prior to the Cut-Off Date or
(y) a termination fee of $17.4 million if payable otherwise;

•  Blue Nile’s entitlement to specific performance to cause the equity financing to be funded if the Marketing Period has
ended, all conditions in the Merger Agreement have been satisfied, the debt financing has been or will be funded at

funded, then the Closing will occur;

 

 •  Blue Nile’s entitlement to specific performance to prevent breaches of the Merger Agreement;
 

 

•  Blue Nile’s entitlement to a reverse termination fee from Parent of $32.2 million if (i) the Closing does not occur
within five business days of the first date Parent is required to close; (ii) all mutual, Merger Sub and Parent closing
conditions are satisfied at the Closing; (iii) Blue Nile has irrevocably notified Parent in writing that it is ready, willing
and able to close and that all of Blue Nile’s closing conditions are satisfied or waived; (iv) Blue Nile has given Parent
written notice five business days prior to termination stating Blue Nile’s intent to terminate the Merger Agreement if
Parent and Merger Sub fail to consummate the Merger; and (v) Parent and Merger Sub fail to close on the later of five

•  that the Merger is subject to the approval of the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares

of Company Common Stock entitled to vote;
 

 
•  the Board of Directors’ view that the Merger Agreement was the product of arm’s-length negotiation and contained

customary terms and conditions; and
 

 

•  the Board of Directors’ view that the terms of the Merger Agreement would be unlikely to deter interested third parties from
making a Superior Proposal, including the Merger Agreement’s terms and conditions as they relate to changes in the
recommendation of the Board of Directors and the belief that the termination fee potentially payable to Parent is reasonable
in light of the circumstances, and not preclusive of other offers (see the section of this proxy statement captioned “The
Merger Agreement—Other Covenants Under the Merger Agreement—Acquisition Proposals; Change in the
Recommendation of Blue Nile’s Board of Directors”).

The Board of Directors also considered a number of uncertainties and risks concerning the Merger, including the following
(which factors are not necessarily presented in order of relative importance):
 

 

•  the fact that the announcement and pendency of the Merger, or the failure to complete the Merger, could cause substantial
harm to Blue Nile’s relationships with its employees (including making it more difficult to attract and retain key personnel
and the possible loss of key management, technical, sales and other personnel), vendors, customers and commercial partners
and may divert management and employees’ attention away from Blue Nile’s day-to-day business operations;

 

 
•  the fact that stockholders will not participate in any future earnings or growth of Blue Nile and will not benefit from any

appreciation in value of Blue Nile, including any appreciation in value that could be realized as a result of improvements to
our operations or future strategic or other transactions by Blue Nile;

 

 

•  the requirement that Blue Nile pay Parent (x) a termination fee of $7.4 million, with respect to Blue Nile entering into an
alternative acquisition agreement with an Excluded Party on or prior to the Cut-Off Date or (y) a termination fee of $17.4
million in certain other circumstances, including if the Board of Directors terminates the Merger Agreement to accept a
Superior Proposal after the Cut-Off Date;

 

 

•  the requirement that Blue Nile pay Parent for its out-of-pocket expenses (including fees and expenses of the Financing
Sources, counsel, accountants, investment banks, advisors and consultants of Parent and Merger Sub) up to an aggregate of
$5.0 million, if the Merger Agreement is terminated due to the failure to consummate the Closing by 5:00 p.m., Eastern time,
on May 6, 2017 or the failure of Blue Nile’s stockholders to adopt the Merger Agreement at the Company Stockholder
Meeting;

•  the restrictions on the conduct of Blue Nile’s business prior to the consummation of the Merger, including the requirement
that Blue Nile conduct its business in the ordinary course, subject to specific limitations, which may delay or prevent Blue
Nile from undertaking business opportunities that may arise before the completion of the Merger and that, absent the Merger
Agreement, Blue Nile might have pursued;

 

 
•  the fact that an all cash transaction would be taxable to Blue Nile’s stockholders that are U.S. persons for U.S. federal

income tax purposes;
 

 
•  the fact that under the terms of the Merger Agreement, Blue Nile is unable to solicit other acquisition proposals after the Go-

Shop Period End Date during the pendency of the Merger;
 

 
•  the significant costs involved in connection with entering into the Merger Agreement and completing the Merger and the

substantial time and effort of management required to complete the Merger, which may disrupt Blue Nile’s business
operations;

 

 
•  the fact that Blue Nile’s business, sales operations and financial results could suffer in the event that the Merger is not

consummated;
 

 
•  the risk that the Merger might not be completed and the effect of the resulting public announcement of termination of the

Merger Agreement on the trading price of the Company Common Stock;
 

 •  the fact that the completion of the Merger will require antitrust clearance in the United States and certain other countries; and
 

 
•  the fact that Blue Nile’s directors and officers may have interests in the Merger that may be different from, or in addition to,

those of Blue Nile’s other stockholders (see below in the section of this proxy statement captioned “—Interests of Blue Nile’s
Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger”).

The foregoing discussion is not meant to be exhaustive, but summarizes many, if not all, of the material factors considered by the
Board of Directors in its consideration of the Merger. After considering these and other factors, the Board of Directors concluded that
the potential benefits of the Merger outweighed the uncertainties and risks. In view of the variety of factors considered by the Board of
Directors and the complexity of these factors, the Board of Directors did not find it practicable to, and did not, quantify or otherwise
assign relative weights to the foregoing factors in reaching its determination and recommendations. Moreover, each member of the
Board of Directors applied his or her own personal business judgment to the process and may have assigned different weights to
different factors. The Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement,
based upon the totality of the information presented to and considered by the Board of Directors.

Opinion of Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated

Blue Nile has retained BofA Merrill Lynch to act as Blue Nile’s financial advisor in connection with the Merger. BofA Merrill
Lynch is an internationally recognized investment banking firm which is regularly engaged in the valuation of businesses and securities
in connection with mergers and acquisitions, negotiated underwritings, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private
placements and valuations for corporate and other purposes. Blue Nile selected BofA Merrill Lynch to act as Blue Nile’s financial
advisor in connection with the Merger on the basis of BofA Merrill Lynch’s experience in transactions similar to the Merger, its
reputation in the investment community and its familiarity with Blue Nile and its business.

On November 6, 2016, at a meeting of the Board of Directors held to evaluate the Merger, BofA Merrill Lynch delivered to the
Board of Directors an oral opinion, which was confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated November 6, 2016, to the effect that,
as of the date of the opinion and based on and subject to various assumptions and limitations described in its opinion, the Per Share
Price to be received in the Merger by holders of Company Common Stock (other than Owned Company Shares and Dissenting
Company Shares) was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.

The full text of BofA Merrill Lynch’s written opinion to the Board of Directors, which describes, among other things, the
assumptions made, procedures followed, factors considered and limitations on the review undertaken, is attached as Annex B
to this document and is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. The following summary of BofA Merrill Lynch’s
opinion is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the opinion. BofA Merrill Lynch delivered its opinion to the
Board of Directors for the benefit and use of the Board of Directors (in its capacity as such) in connection with and for
purposes of its evaluation of the Per Share Price from a financial point of view. BofA Merrill Lynch’s opinion does not address
any other aspect of the Merger and no opinion or view was expressed as to the relative merits of the Merger in comparison to
other strategies or transactions that might be available to Blue Nile or in which Blue Nile might engage or as to the underlying
business decision of Blue Nile to proceed with or effect the Merger. BofA Merrill Lynch’s opinion does not address any other
aspect of the Merger and does not constitute a recommendation to any stockholder as to how to vote or act in connection with
the proposed Merger or any related matter.

In connection with rendering its opinion, BofA Merrill Lynch:
 

 (i) reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information relating to Blue Nile;
 

 

(ii) reviewed certain internal financial and operating information with respect to the business, operations and prospects of Blue
Nile furnished to or discussed with BofA Merrill Lynch by the management of Blue Nile, including certain base case
financial forecasts relating to Blue Nile prepared by the management of Blue Nile (such forecasts, “Management
Projections”) and, for reference purposes only, certain growth case financial forecasts relating to Blue Nile prepared by the
management of Blue Nile (such forecasts, the “Upside Case”) and certain downside case financial forecasts relating to Blue
Nile prepared by the management of Blue Nile (such forecasts, the “Downside Case” and, together with the Upside Case,
the “Sensitivity Cases”);

 

 
(iii) discussed the past and current business, operations, financial condition and prospects of Blue Nile with members of senior

management of Blue Nile;
 

 
(iv) reviewed the trading history for Company Common Stock and a comparison of that trading history with the trading

histories of other companies BofA Merrill Lynch deemed relevant;
 

 
(v) compared certain financial and stock market information of Blue Nile with similar information of other companies BofA

Merrill Lynch deemed relevant;
 

 
(vi) compared certain financial terms of the Merger to financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of other transactions

BofA Merrill Lynch deemed relevant;
 

 
(vii) considered the results of BofA Merrill Lynch’s efforts to solicit, at the direction of Blue Nile, indications of interest from

third parties with respect to a possible acquisition of Blue Nile;
 

 
(viii) reviewed a draft, dated November 5, 2016, of the Agreement (the “Draft Agreement”), and a draft, dated October 31, 2016,

of the limited guarantee executed by Bain Capital Fund XI in favor of Blue Nile (such limited guarantee, together with the
Agreement, the “Transaction Agreements” and, such drafts, the “Draft Transaction Agreements”); and

 

 
(ix) performed such other analyses and studies and considered such other information and factors as BofA Merrill Lynch

deemed appropriate.

In arriving at its opinion, BofA Merrill Lynch assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the accuracy and
completeness of the financial and other information and data publicly available or provided to or otherwise reviewed by or discussed
with it and relied upon the assurances of the management of Blue Nile that it was not aware of any facts or circumstances that would
make such information or data inaccurate or misleading in any material respect. With respect to the Management Projections and the
Sensitivity Cases, BofA Merrill Lynch was advised by Blue Nile, and assumed, that the Management Projections were reasonably
prepared on

bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and good faith judgments of the management of Blue Nile as to the future
financial performance of Blue Nile, and, at the direction of Blue Nile, BofA Merrill Lynch relied on the Management Projections for
purposes of its analyses and opinion. BofA Merrill Lynch did not make or was not provided with any independent evaluation or
appraisal of the assets or liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of Blue Nile, nor did it make any physical inspection of the properties or
assets of Blue Nile. BofA Merrill Lynch did not evaluate the solvency or fair value of Blue Nile or Parent under any state, federal or
other laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. BofA Merrill Lynch assumed, at the direction of Blue Nile, that the
Merger would be consummated in accordance with its terms, without waiver, modification or amendment of any material term,
condition or agreement and that, in the course of obtaining the necessary governmental, regulatory and other approvals, consents,
releases and waivers for the Merger, no delay, limitation, restriction or condition, including any divestiture requirements or
amendments or modifications, would be imposed that would have an adverse effect on Blue Nile, Parent or the contemplated benefits
of the Merger. BofA Merrill Lynch also assumed, at the direction of Blue Nile, that the final executed Transaction Agreements would
not differ in any material respect from the Draft Transaction Agreements reviewed by BofA Merrill Lynch.

BofA Merrill Lynch expressed no view or opinion as to any terms or other aspects of the Merger (other than the Per Share Price to
the extent expressly specified in its opinion), including, without limitation, the form or structure of the Merger. BofA Merrill Lynch’s
opinion was limited to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the Per Share Price to be received in the Merger by the holders of
Company Common Stock (other than Owned Company Shares and Dissenting Company Shares) and no opinion or view was
expressed with respect to any consideration received in connection with the Merger by the holders of any other class of securities,
creditors or other constituencies of any party. In addition, no opinion or view was expressed with respect to the fairness (financial or
otherwise) of the amount, nature or any other aspect of any compensation to any of the officers, directors or employees of any party to
the Merger, or class of such persons, relative to the Per Share Price. Furthermore, no opinion or view was expressed as to the relative
merits of the Merger in comparison to other strategies or transactions that might be available to Blue Nile or in which Blue Nile might
engage or as to the underlying business decision of Blue Nile to proceed with or effect the Merger. BofA Merrill Lynch did not express
any opinion as to the prices at which Company Common Stock would trade at any time, including following announcement or
consummation of the Merger. In addition, BofA Merrill Lynch expressed no opinion or recommendation as to how any stockholder
should vote or act in connection with the Merger or any related matter. Except as described above, Blue Nile imposed no other
limitations on the investigations made or procedures followed by BofA Merrill Lynch in rendering its opinion.

BofA Merrill Lynch’s opinion was necessarily based on financial, economic, monetary, market and other conditions and
circumstances as in effect on, and the information made available to BofA Merrill Lynch as of, the date of its opinion. It should be
understood that subsequent developments may affect its opinion, and BofA Merrill Lynch does not have any obligation to update,
revise or reaffirm its opinion. The issuance of BofA Merrill Lynch’s opinion was approved by a fairness opinion review committee of
BofA Merrill Lynch.

The discussion set forth below in the sections entitled “Selected Publicly Traded Companies Analysis,” “Selected Precedent
Transactions Analysis” and “Discounted Cash Flow Analysis” represents a brief summary of the material financial analyses presented
by BofA Merrill Lynch to the Board of Directors in connection with its opinion. The financial analyses summarized below include
information presented in tabular format. In order to fully understand the financial analyses performed by BofA Merrill Lynch,
the tables must be read together with the text of each summary. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the
financial analyses performed by BofA Merrill Lynch. Considering the data set forth in the tables below without considering the
full narrative description of the financial analyses, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying the analyses, could

Blue Nile Financial Analyses

Selected Publicly Traded Companies Analysis

BofA Merrill Lynch reviewed publicly available financial and stock market information for Blue Nile and the following 10
publicly traded companies in the eCommerce and jewelry retail industries:
 

 •  Cimpress N.V.
 

 •  Shutterfly, Inc.
 

 •  Overstock.com, Inc.
 

 •  U.S. Auto Parts Network, Inc.
 

 •  1-800-Flowers.com, Inc.
 

 •  PetMed Express, Inc.
 

 •  Groupon, Inc.
 

 •  FTD Companies, Inc.
 

 •  Tiffany & Co.
 

 •  Signet Jewelers Limited

BofA Merrill Lynch reviewed, among other things, enterprise values of the selected publicly traded companies, calculated as
equity values based on closing stock prices on November 4, 2016, plus debt and preferred stock and minority interests, less cash and
cash equivalents, as a multiple of calendar year 2017 estimated adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciations and amortization,
commonly referred to as adjusted EBITDA. BofA Merrill Lynch also reviewed the per share equity values of the selected publicly
traded companies, based on closing stock prices on November 4, 2016, as a multiple of calendar year 2017 estimated cash earnings per
share, and the market capitalization of the selected publicly traded companies, based on closing stock prices on November 4, 2016, as a
multiple of calendar year 2017 estimated free cash flow. BofA Merrill Lynch then applied (i) a range of enterprise value to adjusted
EBITDA multiples of 7.5x to 13.5x, based on the selected publicly traded companies, to Blue Nile’s calendar year 2017 estimated
adjusted EBITDA; (ii) a range of price to cash earnings per share multiples of 14.0x to 27.0x, based on the selected publicly traded
companies, to Blue Nile’s calendar year 2017 estimated cash earnings per share; and (iii) a range of price to free cash flow multiples of
10.0x to 20.0x, based on the selected publicly traded companies, to Blue Nile’s calendar year 2017 estimated free cash flow. Estimated
financial data of the selected publicly traded companies were based on publicly available research analysts’ estimates, and estimated
financial data of Blue Nile were based on the Management Projections. This analysis indicated the following approximate implied per
share equity value reference ranges for Blue Nile, rounded to the nearest $0.05, as compared to the Per Share Price:
 

Implied Per Share Equity Value Reference Ranges for Blue Nile  Per Share Price
(Based on Management Projections)   

EV/Adj. EBITDA  P/Cash EPS  P/FCF   
$20.25 - $33.70  $16.90 - $32.60  $18.00 - $35.85  $40.75

No company used in this analysis is identical or directly comparable to Blue Nile. Accordingly, an evaluation of the results of this
analysis is not entirely mathematical. Rather, this analysis involves complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in
financial and operating characteristics and other factors that could affect the public trading or other values of the companies to which
Blue Nile was compared.

BofA Merrill Lynch reviewed enterprise values as a multiple of the target company’s last twelve month and next twelve month
estimated revenue and adjusted EBITDA. BofA Merrill Lynch then applied last twelve month adjusted EBITDA multiples of 10.0x to
18.0x, derived from the selected transactions, to Blue Nile’s last twelve month adjusted EBITDA as of October 2, 2016. Estimated
financial data of the selected transactions were based on publicly available information at the time of announcement of the relevant
transaction. Estimated financial data of Blue Nile were based on the Management Projections. This analysis indicated the following
approximate implied per share equity value reference range for Blue Nile, rounded to the nearest $0.05, as compared to the Per Share
Price:

(Based on Management Projections)    

LTM Adj. EBITDA    
$22.70 - $37.95   $40.75

No company, business or transaction used in this analysis is identical or directly comparable to Blue Nile or the Merger.
Accordingly, an evaluation of the results of this analysis is not entirely mathematical. Rather, this analysis involves complex
considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and operating characteristics and other factors that could affect the
acquisition or other values of the companies, business segments or transactions to which Blue Nile and the Merger were compared.

Discounted Cash Flow Analysis

BofA Merrill Lynch performed a discounted cash flow analysis of Blue Nile to calculate the estimated present value of the
standalone unlevered, after-tax free cash flows that Blue Nile was forecasted to generate from Q4 2016 through calendar year 2021
based on the Management Projections. BofA Merrill Lynch calculated terminal values for Blue Nile by applying a range of perpetuity
growth rates of 3.0% to 4.0% to Blue Nile’s calendar year 2021 free cash flow. The free cash flows and terminal values were then
discounted to present value as of October 2, 2016 using discount rates ranging from 8.25% to 10.25%, which were based on an
estimate of Blue Nile’s weighted average cost of capital. This analysis indicated the following approximate implied per share equity
value reference range for Blue Nile, rounded to the nearest $0.05, as compared to the Per Share Price:

Other Factors

BofA Merrill Lynch also noted certain additional factors that were not considered part of BofA Merrill Lynch’s material financial
analyses with respect to its opinion but were referenced for informational purposes, including, among other things, the following:
 

 
•  historical trading prices of Company Common Stock and its performance relative to key market indices during the five-year

period ended November 4, 2016;
 

 
•  selected analyst revenue estimates, adjusted EBITDA estimates, and cash earnings per share estimates for calendar years

2016 and 2017 for Blue Nile found in recently published, publicly available Wall Street research analysts reports as of
November 4, 2016;

 

 
•  the premiums paid to the average pre-announcement stock price over a 1-month and 3-month period in selected precedent

transactions in the internet and technology industries since 2012; and
 

 

•  the illustrative range of per share equity values for Blue Nile derived by performing the analyses described above in the
section entitled “Selected Publicly Traded Companies Analysis” using estimated financial data of Blue Nile based on
publicly available Wall Street research analysts’ estimates for Blue Nile. This analysis indicated the following approximate
implied per share equity value reference ranges for Blue Nile, based on the following respective multiples: (i) EV/Adj.
EBITDA—$19.30 to $32.00; (ii) P/Cash EPS—$16.45 to $31.75; and (iii) P/FCF—$17.60 to $35.00.

Miscellaneous

As noted above, the discussion set forth above in the sections entitled “Selected Publicly Traded Companies Analysis,” “Selected
Precedent Transactions Analysis” and “Discounted Cash Flow Analysis” is a summary of the material financial analyses presented by
BofA Merrill Lynch to the Board of Directors in connection with its opinion and is not a comprehensive description of all analyses
undertaken by BofA Merrill Lynch in connection with its opinion. The preparation of a financial opinion is a complex analytical
process involving various determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant methods of financial analysis and the application of
those methods to the particular circumstances and, therefore, a financial opinion is not readily susceptible to partial analysis or
summary description. BofA Merrill Lynch believes that its analyses summarized above must be considered as a whole. BofA Merrill
Lynch further believes that selecting portions of its analyses and the factors considered or focusing on information presented in tabular
format, without considering all analyses and factors or the narrative description of the analyses, could create a misleading or
incomplete view of the processes underlying BofA Merrill Lynch’s analyses and opinion. The fact that any specific analysis has been
referred to in the summary above is not meant to indicate that such analysis was given greater weight than any other analysis referred
to in the summary.

Table of Contents

In performing its analyses, BofA Merrill Lynch considered industry performance, general business and economic conditions and
other matters, many of which are beyond the control of Blue Nile and Parent. The estimates of the future performance of Blue Nile in
or underlying BofA Merrill Lynch’s analyses are not necessarily indicative of actual values or actual future results, which may be
significantly more or less favorable than those estimates or those suggested by BofA Merrill Lynch’s analyses. These analyses were
prepared solely as part of BofA Merrill Lynch’s analysis of the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the Per Share Price and were
provided to the Board of Directors in connection with the delivery of BofA Merrill Lynch’s opinion. The analyses do not purport to be
appraisals or to reflect the prices at which a company might actually be sold or the prices at which any securities have traded or may
trade at any time in the future. Accordingly, the estimates used in, and the ranges of valuations resulting from, any particular analysis
described above are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty and should not be taken to be BofA Merrill Lynch’s view of the actual
values of Blue Nile.

The type and amount of consideration payable in the Merger was determined through negotiations between Blue Nile and Parent,
rather than by any financial advisor, and was approved by the Board of Directors. The decision to enter into the Merger Agreement was
solely that of the Board of Directors. As described above, BofA Merrill Lynch’s opinion and analyses were only one of many factors
considered by the Board of Directors in its evaluation of the proposed Merger and should not be viewed as determinative of the views
of the Board of Directors or management with respect to the Merger or the Per Share Price.

Blue Nile has agreed to pay BofA Merrill Lynch for its services in connection with the Merger an aggregate fee of approximately
$9 million, a portion of which was payable in connection with its opinion and a significant portion of which is contingent upon the
completion of the Merger. Blue Nile also has agreed to reimburse BofA Merrill Lynch for its expenses incurred in connection with
BofA Merrill Lynch’s engagement and to indemnify BofA Merrill Lynch, any of its affiliates, each of its and their respective directors,
officers, employees, agents and each other person controlling BofA Merrill Lynch or any of its affiliates against specified liabilities,
including liabilities under the federal securities laws.

BofA Merrill Lynch and its affiliates comprise a full service securities firm and commercial bank engaged in securities,
commodities and derivatives trading, foreign exchange and other brokerage activities, and principal investing as well as providing
investment, corporate and private banking, asset and investment management, financing and financial advisory services and other
commercial services and products to a wide range of companies, governments and individuals. In the ordinary course of their
businesses, BofA Merrill Lynch and its affiliates invest on a principal basis or on behalf of customers or manage funds that invest,
make or hold long or short positions, finance positions or trade or otherwise effect transactions in the equity, debt or other securities or
financial instruments (including derivatives, bank loans or other obligations) of Blue Nile, Parent and certain of their respective
affiliates.

BofA Merrill Lynch and its affiliates in the past have provided, currently are providing, and in the future may provide investment
banking, commercial banking and other financial services to Blue Nile and have received or in the future may receive compensation for
the rendering of these services, including having provided or providing certain treasury and/or trade management products and services
to Blue Nile. From October 1, 2014 to September 30, 2016, BofA Merrill Lynch and its affiliates derived aggregate revenues from Blue
Nile and its affiliates of approximately $1 million for investment and corporate banking services.

In addition, BofA Merrill Lynch and its affiliates in the past have provided, currently are providing, and in the future may provide
investment banking, commercial banking and other financial services to Bow Street LLC and have received or in the future may
receive compensation for the rendering of these services, including having provided or providing certain derivatives trading services to
Bow Street LLC. From October 1, 2014 to September 30, 2016, BofA Merrill Lynch and its affiliates derived aggregate revenues from
Bow Street LLC and its affiliates of approximately $200,000 for investment and corporate banking services.

In addition, BofA Merrill Lynch and its affiliates in the past have provided, currently are providing, and in the future may
provide, investment banking, commercial banking and other financial services to Bain Capital Private Equity, L.P. (“Bain Capital”) and
certain of its affiliates and portfolio companies and have received or in the future may receive compensation for the rendering of these
services, including (i) having acted or acting as financial advisor to Bain Capital and/or certain of its affiliates and portfolio companies
in connection with certain mergers and acquisition transactions, (ii) having acted or acting as administrative agent, collateral agent,
arranger, book runner for, and/or lender to, Bain Capital and/or certain of its affiliates and portfolio companies in connection with the
financing for various acquisition transactions, (iii) having acted or acting as underwriter, initial purchaser and placement agent for
various equity and debt offerings undertaken by Bain Capital and/or certain of its affiliates and portfolio companies, (iv) having
provided or providing certain treasury and trade management services and products to Bain Capital and/or certain of its affiliates and
portfolio companies and (v) having provided or providing certain commodity, derivatives and foreign exchange trading services to Bain
Capital and/or certain of its affiliates and portfolio companies. From October 1, 2014 to September 30, 2016, BofA Merrill Lynch and
its affiliates derived aggregate revenues from Bain Capital and its affiliates and portfolio companies of approximately $150 million for
investment and corporate banking services.

Management Projections

Blue Nile does not, as a matter of course, publicly disclose financial projections as to its future financial performance. On
August 1 and August 2, 2016, Blue Nile’s management provided financial projections to the Board of Directors in connection with its
review of Blue Nile’s long-range planning and the strategic review process, which we refer to as the “Management Projections”.

The Management Projections were the only financial projections with respect to Blue Nile provided by Blue Nile to its financial
advisor for the purpose of performing its financial analyses, and reflected the best currently available estimates and good faith
judgments of the management of Blue Nile and the Board of Directors as to the future financial performance of Blue Nile.

Because the Management Projections were made available to the Board of Directors, Blue Nile’s financial advisor and to the
Investor Group and their advisors, they are being included in this proxy statement. However, the inclusion of the Management
Projections should not be regarded as an indication that Blue Nile, the Board of Directors or the Investor Group considered, or now
considers, such Management Projections to be a reliable prediction of future results or to support or fail to support your decision
whether to vote for or against the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. No person has made or makes any representation or
warranty to any stockholder regarding the information included in the Management Projections.

and Cash EPS were calculated with the Board of Director’s authorization from management models. See the reconciliation of the
differences between Cash Net Income, Adjusted EBITDA and Cash EPS from the comparable GAAP measures in the section “—
Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Metrics” below.

Sensitivity Cases

As part of the strategic review process, on August 1 and August 2, 2016, Blue Nile’s management also provided an illustrative
financial scenario to the Board of Directors with more aggressive assumptions for future growth rates than the Management
Projections. This scenario, which we refer to as the “Upside Case”, served as a background to discuss greater investments if the
business performed at a level higher than forecasted. Since this illustrative financial scenario was included in the materials presented to
the Board of Directors at the August 1 and August 2, 2016 meetings, it was also provided to Blue Nile’s financial advisors and
potential acquirers.

At the September 27, 2016 meeting of the Board of Directors, the Board of Directors also instructed management to create a
comparably plausible downside sensitivity case (as compared to the Upside Case) for long-term planning and valuation purposes in
order to provide the Board of Directors with a balanced view of the illustrative Sensitivity Cases. We refer to this sensitivity case as the
“Downside Case”. The Downside Case was prepared by management for the Board of Directors and reflected a lower level of growth
than the Management Projections.

After discussion, the Board of Directors instructed Blue Nile’s financial advisor to use the Management Projections in its
financial analysis as part of the strategic review process. The Board of Directors instructed Blue Nile’s financial advisor to include,
solely for illustrative purposes, an appendix to its preliminary financial analysis with the sensitivity cases consisting of the Upside Case
and the Downside Case. Blue Nile’s financial advisor did not use or rely on the illustrative analyses based on the Downside Case and
the Upside Case for purposes of its opinion. We refer to the Downside Case and the Upside Case together as the “Sensitivity Cases”.

Because the Sensitivity Cases were made available to the Board of Directors and Blue Nile’s financial advisor, and the Upside
Case was made available to potential acquirers including the Investor Group in connection with their due diligence review, they are
being included in this proxy statement. However, the inclusion of the Sensitivity Cases should not be regarded as an indication that
Blue Nile or the Board of Directors, or the Investor Group considered, or now considers, such Sensitivity Cases to be a reliable
prediction of future results or to support or fail to support your decision whether to vote for or against the proposal to adopt the Merger
Agreement. No person has made or makes any representation or warranty to any stockholder regarding the information included in the
Sensitivity Cases.

Cautionary Statements regarding Management Projections and Sensitivity Cases

The Management Projections and Sensitivity Cases were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure or with a view toward
compliance with (1) GAAP, (2) the published guidelines of the SEC regarding projections and forward-looking statements; or (3) the
guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation and presentation of prospective
financial information. Neither Deloitte & Touche LLP, our independent registered public accountant, nor any other independent
accountants, have examined, reviewed, compiled or otherwise performed any procedures with respect to the Management Projections
or the Sensitivity Cases, nor have they expressed any opinion or any other form of assurance on such information or its achievability,
and, accordingly, they assume no responsibility for, express no opinion on, and disclaim any association with, such information. The
Management Projections and Sensitivity Cases included in this proxy statement have been prepared by management on a consistent
basis with the preparation of Blue Nile’s financial statements.

Although summaries of the Management Projections and Sensitivity Cases are presented with numerical specificity, they reflect
numerous assumptions and estimates as to future events made by management, taking into account the relevant information available
to management at the time. This information is not fact and should not be relied upon as being necessarily indicative of actual future
results. Important factors that may affect actual results and cause the Management Projections or the Sensitivity Cases not to be
achieved include general economic conditions, Blue Nile’s ability to achieve projected sales, accuracy of certain accounting

Interests of Blue Nile’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger

When considering the recommendation of the Board of Directors that you vote to adopt the Merger Agreement, you should be
aware that our directors and executive officers have interests in the Merger that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of
stockholders generally, as more fully described below. In (i) evaluating and negotiating the Merger Agreement; (ii) recommending the
adoption of the Merger Agreement; and (iii) recommending that the Merger Agreement be adopted by Blue Nile’s stockholders, the
Board of Directors was aware of and considered these interests to the extent that they existed at the time, among other matters.

Insurance and Indemnification of Directors and Executive Officers

During the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation will (and Parent will cause Surviving Corporation to) indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by
DGCL or pursuant to any indemnification agreements with Blue Nile and any of its Subsidiaries in effect on the date of November 6,
2016, each current or former directors and officers of Blue Nile (and any person who becomes a director or officer of Blue Nile or any
of its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time) (“Indemnified Person”) from and against any costs, fees and expenses (including
attorneys’ fees and investigation expenses), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement or
compromise in connection with any legal proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, to the extent that such
Legal Proceeding arises, directly or indirectly, out of or pertains, directly or indirectly, with respect to any act or omission, or alleged
act or omission, in such Indemnified Person’s capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent of Blue Nile or any of its Subsidiaries
or other Affiliates to the extent that such action or omission, or alleged action or omission, occurred prior to or at the Effective Time
(including any matters arising in connection with the Merger Agreement or the Merger).

During the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) cause the certificates of
incorporation, bylaws and other similar organizational documents of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to contain
provisions with respect to indemnification, exculpation and the advancement of expenses that are at least as favorable as the
indemnification, exculpation and advancement of expenses provisions set forth in the charter, the bylaws and the other similar
organizational documents of the Subsidiaries of Blue Nile, as applicable, as of the date of the Merger Agreement that have been made
available to Parent. During such six-year period, such provisions may not be repealed, amended or otherwise modified in any manner
except as required by applicable law.

The Merger Agreement also provides during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth anniversary of
the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to) maintain Blue Nile’s current
directors’ and officers’ liability insurance (“D&O Insurance”) in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time
on terms (including with respect to coverage, conditions, retentions, limits and amounts) that are equivalent to those of the D&O
Insurance. The

Table of Contents

Surviving Corporation will not be obligated to pay annual premiums in excess of 300% of the amount paid by Blue Nile for coverage
for its last full fiscal year (such 300% amount, the “Maximum Annual Premium”). If the annual premiums of such insurance coverage
exceed the Maximum Annual Premium, then the Surviving Corporation will be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage
available for a cost not exceeding the Maximum Annual Premium from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as
Blue Nile’s current directors’ and officers’ liability insurance carrier. Prior to the Effective Time, Blue Nile may (and at Parent’s
request will) purchase a prepaid “tail” policy with respect to the D&O Insurance from an insurance carrier with the same or better
credit rating as Blue Nile’s current directors’ and officers’ liability insurance carrier so long as the annual cost for such “tail” policy
does not exceed the Maximum Annual Premium. If Blue Nile purchases such a “tail” policy prior to the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to) maintain such “tail” policy in full force and effect and continue
to honor its obligations thereunder for so long as such “tail” policy is in full force and effect.

Treatment of Equity-Based Awards

Treatment of Company Options

As of the Record Date, there were outstanding options to purchase 517,063 shares of Company Common Stock with an exercise
price less than the Per Share Price, of which options to purchase 434,890 shares of Company Common Stock were held by our non-
employee directors and executive officers. At the Effective Time and without any action required by any holder of a Company Option,
each outstanding Company Option, whether unvested or vested:
 

 

(i) with an exercise price per share less than the Per Share Price, will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an
amount in cash equal to (a) the Per Share Price (less the exercise price per share attributable to such Company Option);
multiplied by (b) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock that are issuable upon full exercise of such
Company Option, minus (c) any applicable tax withholdings; and

 

 
(ii) with an exercise price per share equal to or greater than the Per Share Price, will be cancelled without payment of any

consideration.

Treatment of Restricted Stock Units

As of the Record Date, there were outstanding RSUs in respect of 334,927 shares of Company Common Stock, of which there
were performance RSUs in respect of 46,448 shares of Company Common Stock (assuming satisfaction of the applicable performance
metrics at maximum levels). Of the total number of outstanding RSUs as of the Record Date, our current non-employee directors and
executive officers held RSUs in respect of 241,172 shares of Company Common Stock, of which there were performance RSUs in
respect of 46,448 shares of Company Common Stock (assuming satisfaction of the applicable performance metrics at maximum
levels).

At the Effective Time, and without any action required by any holder of an RSU, each outstanding RSU, whether vested or
unvested, will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, equal to (a) the Per Share Price, multiplied by:
 

 
(i) in the case of any RSU that is only subject to time-vesting requirements, (b) the total number of shares subject to such RSU,

minus (c) any applicable tax withholdings; and
 

 
(ii) in the case of any RSU that is subject to time- and performance-based requirements, (b) the total number of shares

determined to be performance vested, with the performance goals deemed achieved at the maximum levels and with the
remaining time-vesting requirements deemed satisfied, minus (c) any applicable tax withholdings.

Amounts payable to the holders of Company Options and RSUs will be payable no later than the second payroll cycle of the
Surviving Corporation following the Effective Time.

Treatment of ESPP

Blue Nile has no participants in the ESPP, and new enrollments are prohibited under the Merger Agreement.

Payments Upon Termination In Connection with Change of Control

Change of Control and Severance Agreements with Executive Officers

Change of Control Severance Benefits.

Each of the executive officers is a party to a certain 2015 Change of Control Severance Plan agreement (each, a “Change of
Control Agreement”) that provides for “double trigger” benefits if there is both a “Change of Control” (as defined in the applicable
Change of Control Agreement) and a termination of the executive officer’s employment with Blue Nile under certain circumstances
thereafter. Under each Change of Control Agreement, in the event an executive officer’s service is terminated by Blue Nile other than
for “Cause,” death or disability or due to the executive officer’s resignation for “Good Reason” in each case on or within the 12-month
period (or, with respect to Mr. Kanter and Mr. Binder, the 24-month period) following a “Change of Control” (each as defined in the
applicable Change of Control Agreement) and such termination constitutes a “separation from service” (as defined under Treasury
Regulation Section 1.409A-1(h)), the following severance payments would be made, (i) subject to the execution of a release of claims
in favor of Blue Nile and that release becoming effective and irrevocable and (ii) the executive officer’s compliance with applicable
restrictive covenants:
 

 
•  Mr. Kanter is entitled to: (1) a severance payment equal to 2.0x his Total Cash Compensation, (2) payments equal to Mr.

Kanter’s COBRA premiums for a period of 18 months, and (3) full accelerated vesting of his outstanding and unvested
equity awards.

 

 
•  Mr. Binder is entitled to: (1) a severance payment equal to 2.0x his Total Cash Compensation, (2) payments equal to Mr.

Binder’s COBRA premiums for a period of 18 months, and (3) full accelerated vesting of his outstanding and unvested
equity awards.

 

 
•  Mr. Sainsbury is entitled to: (1) a severance payment equal to 1.0x his Total Cash Compensation, (2) payments equal to Mr.

Sainsbury’s COBRA premiums for a period of 12 months, and (3) full accelerated vesting of his outstanding and unvested
equity awards.

 

 
•  Ms. Neiswender is entitled to: (1) a severance payment equal to 1.0x of her Total Cash Compensation, (2) payments equal to

Ms. Neiswender’s COBRA premiums for a period of 12 months, and (3) full accelerated vesting of her outstanding and
unvested equity awards.

In all cases, in the event of any potential exposure to excise taxes under Section 280G or 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code, the
Change of Control Agreements provide that such payments and benefits either will be paid in full or reduced to a level such that the
excise taxes are not imposed, whichever provides a better after-tax result for the executive officer. No tax gross-ups are provided for
under the Change of Control Agreements.

Cause means any of the following events that has a material negative impact on the business or reputation of Blue Nile: the
executive officer’s (i) indictment or conviction of any felony or any crime involving dishonesty or moral turpitude; (ii) dishonesty
which is not the result of an inadvertent or innocent mistake by the executive officer with respect to Blue Nile; (iii) continued willful
violation of his or her obligations to Blue Nile after there has been delivered to the executive officer a written demand for performance
from our Board of Directors which describes the basis for the Board of Directors’ belief that the executive officer has not substantially
satisfied his or her obligations to Blue Nile; (iv) violation or breach of any material written Blue Nile policy, agreement with Blue Nile,
or any statutory or fiduciary duty; or (v) damaging or misappropriating or attempting to damage or misappropriate any property,
including any confidential or proprietary information, of Blue Nile.

Table of Contents

Good Reason means any of the following actions taken without the executive officer’s express written consent (i) the material
reduction (where material is considered greater than 10%) of the executive officer’s annual base salary; (ii) a material adverse change
in the executive officer’s position or responsibilities (including the person or persons to whom the executive officer has reporting
responsibilities and including a requirement that an executive officer who reports directly to our Board of Directors instead report to a
corporate officer or employee instead of reporting directly to our Board of Directors), provided, however, that becoming the chief
executive officer or chief financial officer of a privately-held company will not, by itself, be deemed a material adverse change in the
position or responsibilities of our chief executive officer or chief financial officer, respectively; (iii) the executive officer is required to
relocate his or her principal place of employment to a location that would increase his or her one way commute distance by more than
25 miles; or (iv) Blue Nile (or its successor) materially breaches its obligations under the 2015 Change of Control Severance Plan or
any then-existing employment agreement with the executive officer. To terminate for Good Reason, the executive officer must notify
Blue Nile (or its successor) in writing of the existence of the condition which the executive officer believes constitutes Good Reason
within thirty (30) days of the initial existence of such condition, Blue Nile (or its successor) must fail to remedy such condition within
thirty (30) days after the date on which it receives such notice (the “Remedial Period”); and the executive officer must actually
terminate employment within sixty (60) days after the expiration of the Remedial Period.

Total Cash Compensation means the sum of the executive officer’s (i) annual base salary in effect immediately prior to (x) the
occurrence of the Change of Control or (y) the date of termination of employment, whichever of (x) or (y) is greater, and (ii) target
annual incentive bonus, which the executive officer is eligible to earn in the fiscal year (x) in which the Change of Control occurs or
(y) the termination of employment occurs, whichever of (x) or (y) is greater.

Non-Change of Control Severance Benefits.

With respect to Mr. Kanter only, if we terminate his employment without “Cause” (other than as a result of his death or
disability), then subject to his execution and non-revocation of Blue Nile’s standard general waiver and release of claims, he would be
entitled to: (i) a lump sum cash payment equal to 2.0x his then current salary; (ii) a lump sum cash payment equal to a pro-rata portion
of his actual annual bonus (not to exceed his pro-rata target annual bonus) for the fiscal year in which his termination occurs, as
determined under the applicable bonus plan, based solely on the achievement of the “Section 162(m) Performance Goal” (as defined in
the applicable bonus plan) as of the end of such fiscal year and without the Board of Directors’ exercise of any negative discretion, and
based on the number of months of employment during such fiscal year (which full credit for any partial months), payable in the
ordinary course; and (iii) up to 18 months of Blue Nile’s payment of the premiums for COBRA benefits for Mr. Kanter and his eligible
dependents.

For the purpose of Mr. Kanter’s non-change of control severance benefits, “Cause” means any of the following: (i) Mr. Kanter’s
conviction of, or guilty plea or plea of nolo contendere to, a felony under the laws of the United States or of any state, or a crime
involving moral turpitude or dishonesty (including, but not limited to, fraud, theft, or embezzlement); (ii) Mr. Kanter’s participation in
any fraud or act of dishonesty against Blue Nile; (iii) Mr. Kanter’s willful misconduct, or his material breach of any agreement between
him and Blue Nile (including, but not limited to, his offer letter or his Nondisclosure, Proprietary Information, Inventions,
Nonsolicitation and Noncompetition Agreement); (iv) Mr. Kanter’s conduct that Blue Nile determines, in good faith, demonstrates
unfitness for the job; (v) Mr. Kanter’s engagement in any activity that constitutes a material conflict of interest with Blue Nile; or (vi)
Mr. Kanter’s significant failure to perform his duties, gross neglect of his duties, or refusal to comply with any lawful directive of the
Board of Directors, which conduct, if capable of cure or remedy, is not cured or remedied within thirty (30) days following his receipt
of written notice from the Board of Directors.

Golden Parachute Compensation

In accordance with Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K, the table below sets forth the compensation that is based on or otherwise
relates to the Merger that will or may become payable to each of our named executive officers in connection with the Merger. Please
see “—Payments Upon Termination In Connection with Change of Control” for further information regarding this compensation.

The amounts indicated in the table below are estimates of the amounts that would be payable assuming, solely for purposes of this
table, that the Merger is consummated on December 21, 2016, and that the employment of each of the named executive officers was
subject to an involuntary termination on such date (excluding Ms. Yoakum, whose employment was terminated prior to such
date). Blue Nile’s named executive officers will not receive pension, non-qualified deferred compensation enhancements, tax
reimbursement or other benefits in connection with the Merger.

Some of the amounts set forth in the table would be payable solely by virtue of the consummation of the Merger. In addition to
the assumptions regarding the consummation date of the Merger and the termination of employment, these estimates are based on
certain other assumptions that are described in the footnotes accompanying the table below. Accordingly, the ultimate values to be
received by a named executive officer in connection with the Merger may differ from the amounts set forth below.

Julie Yoakum(5)    —       —       —       —    

 
(1) This amount represents the “double-trigger” cash severance payments to which each named executive officer may become

entitled under his or her Change of Control Agreement, as described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “—Interest of
Blue Nile’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—Payments Upon Termination In Connection with Change of
Control”. The amount represents 1.0x (2.0x, in the case of Messrs. Kanter and Binder) the named executive officer’s annual base
salary in effect immediately prior to the occurrence of the Change of Control or the date of termination of employment, whichever
is greater, plus the named executive officer’s target annual incentive bonus, which the named executive officer is eligible to earn
in the fiscal year in which the Change of Control occurs or the termination of employment occurs, whichever is greater.

(2) This amount represents “single-trigger” payments due with respect to each named executive officer’s Company Options and
RSUs under the Merger Agreement. This amount represents the product of (a) the Per Share Price, multiplied by (b) the total
number of shares subject to each individual’s outstanding (i) unvested in-the-money options (i.e., options to purchase shares of
Company Common Stock with an exercise price of less than $40.75 per share) with such product reduced by the aggregate per
share exercise price for the in-the-money options and (ii) RSUs, including performance RSUs (assuming satisfaction of
performance conditions at the maximum level).

(3) This amount equals the estimated value of the “double-trigger” health insurance benefits to which each named executive officer
may become entitled under his or her Change of Control Agreement, as described in the section of this proxy statement captioned
“—Interest of Blue Nile’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—Payments Upon Termination In Connection with
Change of Control”. The amount represents the amount of the named executive officer’s COBRA premiums for a period of 12
months (18 months, in the case of Messrs. Kanter and Binder).

(4) Under the Change of Control Agreements, amounts are subject to reduction in the event the named executive officer would be
better off on an after-tax basis being cutback to a level such that the penalties and excise taxes under Sections 280G and 4999 of
the Internal Revenue Code are not imposed as compared to retaining all amounts and paying the excise tax under Section 4999 of
the Internal Revenue Code. This table assumes no such reductions are required.

payment in connection with the Merger.

purchase shares of Company Common Stock with an exercise price of less than the Per Share Price) and RSUs. The Merger
Agreement provides that at the Effective Time and without any action required by any holder of a Company Option, each
outstanding Company Option, whether unvested or vested:

 

 

a. with an exercise price per share less than the Per Share Price will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an
amount in cash equal to (i) the Per Share Price (less the exercise price per share attributable to such Company Option);
multiplied by (ii) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock that are issuable upon full exercise of such
Company Option, minus (iii) any applicable tax withholdings; and

 

 
b. with an exercise price per share equal to or greater than the Per Share Price, will be cancelled without payment of any

consideration.

The Merger Agreement also provides that at the Effective Time, and without any action required by any holder of an RSU, each
outstanding RSU, whether vested or unvested, will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, equal
to (i) the Per Share Price, multiplied by:

compensation payment in connection with the Merger. Ms. Taylor resigned from the Board of Directors on July  15, 2016, and
will not be receiving any cash or equity compensation payment in connection with the Merger.

Financing of the Merger

We anticipate that the total amount of funds necessary to complete the Merger and the related transactions will be approximately
$500 million. This amount includes the funds needed to: (1) pay stockholders the amounts due under the Merger Agreement; (2) make
payments in respect of our outstanding equity-based awards pursuant to the Merger Agreement; and (3) pay all fees and expenses
payable by Parent and Merger Sub under the Merger Agreement.

Although the obligation of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger is not subject to any financing condition, the
Merger Agreement provides that, without Parent’s agreement, the Closing of the Merger will not occur earlier than the third Business
Day after the expiration of the marketing period (the “Marketing Period”). For more information, please see the section of this proxy
statement captioned, “The Merger Agreement—Marketing Period.”

Equity Financing

Pursuant to the Equity Commitment Letter (as such term is defined in the Merger Agreement), Bain Capital Fund XI has agreed
to provide Parent with an equity commitment of up to approximately $334 million in cash, which will be available to fund the
aggregate purchase price and the other payments contemplated by, and subject to the terms and conditions of, the Merger Agreement.

The Equity Commitment Letter provides, among other things, that: (1) Blue Nile is an express third party beneficiary thereof in
connection with Blue Nile’s exercise of its rights related to specific performance under the Merger Agreement; and (2) Blue Nile will
be entitled to specific performance in connection with the exercise of such third party beneficiary rights. The Equity Commitment
Letter may not be waived, amended or modified except by a written instrument signed by Parent and Bain Capital Fund XI, but any
amendment, waiver or modification expected to be adverse to Blue Nile’s third party beneficiary rights shall also require the prior
written consent of Blue Nile.

Limited Guaranty

Pursuant to the limited guaranty delivered by Bain Capital Fund XI in favor of Blue Nile, dated as of November 6, 2016 (the
“Limited Guaranty”), Bain Capital Fund XI has agreed to guaranty the payment of the Parent Termination Fee that may be payable by
Parent under the Merger Agreement.

Table of Contents

The obligations of Bain Capital Fund XI under the Limited Guaranty are subject to an aggregate cap equal to $32.2 million.
Subject to specified exceptions, the Limited Guaranty will terminate upon the earliest of:
 

 •  the Closing;
 

 
•  the valid termination of the Merger Agreement by mutual written consent of Parent and Blue Nile, or under circumstances in

which Parent and Merger Sub would not be obligated to pay the Parent Termination Fee under the Merger Agreement; and
 

 •  payment in full by Parent of its payment obligations under the Limited Guaranty.

Debt Financing

In connection with the Merger Agreement, Parent and Merger Sub entered into a debt commitment letter on November 6, 2016
with Goldman Sachs Bank USA (the “Lead Arranger”) pursuant to which the Lead Arranger has committed to provide (i) a $50 million
senior secured asset based revolving credit facility and (ii) a $175 million senior secured term loan for the purpose of financing the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and paying related fees and expenses, subject to the terms and conditions set forth
therein (the “Debt Commitment Letter”). The obligation of the Lead Arranger to provide debt financing under the Debt Commitment
Letter is subject to a number of customary conditions, including, without limitation, the following (subject to certain exceptions and
qualifications as set forth in the debt commitment letter):
 

 •  the substantially simultaneous closing of the Merger in accordance in all material respects with the Merger Agreement;
 

 •  the substantially simultaneous funding of the equity financing;

Appraisal Rights

If the Merger is consummated, Blue Nile stockholders who do not vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement, who
properly demand an appraisal of their shares of Company Common Stock, who continuously hold such shares of Company Common
Stock through the Effective Time of the Merger and who otherwise comply with the procedures of Section 262 of the DGCL (including
with respect to certain aggregate ownership requirements) will be entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the Merger under
Section 262 of the DGCL (“Section 262”). Unless the context requires otherwise, all references in Section 262 and in this summary to
a “stockholder” are to a record holder of Company Common Stock.

The following discussion is not a complete statement of the law pertaining to appraisal rights under the DGCL and is qualified in
its entirety by the full text of Section 262, which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex C and incorporated into this proxy
statement by reference. The following summary does not constitute any legal or other advice and does not constitute a recommendation
that Blue Nile stockholders exercise their appraisal rights under Section 262. Only a holder of record of shares of Company Common
Stock is entitled to demand appraisal rights for the shares of Company Common Stock registered in that holder’s name. A person
having a beneficial interest in shares of Company Common Stock held of record in the name of another person, such as a bank, broker
or other nominee, must act promptly to cause the record holder to demand an appraisal of such holder’s shares. If you hold your shares
of Company Common Stock through a bank, broker or other nominee and you wish to exercise appraisal rights, you should consult
with your bank, broker or the other nominee to ensure that appraisal rights are exercised.

Under Section 262, holders of record of shares of Company Common Stock who (1) submit a written demand for appraisal of
such stockholder’s shares of Company Common Stock to Blue Nile prior to the vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement; (2) do
not vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement; (3) continuously are the record holders of such shares of Company
Common Stock through the Effective Time; and (4) otherwise comply with the procedures set forth in Section 262 may be entitled to
have their shares of Company Common Stock appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive payment in cash of the “fair
value” of the shares of Company Common Stock, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of
the Merger, together with interest, if any, to be paid on the amount determined to be fair value as determined by the Delaware Court of
Chancery. However, the Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings as to all Blue Nile stockholders who assert
appraisal rights unless (a) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock for which appraisal rights have been pursued and
perfected exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock as measured in accordance with subsection (g) of Section
262; or (b) the value of the aggregate Per Share Price in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock for which appraisal rights
have been pursued and perfected exceeds $1 million (conditions (a) and (b) referred to as the “ownership thresholds”). Unless the
Delaware Court of Chancery, in its discretion, determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest on an appraisal award will accrue
and compound quarterly from the Effective Time through the date the judgment is paid at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate
(including any surcharge) as established from time to time during such period. However, at any time before the Delaware Court of
Chancery enters judgment in the appraisal proceedings, the Surviving Corporation may pay to each stockholder entitled to appraisal an
amount in cash, in which case such interest will accrue after the time of such payment only on an amount that equals the difference, if
any, between the amount paid and the “fair value” determined by the Court of Chancery, in addition to any interest accrued prior to the
time of such voluntary payment, unless paid at such time. The Surviving Corporation is under no obligation to make such voluntary
cash payment prior to such entry of judgment.

Table of Contents

Under Section 262, where a merger agreement is to be submitted for adoption at a meeting of stockholders, the corporation, not
less than twenty (20) days prior to the stockholder meeting, must notify each of its stockholders of record as of the record date for
notice of such meeting that appraisal rights are available and include in the notice a copy of Section 262. This proxy statement
constitutes Blue Nile’s notice to stockholders that appraisal rights are available in connection with the Merger, and the full text of
Section 262 is attached to this proxy statement as Annex C. In connection with the Merger, any holder of shares of Company Common
Stock who wishes to exercise appraisal rights, or who wishes to preserve such holder’s right to do so, should review Annex C carefully.
Failure to strictly comply with the requirements of Section 262 in a timely and proper manner may result in the loss of appraisal rights
under the DGCL. A stockholder who loses his, her or its appraisal rights will be entitled to receive the Per Share Price without interest.
Moreover, because of the complexity of the procedures for exercising the right to seek appraisal of shares of Company Common Stock,
Blue Nile believes that if a stockholder considers exercising such rights, that stockholder should seek the advice of legal counsel.

Stockholders wishing to exercise the right to seek an appraisal of their shares of Company Common Stock must do ALL of the
following:
 

 •  the stockholder must not vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement;
 

 
•  the stockholder must deliver to Blue Nile a written demand for appraisal before the vote on the Merger Agreement at the

Company Stockholder Meeting;
 

 
•  the stockholder must continuously hold the shares of Company Common Stock from the date of making the demand through

the Effective Time (a stockholder will lose appraisal rights if the stockholder transfers the shares of Company Common
Stock before the Effective Time); and

 

 

•  a stockholder (or any person who is the beneficial owner of shares of Company Common Stock held either in a voting trust
or by a nominee on behalf of such person) or the Surviving Corporation must file a petition in the Delaware Court of
Chancery demanding a determination of the value of the shares of Company Common Stock of all stockholders entitled to
appraisal within one hundred and twenty (120) days after the Effective Time. The Surviving Corporation is under no
obligation to file any petition and has no intention of doing so.

In addition, one of the ownership thresholds must be met.

Because a proxy that does not contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger
Agreement, a stockholder who votes by proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights must vote against the adoption of the Merger
Agreement, abstain or not vote his, her or its shares of Company Common Stock.

Filing Written Demand

A stockholder wishing to exercise appraisal rights must deliver to Blue Nile, before the vote on the adoption of the Merger
Agreement at the Company Stockholder Meeting at which the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement will be submitted to the
stockholders, a written demand for the appraisal of such stockholder’s shares of Company Common Stock, and that stockholder must
not vote, in person or by proxy, in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement. A stockholder exercising appraisal rights must hold
of record the shares of Company Common Stock on the date the written demand for appraisal is made and must continue to hold the
shares of Company Common Stock of record through the Effective Time. A proxy that is submitted and does not contain voting
instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement, and it will constitute a waiver of the
stockholder’s right of appraisal and will nullify any previously delivered written demand for appraisal. Therefore, a stockholder who
submits a proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights must submit a proxy containing instructions to vote against the adoption of
the Merger Agreement or abstain from voting on the adoption of the Merger Agreement. Neither voting against the adoption of the
Merger

Table of Contents

Agreement nor abstaining from voting or failing to vote on the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement will, in and of itself, constitute
a written demand for appraisal satisfying the requirements of Section 262. The written demand for appraisal must be in addition to and
separate from any proxy or vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement. A proxy or vote against the adoption of the Merger
Agreement will not constitute a demand. A stockholder’s failure to make the written demand prior to the taking of the vote on the
adoption of the Merger Agreement at the Company Stockholder Meeting will constitute a waiver of appraisal rights.

Only a holder of record of shares of Company Common Stock is entitled to demand appraisal rights for the shares registered in
that holder’s name. A demand for appraisal in respect of shares of Company Common Stock should be executed by or on behalf of the
holder of record, and must reasonably inform Blue Nile of the identity of the holder and state that the stockholder intends thereby to
demand an appraisal of such stockholder’s shares of Company Common Stock. If the shares of Company Common Stock are owned of
record in a fiduciary capacity, such as by a trustee, guardian or custodian, such demand must be executed by or on behalf of the record
owner, and if such shares of Company Common Stock are owned of record by more than one person, as in a joint tenancy and tenancy
in common, the demand must be executed by or on behalf of all joint owners. An authorized agent, including an authorized agent for
two or more joint owners, may execute a demand for appraisal on behalf of a holder of record; however, the agent must identify the
record owner or owners and expressly disclose that, in executing the demand, the agent is acting as agent for the record owner or
owners.

STOCKHOLDERS WHO HOLD THEIR SHARES OF COMMON STOCK IN BROKERAGE OR BANK ACCOUNTS OR
OTHER NOMINEE FORMS AND WHO WISH TO EXERCISE APPRAISAL RIGHTS SHOULD CONSULT WITH THEIR BANK,
BROKER OR OTHER NOMINEES, AS APPLICABLE, TO DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE PROCEDURES FOR THE BANK,
BROKER OR OTHER NOMINEE TO MAKE A DEMAND FOR APPRAISAL OF THOSE SHARES OF COMMON STOCK. A
PERSON HAVING A BENEFICIAL INTEREST IN SHARES OF COMMON STOCK HELD OF RECORD IN THE NAME OF
ANOTHER PERSON, SUCH AS A BANK, BROKER OR OTHER NOMINEE, MUST ACT PROMPTLY TO CAUSE THE
RECORD HOLDER TO FOLLOW PROPERLY AND IN A TIMELY MANNER THE STEPS NECESSARY TO PERFECT
APPRAISAL RIGHTS.

All written demands for appraisal pursuant to Section 262 should be mailed or delivered to:

Blue Nile, Inc.
411 First Avenue South, Suite 700

Seattle, Washington 98104
Attention: Corporate Secretary

Any holder of shares of Company Common Stock may withdraw his, her or its demand for appraisal and accept the consideration
offered pursuant to the Merger Agreement by delivering to Blue Nile a written withdrawal of the demand for appraisal. However, any
such attempt to withdraw the demand made more than sixty (60) days after the Effective Time will require written approval of the
Surviving Corporation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery will be dismissed
without the approval of the Delaware Court of Chancery, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Delaware
Court of Chancery deems just; provided, however, that this shall not affect the right of any stockholder who has not commenced an
appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such stockholder’s demand for appraisal and to accept the
Per Share Price within sixty (60) days after the Effective Time.

Notice by the Surviving Corporation

If the Merger is completed, within ten (10) days after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will notify each record holder
of shares of Company Common Stock who has made a written demand for appraisal pursuant to Section 262, and who has not voted in
favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement, that the Merger has become effective and the effective date thereof.

Filing a Petition for Appraisal

Within one hundred and twenty (120) days after the Effective Time, but not thereafter, the Surviving Corporation or any holder of
shares of Company Common Stock who has complied with Section 262 and is entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262 (or the
beneficial owner of such shares of Company Common Stock) may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the
Delaware Court of Chancery, with a copy served on the Surviving Corporation in the case of a petition filed by a stockholder,
demanding a determination of the fair value of the shares held by all stockholders entitled to appraisal. The Surviving Corporation is
under no obligation, and has no present intention, to file a petition, and holders should not assume that the Surviving Corporation will
file a petition or initiate any negotiations with respect to the fair value of the shares of Company Common Stock. Accordingly, any
holders of shares of Company Common Stock who desire to have their shares appraised should initiate all necessary action to perfect
their appraisal rights in respect of their shares of Company Common Stock within the time and in the manner prescribed in Section
262. The failure to file such a petition within the period specified in Section 262 could nullify a previous written demand for appraisal.

Within one hundred and twenty (120) days after the Effective Time, any holder of shares of Company Common Stock who has
complied with the requirements for an appraisal of such holder’s shares pursuant to Section 262 will be entitled, upon written request,
to receive from the Surviving Corporation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock not
voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and with respect to which Blue Nile has received demands for appraisal, and
the aggregate number of holders of such shares of Company Common Stock. The Surviving Corporation must mail this statement to
the requesting stockholder within ten (10) days after receipt of the written request for such a statement or within ten (10) days after the
expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal, whichever is later. A beneficial owner of shares of Company Common
Stock held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person may, in such person’s own name, file a petition seeking
appraisal or request from the Surviving Corporation the foregoing statements. As noted above, however, the demand for appraisal can
only be made by a stockholder of record.

If a petition for an appraisal is duly filed by a holder of shares of Company Common Stock and a copy thereof is served upon the
Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Corporation will then be obligated within twenty (20) days after such service to file with the
Delaware Register in Chancery a duly verified list containing the names and addresses of all stockholders who have demanded
appraisal of their shares of Company Common Stock and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares have not been reached.
After notice to the stockholders as required by the court, at the hearing on such petition, the Delaware Court of Chancery will
determine the stockholders who have complied with Section 262 and who have become entitled to appraisal rights thereunder. The
Delaware Court of Chancery may require the stockholders who demanded appraisal for their shares of Company Common Stock to
submit their stock certificates to the Delaware Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings;
and if any stockholder fails to comply with the direction, the Delaware Court of Chancery may dismiss the proceedings as to such
stockholder.

The Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings as to all Blue Nile stockholders who assert appraisal rights
unless (1) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock for which appraisal rights have been pursued and perfected exceeds
1% of Blue Nile’s outstanding shares of Company Common Stock as measured in accordance with subsection (g) of Section 262; or
(2) the value of the aggregate Per Share Price in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock for which appraisal rights have been
pursued and perfected exceeds $1 million.

Determination of Fair Value

at least one of the ownership thresholds above has been satisfied in respect of stockholders

of Blue Nile seeking appraisal rights, the appraisal proceeding will be conducted in accordance with the rules of the Court of Chancery,
including any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings. Through such proceeding, the Delaware Court of Chancery will
determine the “fair value” of the shares of Company Common Stock, exclusive of any element of value arising from the
accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value.
In determining fair value, the Delaware Court of Chancery will take into account all relevant factors. Unless the court in its discretion
determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest from the Effective Time through the date of payment of the judgment will be
compounded quarterly and will accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time
to time during the period between the Effective Time and the date of payment of the judgment. However, the Surviving Corporation
has the right, at any point prior to the Delaware Court of Chancery’s entry of judgment in the proceedings, to make a voluntary cash
payment to each stockholder seeking appraisal. If the Surviving Corporation makes a voluntary cash payment pursuant to subsection
(h) of Section 262, interest will accrue thereafter only on the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the amount paid by the
Surviving Corporation in such voluntary cash payment and the fair value of the shares as determined by the Delaware Court of
Chancery and (2) interest accrued before such voluntary cash payment, unless paid at that time. In Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the
Supreme Court of Delaware discussed the factors that could be considered in determining fair value in an appraisal proceeding, stating
that “proof of value by any techniques or methods which are generally considered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise
admissible in court” should be considered, and that “[f]air price obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the
value of a company.” The Delaware Supreme Court stated that, in making this determination of fair value, the court must consider
market value, asset value, dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the enterprise and any other facts that could be ascertained as of
the date of the Merger that throw any light on future prospects of the merged corporation. Section 262 provides that fair value is to be
“exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger.” In Cede & Co. v Technicolor, Inc.,
the Supreme Court of Delaware stated that such exclusion is a “narrow exclusion [that] does not encompass known elements of value,”
but which rather applies only to the speculative elements of value arising from such accomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger v.
UOP, Inc., the Supreme Court of Delaware also stated that “elements of future value, including the nature of the enterprise, which are
known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the Merger and not the product of speculation, may be considered.”

Stockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as so determined by the Delaware
Court of Chancery could be more than, the same as or less than the consideration they would receive pursuant to the Merger if they did
not seek appraisal of their shares and that an opinion of an investment banking firm as to the fairness from a financial point of view of
the consideration payable in a Merger is not an opinion as to, and may not in any manner address, fair value under Section 262 of the
DGCL. Although Blue Nile believes that the Per Share Price is fair, no representation is made as to the outcome of the appraisal of fair
value as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, and stockholders should recognize that such an appraisal could result in a
determination of a value higher or lower than, or the same as, the Per Share Price. Neither Blue Nile nor Parent anticipates offering
more than the Per Share Price to any stockholder exercising appraisal rights, and each of Blue Nile and Parent reserves the rights to
make a voluntary cash payment pursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262 and to assert, in any appraisal proceeding, that for purposes
of Section 262, the “fair value” of a share of Company Common Stock is less than the Per Share Price. If a petition for appraisal is not
timely filed, or if neither of the ownership thresholds above has been satisfied in respect of stockholders of Blue Nile seeking appraisal
rights, then the right to an appraisal will cease. The costs of the appraisal proceedings (which do not include attorneys’ fees or the fees
and expenses of experts) may be determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery and charged to the parties as the Delaware Court of
Chancery deems equitable under the circumstances. Upon application of a stockholder, the Delaware Court of Chancery may also order
that all or a portion of the expenses incurred by any stockholder in connection with the appraisal proceeding, including, without
limitation, reasonable attorney’s fees and the fees and expenses of experts, be charged pro rata against the value of all the shares of
Company Common Stock entitled to an appraisal.

Table of Contents

If any stockholder who demands appraisal of his, her or its shares of Company Common Stock under Section 262 fails to perfect,
or loses or validly withdraws, such holder’s right to appraisal, the stockholder’s shares of Company Common Stock will be deemed to
have been converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive the Per Share Price as provided in the Merger Agreement. A
stockholder will fail to perfect, or effectively lose, such holder’s right to appraisal if no petition for appraisal is filed with the Delaware
Court of Chancery within one hundred and twenty (120) days after the Effective Time, if neither of the ownership thresholds above has
been satisfied in respect of stockholders of Blue Nile seeking appraisal rights or if the stockholder delivers to the Surviving
Corporation a written withdrawal of such holder’s demand for appraisal and an acceptance of the Per Share Price as provided in the
Merger Agreement in accordance with Section 262.

From and after the Effective Time, no stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights will be entitled to vote such shares of
Company Common Stock for any purpose or to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on the stock (except dividends or
other distributions payable to stockholders of record at a date which is prior to the Effective Time): provided, however, that if no
petition for an appraisal is filed within the time provided in Section 262, if neither of the ownership thresholds above has been satisfied
in respect of the Blue Nile stockholders seeking appraisal rights, or if such stockholder delivers to the Surviving Corporation a written
withdrawal of such stockholder’s demand for an appraisal and an acceptance of the Per Share Price as provided in the Merger
Agreement, either within sixty (60) days after the Effective Time or thereafter with the written approval of the Surviving Corporation,
then the right of such stockholder to an appraisal will cease. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no appraisal proceeding in the Delaware
Court of Chancery will be dismissed as to any stockholder without the approval of the court, and such approval may be conditioned
upon such terms as the Court deems just; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not affect the right of any stockholder who has not
commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such stockholder’s demand for appraisal
and to accept the terms offered upon the Merger within sixty (60) days after the Effective Time.

Failure to comply strictly with all of the procedures set forth in Section 262 may result in the loss of a stockholder’s statutory
appraisal rights. Consequently, any stockholder wishing to exercise appraisal rights is encouraged to consult legal counsel before
attempting to exercise those rights.

Accounting Treatment

The Merger will be accounted for as a “purchase transaction” for financial accounting purposes.

Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger

The following discussion is a summary of material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger that may be relevant to
certain U.S. Holders and Non-U.S. Holders (each as defined below) of shares of Company Common Stock whose shares are converted
into the right to receive cash pursuant to the Merger. This discussion is based upon the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or
the “Code,” Treasury Regulations promulgated under the Code, court decisions, published positions of the Internal Revenue Service, or
the IRS, and other applicable authorities, all as in effect on the date of this proxy statement and all of which are subject to change or
differing interpretations, possibly with retroactive effect. This discussion is limited to holders who hold their shares of Company
Common Stock as “capital assets” within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment purposes).

This discussion is for general information only and does not address all of the tax consequences that may be relevant to holders in
light of their particular circumstances. For example, this discussion does not address:
 

 
•  tax consequences that may be relevant to holders who may be subject to special treatment under U.S. federal income tax

laws, such as banks and other financial institutions; tax-exempt organizations; S-corporations, partnerships or any other
entities or arrangements treated as partnerships or pass-through

securities; regulated investment companies; real estate investment trusts; entities subject to the U.S. anti-inversion rules; or
certain former citizens or long-term residents of the United States;

 

 
•  tax consequences to holders holding their shares of Company Common Stock as part of a hedging, constructive sale or

conversion, straddle or other risk reduction transaction;
 

 
•  tax consequences to holders that received their shares of Company Common Stock on exercise of notes, warrants or options

or otherwise in a compensatory transaction;
 

 
•  tax consequences to holders who own an equity interest, actually or constructively, in Parent or the Surviving Corporation

following the Merger;
 

 •  tax consequences to U.S. Holders whose “functional currency” is not the U.S. dollar;
 

 
•  tax consequences to holders who hold their Company Common Stock through a bank, financial institution or other entity, or

a branch thereof, located, organized or resident outside the United States;
 

 
•  tax consequences to holders who hold their shares as “qualified small business stock” within the meaning of Section 1202 of

the Code or Section 1244 Stock for purposes of the Code;
 

 
•  tax consequences arising under the unearned income Medicare contribution tax pursuant to the Health Care and Education

Reconciliation Act of 2010;
 

 
•  tax consequences to holders who are “controlled foreign corporations,” “passive foreign investment companies” or “personal

holding companies” for U.S. federal income tax purposes;
 

 •  the U.S. federal estate, gift or alternative minimum tax consequences, if any;
 

 •  any state, local or non-U.S. tax consequences; or
 

 •  tax consequences to holders that do not vote in favor of the Merger.

If a partnership (including an entity or arrangement, domestic or foreign, treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax
purposes) is a beneficial owner of shares of Company Common Stock, then the tax treatment of a partner in such partnership will
generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partner and the partnership. Partnerships holding shares of
Company Common Stock and partners therein should consult their tax advisors regarding the consequences of the Merger.

No ruling from the IRS and no opinion of counsel has been or will be obtained regarding the U.S. federal income tax
consequences of the Merger described below. If the IRS contests a conclusion set forth herein, no assurance can be given that a holder
would ultimately prevail in a final determination by a court.

ADVICE TO ANY HOLDER. A HOLDER SHOULD CONSULT ITS OWN TAX ADVISORS CONCERNING THE U.S.
FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES RELATING TO THE MERGER IN LIGHT OF ITS PARTICULAR
CIRCUMSTANCES AND ANY CONSEQUENCES ARISING UNDER U.S. FEDERAL NON-INCOME TAX LAWS OR THE
LAWS OF ANY STATE, LOCAL OR NON-U.S. TAX JURISDICTION.

U.S. Holders

For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. Holder” is a beneficial owner of shares of Company Common Stock that is for U.S.
federal income tax purposes:
 

 •  an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;

•  a corporation, or other entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, created or organized in or under

the laws of the United States or any state thereof or the District of Columbia;
 

 •  an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or
 

 
•  a trust (1) that is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and the control of one or more United

States persons as defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code; or (2) that has a valid election in effect under applicable
Treasury regulations to be treated as a United States person.

The receipt of cash by a U.S. Holder in exchange for shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Merger will be a taxable
transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, such U.S. Holder’s gain or loss will be equal to the difference, if any,
between the amount of cash received and the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the shares surrendered pursuant to the Merger. A U.S.
Holder’s adjusted tax basis generally will equal the amount that such U.S. Holder paid for the shares. Such gain or loss will be capital
gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss if such U.S. Holder’s holding period in such shares is more than one year at the
time of the completion of the Merger. A reduced tax rate on capital gain generally will apply to long-term capital gain of a non-
corporate U.S. Holder (including individuals). The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. Gain or loss realized
generally must be calculated separately for each block of shares (i.e. shares acquired at the same cost in a single transaction)
surrendered pursuant to the Merger. Additionally, certain non-corporate U.S. Holders may also be subject to a 3.8% Federal surtax on
“net investment income” as defined in Section 1411 of the Code, which may include capital gain on shares surrendered in the Merger.

Non-U.S. Holders

For purposes of this discussion, the term “Non-U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of shares of Company Common Stock that
is neither a U.S. Holder nor a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

Any gain realized by a Non-U.S. Holder pursuant to the Merger generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax unless:
 

 

•  the gain is effectively connected with a trade or business of such Non-U.S. Holder in the United States (and, if required by
an applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to a permanent establishment or fixed base maintained by such Non-U.S.
Holder in the United States), in which case such gain generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at rates generally
applicable to U.S. persons, and, if such Non-U.S. Holder is a corporation, such gain may also be subject to the branch profits
tax at a rate of 30% (or a lower rate under an applicable income tax treaty);

 

 

•  such Non-U.S. Holder is an individual who is present in the United States for one hundred eighty-three (183) days or more
in the taxable year of that disposition, and certain other specified conditions are met, in which case such gain will be subject
to U.S. federal income tax at a rate of 30% (or a lower rate under an applicable income tax treaty) and may be offset by
certain U.S. source capital losses; or

 

 

•  Blue Nile is or has been a “United States real property holding corporation” as such term is defined in Section 897(c) of the
Code, or the “USRPHC,” at any time within the shorter of the five (5)-year period preceding the Merger or such Non-U.S.
Holder’s holding period with respect to the applicable shares of Company Common Stock, or the “Relevant Period,” and, if
shares of Company Common Stock are regularly traded on an established securities market (within the meaning of
Section 897(c)(3) of the Code), such Non-U.S. Holder owns directly or is deemed to own pursuant to attribution rules more
than 5% of Company Common Stock at any time during the Relevant Period, in which case such gain will be subject to U.S.
federal income tax at rates generally applicable to U.S. persons (as described in the first bullet point above), except that the
branch profits tax will not apply. We believe that we are not, and have not been, a USRPHC at any time during the five (5)-
year period preceding the Merger.

Information Reporting and Backup Withholding

Information reporting and backup withholding (at a current rate of 28%) may apply to the proceeds received by a holder pursuant
to the Merger. Backup withholding generally will not apply to (i) a U.S. Holder that furnishes a correct taxpayer identification number
and certifies that such holder is not subject to backup withholding on a properly completed IRS Form W-9 (or a substitute or successor
form) or (ii) a Non-U.S. Holder that (A) provides a certification of such holder’s foreign status on a properly completed appropriate
series of IRS Form W-8 (or a substitute or successor form) or (B) otherwise establishes an exemption from backup withholding.
Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules will be allowed as a refund or
a credit against the holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, provided that the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.

Regulatory Approvals Required for the Merger

HSR Act and U.S. Antitrust Matters

Under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder (the “HSR Act”), certain acquisition transactions, including the Merger, may not be consummated until certain information
and documentary material (“Premerger Notification and Report Form”) have been furnished to the U.S. Antitrust Division of the
Department of Justice (the “Antitrust Division”) or the Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC” and, together with the Antitrust
Division, the “Antitrust Agencies”) and certain waiting period requirements have been satisfied. Parent and Blue Nile filed their
respective Premerger Notification and Report Forms with the Antitrust Agencies on November 18, 2016. On November 30, 2016, the
FTC notified Blue Nile that early termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act was granted, effective immediately.

Before or after the Merger, the Antitrust Division or the FTC could take such action under the antitrust laws of the United States
as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest, including seeking to enjoin the Merger or seeking divestiture of substantial
assets or businesses of Parent or Blue Nile or their respective subsidiaries. State attorneys general may also bring legal action under
both state and federal antitrust laws, as applicable. Private parties may also bring legal actions under the antitrust laws of the United
States under certain circumstances. Blue Nile does not believe that the consummation of the Merger will result in a violation of any
applicable antitrust laws. There can be no assurance that a challenge to the Merger on antitrust grounds will not be made, or if such a
challenge is made, what the result would be.

Foreign Competition Laws

The Merger is subject to review by the Austrian Federal Competition Authority (“FCA”). Pursuant to the Austrian Cartel Act,
notification to the FCA of the Merger is required and the Merger may not be consummated before the expiration of a four week waiting
period, or upon a waiver by the FCA and the Austrian Federal Cartel Prosecutor of their right to file a motion with the Austrian Cartel
Court to review the transactions. Parent filed the required notice form with the FCA on November 17, 2016. On December 16, 2016,
the FCA and the Austrian Cartel Attorney provided clearance permitting the Merger to move forward.

If any foreign governmental authority initiates an action to block the Merger and an order is issued prohibiting the Merger, Parent
and Blue Nile may not be obligated to consummate the Merger.

THE MERGER AGREEMENT

Explanatory Note Regarding the Merger Agreement

The following summary describes the material provisions of the Merger Agreement. The descriptions of the Merger Agreement in
this summary and elsewhere in this proxy statement are not complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the Merger
Agreement, a copy of which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex A and is incorporated into this proxy statement by reference.
We encourage you to read the Merger Agreement carefully and in its entirety because this summary may not contain all the information
about the Merger Agreement that is important to you. The rights and obligations of the parties are governed by the express terms
of the Merger Agreement and not by this summary or any other information contained in this proxy statement. Capitalized
terms in this section but not defined in this proxy statement have the meaning ascribed to such terms in the Merger Agreement.

The representations, warranties, covenants and agreements described in this section and included in the Merger Agreement
(1) were made only for purposes of the Merger Agreement and as of specific dates; (2) were made solely for the benefit of the parties
to the Merger Agreement; and (3) may be subject to important qualifications, limitations and supplemental information agreed to by
Parent, Blue Nile and Merger Sub in connection with negotiating the terms of the Merger Agreement. The representations and
warranties may also be subject to a contractual standard of materiality different from those generally applicable to reports and
documents filed with the SEC and, in some cases, were qualified by matters disclosed to Parent and Merger Sub by Blue Nile. In
addition, the representations and warranties may have been included in the Merger Agreement for the purposes of allocating
contractual risk between the parties to the Merger Agreement, rather than to establish matters as facts, and may be subject to standards
of materiality applicable to such parties that differ from those applicable to investors. Stockholders should not rely on the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements or any descriptions thereof as characterizations of the actual state of facts or
condition of Blue Nile, Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective affiliates or businesses. Moreover, information concerning the
subject matter of the representations and warranties may have changed after the Merger Agreement date and does not purport to be
accurate as of the date of this proxy statement. In addition, you should not rely on the covenants in the Merger Agreement as actual
limitations on the respective businesses of Blue Nile, Parent and Merger Sub because the parties may take certain actions that are either
expressly permitted or as otherwise consented to by the appropriate party, which consent may be given without prior notice to the
public. The Merger Agreement is described below, and included as Annex A, only to provide you with information regarding its terms
and conditions, and not to provide you with any other factual information regarding Blue Nile, Parent, Merger Sub or their respective
businesses or affiliates.

Form and Effects of the Merger; Directors and Officers; Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws

Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Merger Agreement and the applicable provisions of the DGCL, on the closing
date, Merger Sub will be merged with and into Blue Nile and Blue Nile will continue as the Surviving Corporation of the Merger and a
private subsidiary of Parent.

At the Effective Time, all of the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of Blue Nile and Merger Sub will vest in the
Surviving Corporation and debts, liabilities and duties of Blue Nile and Merger Sub will become the debts, liabilities and duties of the
Surviving Corporation.

At Effective Time, the initial directors of the Surviving Corporation will be the directors of Merger Sub as of immediately prior to

Table of Contents

At the Effective Time, the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of Blue Nile as amended (the “Charter”), will be
amended and restated in its entirety to read substantially identically to the certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, and such amended and restated certificate of incorporation will become the certificate of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with the applicable provisions of the DGCL and
such certificate of incorporation; provided, however, that at the Effective Time the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation will be amended so that the name of the Surviving Corporation will be “Blue Nile, Inc.”

At the Effective Time, the bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, will become the bylaws of
the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with the applicable provisions of the DGCL, the certificate of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and such bylaws.

Closing and Effective Time of the Merger

The consummation of the Merger will take place at a closing to occur at 9:00 a.m., Eastern time, at the offices of Kirkland & Ellis
LLP, 300 North LaSalle, Chicago, Illinois 60654, on the later of (a) a date which shall be the third Business Day after the date the
conditions to the Merger set forth in the Merger Agreement and described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “—
Conditions to the Merger” have been satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the
Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver in accordance with the Merger Agreement by the party having the benefit of the
applicable condition) of all conditions at the Closing; (b) the earlier of (i) a date during the Marketing Period to be specified by Parent
on no fewer than three (3) Business Days’ notice to Blue Nile (which notice may be revoked at Parent’s option), and (ii) the third
Business Day following the final day of the Marketing Period (subject, in the case of each of subclauses (i) and (ii) of this clause (b), to
the satisfaction (or waiver in accordance with the Merger Agreement by the party having the benefit of the applicable condition) of all
conditions to the Merger set forth in the Merger Agreement and described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “—
Conditions to the Merger” have been satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the
Closing, but subject to the fulfillment (or waiver in accordance with the Merger Agreement by the party having the benefit of the
applicable condition at the Closing)); or (c) at such other place, date and time as Blue Nile and Parent may agree in writing; provided
that the Closing Date specified in any notice delivered pursuant to Merger Agreement may be conditioned upon the simultaneous
completion of the Debt Financing (as defined in the section of the proxy statement captioned “—Other Covenants Under the Merger
Agreement—Financing”), it being understood and agreed that if such Debt Financing is not completed for any reason at such time, such
notice shall automatically be deemed withdrawn. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, on
the closing date, Parent, Merger Sub and Blue Nile will cause the Merger to be consummated pursuant to the DGCL by filing a
Certificate of Merger in customary form and substance with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in accordance with the
applicable provisions of the DGCL. As of the date of this proxy statement, we expect to complete the Merger in the first calendar
quarter of 2017; however, consummation of the Merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to the completion of
the Merger more fully described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “—Conditions to the Merger” and we cannot specify
when, or assure you that, Blue Nile and Parent will satisfy or waive all conditions to the Merger. There may be a substantial amount of
time between the date of the Company Stockholder Meeting and the consummation of the Merger and it is possible that factors outside
the control of Blue Nile or Parent could delay the consummation of the Merger, or prevent the Merger from being consummated;
however, we expect to consummate the Merger promptly following the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions more fully described
below in the section of this proxy statement captioned “—Conditions to the Merger.”

Marketing Period

The “Marketing Period” means the first period of twenty (20) consecutive Business Days commencing on the date that is the first
Business Day after the later of (a) the date this proxy statement is mailed to stockholders or (b) January 2, 2017 throughout which
(1) Parent has received certain financial information from Blue Nile

necessary to syndicate any debt financing and (2) certain conditions to the consummation of the Merger are satisfied (other than those
conditions that, by their nature, are to be satisfied at the Closing (provided such conditions would be satisfied as of such date)).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Marketing Period: (1) will end on any earlier date on which the debt financing is obtained; and
(2) will not commence and will be deemed not to have commenced if, on or prior to the completion of such period of twenty (20)
consecutive Business Days, (i) auditors have withdrawn, or informed Blue Nile that they intend to withdraw, their audit opinion
contained in certain required financing information, in which case the Marketing Period will be deemed not to commence unless and
until a new unqualified audit opinion is issued with respect thereto by Blue Nile’s auditors or another independent accounting firm
reasonably acceptable to Parent; or (ii) Blue Nile has announced any intention to restate any financial statements or financial
information included in the required financing information or that any such restatement is under consideration or may be a possibility,
in which case the Marketing Period will be deemed not to commence unless and until such restatement has been completed and the
applicable required financing information has been amended or Blue Nile has announced that it has concluded that no restatement will
be required, and the requirements described in the immediately preceding sentence would be satisfied on the first day, throughout and
on the last day of such new twenty (20) consecutive Business Day period.

The Per Share Price

Effect of the Merger on Blue Nile’s Capital Stock

At the Effective Time, each share of Company Common Stock that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than Owned Company Shares or Dissenting Company Shares), will be cancelled and extinguished, and automatically converted
into the right to receive an amount equal to $40.75 in cash, without interest.

As of the Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock and rights or interests will no longer be outstanding and will be
cancelled and will cease to exist and will thereafter represent only the right to receive the Per Share Price to be paid in accordance with,
and subject to, the conditions of the Merger Agreement. At the Effective Time, each share of Company Common Stock that is (1) held
by Blue Nile as treasury stock; (2) owned by Parent or Merger Sub; or (3) owned by any direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of
Parent or Merger Sub as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will be cancelled and extinguished without any conversion thereof
or consideration paid therefor. All shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time and held by Company Stockholders (as defined in the Merger Agreement) who shall have neither voted in favor of the
adoption of the Merger Agreement nor consented thereto in writing and who shall have properly and validly exercised their statutory
rights of appraisal in respect of such shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (the “Dissenting
Company Shares”) will not be converted into, or represent the right to receive, the Per Share Price pursuant to the Merger Agreement.
Such Company Stockholders may be entitled to receive payment of the appraised value of such Dissenting Company Shares in
accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL, except that all Dissenting Company Shares held by Company
Stockholders who shall have failed to perfect or who shall have effectively withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal of such
Dissenting Company Shares pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL will thereupon be deemed to have been converted into, and to have
become exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive the Per Share Price, without interest thereon, upon surrender of
the Certificates or Uncertificated Shares (each as defined below) that formerly evidenced such shares of Company Common Stock in
the manner provided in the Merger Agreement. The Per Share Price will be adjusted appropriately to reflect the effect of any stock
split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or other distribution of securities convertible into Company Common
Stock), reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other similar change with respect to the
Company Common Stock occurring on or after the date of the Merger Agreement and prior to the Effective Time.

Treatment of Blue Nile Equity-Based Awards

Outstanding Equity Awards

The Merger Agreement provides that Blue Nile’s equity awards that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will
be subject to the following treatment at the Effective Time:

Options

At the Effective Time, each outstanding Company Option, whether unvested or vested, that has an exercise price per share less
than $40.75 will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to (a) $40.75 (less the exercise price per
share attributable to such Company Option); multiplied by (b) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock that are issuable
upon full exercise of such Company Option less any applicable tax withholdings.

At the Effective Time, each outstanding Company Option, whether unvested or vested, that has an exercise price per share equal
to or greater than $40.75, will be cancelled without payment of any consideration.

RSUs

At the Effective Time, each outstanding RSU that is only subject to time-vesting requirements, whether unvested or vested, will
be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, equal to $40.75, multiplied by the total number of shares subject
to such RSUs less any applicable tax withholdings.

At the Effective Time, each outstanding RSU that is subject to time- and performance-based requirements, will be cancelled and
converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, equal to $40.75, multiplied by the total number of shares determined to be
performance vested, with the performance goals deemed achieved at the maximum levels and with the remaining time-vesting
requirements deemed satisfied less any applicable tax withholdings.

Amounts payable to the holders of Company Options and RSUs will be payable no later than the second payroll cycle of the
Surviving Corporation following the Effective Time.

ESPP

Blue Nile has no participants in the ESPP, and new enrollments are prohibited under the Merger Agreement.

Exchange of Certificates and Payment Procedures

Payment Agent

Prior to the Closing, Parent will (i) select a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to Blue Nile to act as the payment agent
for the Merger and (ii) enter into a payment agent agreement, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Blue Nile, with such
payment agent.

Exchange Fund

At or prior to the Closing, Parent will deposit (or cause to be deposited) with the Payment Agent, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds, for payment to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock, an amount of cash equal to the aggregate
consideration to which such holders of Company Common Stock have become entitled pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement.
Until disbursed in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, such cash will be invested by the payment
agent, as directed by Parent

or the Surviving Corporation, in (i) obligations of or fully guaranteed by the United States or any agency or instrumentality thereof and
backed by the full faith and credit of the United States with a maturity of no more than thirty (30) days; (ii) commercial paper
obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. or Standard & Poor’s Corporation, respectively; or (iii)
certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or banker’s acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $1.0 billion
(based on the most recent financial statements of such bank that are then publicly available) (such cash and any proceeds thereon, the
“Exchange Fund”). To the extent that (1) there are any losses with respect to any investments of the Exchange Fund; (2) the Exchange
Fund diminishes for any reason below the level required for the payment agent to promptly pay the cash amounts owed pursuant to
Merger Agreement; or (3) all or any portion of the Exchange Fund is unavailable for Parent (or the payment agent on behalf of Parent)
to promptly pay the cash amounts owed pursuant to the Merger Agreement for any reason, Parent will, or will cause the Surviving
Corporation to, promptly replace or restore the amount of cash in the Exchange Fund so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all
times fully available for distribution and maintained at a level sufficient for the payment agent to make the payments owed pursuant to
Merger Agreement. Any income from investment of the Exchange Fund will be payable to Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as
Parent directs.

Payment Procedure

Promptly following the Effective Time (and in any event within three (3) Business Days of the Closing), Parent and the Surviving
Corporation will cause the payment agent to mail to each holder of record (as of immediately prior to the Effective Time) of (1) a
certificate or certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock
(other than Dissenting Company Shares and Owned Company Shares) (the “Certificates”); and (2) uncertificated shares of Company
Common Stock that represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (other than Dissenting Company Shares and Owned
Company Shares) (the “Uncertificated Shares”) (A) a letter of transmittal in customary form (which will specify that delivery will be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates will pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Payment Agent); and (B)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates and Uncertificated Shares in exchange for the Per Share Price payable
in respect thereof pursuant to the Merger Agreement. Upon surrender of Certificates for cancellation to the payment agent, together
with such letter of transmittal duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, the holders of such
Certificates will be entitled to receive in exchange therefor an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the
aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate; by (y) the Per Share Price (less any
applicable withholding taxes payable in respect thereof), and the Certificates so surrendered will forthwith be cancelled. Upon receipt
of an “agent’s message” by the Payment Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Payment Agent may reasonably
request) in the case of a book-entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares, the holders of such Uncertificated Shares will be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (I) the aggregate number of shares of
Company Common Stock represented by such holder’s transferred Uncertificated Shares; by (II) the Per Share Price (less any
applicable withholding Taxes payable in respect thereof), and the transferred Uncertificated Shares so surrendered will be cancelled.
The payment agent will accept such Certificates and transferred Uncertificated Shares upon compliance with such reasonable terms and
conditions as the payment agent may impose to cause an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices. No
interest will be paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of the Certificates and Uncertificated Shares on the Per Share Price payable
upon the surrender of such Certificates and Uncertificated Shares pursuant to the Merger Agreement. Until so surrendered, outstanding
Certificates and Uncertificated Shares will be deemed from and after the Effective Time to evidence only the right to receive the Per
Share Price, without interest thereon, payable in respect thereof pursuant to the Merger Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in the Merger Agreement, no holder of Uncertificated Shares will be required to provide a Certificate or an executed letter of
transmittal to the Payment Agent in order to receive the payment that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to the Merger
Agreement.

Table of Contents

DTC Payment

Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and Blue Nile will cooperate to establish procedures with the payment agent and the
Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) with the objective that the payment agent will transmit to DTC or its nominees on the first
Business Day after the Closing Date an amount in cash, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, equal to (i) the number of
shares of Company Common Stock (other than Owned Company Shares and Dissenting Company Shares) held of record by DTC or
such nominee immediately prior to the Effective Time; multiplied by (ii) the Per Share Price.

Transfers of Ownership

If a transfer of ownership of shares of Company Common Stock is not registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of Blue
Nile, or if the Per Share Price is to be paid in a name other than that in which the Certificates surrendered or transferred in exchange
therefor are registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of Blue Nile, the Per Share Price may be paid to a person other than the
person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered or transferred is registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of Blue Nile only
if such Certificate is properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for surrender and transfer and the person requesting such payment
has paid to Parent (or any agent designated by Parent) any transfer Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Per Share Price to a
person other than the registered holder of such Certificate, or established to the satisfaction of Parent (or any agent designated by
Parent) that such transfer Taxes have been paid or are otherwise not payable. Payment of the applicable Per Share Price with respect to
Uncertificated Shares will only be made to the person in whose name such Uncertificated Shares are registered.

No Liability

None of the Payment Agent, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any other Party will be liable to a holder of shares of Company
Common Stock for any amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

Distribution of Exchange Fund to Parent

Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates or Uncertificated Shares on the
date that is one year after the Effective Time will be delivered to Parent upon demand, and any holders of shares of Company Common
Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Merger who have not theretofore surrendered or transferred their
Certificates or Uncertificated Shares representing such shares of Company Common Stock for exchange pursuant to the Merger
Agreement will thereafter look for payment of the Per Share Price payable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock
represented by such Certificates or Uncertificated Shares solely to Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat or similar laws),
solely as general creditors thereof, for any claim to the Per Share Price to which such holders may be entitled pursuant to the Merger
Agreement. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of any such Certificates or Uncertificated Shares two years after the
Effective Time, or at such earlier date as is immediately prior to the time at which such amounts would otherwise escheat to, or become
property of, any Governmental Authority, will, to the extent permitted by applicable law, become the property of the Surviving
Corporation free and clear of any claims or interest of any such holders (and their successors, assigns or personal representatives)
previously entitled thereto.

No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock

From and after the Effective Time, (a) all shares of Company Common Stock will no longer be outstanding and will automatically
be cancelled, retired and cease to exist; and (b) each holder of a Certificate or Uncertificated Shares theretofore representing any shares
of Company Common Stock will cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Per Share Price payable
therefor in accordance with the Merger Agreement, or in the case of Dissenting Company Shares, the rights pursuant to Merger
Agreement. The

Table of Contents

Per Share Price paid in accordance with the terms described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger” will be
deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock. From and after the
Effective Time, there will be no further registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company
Common Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than transfers to reflect, in accordance
with customary settlement procedures, trades effected prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they will (subject to compliance with the exchange
procedures described herein) be cancelled and exchanged as described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger.”

Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates

In the event that any Certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the payment agent will issue in exchange therefor, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the Per Share Price payable as described herein. Parent or the payment agent
may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of such Per Share Price, require the owners of such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in such amount as it may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Payment Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

Required Withholding

Each of the payment agent, Parent, Blue Nile and the Surviving Corporation will be entitled to deduct and withhold from any cash
amounts payable pursuant to the Merger Agreement to any holder or former holder of shares of Company Common Stock, Company
Restricted Stock Units or Company Options such amounts as are required to be deducted or withheld therefrom pursuant to any
applicable tax laws. To the extent that such amounts are so deducted or withheld and paid over to the appropriate governmental
authority, such amounts will be treated for all purposes of the Merger Agreement as having been paid to the person to whom such
amounts would otherwise have been paid.

Effect.” For purposes of the Merger Agreement, “Company Material Adverse Effect” means, with respect to Blue Nile, any change,

expected to have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition or results of operations of Blue Nile and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole or (2) would reasonably be expected to prevent or materially impair or delay the consummation of the Merger,
provided, however, that, with respect to clause (1) only, none of the following (by itself or when aggregated) will be deemed to be or
constitute a Company Material Adverse Effect or will be taken into account when determining whether a Company Material Adverse
Effect has occurred or may, would or could occur (subject to the limitations set forth below):

constitutes, or is reasonably expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal or any inquiries or the making of any proposal that

respect of any person (other than Parent and its Affiliates).

Notwithstanding the restrictions described above, under certain circumstances, prior to the adoption of the Merger Agreement by
stockholders, Blue Nile may, among other things, provide information to, and engage or participate in negotiations or substantive
discussions with, a person in respect of an Acquisition Proposal, and otherwise facilitate such Acquisition Proposal or assist such
person (and its Representatives and financing sources) with such Acquisition Proposal (in each case, if requested by such person and
such Acquisition Proposal was not solicited in breach of Blue Nile’s obligations, as described in the immediately preceding paragraph)
if (and only if):
 

 •  such Acquisition Proposal was not solicited in violation of the non-solicitation provisions of the Merger Agreement;
 

 
•  the Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that

such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal or is reasonably expected to lead to a Superior Proposal; and

the failure to take the actions described above would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors under
the DGCL.

For more information, please see the section of this proxy statement captioned, “—Termination of the Merger Agreement;
Termination Fees.”

Blue Nile is not entitled to terminate the Merger Agreement for the purpose of entering into an agreement in respect of a Superior
Proposal, unless it complies with certain procedures in the Merger Agreement, including, but not limited to, negotiating with Parent in
good faith over a five (5) Business Day period in an effort to amend the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, so that such
Superior Proposal no longer constitutes “Superior Proposal” relative to the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, as
amended pursuant to such negotiations.

Blue Nile is also required to provide or make available to Parent any information provided in connection with the receipt of the
Superior Proposal described above, to the extent that such information has not been previously provided or made available to Parent,
prior to or concurrently with the time such information is provided or made available to a third party (or its representatives or financing
sources).

In addition to any obligations set forth in the Merger Agreement with regard to the non-solicitation provisions of the Merger
Agreement, Blue Nile has agreed to promptly, and in any event within 24 hours of receipt, advise Parent in the event that Blue Nile or
any of its representatives receives any Acquisition Proposal or any inquiries with respect thereto or that could reasonably be expected
to lead to an Acquisition Proposal,

considering making, or has made, an Acquisition Proposal or inquiry with respect thereto.

Change in the Recommendation of Blue Nile’s Board of Directors

As described above, and subject to the provisions described below, the Board of Directors has made the recommendation that the
holders of shares of Company Common Stock vote “FOR” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. The Merger Agreement
provides that the Board of Directors will not effect a Company Board Recommendation Change except as described below.

Prior to the adoption of the Merger Agreement by stockholders, the Board of Directors may not take any action described in the
following (any such action, a “Company Board Recommendation Change”):
 

 
•  withhold, withdraw, amend, qualify or modify, or publicly propose to withhold, withdraw, amend, qualify or modify, the

Blue Nile recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent in any material respect;
 

 •  adopt, approve, endorse, recommend or otherwise declare advisable an Acquisition Proposal;
 

 
•  fail to publicly reaffirm the Blue Nile recommendation within five (5) Business Days after Parent so requests in writing (it

being understood that Blue Nile will have no obligation to make such reaffirmation on more than three separate occasions);
 

 

•  take or fail to take any formal action or make or fail to make any recommendation or public statement in connection with a
tender or exchange offer, other than a recommendation against such offer or a “stop, look and listen” communication by the
Board of Directors to Blue Nile’s stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any
substantially similar communication) (it being understood that the Board of Directors may refrain from taking a position
with respect to an Acquisition Proposal until the close of business on the tenth Business Day after the commencement of a
tender or exchange offer in connection with such Acquisition Proposal without such action being considered a violation of
the Merger Agreement); or

 

 •  fail to include the Blue Nile recommendation in this proxy statement.

Notwithstanding the restrictions described above, prior to the adoption of the Merger Agreement by stockholders, the Board of
Directors may effect a Company Board Recommendation Change if (1) there has been an Intervening Event; or (2) Blue Nile has
received a bona fide Acquisition Proposal that the Board of Directors has concluded in good faith (after consultation with its financial
advisor and outside legal counsel) is a Superior Proposal, in each case, to the extent a failure to effect a Company Board
Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with the Board of Directors’ fiduciary obligations under applicable law.

The Board of Directors may only effect a Board of Directors Recommendation Change for an Intervening Event if:
 

 
•  Blue Nile has provided prior written notice to Parent at least five (5) Business Days in advance to the effect that the Board of

Directors has (1) so determined; and (2) resolved to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change pursuant to Merger
Agreement, which notice must describe the applicable Intervening Event in reasonable detail; and

•  prior to effecting such Company Board Recommendation Change, Blue Nile and its Representatives, during such five (5)
Business Day period, must have negotiated with Parent and its Representatives in good faith (to the extent that Parent desires
to so negotiate) to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement so that the Board of
Directors no longer determines that the failure to make a Company Board Recommendation Change in response to such
Intervening Event would be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations pursuant to applicable law.

In addition, the Board of Directors may only effect a Company Board Recommendation Change in response to a bona fide
Acquisition Proposal that the Board of Directors has concluded in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside
legal counsel) is a Superior Proposal if:
 

 
•  the Board of Directors has determined in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel)

that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable law;
 

 

•  Blue Nile has provided prior written notice to Parent at least five (5) Business Days in advance to the effect that the Board of
Directors has (1) received a bona fide Acquisition Proposal that has not been withdrawn; (2) concluded in good faith that
such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal; and (3) resolved to effect a Company Board Recommendation
Change or to terminate the Merger Agreement absent any revision to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement,
which notice will describe the basis for such Company Board Recommendation Change or termination in reasonable detail,
including the identity of the person of “group” of persons making such Acquisition Proposal (unless such disclosure is
prohibited pursuant to the terms of any confidentiality agreement with such person or “group” of persons that was in effect
on the date of the Merger Agreement), the material terms thereof and copies of all material documents relating to such
Acquisition Proposal;

 

 

•  prior to effecting such Company Board Recommendation Change or termination, Blue Nile and its Representatives, during
the five (5) Business Day notice period describe above, has negotiated with Parent and its Representatives in good faith (to
the extent that Parent desires to so negotiate) to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement
so that such Acquisition Proposal would cease to constitute a Superior Proposal;

 

 

•  in the event of any termination of the Merger Agreement in order to cause or permit Blue Nile or any of its Subsidiaries to
enter into an acquisition agreement with respect to such Acquisition Proposal, Blue Nile has validly terminated the Merger
Agreement in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, including paying to Parent a termination fee of $17.4
million ($7.4 million if in connection with entry into a definitive agreement with a person or group that is an Excluded Party
at the time of the termination); and

 

 
•  Blue Nile has otherwise complied in all material respects with its obligations pursuant to the Merger Agreement with respect

to such Acquisition Proposal.

For purposes of this proxy statement and the Merger Agreement, an “Intervening Event” means any material event or
development or material change in circumstances with respect to Blue Nile (other than in connection with a bona fide Acquisition
Proposal that constitutes a Superior Proposal) that was (1) not known to the Board of Directors as of the date on which the Merger
Agreement was executed; or (2) does not relate to any Acquisition Proposal.

Board Obligation to Call a Company Stockholder Meeting

Blue Nile will take all actions necessary in accordance with the DGCL, the Charter, the bylaws and the rules of NASDAQ to
establish a record date (and Blue Nile will not change such record date without the prior written consent of Parent), it will duly call,

for the purpose of obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Approval. Blue Nile will not be required to convene and hold the Company
Stockholder Meeting at any time prior to the 20th Business Day following the mailing of the Proxy Statement to the Company
Stockholders. Unless there has been a Company Board Recommendation Change, Blue Nile will use its reasonable best efforts to
solicit proxies to obtain the Requisite Stockholder Approval.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Merger Agreement, nothing will prevent Blue Nile from postponing or
adjourning the Company Stockholder Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if (i) there are holders of an
insufficient shares of the Company Common Stock present or represented by proxy at the Company Stockholder Meeting to constitute
a quorum at the Company Stockholder Meeting (provided that, without Parent’s prior written consent, the Company may not postpone
or adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting more than two times pursuant to this clause (i)); (ii) Blue Nile is required to postpone or
adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting by applicable law, order or a request from the SEC or its staff; or (iii) the Board of
Directors has determined in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that it would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties not to postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting, including in order to give the Company Stockholders sufficient
time to evaluate any information or disclosure that Blue Nile has sent to the Company Stockholders or otherwise made publicly
available to the Company Stockholders (including in connection with a Company Board Recommendation Change); provided that the
Company Stockholder Meeting may not be postponed or adjourned pursuant to this clause (iii) on more than two separate occasions or
for more than five (5) Business Days for each such postponement or adjournment. Unless the Merger Agreement is validly terminated
in accordance with its terms, Blue Nile will submit the adoption of the Merger Agreement to its stockholders at the Company
Stockholder Meeting even if the Board of Directors shall have effected a Company Board Recommendation Change. For more
information, please refer to the section of this proxy statement captioned, “—Termination of the Merger Agreement; Termination Fees.”

Access to Information; Confidentiality

will afford Parent and its Representatives and the Financing Sources and their respective Representatives reasonable access during
normal business hours, upon reasonable advance notice to the properties, books and records and personnel of Blue Nile except that
Blue Nile may restrict or otherwise prohibit access to any documents or information to the extent that (a) any applicable Law or
regulation requires Blue Nile to restrict or otherwise prohibit access to such documentation information; (b) access to such documents
or information would give rise to a material risk of waiving any attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other privilege
applicable to such documents or information; (c) access to a Contract to which Blue Nile or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or
otherwise bound would violate or cause a default pursuant to, or give a third person the right terminate or accelerate the rights pursuant
to, such Contract; (d) access would result in the disclosure of any trade secrets of third persons; or (e) such documents or information
are reasonably pertinent to any adverse Legal Proceeding between Blue Nile, on the one hand, and Parent and its Affiliates, on the
other hand; provided that Blue Nile will use its reasonable best efforts to cooperate on utilizing an alternative method of production of
all such information in the event any of the foregoing circumstances apply.

Required Efforts to Consummate the Merger

FTC and the Antitrust Division of the DOJ a Notification and Report Form relating to this Agreement and the Merger as required by

the applicable waiting periods pursuant to the HSR Act and any other antitrust laws applicable to the Merger; and (2) obtain any
required consents pursuant to any antitrust laws applicable to the Merger, in each case as soon as practicable. If any party receives a
request for additional information or documentary material from any governmental authority with respect to the Merger pursuant to the
HSR Act or any other antitrust laws applicable to the Merger, then such party will make (or cause to be made), as soon as reasonably
practicable and after consultation with the other parties, an appropriate response in compliance with such request.

Anti-Takeover Statutes

Each of Blue Nile, Parent and Merger Sub and their respective authorized representatives will take all necessary actions so that
the restrictions on business combinations set forth in Section 203 of the DGCL and any other similar applicable “anti-takeover” law
will not be applicable to the Merger

Directors’ and Officers’ Indemnification and Insurance

During the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation will (and Parent will cause Surviving Corporation to) indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by
DGCL or pursuant to any indemnification agreements with Blue Nile and any of its Subsidiaries in effect on the date of November 6,
2016, each current or former director and officer of Blue Nile (and any person who becomes a director or officer of Blue Nile or any of
its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time (“Indemnified Person”) from and against any costs, fees and expenses (including attorneys’
fees and investigation expenses), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement or compromise in
connection with any legal proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, to the extent that such Legal Proceeding
arises, directly or indirectly, out of or pertains, directly or indirectly, with respect to any act or omission, or alleged act or omission, in
such Indemnified Person’s capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent of Blue Nile or any of its Subsidiaries or other Affiliates to
the extent that such action or omission, or alleged action or omission, occurred prior to or at the Effective Time(including any matters
arising in connection with the Merger Agreement or the Merger).

During the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) cause the certificates of
incorporation, bylaws and other similar organizational documents of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to contain
provisions with respect to indemnification, exculpation and the advancement of expenses that are at least as favorable as the
indemnification, exculpation and advancement of expenses provisions set forth in the charter, the bylaws and the other similar
organizational documents of the Subsidiaries of Blue Nile, as applicable, as of the date of the Merger Agreement that have been made
available to Parent. During such six-year period, such provisions may not be repealed, amended or otherwise modified in any manner
except as required by applicable law.

The Merger Agreement also provides during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth anniversary of
the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to) maintain Blue Nile’s current
directors’ and officers’ liability insurance (“D&O Insurance”) in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time
on terms (including with respect to coverage, conditions, retentions, limits and amounts) that are equivalent to those of the D&O
Insurance. The Surviving Corporation will not be obligated to pay annual premiums in excess of 300% of the amount paid by Blue Nile
for coverage for its last full fiscal year (such 300% amount, the “Maximum Annual Premium”). If the annual premiums of such
insurance coverage exceed the Maximum Annual Premium, then the Surviving Corporation will be obligated to obtain a policy with
the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding the

Maximum Annual Premium from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as Blue Nile’s current directors’ and
officers’ liability insurance carrier. Prior to the Effective Time, Blue Nile may (and at Parent’s request will) purchase a prepaid “tail”
policy with respect to the D&O Insurance from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as Blue Nile’s current
directors’ and officers’ liability insurance carrier so long as the annual cost for such “tail” policy does not exceed the Maximum
Annual Premium. If Blue Nile purchases such a “tail” policy prior to the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will (and Parent
will cause the Surviving Corporation to) maintain such “tail” policy in full force and effect and continue to honor its obligations
thereunder for so long as such “tail” policy is in full force and effect. For more information, please refer to the section of this proxy
statement captioned, “The Merger—Interests of Blue Nile’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger.”

Employee Benefits

The Merger Agreement provides that for a period of one year following the Effective Time (or, if earlier, the date the applicable
employee terminates employment), Parent will either (i) maintain for the benefit of each continuing employee the employee benefit
plans (other than change in control, retention, long term incentive, nonqualified deferred compensation, and equity-based compensation
or benefits and individual employment or other compensation agreements (except with respect to severance terms in such agreements))
to each continuing employee at benefit levels that, taken as a whole, are substantially comparable in the aggregate to those in effect at
Blue Nile or its applicable Subsidiaries on the date of the Merger Agreement; (ii) provide compensation, benefits, and severance
payments (other than change in control, retention, long term incentive, nonqualified deferred compensation, and equity-based
compensation or benefits and individual employment or other compensation agreements (except with respect to severance terms in
such agreements)) to each continuing employee that, taken as a whole, are substantively comparable in the aggregate to the
compensation, benefits, and severance payments (other than change in control, retention, long term incentive, nonqualified deferred
compensation, and equity-based compensation or benefits and individual employment or other compensation agreements (except with
respect to severance terms in such agreements)) provided to such continuing employee immediately prior to the Effective Time; or (iii)
provide some combination of current plans and comparable plans (other than change in control, retention, long term incentive,
nonqualified deferred compensation, and equity-based compensation or benefits and individual employment or other compensation
agreements (except with respect to severance terms in such agreements)) that, taken as a whole, are substantially comparable in the
aggregate to the compensation, benefits, and severance payments (other than change in control, retention, long term incentive,
nonqualified deferred compensation, and equity-based compensation or benefits and individual employment or other compensation
agreements (except with respect to severance terms in such agreements)) provided to such continuing employee immediately prior to
the Effective Time. Further, the base compensation and target bonus opportunity will not be decreased for a period of one year
following for any continuing employee. In addition, for a period of one year following the Effective Time, Parent will provide
severance benefits to eligible employees in accordance with Blue Nile’s severance plans, guidelines, and practices as in effect on the
date of the Merger Agreement.

In addition, Parent will use reasonable efforts to cause to be granted for continued employee’s credit for all service with Blue Nile
prior to the Effective Time for purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting and for purposes of vacation accrual and severance pay
entitlement. Further, each continuing employee will be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting period, in any and all
employee benefit plans sponsored by the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to the extent that coverage under such plan
replaces in the plan year in which the closing occurs, coverage pursuant to a comparable benefit plan sponsored by Blue Nile and to the
extent that the applicable waiting period under the Blue Nile plan has been satisfied or waived at or before the Effective Time. Further,
with regard to any Surviving Corporation plans providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical, or vision benefits, any pre-existing
conditions or exclusions, eligibility waiting periods, evidence of insurability requirements, and actively at work or similar requirements
will be waived with respect to the continuing employees and their covered dependents, to the extent waived under the corresponding
plan in which the applicable continuing employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time and the continuing

employee will be given full credit pursuant to such Surviving Corporation plan for purposes of satisfying deductible, coinsurance, and
maximum out of pocket requirements applicable to such continuing employee and his or her covered dependents for the plan year in
which the closing occurs as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with the applicable Surviving Corporation plan. Finally, for
the plan year in which the closing occurs, Parent will credit the accounts of continuing employees pursuant to any Surviving
Corporation plan that is a flexible spending plan with any unused balance in the account of such continuing employee in the
corresponding Blue Nile plan to the extent permitted by applicable law. Any accrued but unused vacation or paid time as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time will be credited to the continuing employee.

Financing

Blue Nile has agreed that it will, and will cause its Subsidiaries to, and will use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and their
respective representatives to, assist Parent in the arrangement of any third-party debt financing for the purpose of financing aggregate
portion of the Per Share Price, (the “Debt Financing”), subject to certain exceptions described below. The receipt of such Debt
Financing and any equity financing are not conditions to the Merger.

Such cooperation will include, without limitation, (A) participating in a reasonable number of meetings, presentations and due
diligence sessions (including the participation in such meetings, presentations and due diligence sessions of Blue Nile’s senior
management); (B) providing timely assistance with the preparation of materials for lender presentations, bank information memoranda,
rating agency presentations and similar documents required in connection with the Debt Financing; (C) furnishing the report of Blue
Nile’s auditor on the most recent audited consolidated financial statements of Blue Nile and its Subsidiaries; (D) as promptly as
reasonably practicable furnishing Parent and its financing sources with (1) audited consolidated balance sheets and related consolidated
statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), equity and cash flows for Blue Nile for the fiscal years ended December 29,
2013, January 4, 2015 and January 3, 2016 and (2) unaudited consolidated balance sheets and related statements of operations,
comprehensive income (loss) and cash flows for Blue Nile for the six-month period quarter ended July 3, 2016 and each subsequent
fiscal quarter ended on a date that is not a fiscal year end and that is at least forty five (45) days before the closing date, in each case
prepared in accordance with GAAP; and (E) furnishing any additional financial statements, schedules or other financial data relating to
Blue Nile and its Subsidiaries as reasonably requested by Parent (including such information as is necessary to enable Parent to prepare
any pro forma financial statements required pursuant to the Debt Financing).

However, nothing described in this section of the proxy statement will require cooperation to the extent it would (i) unreasonably
disrupt the conduct of the business or operations of Blue Nile or its Subsidiaries, (ii) require Blue Nile or any of its Subsidiaries to
agree to pay any fees or reimburse any expenses or give any indemnities prior to the Effective Time for which it is not promptly
reimbursed or simultaneously indemnified; or (iii) require Blue Nile or any of its Subsidiaries to take any action pursuant to any
certificate, agreement, arrangement, document or instruction (other than customary representation letters and authorization) letters that
is not contingent upon or effective prior to the Effective Time.

In addition, Parent will promptly, upon request by Blue Nile, reimburse Blue Nile for all reasonable costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys’ fees, but not the costs of Blue Nile’s preparation of its annual and quarterly financial statements) incurred by
Blue Nile or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective representatives in connection with the Debt Financing. Parent will also
indemnify and hold harmless Blue Nile, its Subsidiaries and their respective representatives from and against any and all losses,
damages, claims, costs or expenses suffered or incurred by any of them in connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing and
any information used in connection therewith, except to the extent suffered or incurred as a result of the gross negligence or willful
misconduct or material breach of the Merger Agreement by any such persons. Further, Parent and its subsidiaries will be permitted to
disclose information about Blue Nile and its Subsidiaries as necessary and consistent with customary practices in connection with the
Debt Financing subject to customary confidentiality arrangements in connection therewith.

Although the obligation of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger is not subject to any financing condition, the
Merger Agreement provides that, without Parent’s agreement, the Closing of the Merger will not occur earlier than the third Business
Day after the expiration of the marketing period (the “Marketing Period”), which Marketing Period is the first period of twenty (20)
consecutive Business Days commencing on the date that is the first Business Day after the later of (a) the date this proxy statement is

consecutive Business Days, (i) Blue Nile’s auditors have withdrawn, or informed Blue Nile that they intend to withdraw, their audit
opinion contained in the required financing information, in which case the Marketing Period will be deemed not to commence unless
and until a new unqualified audit opinion is issued with respect thereto by Blue Nile’s auditors or another independent accounting firm
reasonably acceptable to Parent or (ii) Blue Nile has announced any intention to restate any financial statements or financial
information included in the required financing information or that any such restatement is under consideration or may be a possibility,

applicable required financing information has been amended or Blue Nile has announced that it has concluded that no restatement will
be required, and the requirements described in the immediately preceding sentence would be satisfied on the first day, throughout and
on the last day of such new 20 consecutive Business Day period.

 •  by Parent if:
 

 

•  Blue Nile has breached or failed to perform in any material respect any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
other agreements set forth in the Merger Agreement such that certain conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement are
not satisfied and such breach is not capable of being cured, or is not cured, before the earlier of the Outside Date or
the date that is thirty (30) calendar days following Parent’s delivery of written notice of such breach; or

 

 •  if at any time the Board of Directors has effected a Company Board Recommendation Change.

In the event that the Merger Agreement is terminated pursuant to the termination rights above, the Merger Agreement will be of
no further force or effect without liability of any party to the other parties, as applicable, except certain sections of the Merger
Agreement will survive the termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with their respective terms, including terms relating to
reimbursement of expenses and indemnification. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in the Merger Agreement will relieve any
party from any liability for any willful and intentional breach of the Merger Agreement.

Termination Fee

If the Merger Agreement is terminated in specified circumstances, Blue Nile has agreed to pay Parent a termination fee of $17.4
million (the “Company Termination Fee”).

Parent will be entitled to receive the Company Termination Fee from Blue Nile if the Merger Agreement is terminated:
 

 

•  (a) by either Parent or Blue Nile because (i) the Merger closing has not occurred by the Outside Date; or (ii) the stockholders
fail to adopt the Merger Agreement; or (b) by Parent because Blue Nile has materially breached its representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements in the Merger Agreement, provided, however, that Parent will only be entitled to
receive the Company Termination Fee from Blue Nile if (1); any person has made (since the date of the Merger Agreement
and prior to its termination) an Acquisition Proposal that is not withdrawn or otherwise abandoned; and (2) Blue Nile enters
into an agreement relating to, or consummates, an Acquisition Transaction within 12 months of

such termination (provided that, for purposes of the termination fee, all references to “15%” in the definition of “Acquisition
Transaction” are deemed to be references to “50%”);

 

 •  by Parent, because the Board of Directors has effected a Company Board Recommendation Change; or
 

 •  by Blue Nile, to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal.

Notwithstanding the above, if the Merger Agreement is terminated because Blue Nile terminates on or prior to the Cut-Off Date
to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with a person or group that is an Excluded Party at the time of such termination,
Parent will be entitled to receive a termination fee of $7.4 million.

Moreover, if the Merger Agreement is terminated by either Parent or Blue Nile due to: (i) failure to consummate the Closing by
the Outside Date; or (ii) failure to obtain the Requisite Stockholder Approval, Blue Nile shall reimburse Parent for its out-of-pocket
expenses (including all fees and expenses of the Financing Sources, counsel, accountants, investment banks, advisors and consultants
of Parent and Merger Sub) up to an aggregate of $5.0 million.

However, if the Merger Agreement is terminated due to: (i) breach and failure to cure within thirty (30) days of receipt of written
notice of such breach by Parent or Merger Sub of their respective representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements; or (ii)
failure by Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the Closing within five (5) Business Days of the first date upon which Parent is
required to consummate the Closing pursuant to the Merger Agreement, provided that Blue Nile has complied in material respect with
all representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements contained in the Merger Agreement, Blue Nile will be entitled to receive
from Parent a termination fee equal to $32.2 million (minus the sum of any reimbursement and any indemnification obligations of
Parent under the Merger Agreement).

Amendment and Waiver

Amendment

The Merger Agreement may be amended by Parent, Merger Sub and Blue Nile at any time by execution of an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of each of Parent, Merger Sub and Blue Nile (pursuant to authorized action by the Board of Directors, except
that in the event that Blue Nile has received the Requisite Stockholder Approval, no amendment may be made to the Merger
Agreement that requires the approval of the Company Stockholders pursuant to the DGCL without such approval. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in the Merger Agreement, any amendments, modifications or alterations of the provisions relating to the
Financing Sources set forth in the Merger Agreement and the defined terms used therein solely as they relate to such sections) to the
extent adversely affecting any of the Financing Sources, shall not be effective with respect to such affected Financing Sources unless
the Lenders provide their prior written consent to such amendment, modification or alteration.

Waiver

At any time and from time to time prior to the Effective Time, Parent, Merger Sub and Blue Nile may, to the extent legally
allowed and except as otherwise set forth in the Merger Agreement, (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or
other acts of the other Parent, Merger Sub and Blue Nile, as applicable; (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and
warranties made to such party contained therein or in any document delivered pursuant thereto; and (c) subject to the requirements of
applicable law, waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions for the benefit of such party contained therein. Any
agreement on the part of a party to any such extension or waiver will be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by
such party. Any delay in exercising any right pursuant the Merger Agreement will not constitute a waiver of such right.

Governing Law

The Merger Agreement is governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the laws
that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of laws thereof.

Specific Performance

Parent, Merger Sub and Blue Nile have agreed that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even if available, would not
be an adequate remedy would occur in the event that the Parent, Merger Sub and Blue Nile do not perform the provisions of the Merger
Agreement (including any party failing to take such actions as are required of it in order to consummate the Merger Agreement) in
accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. Parent, Merger Sub and Blue Nile acknowledge and agree
that, subject to the Merger Agreement, (A) Parent, Merger Sub and Blue Nile will be entitled, in addition to any other remedy to which
they are entitled at law or in equity, to an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches (or threatened
breaches) of the Merger Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions thereof; (B) the provisions of the Merger
Agreement are not intended to and do not adequately compensate Blue Nile, on the one hand, or Parent and Merger Sub, on the other
hand, for the harm that would result from a breach of the Merger Agreement, and will not be construed to diminish or otherwise impair
in any respect any party’s right to an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief; and (C) the right of specific
enforcement is an integral part of the Merger and without that right, neither Blue Nile nor Parent would have entered into the Merger
Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is explicitly agreed that Blue Nile shall have the right to an injunction, specific
performance or other equitable remedies in connection with enforcing Parent’s and Merger Sub’s obligations to consummate the
Merger and cause the Equity Financing to be funded to fund the Merger (including to cause Parent to enforce the obligations of Bain
Capital Fund XI under the Equity Commitment Letter in order to cause the Equity Financing to be timely completed in accordance
with and subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Equity Commitment Letter) if and only if (1) the Marketing Period has
ended and all conditions in the Merger Agreement have been satisfied (other than those conditions that, by their nature, are to be
satisfied at the Closing (provided such conditions would be satisfied as of such date)) at the time when the Closing would have
occurred pursuant to the Merger Agreement but for the failure of the Equity Financing to be funded, (2) the Debt Financing has been
funded or will be funded at the Closing on the terms set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter or the Definitive Agreements if the
Equity Financing is funded to fund the Merger at the Closing, and (3) Blue Nile has irrevocably confirmed in writing to Parent that if
specific performance is granted and the Equity Financing is funded, then the Closing pursuant to the Merger Agreement will occur.

Blue Nile, Parent and Merger Sub agree not to raise any objections to (A) the granting of an injunction, specific performance or
other equitable relief to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of the Merger Agreement by Blue Nile, on the one hand, or
Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand; and (B) the specific performance of the terms and provisions of the Merger Agreement to
prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants, obligations and agreements of Parent and
Merger Sub pursuant to the Merger Agreement. Any Party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of the Merger
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of the Merger Agreement will not be required to provide any bond or
other security in connection with such injunction or enforcement, and each Blue Nile, Parent and Merger Sub irrevocably waives any
right that it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or other security.

Limitation of Liability

The maximum aggregate liability of Parent and Merger Sub for breaches under the Merger Agreement, the Limited Guaranty or
the Commitment Letters will not exceed, in the aggregate for all such breaches, an amount equal to $32.2 million. Notwithstanding
such limitations of liability, Parent, Merger Sub and Blue Nile will be entitled to an injunction, specific performance or other equitable
relief as provided in the Merger Agreement.

FUTURE STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS

If the Merger is completed, we will have no public stockholders and there will be no public participation in any future meetings of
stockholders of Blue Nile. However, if the Merger is not completed, stockholders will continue to be entitled to attend and participate
in stockholder meetings.

Blue Nile held its 2016 annual meeting of stockholders on May 26, 2016. Blue Nile will hold an annual meeting in 2017 only if
the Merger has not already been completed.

Proposals of stockholders that are intended for inclusion in our proxy statement relating to our annual meeting in 2017, if held,
must be received by us at our offices at 411 First Avenue South, Suite 700, Seattle, WA 98104, Attention: Corporate Secretary, no later

thirty (30) days after the one (1)-year anniversary of the date of the 2016 annual meeting), and must satisfy the conditions established
by the SEC, including, but not limited to, Rule 14a-8 promulgated under the Exchange Act, and in our bylaws for stockholder
proposals in order to be included in our proxy statement for that meeting.

Stockholders may only present a matter for consideration at our annual meeting in 2017, if held, if certain procedures are
followed. Under our bylaws, in order for a matter to be deemed properly presented by a stockholder, timely notice must be received by
our secretary at our principal executive offices not later than the 90th day nor earlier than the close of business on 120th day prior to
the one (1)-year anniversary of the preceding year’s annual meeting, provided, however, that, in the event that the date of the annual
meeting is advanced more than thirty (30) days prior to or delayed by more than thirty (30) days after the anniversary of the preceding
year’s annual meeting, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be so received not earlier than the close of business on the one
hundred twentieth (120th) day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the ninetieth (90th)
day prior to such annual meeting or the tenth (10th) day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting
is first made. In no event shall an adjournment or a postponement of an annual meeting for which notice has been given, or the public
announcement thereof has been made, commence a new time period for the giving of a stockholder’s notice as described above.

Nominations for the election of directors at an annual meeting may be made only (1) pursuant to the corporation’s notice of
meeting of stockholders; (2) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors; or (3) by any stockholder of the corporation who was a
stockholder of record at the time of giving the stockholder’s, who is entitled to vote at the meeting and who complied with the notice
procedures set forth in preceding paragraph. The notice must contain specified information about the nominees and about the
stockholder proposing such nominations.

Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company as amended (the “Charter”), will be amended and restated in its entirety to read

of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holders of any of the following securities,
the following will occur:

(i) each share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Merger Sub that is outstanding as of immediately prior
to the Effective Time will be converted into one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation, and thereupon each certificate representing ownership of such shares of common stock of Merger Sub will thereafter
represent ownership of shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation;

(ii) each share of Company Common Stock that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (other
than Owned Company Shares or Dissenting Company Shares) will be cancelled and extinguished and automatically converted into the
right to receive cash in an amount equal to $40.75, without interest thereon (the “Per Share Price”), in accordance with the provisions
of Section 2.9 (or in the case of a lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, upon delivery of an affidavit (and bond, if required) in accordance
with the provisions of Section 2.11); and

(iii) each share of Company Common Stock that is (1) held by the Company as treasury stock; (2) owned by Parent or
Merger Sub; or (3) owned by any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent or Merger Sub as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time (collectively, the “Owned Company Shares”) will be cancelled and extinguished without any conversion thereof or
consideration paid therefor.

(b) Adjustment to the Per Share Price. The Per Share Price will be adjusted appropriately to reflect the effect of any stock
split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or other distribution of securities convertible into Company Common
Stock), reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other similar change with respect to the
Company Common Stock occurring on or after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time.

voted in favor of the adoption of this Agreement nor consented thereto in writing and who shall have properly and validly exercised
their statutory rights of appraisal in respect of such shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL
(the “Dissenting Company Shares”) will not be converted into, or represent the right to receive, the Per Share Price pursuant to this
Section 2.7. Such Company Stockholders will be entitled to receive payment of the appraised value of such Dissenting Company
Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL, except that all Dissenting Company Shares held by Company
Stockholders who shall have failed to perfect or who shall have effectively withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal of such
Dissenting Company Shares pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL will thereupon be deemed to have been converted into, and to have
become exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive the Per Share Price, without interest thereon, upon surrender of
the Certificates or Uncertificated Shares that formerly evidenced such shares of Company Common Stock in the manner provided in
Section 2.9.

(ii) The Company will give Parent prompt notice of any demands for appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals
of such demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company in respect of Dissenting
Company Shares. Parent shall have the right to control all negotiations and Legal Proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal
pursuant to the DGCL in respect of Dissenting Company Shares. The Company may not, except with the prior written consent of
Parent, make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or settle or offer to settle any such demands in respect of
Dissenting Company Shares.

2.8 Equity Awards.

(a) Company Restricted Stock Units. Unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the Parent and the Company, at the Effective
Time, each Company Restricted Stock Unit outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested,
will, without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holder thereof, be cancelled and converted into and will
become a right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to (i) the amount of the Per Share Price; multiplied by (ii) (1) with
respect to Company Restricted Stock Units that are only subject to time-vesting requirements, the total number of shares of Company
Common Stock subject to such Company Restricted Stock Unit and (2) with respect to Company Restricted Stock Units that are
subject to time- and performance-vesting requirements, the total number of shares of Company Common Stock determined to be
performance vested with the performance goals deemed achieved at maximum levels and with the remaining time-vesting requirements
deemed satisfied (in all cases, the “Company Restricted Stock Unit Consideration”). The payment of the Company Restricted Stock
Unit Consideration will be subject to withholding for all required Taxes.

(b) Company Options. Unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the Parent and the Company, at the Effective Time, each
Company Option (or portion thereof) that is outstanding, whether vested or unvested as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and
that is an In-the-Money Company Option will, without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holder
thereof, be cancelled and converted into and will become a right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to (i) the amount
of the Per Share Price (less the exercise price per share attributable to such Company Option); multiplied by (ii) the total number of
shares of Company Common Stock issuable upon exercise in full of such Company Option (the “Option Consideration”).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, all Company Options that are not In-the-Money Company Options will be
cancelled without any cash payment being made in respect thereof. The payment of the Option Consideration will be subject to
withholding for all required Taxes.

(c) Payment Procedures. No later than the second payroll cycle of the Surviving Corporation following the Effective Time,
the Company or the Surviving Corporation shall pay to the applicable holders of Company Restricted Stock Units and In-the-Money
Company Options, through its payroll system or payroll provider, all amounts required to be paid to such holders in respect of such
Company Restricted Stock Units or In-the-Money Company Options that are cancelled and converted pursuant to Section 2.8(a) and
Section 2.8(b), as applicable. All such payments will be less any applicable withholding Taxes. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any
payment owed to a holder of Company Restricted Stock Units or In-the-Money Company Options pursuant to Section 2.8(a) and
Section 2.8(b), as applicable, cannot be made through the Company’s or the Surviving Corporation’s payroll system or payroll
provider, then the Surviving Corporation will issue a check for such payment to such holder, which check will be sent by overnight
courier to such holder promptly following the time the applicable payments that are made through the payroll system. All such
payments will be less any applicable withholding Taxes.

(d) Further Actions. The Company will pass resolutions necessary to effect the cancellation and exchange, as applicable, of
Company Restricted Stock Units and Company Options upon the Effective Time and to give effect to this Section 2.8 (including the
satisfaction of the requirements of Rule 16b-3(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act), and except as otherwise mutually agreed by
the Parties as provided in Section 2.8(a) through Section 2.8(a), terminate all Company Restricted Stock Units, all Company Options
and all Company

Stock Plans as of the Effective Time, and terminate the provisions in any other Employee Plan, Contract or arrangement providing for
the issuance or grant or vesting of any other interest in respect of the capital stock of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as of the
Effective Time without any liability to Parent, the Company, and Merger Sub. The Company will ensure that, following the Effective
Time, no participant in any Company Stock Plan or other Employee Plan will have any right thereunder to acquire any equity securities
of the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries.

(e) Treatment of Employee Stock Purchase Plan. With respect to the Company’s 2004 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the
“ESPP”), as soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Company Board will adopt resolutions or take all other
actions as may be required to provide that (i) no new participants will commence participation after the date of this Agreement; (ii) no
participant will be allowed to increase his or her payroll contribution rate in effect as of the date of this Agreement or make separate
non-payroll contributions on or following the date of this Agreement; (iii) no new Offering (as defined in the ESPP), Purchase Period
or purchase period will commence or be extended pursuant to the ESPP, in each case, after the date of this Agreement; and (iv) the
ESPP will terminate, in accordance with its terms, no later than immediately prior to and effective as of the Effective Time (but subject
to the consummation of the Merger).

2.9 Exchange of Certificates.

(a) Payment Agent. Prior to the Closing, Parent will (i) select a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the
Company to act as the payment agent for the Merger (the “Payment Agent”); and (ii) enter into a payment agent agreement, in form
and substance reasonably acceptable to the Company, with such Payment Agent.

(b) Exchange Fund. At or prior to the Closing, Parent will deposit (or cause to be deposited) with the Payment Agent, by
wire transfer of immediately available funds, for payment to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.7,
an amount of cash equal to the aggregate consideration to which such holders of Company Common Stock have become entitled
pursuant to Section 2.7. Until disbursed in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, such cash will be invested by
the Payment Agent, as directed by Parent or the Surviving Corporation, in (i) obligations of or fully guaranteed by the United States or
any agency or instrumentality thereof and backed by the full faith and credit of the United States with a maturity of no more than 30
days; (ii) commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. or Standard & Poor’s
Corporation, respectively; or (iii) certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or banker’s acceptances of commercial banks
with capital exceeding $1,000,000,000 (based on the most recent financial statements of such bank that are then publicly available)
(such cash and any proceeds thereon, the “Exchange Fund”). To the extent that (1) there are any losses with respect to any investments
of the Exchange Fund; (2) the Exchange Fund diminishes for any reason below the level required for the Payment Agent to promptly
pay the cash amounts owed pursuant to Section 2.7; or (3) all or any portion of the Exchange Fund is unavailable for Parent (or the
Payment Agent on behalf of Parent) to promptly pay the cash amounts owed pursuant to Section 2.7 for any reason, Parent will, or will
cause the Surviving Corporation to, promptly replace or restore the amount of cash in the Exchange Fund so as to ensure that the
Exchange Fund is at all times fully available for distribution and maintained at a level sufficient for the Payment Agent to make the
payments owed pursuant to Section 2.7. Any income from investment of the Exchange Fund will be payable to Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, as Parent directs.

(c) Payment Procedures. Promptly following the Effective Time (and in any event within three Business Days), Parent and
the Surviving Corporation will cause the Payment Agent to mail to each holder of record (as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time) of (1) a certificate or certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company
Common Stock (other than Dissenting Company Shares and Owned Company Shares) (the “Certificates”); and (2) uncertificated
shares of Company Common Stock that represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (other than Dissenting Company
Shares and Owned Company Shares) (the “Uncertificated Shares”) (A) a letter of transmittal in customary form (which

will specify that delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates will pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to
the Payment Agent); and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates and Uncertificated Shares in exchange for
the Per Share Price payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.7. Upon surrender of Certificates for cancellation to the Payment
Agent, together with such letter of transmittal duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, the
holders of such Certificates will be entitled to receive in exchange therefor an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by
multiplying (x) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate; by (y) the Per Share Price
(less any applicable withholding Taxes payable in respect thereof), and the Certificates so surrendered will forthwith be cancelled.
Upon receipt of an “agent’s message” by the Payment Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Payment Agent may
reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares, the holders of such Uncertificated Shares will be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (I) the aggregate number of
shares of Company Common Stock represented by such holder’s transferred Uncertificated Shares; by (II) the Per Share Price (less any
applicable withholding Taxes payable in respect thereof), and the transferred Uncertificated Shares so surrendered will be cancelled.
The Payment Agent will accept such Certificates and transferred Uncertificated Shares upon compliance with such reasonable terms
and conditions as the Payment Agent may impose to cause an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices.
No interest will be paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of the Certificates and Uncertificated Shares on the Per Share Price
payable upon the surrender of such Certificates and Uncertificated Shares pursuant to this Section 2.9(c). Until so surrendered,
outstanding Certificates and Uncertificated Shares will be deemed from and after the Effective Time to evidence only the right to
receive the Per Share Price, without interest thereon, payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.7. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, no holder of Uncertificated Shares will be required to provide a Certificate or an executed letter of
transmittal to the Payment Agent in order to receive the payment that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to Section 2.7.

(d) DTC Payment. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Company will cooperate to establish procedures with the
Payment Agent and the Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) with the objective that the Payment Agent will transmit to DTC or its
nominees on the first Business Day after the Closing Date an amount in cash, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, equal to
(i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock (other than Owned Company Shares and Dissenting Company Shares) held of
record by DTC or such nominee immediately prior to the Effective Time; multiplied by (ii) the Per Share Price.

(e) Transfers of Ownership. If a transfer of ownership of shares of Company Common Stock is not registered in the stock
transfer books or ledger of the Company, or if the Per Share Price is to be paid in a name other than that in which the Certificates
surrendered or transferred in exchange therefor are registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the Company, the Per Share Price
may be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered or transferred is registered in the stock
transfer books or ledger of the Company only if such Certificate is properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for surrender and
transfer and the Person requesting such payment has paid to Parent (or any agent designated by Parent) any transfer Taxes required by
reason of the payment of the Per Share Price to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate, or established to the
satisfaction of Parent (or any agent designated by Parent) that such transfer Taxes have been paid or are otherwise not payable.
Payment of the applicable Per Share Price with respect to Uncertificated Shares will only be made to the Person in whose name such
Uncertificated Shares are registered.

(f) No Liability. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, none of the Payment Agent, Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or any other Party will be liable to a holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any amount properly
paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

(g) Distribution of Exchange Fund to Parent. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of
the Certificates or Uncertificated Shares on the date that is one year after the Effective Time will be delivered to Parent upon demand,
and any holders of shares of Company Common Stock

that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Merger who have not theretofore surrendered or transferred their Certificates
or Uncertificated Shares representing such shares of Company Common Stock for exchange pursuant to this Section 2.9 will thereafter
look for payment of the Per Share Price payable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificates
or Uncertificated Shares solely to Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws), solely as general creditors thereof,
for any claim to the Per Share Price to which such holders may be entitled pursuant to Section 2.7. Any amounts remaining unclaimed
by holders of any such Certificates or Uncertificated Shares two years after the Effective Time, or at such earlier date as is immediately
prior to the time at which such amounts would otherwise escheat to, or become property of, any Governmental Authority, will, to the
extent permitted by applicable law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation free and clear of any claims or interest of any
such holders (and their successors, assigns or personal representatives) previously entitled thereto.

2.10 No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock. From and after the Effective Time, (a) all shares of Company
Common Stock will no longer be outstanding and will automatically be cancelled, retired and cease to exist; and (b) each holder of a
Certificate or Uncertificated Shares theretofore representing any shares of Company Common Stock will cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the right to receive the Per Share Price payable therefor in accordance with Section 2.7, or in the case of
Dissenting Company Shares, the rights pursuant to Section 2.7(c). The Per Share Price paid in accordance with the terms of this
Article II will be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock. From
and after the Effective Time, there will be no further registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving Corporation of shares of
Company Common Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than transfers to reflect, in
accordance with customary settlement procedures, trades effected prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates
or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they will (subject to compliance with the exchange
procedures of Section 2.9(c)) be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article II.

2.11 Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event that any Certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Payment
Agent will issue in exchange therefor, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the Per Share Price payable in
respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.7. Parent or the Payment Agent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment
of such Per Share Price, require the owners of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in such amount as it may
direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Payment Agent with respect to
the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

2.12 Required Withholding. Each of the Payment Agent, Parent, the Company and the Surviving Corporation will be entitled to
deduct and withhold from any cash amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder or former holder of shares of Company
Common Stock, Company Restricted Stock Units or Company Options such amounts as are required to be deducted or withheld
therefrom pursuant to any Tax Laws. To the extent that such amounts are so deducted or withheld and paid over to the appropriate
Governmental Authority, such amounts will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom
such amounts would otherwise have been paid.

2.13 No Dividends or Distributions. No dividends or other distributions with respect to capital stock of the Surviving Corporation
with a record date on or after the Effective Time will be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificates or Uncertificated Shares.

2.14 Necessary Further Actions. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out
the purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and possession to all assets, property, rights,
privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub, then the directors and officers of the Company and Merger Sub as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time will take all such lawful and necessary action.

3.1 Organization; Good Standing. The Company (a) is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing
pursuant to the DGCL; and (b) has the requisite corporate power and authority to conduct its business as it is presently being conducted
and to own, lease or operate its properties and assets. The Company is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction where the character of its properties owned or leased or the nature of its activities make such qualification necessary (to the
extent that the concept of “good standing” is applicable in the case of any jurisdiction outside the United States), except where the
failure to be so qualified or in good standing would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company has made available to
Parent true, correct and complete copies of the Charter and the Amended and Restated Bylaws of the Company (the “Bylaws”), each as
amended to date. The Company is not in violation of the Charter or the Bylaws.

3.2 Corporate Power; Enforceability. The Company has the requisite corporate power and authority to (a) execute and deliver

covenants and obligations hereunder, and the consummation of the Merger have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action

and delivery of this Agreement by the Company; (ii) the performance by the Company of its covenants and obligations hereunder; or
(iii) subject to the receipt of the Requisite Stockholder Approval, the consummation of the Merger. This Agreement has been duly
executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by Parent and Merger Sub,
constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except

Company Stockholders, and declared it advisable, to enter into this Agreement and consummate the Merger upon the terms and subject

of its financial advisor, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated (the “Advisor”), to the effect that, as of the date of such

the Merger by the holders of shares of Company Common Stock (other than Owned Company Shares or Dissenting Company Shares)
pursuant to this Agreement is fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders (it being understood and agreed that such written
opinion is for the benefit of the Company Board and may not be relied upon by Parent or Merger Sub).

(c) Anti-Takeover Laws. Assuming that the representations of Parent and Merger Sub set forth in Section 4.6 are true and
correct, the Company Board has taken all necessary actions so that the restrictions on business combinations set forth in Section 203 of
the DGCL and any other similar applicable “anti-takeover” law will not be applicable to the Merger.

3.4 Requisite Stockholder Approval. Assuming that the representations of Parent and Merger Sub set forth in Section 4.6 are true
and correct, the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock entitled to vote to
adopt this Agreement (the “Requisite Stockholder Approval”) is the only vote of the holders of any class or series of Company
Capital Stock that is necessary pursuant to applicable Law, the Charter or the Bylaws to adopt this Agreement and consummate the
Merger.

3.5 Non-Contravention. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company, the performance by the Company of its
covenants and obligations hereunder, and the consummation of the Merger do not (a) violate or conflict with any provision of the
Charter or the Bylaws; (b) violate, conflict with, result in the breach of, constitute a default (or an event that, with notice or lapse of
time or both, would become a default) pursuant to, result in the termination of, accelerate the performance required by, or result in a
right of termination or acceleration pursuant to any Material Contract; (c) assuming compliance with the matters referred to in
Section 3.6 and, in the case of the consummation of the Merger, subject to obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Approval, violate or
conflict with any Law applicable to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or by which any of their respective properties or assets are
bound; or (d) result in the creation of any lien (other than Permitted Liens) upon any of the properties or assets of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, except in the case of each of clauses (b), (c) and (d) for such violations, conflicts, breaches, defaults, terminations,
accelerations or liens that would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

3.6 Requisite Governmental Approvals. No consent, approval, order or authorization of, filing or registration with, or notification
to (any of the foregoing, a “Consent”) any Governmental Authority is required on the part of the Company (a) in connection with the
execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company; (b) the performance by the Company of its covenants and obligations
pursuant to this Agreement; or (c) the consummation of the Merger, except (i) the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary
of State of the State of Delaware and such filings with Governmental Authorities to satisfy the applicable laws of states in which the
Company and its Subsidiaries are qualified to do business; (ii) such filings and approvals as may be required by any federal or state
securities laws, including compliance with any applicable requirements of the Exchange Act; (iii) compliance with any applicable
requirements of the HSR Act and any applicable foreign Antitrust Laws; and (iv) such other Consents the failure of which to obtain
would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

(c) Absence of Liens. The Company or one of its Subsidiaries owns each item of material Company Intellectual Property
free and clear of any liens (other than Permitted Liens).

“SaaS” license) granted by the Company or its Subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business or in connection with the marketing,
advertising, provision, or sale of services and products by the Company or its Subsidiaries to customers, distributors, or marketing or

Property.

the computer hardware, firmware, databases, Software, systems, information technology infrastructure, and other similar or related
items of automated, computerized and/or software systems and infrastructure used, controlled, or relied upon by the Company and the
Subsidiaries in the operation of their business (whether or not outsourced) (collectively, the “Company Systems”) are sufficient in all
material respects for the current needs of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries. The Company and its Subsidiaries have not
disclosed, delivered, licensed or otherwise made available, and do not have a duty or obligation (whether present, contingent, or

Property to any Person other than consultants bound by non-disclosure obligations who are authorized to use the source code solely for
the benefit of the Company or its Subsidiaries.

its Subsidiaries is distributed in material compliance with the applicable Open Source License, except as would not have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. To the Knowledge of the Company, except as would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect, neither the

United States federal, state, local and non-United States returns, estimates, information statements and reports (including amendments
thereto) relating to any and all Taxes (“Tax Returns”) required to be filed by any of them, and all such filed Tax Returns are true,
correct, and complete except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has executed any waiver, except in connection with any ongoing Tax examination, of any statute
of limitations on, or extended the period for the assessment or collection of, any material Tax, in each case that has not since expired.

(b) Taxes Paid. Except as would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect, the Company and each of its Subsidiaries has

except with respect to matters contested in good faith for which adequate reserves have been established on the face of the Audited
Company Balance Sheet (as opposed to the notes thereto and in accordance with GAAP) through the date of the Audited Company
Balance Sheet. The most recent financial statements contained in the Company SEC Reports reflect an adequate reserve (in accordance
with GAAP) for all Taxes accrued but not then payable by the Company and its Subsidiaries through the date of such financial
statements.

(c) No Audits. No audits or other examinations with respect to Taxes of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries are presently

threatened or proposed other than in writing. No written claim has ever been made by a Governmental Authority in a jurisdiction where
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries does not file Tax Returns that the Company or such Subsidiary, as the case may be, is or may be
subject to Tax in that jurisdiction and, to the Knowledge of the Company, no such claim has been made other than in writing.

corporation” or a “controlled corporation” in a distribution of stock intended to qualify for tax-free treatment pursuant to Section 355
of the Code or been involved in a transaction governed by a similar provision of state, local, or non-U.S. law.

Proposal or any inquiries or the making of any proposal that would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal;
(3) participate, engage in or continue discussions or negotiations with any Person with respect to an Acquisition Proposal or inquiry

Acquisition Proposal that was not solicited in material breach of Section 5.3(b); provided, however, that the Company Board has
determined in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that such Acquisition Proposal either
constitutes a Superior Proposal or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal, and the Company Board has determined in good
faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that the failure to take the actions contemplated by this
Section 5.3(c) would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable law; and provided further, however, that the
Company will promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) make available to Parent any non-public information concerning the
Company and its Subsidiaries that is provided to any such Person or its Representatives that was not previously made available to
Parent.

(d) No Change in Company Board Recommendation or Entry into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement. Except as provided
by Section 5.3(e), at no time after the date of this Agreement may the Company Board :

(i) (1) withhold, withdraw, amend, qualify or modify, or publicly propose to withhold, withdraw, amend, qualify or
modify, the Company Board Recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent in any material respect; (2) adopt, approve, endorse,
recommend or otherwise declare advisable an Acquisition Proposal; (3) fail to publicly reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation
following the public disclosure of an Acquisition Proposal within five Business Days after Parent so requests in writing (it being
understood that the Company will have no obligation to make such reaffirmation on more than two separate occasions); (4) take or fail
to take any formal action or make or fail to make any recommendation or public statement in connection with a tender or exchange
offer, other than a recommendation against such offer or a “stop, look and listen” communication by the Company Board to the
Company Stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any substantially similar communication)
(it being understood that the Company Board may refrain from taking a position with respect to an Acquisition Proposal until the close
of business on the 10th Business Day after the commencement of a tender or exchange offer in connection with such Acquisition
Proposal without such action being considered a violation of this Section 5.3); or (5) fail to include the Company Board
Recommendation in the Proxy Statement (any action described in clauses (1) through (5), a “Company Board Recommendation
Change”); provided, however, that, for the avoidance of doubt, none of (A) the determination by the Company Board that an
Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal or (B) the delivery by the Company to Parent of
any notice contemplated by Section 5.3(e) will, in and of itself, constitute a Company Board Recommendation Change or violate this
Section 5.3; or

(ii) cause or permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement.

(e) Company Board Recommendation Change; Entry into Alternative Acquisition Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary set forth in this Agreement, at any time prior to obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Approval:

(i) other than in connection with a bona fide Acquisition Proposal that constitutes a Superior Proposal (which, for the
avoidance of doubt, is governed exclusively by clause (ii) below), the Company Board may effect a Company Board Recommendation
Change in response to any effect, event, development, occurrence or change in circumstances with respect to the Company that (A)
was not known to the Company Board as of the date of this Agreement and (B) does not relate to any Acquisition Proposal (each such
event, an “Intervening Event”), if the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that
the failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable Law and if and only if:

(1) the Company has provided prior written notice to Parent at least five Business Days in advance to the effect
that the Company Board has (A) so determined; and (B) resolved to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change pursuant to this
Section 5.3(e)(i), which notice will describe the applicable Intervening Event in reasonable detail; and

(2) prior to effecting such Company Board Recommendation Change, the Company and its Representatives,
during such five Business Day period, must have negotiated with Parent and its Representatives in good faith (to the extent that Parent
desires to so negotiate) to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that the Company Board no longer
determines that the failure to make a Company Board Recommendation Change in response to such Intervening Event would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable law; or

(ii) if the Company has received a bona fide Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board has concluded in good
faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) is a Superior Proposal, then the Company Board may
(x) effect a Company Board Recommendation Change with respect to such Acquisition Proposal; or (y) authorize and cause the
Company to terminate this Agreement to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Acquisition Proposal, in
each case if and only if:

(1) the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal
counsel) that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable law;

(2) the Company has complied in all material respects with its obligations pursuant to this Section 5.3 with
respect to such Acquisition Proposal;

(3) (A) the Company has provided prior written notice to Parent at least five Business Days in advance (the
“Notice Period”) to the effect that the Company Board has (I) received a bona fide Acquisition Proposal that has not been withdrawn;
(II) concluded in good faith that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal; and (III) resolved to effect a Company
Board Recommendation Change or to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 5.3(e)(ii) absent any revision to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, which notice will describe the basis for such Company Board Recommendation Change or termination in
reasonable detail, including the identity of the Person or “group” of Persons making such Acquisition Proposal, the material terms
thereof and copies of all material documents relating to such Acquisition Proposal; and (B) prior to effecting such Company Board
Recommendation Change or termination, the Company and its Representatives, during the Notice Period, must have negotiated with
Parent and its Representatives in good faith (to the extent that Parent desires to so negotiate) to make such adjustments to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement so that such Acquisition Proposal would cease to constitute a Superior Proposal; provided, however, that
in the event of any material revisions to such Acquisition Proposal, the Company will be required to deliver a new written notice to
Parent and to comply with the requirements of this Section 5.3(e)(ii)(3) with respect to such new written notice (it being understood
that the “Notice Period” in respect of such new written notice will be two Business Days); and

(4) in the event of any termination of this Agreement in order to cause or permit the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Acquisition Proposal, the Company will have
validly terminated this Agreement in accordance with Section 8.1(h), including paying the Company Termination Fee in accordance
with Section 8.3(b)(iii).

The Company shall keep confidential any proposals made by Parent to modify the terms of this Agreement, other than in the event of
any amendment to this Agreement and to the extent required by applicable Law to be disclosed in any Company SEC Reports.

(f) Notice. From the date of this Agreement until the earlier to occur of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to
Article VIII and the Effective Time, the Company will promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) notify Parent if any inquiries, offers
or proposals that constitute, or are reasonably expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal are received by, any non-public information
is requested from, or any discussions or negotiations are sought to be initiated or continued with, the Company or any of its
Representatives. Such notice must include (i) the identity of the Person or “group” of Persons making such offers or proposals and

summary of the material terms and conditions of such offers or proposals. Thereafter, the Company must keep Parent reasonably
informed, on a prompt basis, of the status and terms of any such offers or proposals (including any amendments thereto) and the status
of any such discussions or negotiations. The Company shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) following a determination by
the Company Board that an Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal, notify Parent of such determination.

(g) Certain Disclosures. Nothing in this Agreement will prohibit the Company or the Company Board from (i) taking and
disclosing to the Company Stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or complying
with Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act, including a “stop, look and listen” communication by the Company Board to
the Company Stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any substantially similar
communication); (ii) complying with Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act; (iii) informing any
Person of the existence of the provisions contained in this Section 5.3; or (iv) making any disclosure to the Company Stockholders
(including regarding the business, financial condition or results of operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries) that the Company
Board has determined to make in good faith in order to comply with applicable law, it being understood that any such statement or
disclosure made by the Company Board pursuant to this Section 5.3(g) must be subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement
and will not limit or otherwise affect the obligations of the Company or the Company Board and the rights of Parent under this
Section 5.3, it being understood that nothing in the foregoing will be deemed to permit the Company or the Company Board to effect a
Company Board Recommendation Change other than in accordance with Section 5.3(e). Any disclosure by the Company or the
Company Board relating to an Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be a Company Board Recommendation Change unless the
Company Board expressly publicly reaffirms the Company Board Recommendation in such disclosure.

(h) Breach by Representatives. The Company agrees that any breach of this Section 5.3 by any of its Representatives that, if
taken by the Company, would be a breach of this Section 5.3, then such action will be deemed to be a breach of this Section 5.3 by the
Company.

(i) Waiver. The Company may waive or fail to enforce any standstill or similar provision in any confidentiality or other
agreement it has entered into with any Person, whether prior to or after the date hereof, solely in order to permit non-public Alternative
Proposals to be made to the Company Board and otherwise only, if in the good faith judgment of the Company Board, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, the failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable
Law.

pursuant to any Material Contracts in connection with this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger so as to seek to maintain
and preserve the benefits to the Surviving Corporation of such Material Contracts as of and following the consummation of the Merger.

(b) No Failure to Take Necessary Action. In addition to the foregoing, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
neither Parent or Merger Sub, on the one hand, nor the Company, on the other hand, will take any action, or fail to take any action, that
is intended to or has (or would reasonably be expected to have) the effect of (i) preventing, impairing, delaying or otherwise adversely

(including a guaranty), in connection with the Merger, including in connection with obtaining any consent pursuant to any Material
Contract.

cause the other to be supplied) with any information that may be required in order to make such filings; (C) supply (or cause the other

respect to the Merger pursuant to the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Laws applicable to the Merger, then such Party will make (or
cause to be made), as soon as reasonably practicable and after consultation with the other Parties, an appropriate response in
compliance with such request.

Company, Parent and Merger Sub may designate any non-public information provided to any Governmental Authority as restricted to
“outside counsel” only and any such information shall not be shared with employees, officers or directors or their equivalents of the
other party without approval of the party providing the non-public information; provided, however, that before sharing any information

Merger Sub may redact any information (A) to remove references concerning valuation of the Company, (B) as necessary to comply

relating to the Company Stockholder Meeting. Subject to Section 5.3, the Company must include the Company Board
Recommendation in the Proxy Statement.

(b) Other Required Company Filing. If the Company determines that it is required to file any document other than the Proxy

Statement nor any Other Required Company Filing shall contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
are made, not false or misleading. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no covenant is made by the Company with respect to any
information supplied by Parent, Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement
or any Other Required Company Filing. The information supplied by the Company for inclusion or incorporation by reference in any
Other Required Parent Filings will not, at the time that such Other Required Parent Filing is filed with the SEC, contain any untrue

(or any amendment thereto) with the SEC without first providing the Company and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment thereon, and Parent shall give due consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by the

of their respective Affiliates should be discovered by the Company, on the one hand, or Parent or Merger Sub, on the other hand, that
should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, any Other Required Company Filing or any Other Required
Parent Filing, as the case may be, so that such filing would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading, then the Party that discovers such information will promptly notify the other, and an appropriate amendment or
supplement to such filing describing such information will be promptly prepared and filed with the SEC by the appropriate Party and,
to the extent required by applicable Law or the SEC or its staff, disseminated to the Company Stockholders.

Sub and their respective Affiliates, on the other hand, may not communicate in writing with the SEC or its staff with respect to the
Proxy Statement, any Other Required Company Filing or any Other Required Parent Filing, as the case may be, without first providing

6.4 Company Stockholder Meeting.

(a) Call of Company Stockholder Meeting. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, the Company will take all action
necessary in accordance with the DGCL, the Charter, the Bylaws and the rules of NASDAQ to establish a record date for (and the
Company shall not change such record date without the prior written consent of Parent), duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a
meeting of its stockholders (the “Company Stockholder Meeting”) as promptly as reasonably practicable following the mailing of the
Proxy Statement to the Company Stockholders for the purpose of obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Approval. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company will not be required to convene and hold the Company Stockholder Meeting

Section 5.3 and unless there has been a Company Board Recommendation Change, the Company will use its reasonable best efforts to
solicit proxies to obtain the Requisite Stockholder Approval.

(b) Adjournment of Company Stockholder Meeting. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, nothing
will prevent the Company from postponing or adjourning the Company Stockholder Meeting if (i) there are holders of an insufficient

the Company Stockholder Meeting by applicable law, order or a request from the SEC or its staff or (iii) the Company Board has

postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting, including in order to give the Company Stockholders sufficient time to
evaluate any information or disclosure that the Company has sent to the Company Stockholders or otherwise made publicly available
to the Company Stockholders (including in connection with a Company Board Recommendation Change); provided that the Company
Stockholder Meeting may not be postponed or adjourned pursuant to this clause (iii) on more than two separate occasions or for more
than five Business Days for each such postponement or adjournment. Unless this Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with
Section 8.1, the Company shall submit the adoption of this Agreement to its stockholders at the Company Stockholder Meeting even if
the Company Board shall have effected a Company Board Recommendation Change.

6.5 Financing.

(a) No Amendments to Commitment Letters. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of Parent and
Merger Sub will not permit any amendment or modification to be made to, or any waiver of any material provision or remedy pursuant
to, or any replacement of, the Commitment Letters or the Fee Letter if such amendment, modification, waiver or replacement would, or
would reasonably be expected to, (i) reduce the aggregate amount of the Financing below the Required Financing Amount (calculated
net of the cash and cash equivalents of the Company and its Subsidiaries); (ii) impose new or additional conditions to the receipt of the
Financing or otherwise expand, adversely amend or modify any of the conditions to the receipt of the Financing in a manner that would
reasonably be expected to (A) materially delay or prevent the Closing Date; or (B) make the timely funding of the Financing, or the
satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the Financing, less likely to occur when required pursuant to the terms hereof; or
(iii) materially and adversely impact the ability of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company, as applicable, to enforce its rights against the
Guarantor under the Equity Commitment Letter or the ability of Parent and Merger Sub to enforce their rights under the Debt
Commitment Letter (it being understood that inter alia Parent and Merger Sub may: (x) modify pricing and implement or exercise any
of the “market flex” provisions exercised by the Lenders in accordance with the Debt Commitment Letter and (y) add
additional lenders and Financing Sources (including in replacement of a Lender) to the Debt Commitment Letter (or all or a portion of

assign titles and roles to or among parties to the Debt Commitment Letter. Within two Business Days of receipt, Parent and Merger Sub

unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter (other than a breach by the Company of this
Agreement which prevents or renders impracticable the consummation of the Financing) Parent will use its reasonable best efforts to
(A) arrange alternative debt financing (the “Alternative Debt Financing”) from the same or alternative sources in an amount sufficient
to pay the Required Financing Amount on terms and conditions taken as a whole (including any “market flex” provisions in the Fee
Letter), that are not less favorable to Parent and Merger Sub or that are otherwise acceptable to Parent; and (B) to obtain one or more
new financing commitment letters with respect to such Alternative Debt Financing and Parent shall promptly provide the Company
with a copy of such new financing commitment letters with respect to such Alternate Debt Financing (and any fee letter in connection
therewith; provided, such fee letter may be redacted to omit the fee amounts, original issue discount, pricing caps and other economic
terms and the “market flex” provisions thereof, none of which would adversely affect the amount, conditionality or availability of the
Debt Financing contemplated thereby (other than through the operation of the original issue discount)); provided that in no event shall
the reasonable best efforts of Parent be deemed or construed to require Parent to (A) pay any fees, taken as a whole, in excess of those
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter and Fee Letter as in effect on the date hereof, or (B) agree to conditionality or economic
terms of the Alternative Debt Financing that taken as a whole are less favorable than those contemplated by the Debt Commitment
Letter or the Fee Letter (including any flex provisions therein). Any reference in this Agreement to (1) the “Financing” will include the
financing contemplated by the Commitment Letters as amended, modified, waived or replaced, and any Alternative Debt Financing
obtained, in compliance with this Section 6.5; and (2) the “Commitment Letters” and the Fee Letter will include such documents as
amended, modified, waived or replaced, or any Alternative Debt Financing obtained, in compliance with this Section 6.5. Upon the
reasonable request of the Company, Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to keep the Company reasonably informed of the status of
its efforts to arrange the Financing, including promptly notifying the Company of the receipt by Parent or Merger Sub of any written
notice or other written communication from any Financing Source with respect to any (i) breach or default which would permit any
party to a Commitment Letter to terminate its obligations thereunder or (ii) any termination or repudiation by any party to a
Commitment Letter, which termination or repudiation would result in Parent and Merger Sub not having the Required Financing
Amount on the Closing Date.

(b) Taking of Necessary Actions. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of Parent and Merger Sub will
use its respective reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary to
obtain the Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Commitment Letters and the Fee Letter, including using its
reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in effect the Commitment Letters in accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions
thereof until the initial funding of the Financing; (ii) negotiate definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Financing on terms and
conditions as specified in the Debt Commitment Letters and (iii) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions to funding the Financing that
are applicable to Parent and Merger Sub in the Commitment Letters and the Fee Letter; (iii) if all of the conditions to the Financing and
in Article VII of this Agreement have been satisfied or waived, consummate the Financing to the extent necessary to consummate the
Merger at Closing; and (iv) comply with its obligations pursuant to the Commitment Letters.

(c) Enforcement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, nothing contained in this
Section 6.5 will require, and in no event will the reasonable best efforts of Parent or Merger Sub be deemed or construed to require,
either Parent or Merger Sub to other than with respect to any Alternative Debt Financing, seek the Financing from any source other
than a counterparty to, or in any amount in excess of that contemplated by, the Commitment Letters.

(d) No Financing Condition. Parent and Merger Sub each acknowledge and agree that obtaining the Financing is not a
condition to the Closing. If the Financing has not been obtained, Parent and Merger Sub will each continue to be obligated, subject to
the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VII, to consummate the Merger at the time contemplated by Section 2.3.

prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, any Indemnified Person delivers to Parent a written notice asserting a claim for
indemnification pursuant to this Section 6.10(b), then the claim asserted in such notice will survive the sixth anniversary of the
Effective Time until such claim is fully and finally resolved. In the event of any such Legal Proceeding, (1) the Surviving Corporation
will have the right to control the defense thereof after the Effective Time (it being understood that, by electing to control the defense
thereof, the Surviving Corporation will be deemed to have waived any right to object to the Indemnified Person’s entitlement to
indemnification hereunder with respect thereto); (2) each Indemnified Person will be entitled to retain his or her own counsel, whether
or not the Surviving Corporation elects to control the defense of any such Legal Proceeding; (3) the Surviving Corporation will
advance all fees and expenses (including fees and expenses of any counsel) as incurred by an Indemnified Person in the defense of such
Legal Proceeding, whether or not the Surviving Corporation elects to control the defense of any such Legal Proceeding; and (4) no
Indemnified Person will be liable for any settlement of such Legal Proceeding effected without his or her prior written consent (unless
such settlement relates only to monetary damages for which the Surviving Corporation is entirely responsible). Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, none of Parent, the Surviving Corporation nor any of their respective Affiliates will settle
or otherwise compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, or otherwise seek the termination of, any Legal
Proceeding for which indemnification may be sought by an Indemnified Person pursuant to this Agreement unless such settlement,
compromise, consent or termination includes an unconditional release of all Indemnified Persons from all liability arising out of such
Legal Proceeding. Any determination required to be made with respect to whether the conduct of any Indemnified Person complies or
complied with any applicable standard will be made by independent legal counsel selected by the Surviving Corporation (which
counsel will be reasonably acceptable to such Indemnified Person), the fees and expenses of which will be paid by the Surviving
Corporation.

(c) D&O Insurance. During the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth anniversary of the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to) maintain in effect the Company’s
current directors’ and officers’ liability insurance (“D&O Insurance”) in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time on terms (including with respect to coverage, conditions, retentions, limits and amounts) that are equivalent to those of
the D&O

Insurance. In satisfying its obligations pursuant to this Section 6.10(c), the Surviving Corporation will not be obligated to pay annual
premiums in excess of 300% of the amount paid by the Company for coverage for its last full fiscal year (such 300% amount, the
“Maximum Annual Premium”). If the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed the Maximum Annual Premium, then the
Surviving Corporation will be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding the Maximum
Annual Premium from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Company’s current directors’ and officers’
liability insurance carrier. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company may (and at Parent’s request shall) purchase a prepaid “tail” policy
with respect to the D&O Insurance from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Company’s current directors’
and officers’ liability insurance carrier so long as the annual cost for such “tail” policy does not exceed the Maximum Annual
Premium. If the Company purchases such a “tail” policy prior to the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will (and Parent will
cause the Surviving Corporation to) maintain such “tail” policy in full force and effect and continue to honor its obligations thereunder
for so long as such “tail” policy is in full force and effect.

(d) Successors and Assigns. If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns will
(i) consolidate with or merge into any other Person and not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or
merger; or (ii) transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then proper provisions will be made so that the
successors and assigns of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns will assume all of the
obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation set forth in this Section 6.10.

(e) No Impairment. The obligations set forth in this Section 6.10 may not be terminated, amended or otherwise modified in
any manner that adversely affects any Indemnified Person (or any other person who is a beneficiary pursuant to the D&O Insurance or
the “tail” policy referred to in Section 6.10(c) (and their heirs and representatives)) without the prior written consent of such affected
Indemnified Person or other person. Each of the Indemnified Persons or other persons who are beneficiaries pursuant to the D&O
Insurance or the “tail” policy referred to in Section 6.10(c) (and their heirs and representatives) are intended to be third party
beneficiaries of this Section 6.10, with full rights of enforcement as if a Party. The rights of the Indemnified Persons (and other persons
who are beneficiaries pursuant to the D&O Insurance or the “tail” policy referred to in Section 6.10(c) (and their heirs and
representatives)) pursuant to this Section 6.10 will be in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights that such persons may
have pursuant to (i) the Charter and Bylaws; (ii) the similar organizational documents of the Subsidiaries of the Company; (iii) any and
all indemnification agreements entered into with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; or (iv) applicable Law (whether at law or in
equity).

(f) Joint and Several Obligations. The obligations of the Surviving Corporation, Parent and their respective Subsidiaries
pursuant to this Section 6.10 will be joint and several.

(g) Other Claims. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, or will be construed to, release, waive or impair any rights to
directors’ and officers’ insurance claims pursuant to any applicable insurance policy or indemnification agreement that is or has been in
existence with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of their respective directors, officers or other employees, it
being understood and agreed that the indemnification provided for in this Section 6.10 is not prior to or in substitution for any such
claims pursuant to such policies or agreements.

6.11 Employee Matters.

(a) Acknowledgement. Parent hereby acknowledges and agrees that a “change of control” (or similar phrase) within the
meaning of the Employee Plans will occur as of the Effective Time.

(b) Existing Arrangements. Subject to Section 6.11(c) below, nothing will prohibit the Surviving Corporation from in any
way amending, modifying or terminating any Employee Plans or compensation or severance arrangements in accordance with their
terms or if required pursuant to applicable law.

(c) Employment; Benefits. For a period of one year following the Effective Time (or, if earlier, until the date of termination
of the relevant Continuing Employee), the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries will (and Parent will cause the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) either (i) maintain for the benefit of each Continuing Employee the Employee Plans (other than
change in control, retention, long term incentive, nonqualified deferred compensation and equity-based compensation or benefits and
individual employment or other compensation agreements (except with respect to the severance terms contained therein)) (the
“Company Plans”) at benefit levels that, taken as a whole, are substantially comparable in the aggregate to those in effect at the
Company or its applicable Subsidiaries on the date of this Agreement, and provide compensation and benefits (other than change in
control, retention, long term incentive, nonqualified deferred compensation and equity-based compensation or benefits and individual
employment or other compensation agreements (except with respect to severance terms contained therein)) to each Continuing
Employee pursuant to such Company Plans; (ii) provide compensation, benefits and severance payments (other than change in control,
retention, long term incentive, nonqualified deferred compensation and equity-based benefits and individual employment or other
compensation agreements except with respect to severance terms contained therein)) to each Continuing Employee that, taken as a
whole, are substantially comparable in the aggregate to the compensation, benefits and severance payments (other than change in
control, retention, long term incentive, nonqualified deferred compensation and equity-based benefits and individual employment or
other compensation agreements (except with respect to the severance terms contained therein)) provided to such Continuing Employee
immediately prior to the Effective Time under the Company Plans (“Comparable Plans”); or (iii) provide some combination of
Company Plans and Comparable Plans such that each Continuing Employee receives compensation, benefits and severance payments
(other than change in control, retention, long term incentive, nonqualified deferred compensation and equity-based benefits and
individual employment or other compensation agreements (except with respect to the severance terms contained therein)) that, taken as
a whole, are substantially comparable in the aggregate to the compensation, benefits and severance payments (other than change in
control, retention, long term incentive, nonqualified deferred compensation and equity-based benefits and individual employment or
other compensation agreements (except with respect to the severance terms contained therein)) provided to such Continuing Employee
immediately prior to the Effective Time under the Company Plans. In each case, base compensation and target incentive compensation
opportunity will not be decreased for a period of one year following the Effective Time for any Continuing Employee employed during
that period. For a period of one year following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will (and Parent will cause the Surviving
Corporation to) provide severance benefits to eligible employees in accordance with the Company’s severance plans, guidelines and
practices as in effect on the date of this Agreement and that have been made available to Parent prior to the date hereof.

(d) New Plans. To the extent that a Company Plan or Comparable Plan is made available to any Continuing Employee at or
after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries will (and Parent will use reasonable best efforts to cause the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) cause to be granted to such Continuing Employee credit for all service with the
Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time for purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting and for purposes of
vacation accrual and severance pay entitlement to the same extent such service was recognized under such Company Plan (or, in the
case of a Comparable Plan, under the similar Company Plan), except that such service need not be credited to the extent that it would
result in duplication of coverage or compensation or benefits or for any purpose under any equity-based plan. In addition, and without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, (i) each Continuing Employee will be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting
period, in any and all employee benefit plans sponsored by the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries (other than the Company
Plans and other than any equity-based plan) (such plans, the “New Plans”) to the extent that coverage pursuant to any such New Plan
replaces in the plan year in which the Closing occurs coverage pursuant to a comparable Company Plan in which such Continuing
Employee participates immediately before the Effective Time (such plans, the “Old Plans”) and to the extent that the applicable
waiting period under the Old Plan had been satisfied or waived at or before the Effective Time; (ii) for purposes of each New Plan
providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical, or vision benefits to any Continuing Employee in the plan year in which the Closing occurs,
the Surviving Corporation will cause all waiting periods, pre-existing condition exclusions, evidence of insurability requirements and
actively-at-work

or similar requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents to the same
extent such waiting periods, exclusions, and requirements were waived under the corresponding Old Plan, and the Surviving
Corporation will for the plan year in which the Closing occurs cause any eligible expenses incurred by such Continuing Employee and
his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan in which the Effective Time occurs and ending on the
date that such Continuing Employee’s participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be given full credit pursuant to such New
Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such Continuing
Employee and his or her covered dependents for the plan year in which the Closing occurs as if such amounts had been paid in
accordance with such New Plan; and (iii) for the plan year in which the Closing occurs credit the accounts of such Continuing
Employees pursuant to any New Plan that is a flexible spending plan with any unused balance in the account of such Continuing
Employee in the corresponding Old Plan to the extent permitted by applicable Law. Any vacation or paid time off accrued but unused
by a Continuing Employee as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will be credited to such Continuing Employee following the
Effective Time, and will not be subject to accrual limits or other forfeiture (except to the extent that such limits or forfeitures applied
under the Company Plans in effect as of the date of this Agreement).

(e) No Third Party Beneficiary Rights. This Section 6.11 will not be deemed to (i) guarantee employment or service for any
period of time for, or preclude the ability of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries to terminate the
employment or service of any Continuing Employee or any other Person at any time and for any or no reason; (ii) require Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries to continue any Company Plan or any other benefit or compensation plan,
program, agreement, Contract, policy or arrangement or prevent the amendment, modification or termination thereof after the Effective
Time; (iii) create any third party beneficiary rights in any Person; or (iv) establish, amend or modify any benefit or compensation plan,
program, agreement, policy, Contract or arrangement.

Agreement has become untrue or inaccurate in any material respect, or of any failure by the Company to comply with or satisfy in any
material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it pursuant to this Agreement, in each case if
and only to the extent that such untruth, inaccuracy, or failure would reasonably be expected to cause any of the conditions to the
obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger set forth in Section 7.2(a) or Section 7.2(b) to fail to be satisfied at the
Closing, except that no such notification will affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty of the Company set forth in
this Agreement or the conditions to the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger or the remedies available to
the Parties under this Agreement. The terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement apply to any information provided to
Parent pursuant to this Section 6.13(a).

in any material respect, or of any failure by Parent or Merger Sub to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant,
condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it pursuant to this Agreement, in each case if and only to the extent that such
untruth, inaccuracy or failure would reasonably be expected to cause any of the conditions to the obligations of the Company to
consummate the Merger set forth in Section 7.3(a) or Section 7.3(b) to fail to be satisfied at the Closing, except that no such
notification will affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty of Parent or Merger Sub set forth in this Agreement or

Parties before (a) participating in any media interviews; (b) engaging in any meetings or calls with analysts, institutional investors or

Transaction Litigation; and (b) consult with Parent with respect to the defense, settlement and prosecution of any Transaction
Litigation. The Company may not compromise, settle or come to an arrangement regarding, or agree to compromise, settle or come to
an arrangement regarding, any Transaction Litigation unless Parent has consented thereto in writing (which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). For purposes of this Section 6.15, “participate” means that Parent will be kept
apprised of proposed strategy and other significant decisions with respect to the Transaction Litigation by the Company (to the extent
that the attorney-client privilege between the Company and its counsel is not undermined or otherwise affected), and Parent may offer

(f) Sole and Exclusive Remedy.

(i) Under no circumstances will the collective amounts payable by Parent, Merger Sub and any of their Affiliates for
breaches under this Agreement, the Limited Guaranty or the Commitment Letters exceed an amount equal to $32,200,000 in the
aggregate for all such breaches (the “Parent Maximum Liability Amount”). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, if Parent or Merger Sub fails to effect the Closing when required by Section 2.3 for any reason or no reason or otherwise
breaches this Agreement or fails to perform under this Agreement, then (x) a decree or order of specific performance or an injunction
or injunctions or other equitable relief if and solely to the extent permitted by Section 9.8(b) or (y) the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Section 8.1(g) or Section 8.1(i) and the receipt of payment of the Parent Termination Fee to the extent owed pursuant to
Section 8.3(c) (including, without duplication, the Company’s right to enforce the Limited Guaranty with respect thereto and receive
the Parent Termination Fee from Guarantor), will be the sole and exclusive remedies (whether in contract, tort, equity, law or granted
by statute or otherwise) of Company Related Parties for any breach, cost, loss, expense or damages suffered as a result thereof or
otherwise relating to or arising out of any Transactional Matters, and in no event will any of the Company Related Parties seek or
obtain, nor will they permit any of their Representatives or any other Person acting on their behalf to seek or obtain, nor will any
Person be entitled to seek or obtain in connection therewith (1) any other remedies or (2) in the case of monetary recovery or monetary
award, any amounts or award of any kind (including consequential, special, indirect or punitive damages) in excess of the Parent
Maximum Liability Amount in the aggregate against Parent, Merger Sub, Guarantor and the Parent Related Parties. Upon payment of
the Parent Termination Fee to the extent owed to the Company hereunder, none of the Parent Related Parties will have any further
liability or obligation to the Company, the other Company Related Parties, their respective Affiliates or any other Person relating to or
arising out of this Agreement, any other documents (including the Commitment Letters and the Limited Guaranty), or any other
Transactional Matters, whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise. Other than the Guarantor’s obligations under the
Limited Guaranty and other than the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to the extent expressly provided in this Agreement, in no
event will any Parent Related Party or any other Person other than the Guarantor, Parent and Merger Sub have any liability for
monetary damages to the Company, the other Company Related Parties, their respective Affiliates or any other Person relating to or
arising out of this Agreement, the Merger or the other Transactional Matters.

(ii) If Parent elects to receive and actually receives the Expense Reimbursement pursuant to Section 8.3(b)(v), such
Expense Reimbursement, together with any Company Termination Fee payable pursuant to Section 8.3(b), will be the only monetary
recovery Parent and Merger Sub and each of their respective Affiliates may recover from the Company Related Parties in such
circumstances in respect of this Agreement, any agreement executed in connection herewith and the transactions contemplated hereby
and thereby, the termination of this Agreement, the failure to consummate the Merger or any claims or actions under applicable law
arising out of such termination, and upon payment of such Expense Reimbursement and any Company Termination Fee payable
pursuant to Section 8.3(b) in such circumstances, (1) none of the Company Related Parties will have any further liability or obligation
to Parent or Merger Sub relating to or arising out of this Agreement, any agreement executed in connection herewith or the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby or any matters forming the basis of such termination; and (2) none of Parent, Merger Sub or any other
Person will be entitled to bring or maintain any claim, action or proceeding against the Company or any Company Related Party
arising out of this Agreement, any agreement executed in connection herewith or the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby or
any matters forming the basis for such termination (except that the Parties (or their Affiliates) will remain obligated with respect to, and
the Company and its Subsidiaries may be entitled to remedies with respect to, the Confidentiality Agreement).

(g) Acknowledgement Regarding Specific Performance. It is agreed that Parent, Merger Sub and the Company will be
entitled to an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief as provided in Section 9.8(b), except that, although the
Company, in its sole discretion, may determine its choice of remedies hereunder, including by pursuing specific performance in
accordance with, but subject to the limitations of, Section 9.8(b), under no circumstances shall the Company be permitted or entitled to
receive both specific

only be enforced against the named parties, and in no event shall the Company or any Company Related Parties seek or obtain, nor will
they permit any of their respective Representatives to seek or obtain, nor will any Person be entitled to seek or obtain, any monetary
recovery or monetary award (whether in contract, tort, equity, law or granted by statute, and whether by or through attempted piercing
of the corporate, limited partnership or limited liability company veil or otherwise) against any Non-Recourse Parent Party relating to
or arising out of any Transactional Matters, other than from Parent or Merger Sub to the extent expressly provided for in this
Agreement or the Guarantor to the extent expressly provided for in the Limited Guaranty and the Equity Commitment Letter.

8.4 Amendment. Subject to applicable law and subject to the other provisions of this Agreement, this Agreement may be amended
by the Parties at any time by execution of an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
(pursuant to authorized action by the Company Board , except that in the event that the Company has received the Requisite
Stockholder Approval, no amendment may be made to this Agreement that requires the approval of the Company Stockholders
pursuant to the DGCL without such approval. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any amendments,
modifications or alterations of the provisions relating to the Financing Sources set forth in Section 8.3(f), Section 8.3(h), Section 8.6,
Section 9.3, Section 9.6, Section 9.10(b), Section 9.11 and this Section 8.4 (and the defined terms used therein solely as they relate to
such sections) to the extent adversely affecting any of the Financing Sources, shall not be effective with respect to such affected

and except as otherwise set forth herein, (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other
Parties, as applicable; (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties made to such Party contained herein or in any
document delivered pursuant hereto; and (c) subject to the requirements of applicable law, waive compliance with any of the
agreements or conditions for the benefit of such Party contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a Party to any such extension or

Stockholders or any of their respective Affiliates relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the Debt Commitment Letter, the Debt
Financing or otherwise, whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise, and neither the Company nor any of its Affiliates will

limit the rights of the Company, any Company Stockholders and their respective Affiliates from and after the Effective Time under the
Debt Commitment Letter or the definitive debt documents executed in connection with the Debt Financing (but not, for the avoidance
of doubt, under this Agreement) to the extent the Company and/or its Affiliates are party thereto.

force and effect in accordance with its terms. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Representatives will hold and treat all
documents and information concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries furnished or made available to Parent, Merger Sub or their
respective Representatives in connection with the Merger in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement. By executing this
Agreement, each of Parent and Merger Sub agree to be bound by, and to cause their Representatives to be bound by, the terms and
conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement as if Parent and Merger Sub were parties thereto. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement will (a) not be superseded; (b) survive any termination of this Agreement; and
(c) continue in full force and effect until the earlier to occur of the Effective Time and the date on which the Confidentiality Agreement

will continue in full force and effect and the application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the Parties. The Parties further agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this
Agreement with a valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes
of such void or unenforceable provision.

9.8 Remedies.

(a) Remedies Cumulative. Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a
Party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby or by law or equity upon such Party, and
the exercise by a Party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy. Although the Company may pursue both
a grant of specific performance and monetary damages (including the payment of the Parent Termination Fee), under no circumstances
will the Company be permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of specific performance that results in the occurrence of the Closing
and monetary damages (including any monetary damages in lieu of specific performance and all or any portion of the Parent
Termination Fee).

(b) Specific Performance.

(i) The Parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an
adequate remedy would occur in the event that the Parties do not perform the provisions of this Agreement (including any Party failing
to take such actions as are required of it hereunder in order to consummate this Agreement) in accordance with its specified terms or
otherwise breach such provisions. The Parties acknowledge and agree that, subject to Section 8.6, (A) the Parties will be entitled, in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity, to an injunction, specific performance and other equitable
relief to prevent breaches (or threatened breaches) of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof;
(B) the provisions of Section 8.3 are not intended to and do not adequately compensate the Company, on the one hand, or Parent and
Merger Sub, on the other hand, for the harm that would result from a breach of this Agreement, and will not be construed to diminish
or otherwise impair in any respect any Party’s right to an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief; and (C) the right
of specific enforcement is an integral part of the Merger and without that right, neither the Company nor Parent would have entered
into this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is explicitly agreed that the Company shall have the right to an injunction,
specific performance or other equitable remedies in connection with enforcing Parent’s and Merger Sub’s obligations to consummate
the Merger and cause the Equity Financing to be funded to fund the Merger (including to cause Parent to enforce the obligations of the
Guarantor under the Equity Commitment Letter in order to cause the Equity Financing to be timely completed in accordance with and
subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Equity Commitment Letter) if and only if (1) the Marketing Period has ended and all
conditions in Section 7.1 and Section 7.2 have been satisfied (other than those conditions that, by their nature, are to be satisfied at the
Closing (provided such conditions would be satisfied as of such date)) at the time when the Closing would have occurred pursuant to
Section 2.3 but for the failure of the Equity Financing to be funded, (2) the Debt Financing has been funded or will be funded at the
Closing on the terms set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter or the Definitive Agreements if the Equity Financing is funded to fund
the Merger at the Closing, and (3) the Company has irrevocably confirmed in writing to Parent that if specific performance is granted
and the Equity Financing is funded, then the Closing pursuant to Article II will occur.

(ii) Subject to 9.8(b)(i), the Parties agree not to raise any objections to (A) the granting of an injunction, specific
performance or other equitable relief to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement by the Company, on the
one hand, or Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand; and (B) the specific performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement
to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants, obligations and agreements of Parent and
Merger Sub pursuant to this Agreement. Any Party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement will not be required to provide any bond or other

regardless of the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of laws thereof.

9.10 Consent to Jurisdiction.

(a) General Jurisdiction. Each of the Parties (i) irrevocably consents to the service of the summons and complaint and any
other process (whether inside or outside the territorial jurisdiction of the Chosen Courts) in any Legal Proceeding relating to the Merger
and the Limited Guaranty, for and on behalf of itself or any of its properties or assets, in accordance with Section 9.2 or in such other
manner as may be permitted by applicable law, and nothing in this Section 9.10 will affect the right of any Party to serve legal process

assets in any Legal Proceeding to the exclusive general jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and any state
appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware declines to accept
jurisdiction over a particular matter, any federal court within the State of Delaware) (the “Chosen Courts”) in the event that any

inconvenient court and agrees not to plead or claim the same; and (vi) agrees that it will not bring any Legal Proceeding relating to this
Agreement, the Limited Guaranty or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby in any court other than the Chosen Courts. Each
of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agrees that a final judgment in any Legal Proceeding in the Chosen Courts will be conclusive
and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by applicable law.

and irrevocably agree (i) that any Legal Proceeding, whether in law or in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise, involving the
Financing Sources arising out of, or relating to, the Merger, the Debt Financing, any applicable debt commitment letter or credit
agreement to which Parent or any of its Affiliates is a party or the performance of services thereunder or related thereto will be subject
to the exclusive jurisdiction of any state or federal court sitting in the State of New York in the borough of Manhattan and any appellate
court thereof, and each Party submits for itself and its property with respect to any such Legal Proceeding to the exclusive jurisdiction
of such court; (ii) not to bring or permit any of their Affiliates to bring or support anyone else in bringing any such Legal Proceeding in
any other court; (iii) that service of process, summons, notice or document by registered mail addressed to them at their respective
addresses provided in any applicable debt commitment letter will be effective service of process against them for any such Legal
Proceeding brought in any such court; (iv) to waive and hereby waive, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection which any
of them may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of, and the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of, any such
Legal Proceeding in any such court; and (v) any such Legal Proceeding will be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of
the State of New York.

9.11 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY THAT
MAY ARISE PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND
THEREFORE EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT THAT SUCH
PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING (WHETHER FOR BREACH OF

AGREEMENT, THE MERGER, THE LIMITED GUARANTY, THE COMMITMENT LETTERS, THE DEBT FINANCING OR

IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER; (iii) IT MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY; AND (iv) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO

SECTION 9.11.

9.12 Company Disclosure Letter References. The Parties agree that the disclosure set forth in any particular section or subsection
of the Company Disclosure Letter will be deemed to be an exception to (or, as applicable, a disclosure for purposes of) (a) the
representations and warranties (or covenants, as applicable) of the Company that are set forth in the corresponding Section or
subsection of this Agreement; and (b) any other representations and warranties (or covenants, as applicable) of the Company that are
set forth in this Agreement, but in the case of this clause (b) only if the relevance of that disclosure as an exception to (or a disclosure

9.13 Counterparts. This Agreement and any amendments hereto may be executed in one or more counterparts, all of which will
be considered one and the same agreement and will become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the

to the extent delivered by .pdf, .tif, .gif, .jpg or similar attachment to electronic mail (any such delivery, an “Electronic Delivery”), will
be treated in all manner and respects as an original executed counterpart and will be considered to have the same binding legal effect as
if it were the original signed version thereof delivered in person. Minor variations in the form of the signature page, including footers
from earlier versions of this Agreement or any such other document, will be disregarded in determining the party’s intent or the
effectiveness of such signature. No Party may raise the use of an Electronic Delivery to deliver a signature, or the fact that any
signature or agreement or instrument was transmitted or communicated through the use of an Electronic Delivery, as a defense to the
formation of a contract, and each Party forever waives any such defense, except to the extent such defense relates to lack of
authenticity.

9.14 No Limitation. It is the intention of the Parties that, to the extent possible, unless provisions are mutually exclusive and effect
cannot be given to both or all such provisions, the representations, warranties, covenants and closing conditions in this Agreement will
be construed to be cumulative and that each representation, warranty, covenant and closing condition in this Agreement will be given
full, separate and independent effect and nothing set forth in any provision herein will in any way be deemed to limit the scope,
applicability or effect of any other provision hereof.

The Board of Directors
Blue Nile, Inc.
411 First Avenue South
Suite 700
Seattle, WA 98104

Members of the Board of Directors:

We understand that Blue Nile, Inc. (“Blue Nile”) proposes to enter into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Agreement”), among
Blue Nile, BC Cyan Parent Inc. (“Parent”), an affiliate of Bow Street LLC (“Bow Street”) and Bain Capital Private Equity, LP (“Bain
Capital”), and BC Cyan Acquisition Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (“Merger Sub”), pursuant to which, among other things,
Merger Sub will merge with and into Blue Nile (the “Merger”) and each outstanding share of the common stock, par value $0.001 per
share, of Blue Nile (“Blue Nile Common Stock”), other than Owned Company Shares and Dissenting Company Shares (each as
defined in the Agreement), will be converted into the right to receive $40.75 in cash (the “Consideration”). Concurrently with the
execution of the Agreement, we understand that Bain Capital Fund XI, L.P. (the “Guarantor”), an affiliate of Bain Capital, proposes to
enter into a limited guarantee in favor of Blue Nile pursuant to which the Guarantor will guarantee certain obligations of Parent in
connection with the Agreement. The terms and conditions of the Merger are more fully set forth in the Agreement.

You have requested our opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Blue Nile Common Stock (other
than Owned Company Shares and Dissenting Company Shares) of the Consideration to be received by such holders in the Merger.

In connection with this opinion, we have, among other things:
 

(i) reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information relating to Blue Nile;
 

(ii) reviewed certain internal financial and operating information with respect to the business, operations and prospects of Blue Nile
furnished to or discussed with us by the management of Blue Nile, including certain base case financial forecasts relating to
Blue Nile prepared by the management of Blue Nile (such forecasts, “Blue Nile Base Case Forecasts”) and, for reference
purposes only, certain growth case financial forecasts relating to Blue Nile prepared by the management of Blue Nile (such
forecasts, the “Blue Nile Growth Case Forecasts”) and certain downside case financial forecasts relating to Blue Nile prepared
by the management of Blue Nile (such forecasts, the “Blue Nile Downside Case Forecasts” and, together with the Blue Nile
Base Case Forecasts and the Blue Nile Growth Case Forecasts, the “Blue Nile Forecasts”);

 

(iii) discussed the past and current business, operations, financial condition and prospects of Blue Nile with members of senior
management of Blue Nile;

 

(iv) reviewed the trading history for Blue Nile Common Stock and a comparison of that trading history with the trading histories of
other companies we deemed relevant;

 

(v) compared certain financial and stock market information of Blue Nile with similar information of other companies we deemed
relevant;

 

(vi) compared certain financial terms of the Merger to financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of other transactions we
deemed relevant;

 

(vii) considered the results of our efforts on behalf of Blue Nile to solicit, at the direction of Blue Nile, indications of interest from
third parties with respect to a possible acquisition of Blue Nile;

(viii) reviewed a draft, dated November 5, 2016, of the Agreement (the “Draft Agreement”), and a draft, dated October 31, 2016, of

the limited guarantee executed by the Guarantor in favor of Blue Nile (such limited guarantee, together with the Agreement, the
“Transaction Agreements” and, such drafts, the “Draft Transaction Agreements”); and

 

(ix) performed such other analyses and studies and considered such other information and factors as we deemed appropriate.

In arriving at our opinion, we have assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the accuracy and completeness of the
financial and other information and data publicly available or provided to or otherwise reviewed by or discussed with us and have
relied upon the assurances of the management of Blue Nile that it is not aware of any facts or circumstances that would make such
information or data inaccurate or misleading in any material respect. With respect to the Blue Nile Forecasts, we have been advised by
Blue Nile, and have assumed, that the Blue Nile Base Case Forecasts have been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best
currently available estimates and good faith judgments of the management of Blue Nile as to the future financial performance of Blue
Nile, and, at the direction of Blue Nile, have relied on the Blue Nile Base Case Forecasts for purposes of our analyses and opinion. We
have not made or been provided with any independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of
Blue Nile, nor have we made any physical inspection of the properties or assets of Blue Nile. We have not evaluated the solvency or
fair value of Blue Nile or Parent under any state, federal or other laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. We have
assumed, at the direction of Blue Nile, that the Merger will be consummated in accordance with its terms, without waiver, modification
or amendment of any material term, condition or agreement and that, in the course of obtaining the necessary governmental, regulatory
and other approvals, consents, releases and waivers for the Merger, no delay, limitation, restriction or condition, including any
divestiture requirements or amendments or modifications, will be imposed that would have an adverse effect on Blue Nile, Parent or
the contemplated benefits of the Merger. We also have assumed, at the direction of Blue Nile, that the final executed Transaction
Agreements will not differ in any material respect from the Draft Transaction Agreements reviewed by us.

We express no view or opinion as to any terms or other aspects of the Merger (other than the Consideration to the extent expressly
specified herein), including, without limitation, the form or structure of the Merger. Our opinion is limited to the fairness, from a
financial point of view, of the Consideration to be received by holders of Blue Nile Common Stock (other than Owned Company
Shares and Dissenting Company Shares) and no opinion or view is expressed with respect to any consideration received in connection
with the Merger by the holders of any class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of any party. In addition, no opinion or view
is expressed with respect to the fairness (financial or otherwise) of the amount, nature or any other aspect of any compensation to any
of the officers, directors or employees of any party to the Merger, or class of such persons, relative to the Consideration. Furthermore,
no opinion or view is expressed as to the relative merits of the Merger in comparison to other strategies or transactions that might be
available to Blue Nile or in which Blue Nile might engage or as to the underlying business decision of Blue Nile to proceed with or
effect the Merger. In addition, we express no opinion or recommendation as to how any stockholder should vote or act in connection
with the Merger or any related matter.

We have acted as financial advisor to Blue Nile in connection with the Merger and will receive a fee for our services, a portion of
which is payable upon the rendering of this opinion and a significant portion of which is contingent upon consummation of the Merger.
In addition, Blue Nile has agreed to reimburse our expenses and indemnify us against certain liabilities arising out of our engagement.

We and our affiliates comprise a full service securities firm and commercial bank engaged in securities, commodities and derivatives
trading, foreign exchange and other brokerage activities, and principal investing as well as providing investment, corporate and private
banking, asset and investment management, financing and financial advisory services and other commercial services and products to a
wide range of companies, governments and individuals. In the

In addition, we and our affiliates in the past have provided, currently are providing, and in the future may provide, investment banking,

products to Bain Capital and/or certain of its affiliates and portfolio companies and (v) having provided or providing certain
commodity, derivatives and foreign exchange trading services to Bain Capital and/or certain of its affiliates and portfolio companies.

It is understood that this letter is for the benefit and use of the Board of Directors of Blue Nile (in its capacity as such) in connection
with and for purposes of its evaluation of the Merger.

Our opinion is necessarily based on financial, economic, monetary, market and other conditions and circumstances as in effect on, and
the information made available to us as of, the date hereof. It should be understood that subsequent developments may affect this
opinion, and we do not have any obligation to update, revise, or reaffirm this opinion. The issuance of this opinion was approved by a
fairness opinion review committee of Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated.

Based upon and subject to the foregoing, including the various assumptions and limitations set forth herein, we are of the opinion on
the date hereof that the Consideration to be received in the Merger by holders of Blue Nile Common Stock (other than Owned
Company Shares and Dissenting Company Shares) is fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.

Very truly yours,

TITLE 8 of the Delaware Code—Corporations

CHAPTER 1. GENERAL CORPORATION LAW

Subchapter IX. Merger, Consolidation or Conversion

§ 262 Appraisal rights

(a) Any stockholder of a corporation of this State who holds shares of stock on the date of the making of a demand pursuant to
subsection (d) of this section with respect to such shares, who continuously holds such shares through the effective date of the
merger or consolidation, who has otherwise complied with subsection (d) of this section and who has neither voted in favor of the
merger or consolidation nor consented thereto in writing pursuant to § 228 of this title shall be entitled to an appraisal by the
Court of Chancery of the fair value of the stockholder’s shares of stock under the circumstances described in subsections (b) and
(c) of this section. As used in this section, the word “stockholder” means a holder of record of stock in a corporation; the words
“stock” and “share” mean and include what is ordinarily meant by those words; and the words “depository receipt” mean a receipt
or other instrument issued by a depository representing an interest in 1 or more shares, or fractions thereof, solely of stock of a
corporation, which stock is deposited with the depository.

(b) Appraisal rights shall be available for the shares of any class or series of stock of a constituent corporation in a merger or
consolidation to be effected pursuant to § 251 (other than a merger effected pursuant to § 251(g) of this title and, subject to
paragraph (b)(3) of this section, § 251(h) of this title), § 252, § 254, § 255, § 256, § 257, § 258, § 263 or § 264 of this title:

(1) Provided, however, that, except as expressly provided in § 363(b) of this title, no appraisal rights under this section shall
be available for the shares of any class or series of stock, which stock, or depository receipts in respect thereof, at the record
date fixed to determine the stockholders entitled to receive notice of the meeting of stockholders to act upon the agreement
of merger or consolidation, were either: (i) listed on a national securities exchange or (ii) held of record by more than 2,000
holders; and further provided that no appraisal rights shall be available for any shares of stock of the constituent corporation
surviving a merger if the merger did not require for its approval the vote of the stockholders of the surviving corporation as
provided in § 251(f) of this title.

(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1) of this section, appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the shares of
any class or series of stock of a constituent corporation if the holders thereof are required by the terms of an agreement of
merger or consolidation pursuant to §§ 251, 252, 254, 255, 256, 257, 258, 263 and 264 of this title to accept for such stock
anything except:

a. Shares of stock of the corporation surviving or resulting from such merger or consolidation, or depository receipts
in respect thereof;

b. Shares of stock of any other corporation, or depository receipts in respect thereof, which shares of stock (or
depository receipts in respect thereof) or depository receipts at the effective date of the merger or consolidation will
be either listed on a national securities exchange or held of record by more than 2,000 holders;

c. Cash in lieu of fractional shares or fractional depository receipts described in the foregoing paragraphs (b)(2)a. and
b. of this section; or

d. Any combination of the shares of stock, depository receipts and cash in lieu of fractional shares or fractional
depository receipts described in the foregoing paragraphs (b)(2)a., b. and c. of this section.

(3) In the event all of the stock of a subsidiary Delaware corporation party to a merger effected under § 251(h), § 253 or §
267 of this title is not owned by the parent immediately prior to the merger, appraisal rights shall be available for the shares
of the subsidiary Delaware corporation.

(4) In the event of an amendment to a corporation’s certificate of incorporation contemplated by § 363(a) of this title,
appraisal rights shall be available as contemplated by § 363(b) of this title, and the procedures of this section, including
those set forth in subsections (d) and (e) of this section, shall apply as nearly as practicable, with the word “amendment”
substituted for the words “merger or consolidation,” and the word “corporation” substituted for the words “constituent
corporation” and/or “surviving or resulting corporation.”

(c) Any corporation may provide in its certificate of incorporation that appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the
shares of any class or series of its stock as a result of an amendment to its certificate of incorporation, any merger or consolidation
in which the corporation is a constituent corporation or the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the corporation. If the
certificate of incorporation contains such a provision, the provisions of this section, including those set forth in subsections (d),
(e), and (g) of this section, shall apply as nearly as is practicable.

(d) Appraisal rights shall be perfected as follows:

(1) If a proposed merger or consolidation for which appraisal rights are provided under this section is to be submitted for
approval at a meeting of stockholders, the corporation, not less than twenty (20) days prior to the meeting, shall notify each
of its stockholders who was such on the record date for notice of such meeting (or such members who received notice in
accordance with § 255(c) of this title) with respect to shares for which appraisal rights are available pursuant to subsection
(b) or (c) of this section that appraisal rights are available for any or all of the shares of the constituent corporations, and
shall include in such notice a copy of this section and, if 1 of the constituent corporations is a nonstock corporation, a copy
of § 114 of this title. Each stockholder electing to demand the appraisal of such stockholder’s shares shall deliver to the
corporation, before the taking of the vote on the merger or consolidation, a written demand for appraisal of such
stockholder’s shares. Such demand will be sufficient if it reasonably informs the corporation of the identity of the
stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to demand the appraisal of such stockholder’s shares. A proxy or vote
against the merger or consolidation shall not constitute such a demand. A stockholder electing to take such action must do so
by a separate written demand as herein provided. Within ten (10) days after the effective date of such merger or
consolidation, the surviving or resulting corporation shall notify each stockholder of each constituent corporation who has
complied with this subsection and has not voted in favor of or consented to the merger or consolidation of the date that the
merger or consolidation has become effective; or

(2) If the merger or consolidation was approved pursuant to § 228, § 251(h), § 253, or § 267 of this title, then either a
constituent corporation before the effective date of the merger or consolidation or the surviving or resulting corporation
within ten (10) days thereafter shall notify each of the holders of any class or series of stock of such constituent corporation
who are entitled to appraisal rights of the approval of the merger or consolidation and that appraisal rights are available for
any or all shares of such class or series of stock of such constituent corporation, and shall include in such notice a copy of
this section and, if 1 of the constituent corporations is a nonstock corporation, a copy of § 114 of this title. Such notice may,
and, if given on or after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, shall, also notify such stockholders of the effective
date of the merger or consolidation. Any stockholder entitled to appraisal rights may, within twenty (20) days after the date
of mailing of such notice or, in the case of a merger approved pursuant to § 251(h) of this title, within the later of the
consummation of the offer contemplated by § 251(h) of this title and twenty (20) days after the date of mailing of such
notice, demand in writing from the surviving or resulting corporation the appraisal of such holder’s shares. Such demand
will be sufficient if it reasonably informs the corporation of the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends
thereby to demand the appraisal of such holder’s shares. If

of any class or series of stock of such constituent corporation that are entitled to appraisal rights of the effective date of the
merger or consolidation or (ii) the surviving or resulting corporation shall send such a second notice to all such holders on or
within ten (10) days after such effective date; provided, however, that if such second notice is sent more than twenty (20)
days following the sending of the first notice or, in the case of a merger approved pursuant to § 251(h) of this title, later than
the later of the consummation of the offer contemplated by § 251(h) of this title and twenty (20) days following the sending
of the first notice, such second notice need only be sent to each stockholder who is entitled to appraisal rights and who has
demanded appraisal of such holder’s shares in accordance with this subsection. An affidavit of the secretary or assistant
secretary or of the transfer agent of the corporation that is required to give either notice that such notice has been given shall,
in the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein. For purposes of determining the stockholders
entitled to receive either notice, each constituent corporation may fix, in advance, a record date that shall be not more than
ten (10) days prior to the date the notice is given, provided, that if the notice is given on or after the effective date of the
merger or consolidation, the record date shall be such effective date. If no record date is fixed and the notice is given prior to
the effective date, the record date shall be the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the notice is
given.

(e) Within one hundred twenty (120) days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, the surviving or resulting
corporation or any stockholder who has complied with subsections (a) and (d) of this section hereof and who is otherwise entitled
to appraisal rights, may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Court of Chancery demanding a
determination of the value of the stock of all such stockholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time within 60 days after
the effective date of the merger or consolidation, any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that
proceeding as a named party shall have the right to withdraw such stockholder’s demand for appraisal and to accept the terms
offered upon the merger or consolidation. Within one hundred twenty (120) days after the effective date of the merger or
consolidation, any stockholder who has complied with the requirements of subsections (a) and (d) of this section hereof, upon
written request, shall be entitled to receive from the corporation surviving the merger or resulting from the consolidation a
statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the merger or consolidation and with respect to which
demands for appraisal have been received and the aggregate number of holders of such shares. Such written statement shall be
mailed to the stockholder within ten (10) days after such stockholder’s written request for such a statement is received by the
surviving or resulting corporation or within ten (10) days after expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal
under subsection (d) of this section hereof, whichever is later. Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, a person who is the
beneficial owner of shares of such stock held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person may, in such
person’s own name, file a petition or request from the corporation the statement described in this subsection.

(f) Upon the filing of any such petition by a stockholder, service of a copy thereof shall be made upon the surviving or resulting
corporation, which shall within twenty (20) days after such service file in the office of the Register in Chancery in which the
petition was filed a duly verified list containing the names and addresses of all stockholders who have demanded payment for
their shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares have not been reached by the surviving or resulting
corporation. If the petition shall be filed by the surviving or resulting corporation, the petition shall be accompanied by such a
duly verified list. The Register in Chancery, if so ordered by the Court, shall give notice of the time and place fixed for the
hearing of such petition by registered or certified mail to the surviving or resulting corporation and to the stockholders shown on
the list at the addresses therein stated. Such notice shall also be given by 1 or more publications at least 1 week before the day of
the hearing, in a newspaper of general circulation published in the City of Wilmington, Delaware or such publication as the Court
deems advisable. The forms of the notices by mail and by publication shall be approved by the Court, and the costs thereof shall
be borne by the surviving or resulting corporation.

(g) At the hearing on such petition, the Court shall determine the stockholders who have complied with this section and who have
become entitled to appraisal rights. The Court may require the stockholders who have demanded an appraisal for their shares and
who hold stock represented by certificates to submit their certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of
the pendency of the appraisal proceedings; and if any stockholder fails to comply with such direction, the Court may dismiss the
proceedings as to such stockholder. If immediately before the merger or consolidation the shares of the class or series of stock of
the constituent corporation as to which appraisal rights are available were listed on a national securities exchange, the Court shall
dismiss the proceedings as to all holders of such shares who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless (1) the total number
of shares entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of the class or series eligible for appraisal, (2) the value of the
consideration provided in the merger or consolidation for such total number of shares exceeds $1 million, or (3) the merger was
approved pursuant to § 253 or § 267 of this title.

(h) After the Court determines the stockholders entitled to an appraisal, the appraisal proceeding shall be conducted in accordance
with the rules of the Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings. Through such
proceeding the Court shall determine the fair value of the shares exclusive of any element of value arising from the
accomplishment or expectation of the merger or consolidation, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount
determined to be the fair value. In determining such fair value, the Court shall take into account all relevant factors. Unless the
Court in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, and except as provided in this subsection, interest from the
effective date of the merger through the date of payment of the judgment shall be compounded quarterly and shall accrue at 5%
over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the
effective date of the merger and the date of payment of the judgment. At any time before the entry of judgment in the
proceedings, the surviving corporation may pay to each stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which case interest
shall accrue thereafter as provided herein only upon the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair
value of the shares as determined by the Court, and (2) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time. Upon application by
the surviving or resulting corporation or by any stockholder entitled to participate in the appraisal proceeding, the Court may, in
its discretion, proceed to trial upon the appraisal prior to the final determination of the stockholders entitled to an appraisal. Any
stockholder whose name appears on the list filed by the surviving or resulting corporation pursuant to subsection (f) of this
section and who has submitted such stockholder’s certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery, if such is required, may
participate fully in all proceedings until it is finally determined that such stockholder is not entitled to appraisal rights under this
section.

(i) The Court shall direct the payment of the fair value of the shares, together with interest, if any, by the surviving or resulting
corporation to the stockholders entitled thereto. Payment shall be so made to each such stockholder, in the case of holders of
uncertificated stock forthwith, and the case of holders of shares represented by certificates upon the surrender to the corporation
of the certificates representing such stock. The Court’s decree may be enforced as other decrees in the Court of Chancery may be
enforced, whether such surviving or resulting corporation be a corporation of this State or of any state.

(j) The costs of the proceeding may be determined by the Court and taxed upon the parties as the Court deems equitable in the
circumstances. Upon application of a stockholder, the Court may order all or a portion of the expenses incurred by any
stockholder in connection with the appraisal proceeding, including, without limitation, reasonable attorney’s fees and the fees and
expenses of experts, to be charged pro rata against the value of all the shares entitled to an appraisal.

(k) From and after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, no stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights as
provided in subsection (d) of this section shall be entitled to vote such stock for any purpose or to receive payment of dividends or
other distributions on the stock (except dividends or other distributions payable to stockholders of record at a date which is prior
to the effective date of the merger or consolidation); provided, however, that if no petition for an appraisal shall be filed within the
time provided in subsection (e) of this section, or if such stockholder shall deliver to the surviving or resulting corporation

a written withdrawal of such stockholder’s demand for an appraisal and an acceptance of the merger or consolidation, either
within sixty (60) days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation as provided in subsection (e) of this section or
thereafter with the written approval of the corporation, then the right of such stockholder to an appraisal shall cease.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no appraisal proceeding in the Court of Chancery shall be dismissed as to any stockholder without
the approval of the Court, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Court deems just; provided, however that
this provision shall not affect the right of any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that
proceeding as a named party to withdraw such stockholder’s demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the
merger or consolidation within sixty (60) days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, as set forth in subsection (e)
of this section.

(l) The shares of the surviving or resulting corporation to which the shares of such objecting stockholders would have been
converted had they assented to the merger or consolidation shall have the status of authorized and unissued shares of the surviving
or resulting corporation.
