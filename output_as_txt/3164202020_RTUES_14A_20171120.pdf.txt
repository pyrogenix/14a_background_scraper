Ruby Tuesday, Inc.
333 East Broadway Avenue, Maryville, Tennessee 37804

November 20, 2017

Dear Ruby Tuesday Stockholder:

On October 16, 2017, Ruby Tuesday, Inc. (“Ruby Tuesday”) entered into a definitive merger agreement with RTI Holding Company, LLC
(“Holding”) and its wholly-owned subsidiary, RTI Merger Sub, LLC (“Merger Subsidiary”). Both Holding and Merger Subsidiary are affiliates of NRD
Partners II, L.P. Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, Merger Subsidiary will be merged with and into Ruby Tuesday, with Ruby Tuesday
surviving the merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Holding.

If the merger is completed, Ruby Tuesday stockholders will have the right to receive $2.40 in cash, without interest and less any applicable
withholding taxes, for each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Ruby Tuesday that they own immediately prior to the effective time of
the merger. The purchase price represents a premium of approximately 38 percent over Ruby Tuesday’s closing share price on March 13, 2017, the day
before Ruby Tuesday announced its intention to explore strategic alternatives and a premium of approximately 21 percent over Ruby Tuesday’s closing
share price on October 13, 2017, the last trading day prior to the announcement that Ruby Tuesday had entered into the merger agreement.

We will hold a special meeting of our stockholders in connection with the proposed merger on December 20, 2017 at Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP,
450 Lexington Avenue, New York, NY 10017 at 8:00 a.m., local time (unless the special meeting is adjourned or postponed). At the special meeting (or
any adjournment or postponement thereof), stockholders will be asked to vote on the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement, as it may be
amended from time to time. The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast by all shares of Ruby Tuesday common
stock entitled to vote thereon is required to approve and adopt the merger agreement.

We cannot complete the merger unless Ruby Tuesday stockholders approve and adopt the merger agreement. Your vote is very important,
regardless of the number of shares you own. Whether or not you are able to attend the special meeting in person, please complete, sign and date
the enclosed proxy card and return it in the envelope provided or vote by telephone (at the toll-free number indicated on the proxy card) or via
the internet (at the voting site indicated on the proxy card) as promptly as possible so that your shares may be represented and voted at the
special meeting (or any adjournment or postponement thereof).

After careful consideration, the Ruby Tuesday board of directors has unanimously determined that the merger and the other transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement are advisable and fair to and in the best interests of Ruby Tuesday stockholders and has unanimously
approved the merger agreement. The Ruby Tuesday board of directors unanimously recommends that Ruby Tuesday stockholders vote “FOR”
the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement.

In addition, the Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted rules that require us to seek a non-binding, advisory vote with respect to certain
compensation that will or may be paid by Ruby Tuesday to its named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the merger. The Ruby
Tuesday board of directors unanimously recommends that Ruby Tuesday stockholders vote “FOR” the named executive officer merger-related
compensation proposal described in the accompanying proxy statement.

The obligations of Ruby Tuesday and Holding to complete the merger are subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions. The
accompanying proxy statement contains detailed information about Ruby Tuesday, the special meeting, the merger agreement, the merger and the other
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

Table of Contents

RTI Holding Company, LLC (“Holding”) (see page 22)

Holding is an affiliate of NRD Partners II, L.P. and was formed in August 2017 solely for the purpose of entering into the merger agreement
and completing such other transactions as are necessary to finance the merger. After the closing of the merger, Holding would also act as the
holding company and sole stockholder of Ruby Tuesday. Holding has not carried out any activities to date, except for activities incidental to its
formation and activities undertaken in connection with the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, which includes certain financing
transactions entered into or to be entered into for the purpose of financing the merger.

RTI Merger Sub, LLC (“Merger Subsidiary”) (see page 22)

Merger Subsidiary is an affiliate of NRD Partners II, L.P. and was formed in September 2017 solely for the purpose of completing the merger
with Ruby Tuesday. Merger Subsidiary has not carried out any activities to date, except for activities incidental to its formation and activities
undertaken in connection with the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

NRD Ventures, LLC (“NRD”) (see page 22)

NRD is a limited liability company formed in March 2016 to conduct acquisition activities. NRD entered into a nondisclosure agreement
with Ruby Tuesday on January 25, 2017, thereafter engaged in negotiations regarding the merger and entered into a no-shop agreement with Ruby
Tuesday on August 14, 2017.

THE MERGER

A copy of the merger agreement is attached as Annex A to this proxy statement. We encourage you to read the entire merger agreement
carefully because it is the principal document governing the merger. For more information on the merger agreement, see the section entitled “The
Merger Agreement” beginning on page 63 of this proxy statement.

Effects of the Merger (see page 28)

If the merger is completed, then, at the effective time of the merger, Merger Subsidiary will be merged with and into Ruby Tuesday. Ruby
Tuesday will survive the merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Holding.

Upon consummation of the merger, your shares of Ruby Tuesday common stock will be converted into the right to receive the per share
merger consideration described below unless you have properly demanded dissenters’ rights in accordance with Georgia law. As a result, you will
not own any shares of the surviving corporation, and you will no longer have any interest in its future earnings or growth. As a result of the merger,
Ruby Tuesday will cease to be a publicly-traded company and will be wholly owned by Holding. Following consummation of the merger, the
surviving corporation will terminate the registration of our common stock on the NYSE and we will no longer be subject to reporting obligations
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).

Merger Consideration (see page 28)

Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the merger agreement, at the effective time of the merger, Ruby Tuesday stockholders will
have the right to receive $2.40 in cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes, for each share of Ruby Tuesday common stock
that they own immediately prior to the effective time of the merger.

Table of Contents

Treatment of Ruby Tuesday Equity and Performance-Based Cash Awards (see page 66)

At or immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, to the extent required or permitted by the applicable employee plan:
 

 

•  Each outstanding option to purchase Ruby Tuesday common stock under any employee plan, whether or not exercisable or vested, will
be canceled, and Ruby Tuesday will pay each holder of any such option at or promptly after the effective time of the merger for each
stock option an amount in cash determined by multiplying (i) the excess, if any, of the merger consideration of $2.40 per share over the
applicable exercise price of such stock option, by (ii) the number of shares that such holder could have purchased (assuming full vesting
of all stock options) had such holder exercised such stock option in full immediately prior to the effective time of the merger. In the
event that the per share exercise price of any stock option is equal to or greater than the merger consideration of $2.40 per share, such
stock option will be cancelled, without any consideration being payable in respect thereof, and will have no further force or effect;

 

 

•  Each outstanding service-based restricted stock unit (including service-based phantom stock units) of Ruby Tuesday under any
employee plan, whether or not vested, and whether settleable in shares of Ruby Tuesday common stock or cash, will be canceled, and
Ruby Tuesday will pay each holder of any such restricted stock unit at or promptly after the effective time of the merger for each such
Ruby Tuesday restricted stock unit an amount in cash equal to the merger consideration of $2.40 per share;

 

 

•  Each outstanding performance-based restricted stock unit (including performance-based phantom stock units) of Ruby Tuesday under
any employee plan, whether or not vested, will be canceled, and Ruby Tuesday will pay each holder of any such performance-based
restricted stock unit at or promptly after the effective time of the merger for each Ruby Tuesday performance-based restricted stock unit
an amount in cash determined by multiplying (i) the merger consideration of $2.40 per share by (ii) the number of shares of Ruby
Tuesday restricted stock that the holder of such performance-based restricted stock unit would have been entitled to if such Ruby
Tuesday performance-based restricted stock award had vested at its “target” level;

 

 
•  Each outstanding restricted share of Ruby Tuesday common stock under any employee plan, whether or not vested, shall be canceled,

and Ruby Tuesday will pay each holder of any such outstanding restricted shares at or promptly after the effective time for each such
restricted share an amount in cash equal to the merger consideration of $2.40 per share; and

 

 
•  Each outstanding performance-based cash award of Ruby Tuesday under any employee plan, whether or not vested, will vest and pay

out at its “target” level, prorated for the number of days that have elapsed since the beginning of the year in which the effective time of
the merger occurs (up to and including the date on which the effective time of the merger occurs).

Recommendation of the Ruby Tuesday Board of Directors (see page 23)

After careful consideration, the Ruby Tuesday board unanimously approved the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement. Certain factors considered by the Ruby Tuesday board in reaching its decision to approve and adopt the
merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement can be found in the section entitled “The Merger

On October 15, 2017, at a meeting of the Ruby Tuesday board held to evaluate the merger and the merger agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby, Ruby Tuesday’s financial advisor, UBS Securities LLC (“UBS”), delivered to the Ruby Tuesday board an oral opinion,
which opinion was subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion, dated October 16, 2017, to the effect that, as of that date and based on
and subject to various assumptions made, matters considered, and qualifications and limitations described in its written opinion, the $2.40 per share
merger consideration to be received by the holders of Ruby Tuesday common stock (other than Holding, Merger Subsidiary and their affiliates) in
the merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.

The full text of UBS’s written opinion to the Ruby Tuesday board describes the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered,
and qualifications and limitations on the review undertaken by UBS. The opinion is attached to this proxy statement as Annex B and is
incorporated into this proxy statement by reference. The summary of UBS’s opinion in this proxy statement is qualified in its entirety by
reference to the full text of UBS’s written opinion. Holders of Ruby Tuesday common stock are encouraged to read UBS’s opinion carefully
in its entirety. UBS’s opinion was provided for the benefit of the Ruby Tuesday board (in its capacity as such) in connection with, and for
the purpose of, its evaluation of the $2.40 per share merger consideration to be received by the holders of Ruby Tuesday common stock
(other than Holding, Merger Subsidiary and their affiliates) in the merger from a financial point of view, and does not address any other
aspect of the merger or any related transaction. UBS’s opinion does not address the relative merits of the merger or any related
transaction as compared to other business strategies or transactions that might be available with respect to Ruby Tuesday or Ruby
Tuesday’s underlying business decision to effect the merger or any related transaction. UBS’s opinion does not constitute a
recommendation to any stockholder of Ruby Tuesday as to how such stockholder should vote or act with respect to the merger or any
related transaction.

Financing of the Merger (see page 61)

Completion of the merger is not subject to a financing condition. The merger consideration and other merger-related expenses, such as the
retirement of certain debt obligations of Ruby Tuesday, is being financed through a combination of financing sources, including (i) an equity
commitment pursuant to which the Fund has agreed to provide equity financing; (ii) four purchase and sale agreements whereby four
sale-leaseback providers (each, an “SLB Buyer”) have agreed to provide financing in the form of sale-leaseback transactions involving certain of
Ruby Tuesday’s real property assets; and (iii) a debt commitment whereby Goldman Sachs Specialty Lending Group, L.P. and TCW Direct
Lending Group, together with its affiliates (together with the financing sources described in clause (ii), the “Debt Financing Sources”) have agreed
to provide financing of up to $156,000,000 in the form of senior secured loans and letters of credit (the “Senior Debt Commitment,” and
collectively with the commitments in the foregoing clause (ii), the “Debt Financing Commitments,” and collectively with the commitments in the
foregoing clauses (i)-(ii), the “Financing Commitments”). Holding will fund the merger consideration and certain merger-related expenses with
(i) up to $90,000,000 from the Fund, (ii) up to $178,464,271 from the sale-leaseback transactions, (iii) up to $133,500,000 of up to $156,000,000
from the Senior Debt Commitment ($10,000,000 is required to remain on the balance sheet of Ruby Tuesday and its subsidiaries post closing and
up to $12,500,000 is expected to be used to backstop and/or replace Ruby Tuesday’s existing letters of credit) and (iv) excess cash of Ruby
Tuesday, which amounted to approximately $48 million as of September 5, 2017 and does not necessarily represent Ruby Tuesday’s cash available
at closing.

Table of Contents

The obligation of the Debt Financing Sources to provide financing is subject to a number of conditions. There is no assurance that these
conditions will be satisfied and therefore the financing may not be funded when required. Holding and Merger Subsidiary do not have the financial
resources to consummate the merger without the financing of the Financing Commitments.

Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger (see page 87)

The exchange of Ruby Tuesday common stock for cash in the merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes and
may also be taxable under state and local and other tax laws. You should read the section entitled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences
of the Merger” beginning on page 87 of this proxy statement and consult your tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of
the merger to you in your particular circumstances, as well as tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or foreign taxing
jurisdiction.

Regulatory Clearances and Approvals Required for the Merger (see page 62)

No filing is necessary under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the “HSR Act”), to complete the
merger. No other regulatory clearance or approval is required.

Expected Timing of the Merger (see page 64)

We expect to complete the merger by the first calendar quarter of 2018. The merger is subject to various conditions, however, and it is
possible that factors outside the control of Ruby Tuesday or Holding could result in the merger being completed at a later time, or not at all. There
may be a substantial amount of time between the special meeting and the completion of the merger. We expect to complete the merger promptly
following the satisfaction or, to the extent permitted, waiver of the other conditions to the consummation of the merger. See the section entitled
“The Merger Agreement—Conditions to Completion of the Merger” beginning on page 77 of this proxy statement.

Conditions to Completion of the Merger (see page 77)

As more fully described in this proxy statement and in the merger agreement, each party’s obligation to consummate the merger depends on a
number of conditions being satisfied (or, if permitted by applicable law, waived), including:
 

 
•  Approval and adoption of the merger agreement by an affirmative vote of the majority of all the votes entitled to be cast by all shares of

Ruby Tuesday common stock entitled to vote thereon in accordance with Georgia law;
 

 
•  No restraining order, preliminary or permanent injunction or other order issued by any court of competent jurisdiction or other legal

restraint or prohibition preventing the consummation of the merger will have taken effect and will still be in effect;
 

 
•  The other party will have performed in all material respects all of its obligations under the merger agreement contemplated to be

performed by it at or prior to the effective time of the merger; and
 

 
•  The accuracy of representations and warranties made by the other party in the merger agreement (subject generally to a material adverse

effect standard, with different standards applicable to certain representations and warranties).

Restrictions on Solicitation of Acquisition Proposals (see page 71)

Subject to certain exceptions, Ruby Tuesday has agreed that, prior to approval and adoption of the merger agreement by Ruby Tuesday
stockholders, it and its subsidiaries will not, and will not authorize or permit any of

their respective directors, officers, employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants and other advisors or representatives to, directly or
indirectly:
 

 •  Solicit, initiate or knowingly take any action to facilitate or encourage the submission of an acquisition proposal;
 

 

•  Enter into or participate in any discussions or negotiations with, furnish any information relating to Ruby Tuesday or any of its
subsidiaries or afford access to the business, properties, assets, books or records of Ruby Tuesday or any of its subsidiaries to, or
otherwise cooperate in any way with, or knowingly assist, participate in, facilitate or encourage any effort by, any third party that is
seeking to make, or has made, an acquisition proposal;

 

 
•  Amend, modify or grant any waiver or release under any standstill, confidentiality or similar agreement of Ruby Tuesday or any of its

subsidiaries; or
 

 
•  Enter into any agreement in principle, letter of intent, term sheet, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement or other

similar instrument relating to an acquisition proposal.

Prior to approval and adoption of the merger agreement by Ruby Tuesday stockholders, however, Ruby Tuesday may, upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in the merger agreement, provide information to and engage in discussions or negotiations with a third party if
such third party has made a bona fide unsolicited written acquisition proposal (including bona fide unsolicited acquisition proposals from a third
party that may have otherwise submitted proposals prior to the date of the merger agreement) that the Ruby Tuesday board reasonably believes
after consultation with outside legal counsel constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a superior proposal.

Changes in Board Recommendation (see page 73)

Except as provided in the paragraphs below, under the terms of the merger agreement, Ruby Tuesday has agreed not to fail to make, withdraw
or modify in a manner adverse to Holding, Ruby Tuesday board’s recommendation in favor of the merger (or recommend an acquisition proposal
or make any public statement inconsistent with Ruby Tuesday board’s recommendation in favor of the merger) (any of the foregoing being referred
to as an “Adverse Recommendation Change”).

However, the Ruby Tuesday board may withhold, qualify, change or fail to make its recommendation with respect to approval and adoption
of the merger agreement:
 

 

•  Following receipt of a bona fide acquisition proposal that did not result from a breach of the obligations described in the section entitled
“The Merger Agreement—Restrictions on Solicitation of Acquisition Proposals” beginning on page 71 of this proxy statement that the
Ruby Tuesday board reasonably believes after consultation with outside legal counsel constitutes or would reasonably be expected to
lead to a superior proposal; or

 

 

•  Following certain intervening events that (i) arise after the date of the merger agreement and which events were unknown (or if known,
the consequences or magnitude of which were not known or reasonably foreseeable) to the Ruby Tuesday board as of or prior to the
date of the merger agreement and (ii) involve or relate to the financing and are unrelated to an acquisition proposal, if the Ruby Tuesday
board determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties;

but in each case giving Holding the opportunity to negotiate in good faith and make adjustments to the merger agreement in response to the
proposed change in recommendation.

Table of Contents

In the event that the Ruby Tuesday board is permitted to change its recommendation with respect to the merger agreement following the
receipt of an acquisition proposal that it determines to be a superior proposal, Ruby Tuesday may also terminate the merger agreement to enter into
a definitive written agreement for such superior proposal if immediately before and as a condition to such termination, Ruby Tuesday pays to
Holding the fee required to be paid to Holding as described in the section entitled “The Merger Agreement—Termination Fee Payable by Ruby
Tuesday” beginning on page 79 of this proxy statement.

In addition, if the Ruby Tuesday board changes its recommendation with respect to the merger agreement, Holding may terminate the merger
agreement and collect a termination fee as described in the section entitled “The Merger Agreement—Termination Fee Payable by Ruby Tuesday”
beginning on page 79 of this proxy statement.

Termination of the Merger Agreement (see page 78)

has been the cause of, or resulted in, such action by such governmental authority; or

 

 
•  At the meeting of Ruby Tuesday stockholders to approve and adopt the merger agreement (including any adjournment or

postponement thereof), the approval and adoption of the merger agreement by the stockholders is not obtained;

proposal concerning a superior proposal and, concurrently with such termination, Ruby Tuesday pays to Holding any fees
required to be paid to Holding as described in the section entitled “The Merger Agreement—Termination Fee Payable by Ruby
Tuesday” beginning on page 79 of this proxy statement; or

 

 
•  All of the closing conditions have been satisfied, Ruby Tuesday has given written notice to Holding and Merger Subsidiary that

it is prepared to consummate the merger and Holding and Merger Subsidiary fail to consummate the merger within five business
days after the date that all of the closing conditions have been satisfied or waived; or

real property or (iii) any other transactions in connection with the foregoing, in each case that does not result in a change of

 •  Ruby Tuesday is not entitled to receive the termination fee payable by Holding.

Termination Fee Payable by Holding (see page 79)

Holding has agreed to pay Ruby Tuesday a termination fee of $7.5 million in cash upon termination of the merger agreement if Ruby
Tuesday terminates the merger agreement because all of the closing conditions have been satisfied, Ruby Tuesday has given written notice to
Holding and Merger Subsidiary that it is prepared to consummate the merger and Holding and Merger Subsidiary fail to consummate the merger
within five business days after the date that all of the closing conditions have been satisfied or waived.

The Fund entered into a Limited Guarantee dated October 16, 2017 (the “Limited Guarantee”) with Ruby Tuesday to guarantee Holding’s
obligation to pay its termination fee to Ruby Tuesday and certain other specified payments to Ruby Tuesday, subject to the terms and conditions set
forth in the Limited Guarantee. The foregoing summary of the Limited Guarantee is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text of the
Limited Guarantee, a copy of which have been filed on Ruby Tuesday’s Current Report on Form 8-K dated October 16, 2017, and which is
incorporated by reference into this proxy statement.

Remedies; Maximum Liability (see page 80)

The merger agreement provides that in no event will either Ruby Tuesday or Holding be required to pay its termination fee more than once.

The merger agreement also provides that, upon any termination of the merger agreement under circumstances where the termination fee is
payable by either party and is paid in full, the other party is precluded from any other remedy against such party, and neither the other party nor any
of its respective former, current and future direct or indirect equity holders, controlling persons, stockholders, directors, officers, employees, agents,
affiliates, members, managers, general or limited partners or assignees will have any further liability or obligation arising out of the merger
agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby.

Specific Performance (see page 80)

The merger agreement provides that the parties will be entitled to an injunction to prevent breaches of the merger agreement and to
specifically enforce the performance of the terms and provisions of the merger agreement.

Dissenters’ Rights (page 82 and Annex C)

Under the GBCC, any record holder of Ruby Tuesday common stock at the close of business on the record date who does not vote in favor of
the merger, and who exercises its dissenters’ rights and fully complies with all of the provisions of Article 13 of the GBCC (but not otherwise), will
be entitled to demand and receive payment of the “fair value” for all (but not less than all) of his or her shares of Ruby Tuesday common stock if
the merger is completed. See the section entitled “Dissenters’ Rights of Stockholders” beginning on page 82 of this proxy statement. A copy of
Article 13 of the GBCC is attached as Annex C to this proxy statement.

The Special Meeting (see page 23)

The special meeting of Ruby Tuesday’s stockholders is scheduled to be held at Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP, 450 Lexington Avenue, New
York, NY 10017 on December 20, 2017 at 8:00 a.m., local time. The special meeting is being held in order to consider and vote on the following:
 

 
•  A proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement, which is further described in the sections entitled “The Merger (Proposal 1)”

and “The Merger Agreement,” beginning on pages 28 and 63, respectively, of this proxy statement;
 

 
•  A proposal to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, certain compensation that will or may be paid by Ruby Tuesday to its named

executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the merger, discussed under the section entitled “The Merger (Proposal 1)—
Interests of Ruby Tuesday’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger” beginning on page 54 of this proxy statement; and

 

 
•  A proposal to approve an adjournment of the special meeting, including if necessary to solicit additional proxies in favor of the proposal

to approve and adopt the merger agreement if there are not sufficient votes at the time of such adjournment to approve and adopt the
merger agreement.

Only holders of record of Ruby Tuesday common stock at the close of business on November 17, 2017, the record date for the special
meeting, are entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the special meeting or any adjournments or postponements thereof. At the close of business on
November 15, 2017, 61,190,829 shares of Ruby Tuesday common stock were issued and outstanding, approximately 2.7% of which were held by
Ruby Tuesday’s directors and executive officers. We currently expect that Ruby Tuesday’s directors and executive officers will vote their shares in
favor of the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement and the other proposals to be considered at the special meeting, although no
director or executive officer has entered into any agreement containing an obligation to do so.

The presence at the special meeting, in person or represented by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the shares of Ruby Tuesday common
stock entitled to vote outstanding on the record date will constitute a quorum. There must be a quorum for business to be conducted at the special
meeting. If you submit a properly executed proxy card, even if you abstain from voting, your shares will be counted for purposes of calculating
whether a quorum is present at the special meeting. Failure of a quorum to be represented at the special meeting will necessitate an adjournment or
postponement and will subject Ruby Tuesday to additional expense.

You may cast one vote for each share of Ruby Tuesday common stock that you own at the close of business on the record date. Approval and
adoption of the merger agreement requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast by all shares of
common stock entitled to vote thereon. The proposal to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, certain compensation that will or may be paid by
Ruby Tuesday to its named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the merger requires that the number of votes cast in favor of
the proposal exceed the number of votes opposing the proposal measured by the stock power present in person or represented by proxy at the
special meeting (provided that a quorum is present). The proposal to adjourn the special meeting, including if necessary to permit further
solicitation of proxies, requires that the number of votes cast in favor of the proposal exceed the number of votes opposing the proposal measured
by the stock power present in person or represented by proxy at the special meeting (whether or not a quorum is present).

An abstention occurs when a stockholder attends a meeting, either in person or represented by proxy, but abstains from voting. At the special
meeting, abstentions will be counted in determining whether a quorum is present. Because under Georgia law the approval and adoption of the
merger agreement requires the affirmative vote of the majority of all the votes entitled to be cast by all shares of Ruby Tuesday common stock
entitled to vote thereon, abstentions and a complete failure to vote (including the failure of a record owner to execute and return a proxy card and
the failure of a beneficial owner of shares held in “street name” by a broker, bank or

other nominee to give voting instructions to the broker, bank or other nominee) will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to
approve and adopt the merger agreement. Because the other two proposals require that the number of votes cast in favor of the proposal exceed the
number of votes opposing the proposal measured by the stock power present in person or represented by proxy at the special meeting, abstentions
and a failure to vote (including the failure of a record owner to execute and return a proxy card and the failure of a beneficial owner of shares held
in “street name” by a broker, bank or other nominee to give voting instructions to the broker, bank or other nominee) will have no effect on the
outcome of such proposals.

If no instruction as to how to vote is given (including an instruction to abstain) in an executed, duly returned and not revoked proxy, the
proxy will be voted for (i) the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement; (ii) the proposal to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis,
certain compensation that will or may be paid by Ruby Tuesday to its named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the merger;
and (iii) the proposal to approve the adjournment of the special meeting, including if necessary to solicit additional proxies, if there are not
sufficient votes at the time of such adjournment to approve and adopt the merger agreement.

Interests of Ruby Tuesday’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger (see page 54)

In considering the recommendation of the Ruby Tuesday board to approve and adopt the merger agreement, you should be aware that Ruby
Tuesday’s directors and executive officers have interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, those of Ruby Tuesday stockholders
generally. The Ruby Tuesday board was aware of these interests and considered them, among other matters, in evaluating the merger agreement, in
reaching its decision to approve the merger agreement and in recommending to Ruby Tuesday stockholders that the merger agreement be approved
and adopted. These interests are described in further detail and quantified below under “The Merger (Proposal 1)—Interests of Ruby Tuesday’s
Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger.”

Litigation Related to the Merger (see page 63)

In connection with the merger, as of November 15, 2017, various combinations of Ruby Tuesday, its directors, Holding, Merger Subsidiary
and the Fund have been named as defendants in one or more of six purported stockholder class actions filed in the United States District Court for
the Eastern District of Tennessee by alleged stockholders of Ruby Tuesday. The actions generally seek, among other things, to enjoin the merger, or
in the event that the merger is consummated, rescission of the merger and unspecified damages, costs and attorney’s fees. The defendants believe
that the lawsuits are without merit and intend to defend vigorously against all claims asserted.

Directors’ and Officers’ Indemnification (see page 75)

For six years after the effective time of the merger, Holding has agreed to cause the surviving corporation to indemnify and hold harmless the
present and former directors and officers of Ruby Tuesday, exclusively in their capacity as such (each, an “Indemnified Person”) in respect of acts
or omissions occurring at or prior to the effective time of the merger to the fullest extent permitted by the GBCC or any other applicable law or
provided under Ruby Tuesday’s most recent articles of incorporation and bylaws.

Market Prices of Ruby Tuesday Common Stock (see page 81)

The merger consideration of $2.40 per share represents a premium of approximately 38 percent over Ruby Tuesday’s closing share price on
March 13, 2017, the day before Ruby Tuesday announced its intention to explore strategic alternatives and a premium of approximately 21 percent
over Ruby Tuesday’s closing share price on October 13, 2017, the last trading day prior to the announcement that Ruby Tuesday had entered into
the merger agreement. The closing price of Ruby Tuesday common stock on the NYSE on November 15, 2017 was $2.39 per share. You are
encouraged to obtain current market prices of Ruby Tuesday common stock in connection with voting your shares of Ruby Tuesday common stock.

Q: What will happen in the merger?
 

A: If the merger is completed, Merger Subsidiary will merge with and into Ruby Tuesday, whereupon the separate existence of Merger Subsidiary
will cease and Ruby Tuesday will be the surviving corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Holding. As a result of the merger, Ruby
Tuesday common stock will no longer be publicly traded, and you will no longer have any interest in Ruby Tuesday’s future earnings or growth.
In addition, Ruby Tuesday common stock will be delisted from the NYSE and deregistered under the Exchange Act, and Ruby Tuesday will no
longer be required to file periodic reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) with respect to Ruby Tuesday common
stock, in each case in accordance with applicable law, rules and regulations.

 
Q: Who will own Ruby Tuesday after the merger?
 

A: Immediately following the merger, Ruby Tuesday will be a wholly-owned subsidiary of Holding.

 
Q: What will I receive in the merger?
 

A: Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the merger agreement, if the merger is completed, the holders of Ruby Tuesday common stock will
have the right to receive $2.40 in cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes, for each share of Ruby Tuesday common stock
that they own immediately prior to the effective time of the merger.

 
Q: What will happen in the merger to Ruby Tuesday equity and performance-based cash awards?
 

A: At or immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, to the extent required or permitted by the applicable employee plan:
 

 

•  Each outstanding option to purchase Ruby Tuesday common stock under any employee plan, whether or not exercisable or vested, will be
canceled, and Ruby Tuesday will pay each holder of any such option at or promptly after the effective time of the merger for each stock
option an amount in cash determined by multiplying (i) the excess, if any, of the merger consideration of $2.40 per share over the applicable
exercise price of such stock option, by (ii) the number of shares that such holder could have purchased (assuming full vesting of all stock
options) had such holder exercised such stock option in full immediately prior to the effective time of the merger. In the event that the per
share exercise price of any stock option is equal to or greater than the merger consideration of $2.40 per share, such stock option will be
cancelled, without any consideration being payable in respect thereof, and will have no further force or effect;

 

 

•  Each outstanding service-based restricted stock unit (including service-based phantom stock units) of Ruby Tuesday under any employee
plan, whether or not vested, and whether settleable in shares of Ruby Tuesday common stock or cash, will be canceled, and Ruby Tuesday
will pay each holder of any such outstanding restricted stock unit at or promptly after the effective time of the merger for each such Ruby
Tuesday restricted stock unit an amount in cash equal to the merger consideration of $2.40 per share;

 

 

•  Each outstanding performance-based restricted stock unit (including performance-based phantom stock units) of Ruby Tuesday under any
employee plan, whether or not vested, will be canceled, and Ruby Tuesday will pay each holder of any such outstanding restricted stock unit
at or promptly after the effective time of the merger for each Ruby Tuesday performance-based restricted stock an amount in cash
determined by multiplying (i) the merger consideration of $2.40 per share by (ii) the number of shares of Ruby Tuesday performance-based
restricted stock such holder would have been entitled to if such Ruby Tuesday performance-based restricted stock award had vested at its
“target” level;

 

 
•  Each outstanding restricted share of Ruby Tuesday common stock under any employee plan, whether or not vested, shall be canceled, and

Ruby Tuesday will pay each holder of any such outstanding

restricted shares at or promptly after the effective time for each such restricted share an amount in cash equal to the merger consideration of
$2.40 per share; and

 

 
•  Each outstanding performance-based cash award of Ruby Tuesday under any employee plan, whether or not vested, will vest and pay out at

its “target” level, prorated for the number of days that have elapsed since the beginning of the year in which the effective time of the merger
occurs (up to and including the date on which the effective time of the merger occurs).

 
Q: Am I entitled to exercise dissenters’ rights instead of receiving the merger consideration for my shares of Ruby Tuesday common stock?
 

A: Yes. Under the GBCC, the record holders of Ruby Tuesday common stock at the close of business on the record date are entitled to assert
dissenters’ rights in connection with the merger, provided they follow the procedures and satisfy the conditions set forth in Article 13 of the
GBCC. For more information regarding dissenters’ rights, see the section entitled “Dissenters’ Rights of Stockholders” beginning on page 82 of
this proxy statement. A copy of Article 13 of the GBCC is attached as Annex C to this proxy statement. Failure to strictly comply with Article 13
of the GBCC will result in the loss of dissenters’ rights. We urge any stockholder of Ruby Tuesday who wishes to assert dissenters’ rights to read
the statute carefully and consult with legal counsel before attempting to assert dissenters’ rights.

 
Q: What vote is required to approve and adopt the merger agreement?
 

A: Under Georgia law, the approval and adoption of the merger agreement requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of all the votes
entitled to be cast by all shares of Ruby Tuesday common stock entitled to vote thereon.

 
Q: What vote is required to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, certain compensation that will or may be paid by Ruby Tuesday to its

named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the merger?
 

A: The named executive officer merger-related compensation proposal, approval of which is not required to complete the merger, requires that the
number of votes cast in favor of the proposal exceed the number of votes opposing the proposal measured by the stock power present in person or
represented by proxy at the special meeting (provided a quorum is present in person or represented by proxy).

 
Q: What vote is required to approve the proposal to adjourn the special meeting, including if necessary to solicit additional proxies in favor of the

proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement if there are not sufficient votes at the time of such adjournment to approve and adopt the
merger agreement?

 

A: The proposal to adjourn the special meeting, the approval of which is not required to complete the merger, requires that the number of votes cast in
favor of the proposal exceed the number of votes opposing the proposal measured by the stock power present in person or represented by proxy at
the special meeting (whether or not a quorum is present).

 
Q: When do you expect the merger to be completed?
 

A: In order to complete the merger, Ruby Tuesday must obtain the stockholder approval of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement described in
this proxy statement and the other closing conditions under the merger agreement must be satisfied or waived. The parties to the merger agreement
currently expect to complete the merger by the first calendar quarter of 2018, although Ruby Tuesday cannot assure completion by any particular
date, if at all. Because the merger is subject to a number of conditions, the exact timing of the merger cannot be determined at this time.

Q: Why am I being asked to consider and act upon a proposal to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, certain compensation that will or may
be paid by Ruby Tuesday to its named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the merger?

 

A: SEC rules require Ruby Tuesday to seek a non-binding, advisory vote to approve any agreements or understandings and compensation that will or
may be paid by Ruby Tuesday to its named executive officers in connection with the merger. Approval of this proposal by Ruby Tuesday’s
stockholders is not required to complete the merger.

 
Q: Do you expect the merger to be taxable to Ruby Tuesday stockholders?
 

A: The exchange of Ruby Tuesday common stock for cash in the merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes and may
also be taxable under state and local and other tax laws. You should read the section entitled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of
the Merger” beginning on page 87 of this proxy statement and consult your tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the
merger to you in your particular circumstances, as well as tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or foreign taxing jurisdiction.

 
Q: Who is entitled to vote at the special meeting?
 

A: The record date for the special meeting is November 17, 2017. Only stockholders of record at the close of business on that date are entitled to
attend and vote at the special meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof. The only class of stock that can be voted at the meeting is
Ruby Tuesday common stock. Each outstanding share of Ruby Tuesday common stock is entitled to one vote on all matters that come before the
meeting. At the close of business on November 15, 2017, there were 61,190,829 shares of Ruby Tuesday common stock issued and outstanding,
approximately 2.7% of which were held by Ruby Tuesday’s directors and executive officers. We currently expect that Ruby Tuesday’s directors
and executive officers will vote their shares in favor of the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement and the other proposals to be
considered at the special meeting, although no director or executive officer is obligated to do so.

 
Q: Who may attend the special meeting?
 

A: Only stockholders as of the close of business on November 17, 2017, or their duly appointed proxies, and invited guests of Ruby Tuesday may
attend the meeting. “Street name” holders (those whose shares are held through a broker, bank or other nominee) should bring a copy of an
account statement reflecting their ownership of Ruby Tuesday common stock as of the record date. If you are a “street name” holder and you wish
to vote at the special meeting, you must also bring a proxy from the record holder (your broker, bank or other nominee) of the shares of Ruby
Tuesday common stock authorizing you to vote at the special meeting. All stockholders should bring photo identification. Cameras, recording
devices, and other electronic devices are not permitted at the special meeting. Registration will begin at 7:30 a.m., local time.

 
Q: Who is soliciting my vote?
 

A: The Ruby Tuesday board is soliciting your proxy, and Ruby Tuesday will bear the cost of soliciting proxies. Innisfree M&A Incorporated
(“Innisfree”) has been retained to assist with the solicitation of proxies. Innisfree will be paid a solicitation fee of $15,000 and will be reimbursed
for its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses for these and other advisory services in connection with the special meeting. Solicitation initially will be
made by mail. Forms of proxies and proxy materials may also be distributed through brokers, custodians, and other like parties to the beneficial
owners of shares of Ruby Tuesday common stock, in which case these parties will be reimbursed for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses.
Proxies may also be solicited in person or by telephone, facsimile, electronic mail or other electronic medium by Innisfree or, without additional
compensation, by certain of Ruby Tuesday’s directors, officers and employees.

Table of Contents

Q: What do I need to do now?
 

A: Carefully read and consider the information contained in and incorporated by reference into this proxy statement, including its annexes. Whether
or not you expect to attend the special meeting in person, please submit a proxy to vote your shares as promptly as possible so that your shares
may be represented and voted at the special meeting.

 
Q: How do I vote if my shares are registered directly in my name?
 

A: If you are a stockholder of record, there are three methods by which you may vote at the special meeting:
 

 
•  Internet: To vote over the internet, log on to the voting site indicated on your proxy card. If you vote over the internet, you do not have to

mail in a proxy card.
 

 
•  Telephone: To vote by telephone, call the toll-free number indicated on your proxy card. If you vote by telephone, you do not have to mail in

a proxy card.
 

 
•  Mail: To vote by mail, complete, sign and date a proxy card and return it promptly in the postage paid envelope provided. If you return your

signed proxy card to us before the special meeting, we will vote your shares as you direct.
 

 •  In Person: To vote in person, attend the special meeting. You will be given a ballot when you arrive.

Whether or not you plan to attend the meeting, we urge you to vote by proxy, whether by internet, by telephone or by mail, to ensure your vote is
counted. You may still attend the meeting and vote your shares in person, even if you have already voted by proxy. If you later decide to vote in
person at the special meeting, your proxy prior to the special meeting will be revoked. Please choose only one method to cast your vote by
proxy. We encourage you to vote over the internet, which is a convenient, cost-effective and reliable alternative to returning a proxy card
by mail.

 
Q: How do I vote if my shares are held in the name of my broker (street name)?
 

A: If your shares are held by your broker, bank or other nominee, often referred to as held in “street name,” you will receive a form from your broker,
bank or other nominee seeking instruction as to how your shares should be voted. You should contact your broker, bank or other nominee with
questions about how to provide or revoke your instructions.

 
Q: How do I vote my shares held in the Ruby Tuesday, Inc. Salary Deferral Plan (the “401(K) Plan”)?
 

A: If you hold shares in the 401(k) Plan, your proxy card will serve as a voting instruction card for Wells Fargo Shareholder Services (the “Plan
Trustee”). You may vote your shares by signing, dating and returning your voting instruction card or providing your voting instructions over the
internet or by telephone in advance of the 401(K) Plan vote deadline on December 17, 2017 11:59 p.m. (Eastern Time). If you return your signed
voting instruction card without indicating how you want your shares of Ruby Tuesday common stock to be voted with regard to a particular
proposal, your shares of Ruby Tuesday common stock will be voted in favor of each such proposal. Voting instruction cards that are returned
without a signature will not constitute valid instructions to the Plan Trustee and the Plan Trustee will not vote shares represented by such voting
instruction cards. If you do not provide voting instructions with respect to the shares held in the 401(k) Plan to the Plan Trustee prior to the 401(k)
Plan vote deadline on December 17, 2017 11:59 p.m. (Eastern Time), your 401(k) Plan shares will not be voted.

Q: Can I change my vote after I submit my proxy?
 

A: Yes. You can change or revoke your proxy at any time before the final vote at the special meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof. If
you are the record holder of your shares, you may change or revoke your proxy in any one of three ways:

 

 •  You may submit another properly completed proxy bearing a later date, whether over the internet, by telephone or by mail;
 

 
•  You may send a written notice prior to the special meeting (or any adjournment or postponement thereof) that you are revoking your proxy

to the Office of the Corporate Secretary, Ruby Tuesday, Inc., 333 East Broadway Avenue, Maryville, Tennessee 37804; or
 

 •  You may attend the special meeting (or any adjournment or postponement thereof) and vote in person.

If your shares are held by your broker, bank or other nominee, you will have to follow the instructions provided by your broker, bank or other
nominee to change or revoke your proxy.

If you have questions about how to vote or change your vote, please contact Innisfree, the firm assisting us in the solicitation of proxies, toll-free
at 1 (888) 750-5834. Banks and brokers may call collect at 1 (212) 750-5833.

 
Q: How many shares must be present to constitute a quorum for the meeting?
 

A: The presence at the special meeting, in person or represented by proxy, of a majority of the shares of Ruby Tuesday common stock outstanding
and entitled to vote on the record date will constitute a quorum. There must be a quorum for business to be conducted at the special meeting.
Failure of a quorum to be present at the special meeting will necessitate an adjournment or postponement and will subject Ruby Tuesday to
additional expense.

 
Q: What if I abstain from voting?
 

A: If you attend the special meeting or send in your signed proxy card, but abstain from voting on any proposal, your shares will still be counted for
purposes of determining whether a quorum exists. If you abstain from voting on the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement at the
special meeting, it will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” such proposal. If you abstain from voting on the other two proposals, it will
have no effect on the outcome of such proposals.

 
Q: Will my shares be voted if I do not sign and return my proxy card or vote over the internet, by telephone or in person?
 

A: If you are a registered stockholder and you do not sign and return your proxy card or vote over the internet, by telephone or in person, your shares
will not be voted at the special meeting and will not be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum exists.

If your shares are held in street name and you do not issue instructions to your broker, bank or other nominee, your broker, bank or other nominee
may vote your shares at its discretion on routine matters, but may not vote your shares on non-routine matters. Under NYSE rules, all of the
proposals in this proxy statement are non-routine matters. Accordingly, if your shares are held in “street name” and you do not issue instructions
to your broker, bank or other nominee, your shares will not be voted at the special meeting and will not be counted for purposes of determining
whether a quorum exists.

If you fail to complete, sign, date and return your proxy card by mail, or vote via the internet, by telephone or in person, it will have the same
effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement, but will have no effect on the other proposals.

If you hold shares in the 401(k) Plan and you do not sign and return your voting instruction card or provide your voting instructions over the
internet or by telephone in advance of the 401(k) Plan vote deadline, your 401(k) Plan shares will not be voted at the special meeting and will not
be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum exists.

 
Q: What is a broker non-vote?
 

A: Broker non-votes are shares held by brokers and other record holders that are present in person or represented by proxy at the special meeting, but
with respect to which the broker or other record holder is not instructed by the beneficial owner of such shares how to vote on a particular proposal
and the broker does not have discretionary voting power on such proposal. Because brokers and other record holders do not have discretionary
voting authority with respect to any of the three proposals described in this proxy statement, if a beneficial owner of shares of Ruby Tuesday
common stock held in “street name” does not give voting instructions to the broker or other holder of record, then those shares will not be present
in person or represented by proxy at the special meeting. As a result, it is expected that there will not be any broker non-votes in connection with
any of the three proposals described in this proxy statement.

If you do not instruct your broker, bank or other nominee to vote your shares, your shares will not be voted and the effect will be the same as a
vote “AGAINST” the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement. However, a failure to instruct your broker, bank or other nominee to
vote on the non-binding proposal regarding merger-related compensation for Ruby Tuesday’s named executive officers (assuming a quorum is
present) or the proposal to adjourn the special meeting, including if necessary to solicit additional proxies for the approval and adoption of the
merger agreement, will have no effect on the outcome of such proposals.

 
Q: Will my shares held in “street name” or another form of record ownership be combined for voting purposes with shares I hold of record?
 

A: No. Because any shares you may hold in “street name” will be deemed to be held by a different stockholder than any shares you hold of record,
any shares so held will not be combined for voting purposes with shares you hold of record. Similarly, if you own shares in various registered
forms, such as jointly with your spouse, as trustee of a trust or as custodian for a minor, you will receive, and will need to sign and return, a
separate proxy card for those shares because they are held in a different form of record ownership. Shares held by a corporation or business entity
must be voted by an authorized officer of the entity. Shares held in an individual retirement account must be voted under the rules governing the
account.

 
Q: What does it mean if I receive more than one set of proxy materials?
 

A: This means you own shares of Ruby Tuesday common stock that are registered under different names or are in more than one account. For
example, you may own some shares directly as a stockholder of record and other shares through a broker or you may own shares through more
than one broker. In these situations, you will receive multiple sets of proxy materials. You must vote, sign and return all of the proxy cards or
follow the instructions for any alternative voting procedure on each of the proxy cards that you receive in order to vote all of the shares you own.
Each proxy card you receive comes with its own prepaid return envelope. If you submit your proxy by mail, make sure you return each proxy card
in the return envelope that accompanies that proxy card.

 
Q: Who will count the votes?
 

A: A representative from Broadridge Investor Communications Services will serve as the inspector of election.

Q: Can I participate if I am unable to attend the special meeting?
 

A: If you are unable to attend the meeting in person, we encourage you to complete, sign, date and return your proxy card or to vote over the internet
or by telephone. The special meeting will not be broadcast telephonically or over the internet.

 
Q: Where can I find the voting results of the special meeting?
 

A: Ruby Tuesday intends to announce preliminary voting results at the special meeting and publish final results in a Current Report on Form 8-K that
will be filed with the SEC following the special meeting. All reports that Ruby Tuesday files with the SEC are publicly available when filed.

 
Q: What happens if the merger is not completed?
 

A: If the merger agreement is not approved and adopted by Ruby Tuesday stockholders or if the merger is not completed for any other reason, Ruby
Tuesday stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of Ruby Tuesday common stock in connection with the merger. Instead, Ruby
Tuesday will remain an independent public company and shares of Ruby Tuesday common stock will continue to be listed and traded on the
NYSE.

The merger agreement provides that, upon termination of the merger agreement under certain circumstances, Ruby Tuesday will be required to
pay to Holding a termination fee of $7.5 million. See the section entitled “The Merger Agreement—Termination Fee Payable by Ruby Tuesday”
beginning on page 79 of this proxy statement for a discussion of the circumstances under which such a termination fee will be required to be paid.

The merger agreement also provides that, upon termination of the merger agreement under certain circumstances, Holding will be required to pay
to Ruby Tuesday a termination fee of $7.5 million. See the section entitled “The Merger Agreement—Termination Fee Payable by Holding”
beginning on page 79 of this proxy statement for a discussion of the circumstances under which such a termination fee will be required to be paid.

 
Q: How can I obtain additional information about Ruby Tuesday?
 

A: Ruby Tuesday will provide copies of this proxy statement and its 2016 Annual Report to Stockholders, including its Annual Report on Form 10-K
for the fiscal year ended June 6, 2017, without charge to any stockholder who makes a written request to our Corporate Secretary at Ruby
Tuesday, Inc., 333 East Broadway Avenue, Maryville, Tennessee 37804. Ruby Tuesday’s Annual Report on Form 10-K and other SEC filings may
also be accessed at www.sec.gov or on the Investor Relations section of Ruby Tuesday’s website at www.rubytuesday.com. Ruby Tuesday’s
website address is provided as an inactive textual reference only. The information provided on or accessible through our website is not part of this
proxy statement and is not incorporated in this proxy statement by reference by this or any other reference to our website provided in this proxy
statement.

 
Q: How many copies of this proxy statement and related voting materials should I receive if I share an address with another stockholder?
 

A: The SEC has adopted rules that permit companies and intermediaries, such as brokers, to satisfy the delivery requirements for proxy statements
and annual reports with respect to two or more stockholders sharing the same address by delivering a single annual report or proxy statement, as
applicable, addressed to those stockholders. This process, which is commonly referred to as “householding,” potentially provides extra
convenience for stockholders and cost savings for companies.

Ruby Tuesday and some brokers may be householding our proxy materials by delivering proxy materials to multiple stockholders who request a
copy and share an address, unless contrary instructions have been received from the affected stockholders. Once you have received notice from
your broker or us that they or we will be householding materials to your address, householding will continue until you are notified otherwise or
until you revoke your consent. If at any time you no longer wish to participate in householding and would prefer to receive a separate proxy
statement and annual report, please notify your broker if your shares are held in a brokerage account or Ruby Tuesday if you are a stockholder of
record. You can notify us by sending a written request to Ruby Tuesday, Inc., 333 East Broadway Avenue, Maryville, Tennessee 37804

may request that in the future they receive a single copy by notifying Ruby Tuesday at the telephone and address set forth in the prior sentence. In
addition, Ruby Tuesday will promptly deliver, upon written or oral request to the address or telephone number above, a separate copy of the proxy
statement to a stockholder at a shared address to which a single copy of the documents was delivered pursuant to a prior request.

CAUTION REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

This proxy statement, and the documents incorporated by reference or otherwise referred to in this proxy statement, contain forward-looking
statements within the meaning of the U.S. federal securities laws, including, without limitation, statements regarding management’s expectations,
beliefs, intentions or future strategies that are signified by the words “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “potential,”
“predicts,” “projects” or similar words or phrases, although not all forward-looking statements contain such identifying words. Investors and security
holders are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which are based on information available to Ruby Tuesday on the
date hereof. Although these expectations may change, Ruby Tuesday assumes no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements
whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Forward-looking statements necessarily involve risks and uncertainties, many of
which are outside of Ruby Tuesday’s control, that could cause actual results to differ materially from such statements and from Ruby Tuesday’s
historical results and experience. These risks and uncertainties include such things as:
 

 
•  The occurrence of any event, change or other circumstance that could give rise to the termination of the merger agreement, including a

termination of the merger agreement under circumstances that could require Ruby Tuesday to pay a termination fee;
 

 •  The risk that part or all of the financing under the Financing Commitments may become unavailable;
 

 
•  The failure to receive, on a timely basis or otherwise, the required approvals by Ruby Tuesday stockholders with regard to the merger

agreement;
 

 •  The risk that a closing condition to the merger agreement may not be satisfied;
 

 •  Ruby Tuesday’s and Holding’s ability to complete the proposed merger on a timely basis or at all;
 

 •  The failure of the merger to be completed on a timely basis or at all for any other reason;
 

 •  The risks that Ruby Tuesday’s business may suffer as a result of uncertainties surrounding the merger;
 

 
•  The ability of Ruby Tuesday to retain and hire key personnel and maintain relationships with customers, suppliers and other business

partners pending the consummation of the merger;
 

 
•  The possibility of disruption to Ruby Tuesday’s business from the proposed merger, including increased costs and diversion of management

time and resources;
 

 •  Limitations placed on Ruby Tuesday’s ability to operate its business under the merger agreement;
 

 •  General economic conditions;
 

 •  The possibility that costs related to the merger will be greater than expected;
 

 
•  The outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted against Ruby Tuesday or others relating to the merger agreement or the merger;

and
 

 •  Other financial, operational and legal risks and uncertainties detailed from time to time in Ruby Tuesday’s SEC reports.

Additional information about risks and uncertainties, and about the material factors or assumptions underlying such forward-looking statements
may be found under Part I, Item 1A in Ruby Tuesday’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 6, 2017 and under Part II, Item 1A in
Ruby Tuesday’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended September 5, 2017. Ruby Tuesday cautions that the foregoing list of
important factors that may affect future results is not exhaustive. When relying on forward-looking statements to make decisions with respect to the

THE SPECIAL MEETING

This proxy statement is being provided to the stockholders of Ruby Tuesday as part of a solicitation of proxies by the Ruby Tuesday board for use
at the special meeting to be held at the time and place specified below, and at any properly convened meeting following an adjournment or
postponement thereof. This proxy statement provides stockholders of Ruby Tuesday with the information they need to know to be able to vote or instruct
their vote to be cast at the special meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof.

Date, Time and Place

The special meeting is scheduled to be held at Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP, 450 Lexington Avenue, New York, NY 10017 on December 20, 2017
at 8:00 a.m., local time.

Purpose of the Special Meeting

At the special meeting, Ruby Tuesday stockholders will be asked to consider and vote on the following:
 

 
•  A proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement, which is further described in the sections entitled “The Merger (Proposal 1)” and

“The Merger Agreement,” beginning on pages 28 and 63, respectively, of this proxy statement;
 

 
•  A proposal to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, certain compensation that will or may be paid by Ruby Tuesday to its named

executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the merger, discussed under the section entitled “The Merger (Proposal 1)—
Interests of Ruby Tuesday’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger” beginning on page 54 of this proxy statement; and

 

 
•  A proposal to approve an adjournment of the special meeting, including if necessary to solicit additional proxies in favor of the proposal to

approve and adopt the merger agreement, if there are not sufficient votes at the time of such adjournment to approve and adopt the merger
agreement.

Ruby Tuesday stockholders must approve and adopt the merger agreement for the merger to occur. If Ruby Tuesday stockholders fail to approve
and adopt the merger agreement, the merger will not occur. The vote on executive compensation payable in connection with the merger is a vote
separate and apart from the vote to approve and adopt the merger agreement. Accordingly, a stockholder may vote to approve the executive
compensation payable in connection with the merger and vote not to approve and adopt the merger agreement and vice versa. Because the vote on
executive compensation is advisory in nature only, it will not be binding on either Ruby Tuesday or Holding. Accordingly, because Ruby Tuesday is
contractually obligated to pay the compensation, the compensation will be payable, subject only to the conditions applicable thereto, if the merger
agreement is approved and adopted and the merger is consummated, and regardless of the outcome of the advisory vote.

Ruby Tuesday does not expect a vote to be taken on any other matters at the special meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof. If any
other matters are properly presented at the special meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof for consideration, however, the holders of the
proxies will have discretion to vote on these matters.

Recommendation of the Ruby Tuesday Board of Directors

After careful consideration, the Ruby Tuesday board unanimously approved the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement. Certain factors considered by the Ruby Tuesday board in reaching its decision to authorize and approve the
merger agreement and the merger can be found in the section entitled “The Merger (Proposal 1)—Ruby Tuesday’s Reasons for the Merger” beginning
on page 45 of this proxy statement.

Table of Contents

The Ruby Tuesday board unanimously recommends that the Ruby Tuesday stockholders vote “FOR” the proposal to approve and adopt
the merger agreement, “FOR” the proposal to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, certain compensation that will or may be paid by
Ruby Tuesday to its named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the merger and “FOR” the proposal to adjourn the special
meeting, including if necessary to solicit additional proxies in favor of the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement, if there are not
sufficient votes at the time of such adjournment to approve and adopt the merger agreement.

Record Date; Stockholders Entitled to Vote

Only holders of record of Ruby Tuesday common stock at the close of business on November 17, 2017, the record date for the special meeting,
will be entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the special meeting or any adjournments or postponements of the special meeting. At the close of business on
November 15, 2017, 61,190,829 shares of Ruby Tuesday common stock were issued and outstanding, and there were 1,805 holders of record of Ruby
Tuesday common stock.

Holders of record of Ruby Tuesday common stock are entitled to one vote for each share of Ruby Tuesday common stock they own at the close of
business on the record date.

Quorum

The presence at the special meeting, in person or represented by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the shares of Ruby Tuesday common stock
outstanding and entitled to vote on the record date will constitute a quorum. Any shares of Ruby Tuesday common stock held by Ruby Tuesday are not
considered to be outstanding for purposes of determining a quorum. There must be a quorum for business to be conducted at the special meeting. Failure
of a quorum to be represented at the special meeting will necessitate an adjournment or postponement and will subject Ruby Tuesday to additional
expense. Once a share is represented at the special meeting, it will be counted for the purpose of determining a quorum at the special meeting and any
adjournment of the special meeting. However, if a new record date is set for the adjourned special meeting, then a new quorum will have to be
established. If you submit a properly executed proxy card, even if you abstain from voting, your shares will be counted for purposes of calculating
whether a quorum is present at the special meeting.

Required Vote

Approval and adoption of the merger agreement requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast by all
of our shares of common stock entitled to vote thereon. The proposal to adjourn the special meeting, including if necessary to permit further solicitation
of proxies, requires that the number of votes cast in favor of the proposal exceed the number of votes opposing the proposal measured by the stock
power present in person or represented by proxy at the special meeting (whether or not a quorum is present). The proposal to approve, on a non-binding,
advisory basis, certain compensation that will or may be paid by Ruby Tuesday to its named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to
the merger requires that the number of votes cast in favor of the proposal exceed the number of votes opposing the proposal measured by the stock
power present in person or represented by proxy at the special meeting (provided that a quorum is present).

Abstentions and Broker Non-Votes

An abstention occurs when a stockholder attends a meeting, either in person or represented by proxy, but abstains from voting. At the special
meeting, abstentions will be counted in determining whether a quorum is present, and will be counted as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to approve
and adopt the merger agreement. At the special meeting, abstentions will have no effect on the outcomes of the proposal to adjourn the special meeting,
including if necessary to permit further solicitation of proxies, and the advisory vote on named executive officer merger-related compensation.

Table of Contents

If no instruction as to how to vote is given (including an instruction to abstain) in an executed, duly returned and not revoked proxy, the proxy will
be voted “FOR” (i) the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement; (ii) the proposal to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, certain
compensation that will or may be paid by Ruby Tuesday to its named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the merger; and (iii) the
proposal to approve the adjournment of the special meeting, including if necessary to solicit additional proxies, if there are not sufficient votes at the
time of such adjournment to approve and adopt the merger agreement.

Broker non-votes are shares held by brokers and other record holders that are present in person or represented by proxy at the special meeting, but
with respect to which the broker or other record holder is not instructed by the beneficial owner of such shares how to vote on a particular proposal and
the broker does not have discretionary voting power on such proposal. Because brokers and other record holders do not have discretionary voting
authority with respect to any of the three proposals described in this proxy statement, if a beneficial owner of shares of Ruby Tuesday common stock
held in “street name” does not give voting instructions to the broker or other holder of record, then those shares will not be present in person or
represented by proxy at the special meeting. As a result, it is expected that there will not be any broker non-votes in connection with any of the three
proposals described in this proxy statement. If you do not instruct your broker, bank or other nominee to vote your shares, your shares will not be voted
and the effect will be the same as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement. However, a failure to instruct your
broker, bank or other nominee to vote on the proposal to adjourn the special meeting, including if necessary to solicit additional proxies for the approval
and adoption of the merger agreement or, assuming a quorum is present, the proposal regarding the advisory vote on named executive officer
merger-related compensation, will have no effect on the outcome of such proposals.

Failure to Vote

If you are a registered stockholder and you do not sign and return your proxy card or vote over the internet, by telephone or in person, your shares
will not be voted at the special meeting and will not be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum exists. If you are the record owner of
your shares and you fail to vote, it will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement but will
have no effect on the proposal to adjourn the special meeting (whether or not a quorum is present), including if necessary to permit further solicitation of
proxies, and the advisory vote on named executive officer merger-related compensation (assuming a quorum is present).

Voting by Ruby Tuesday’s Directors and Executive Officers

At the close of business on November 15, 2017, directors and executive officers of Ruby Tuesday and their affiliates were entitled to vote
1,147,693 shares of Ruby Tuesday common stock, or approximately 1.9% of the shares of Ruby Tuesday common stock issued and outstanding on that
date. We currently expect that Ruby Tuesday’s directors and executive officers will vote their shares in favor of the proposal to approve and adopt the
merger agreement and the other proposals to be considered at the special meeting, although none of them is obligated to do so.

Voting at the Special Meeting

If you plan to attend the special meeting and wish to vote in person, you will be given a ballot at the special meeting. Please note that if your
shares of Ruby Tuesday common stock are held by a broker, bank or other nominee, and you wish to vote at the special meeting, you must bring to the
special meeting a legal proxy from the record holder (your broker, bank or other nominee) of the shares of Ruby Tuesday common stock authorizing you
to vote at the special meeting.

You may also authorize the persons named as proxies on the proxy card to vote your shares by (i) signing, dating, completing and returning the
proxy card by mail; (ii) over the internet; or (iii) by telephone. Ruby

Tuesday encourages you to vote over the internet as Ruby Tuesday believes this is the most cost-effective method. We also recommend that you
vote as soon as possible, even if you are planning to attend the special meeting, so that the vote count will not be delayed. The internet provides a
convenient, cost-effective alternative to returning your proxy card by mail or voting by telephone. If you vote your shares over the internet, you may
incur costs associated with electronic access, such as usage charges from internet access providers. If you choose to vote your shares over the internet,
there is no need for you to mail back your proxy card.

To Vote Over the Internet:

To vote over the internet, log on to the voting site indicated on your proxy card. If you vote over the internet, you do not have to mail in a proxy
card.

To Vote By Telephone:

To Vote By Mail:

To vote by mail, complete, sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card and mail it to the address indicated on the proxy card.

If you return your signed proxy card without indicating how you want your shares of Ruby Tuesday common stock to be voted with regard to a
particular proposal, your shares of Ruby Tuesday common stock will be voted in favor of each such proposal. Proxy cards that are returned without a
signature will not be counted as present at the special meeting and cannot be voted.

If your shares are held in the 401(k) Plan, you may provide the Plan Trustee with your voting instructions over the internet, by telephone, or by
mail, by following the instructions on your voting instruction card.

If your shares are held by your broker, bank or other nominee, you will receive a form from your broker, bank or other nominee seeking
instruction as to how your shares should be voted. You should contact your broker, bank or other nominee with questions about how to provide or
revoke your instructions.

If you hold shares in more than one account, you may receive more than one proxy or voting instruction card. To be sure that all of your shares are
represented at the meeting, you must submit your proxy or voting instructions with respect to each proxy or voting instruction card you receive.

Revocation of Proxies

You can revoke your proxy at any time before the final vote at the special meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof. If you are the
record holder of your shares, you may revoke your proxy in any one of three ways:
 

 •  You may submit another properly completed proxy bearing a later date, whether over the internet, by telephone or by mail;
 

 
•  You may send a written notice prior to the special meeting (or any adjournment or postponement thereof) that you are revoking your proxy

to the Office of the Corporate Secretary, Ruby Tuesday, Inc., 333 East Broadway Avenue, Maryville, Tennessee 37804; or
 

 •  You may attend the special meeting (or any adjournment or postponement thereof) and vote in person.

If your shares are held by your broker, bank or other nominee, you will have to follow the instructions provided by your broker, bank or other
nominee to revoke your proxy.

toll-free at 1 (888) 750-5834. Banks and brokers may call collect at 1(212) 750-5833.

Shares Held in Name of Broker

If your shares are held by your broker, bank or other nominee, often referred to as held in “street name,” you will receive a form from your broker,
bank or other nominee seeking instruction as to how your shares should be voted. You should contact your broker, bank or other nominee with questions
about how to provide or revoke your instructions.

Shares Held in the 401(k) Plan

If you hold shares in the 401(k) Plan, your proxy card will serve as a voting instruction card for the Plan Trustee. If you do not sign and return
your voting instruction card or provide your voting instructions over the internet or by telephone in advance of the 401(k) Plan vote deadline on
December 17, 2017 11:59 p.m. (Eastern Time), your shares will not be voted by the Plan Trustee at the special meeting and will not be counted for
purposes of determining whether a quorum exists. 401(k) Plan participants may not vote their 401(k) Plan shares in person at the special meeting.

Tabulation of Votes

A representative from Broadridge Investor Communications Services will serve as the inspector of election.

Solicitation of Proxies

The Ruby Tuesday board is soliciting your proxy, and Ruby Tuesday will bear the cost of soliciting proxies. Innisfree has been retained to assist
with the solicitation of proxies. Innisfree will be paid a solicitation fee of $15,000 and will be reimbursed for its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses for
these and other advisory services in connection with the special meeting. Solicitation initially will be made by mail. Forms of proxies and proxy
materials may also be distributed through brokers, custodians and other like parties to the beneficial owners of shares of Ruby Tuesday common stock,
in which case these parties will be reimbursed for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses. Proxies may also be solicited in person or by telephone,
facsimile, electronic mail, or other electronic medium by Innisfree or, without additional compensation, by certain of Ruby Tuesday’s directors, officers
and employees.

Adjournment

In addition to the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement and the advisory vote on named executive officer merger-related
compensation, Ruby Tuesday stockholders are also being asked to approve a proposal to, as permitted under the terms of the merger agreement, adjourn
the special meeting for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies in favor of the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement if there are not
sufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve and adopt the merger agreement. If this proposal is approved, the special meeting could be
adjourned by Ruby Tuesday. In addition, Ruby Tuesday could postpone the meeting before it commences, whether for the purpose of soliciting
additional proxies or for other reasons. If the special meeting is adjourned for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies, stockholders who have already
submitted their proxies will be able to revoke them at any time prior to their use at the special meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof. If
you return a proxy and do not indicate how you wish to vote on any proposal, your shares will be voted in favor of such proposal.

The special meeting may be adjourned to another place, date or time, if the number of votes cast in favor of the proposal exceed the number of
votes opposing the proposal measured by the stock power present in person or represented by proxy at the special meeting (whether or not a quorum is
present). The chairman of the meeting or the Ruby Tuesday board may also adjourn the special meeting to another date, place or time.

The Ruby Tuesday board unanimously recommends a vote “FOR” the proposal to adjourn the special meeting, including if necessary to
solicit additional proxies in favor of the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement, if there are not sufficient votes at the time of such
adjournment to approve and adopt the merger agreement.

Other Information

You should not send documents representing Ruby Tuesday common stock with the proxy card. If the merger is completed, the exchange agent for
the merger will send you a letter of transmittal and instructions for exchanging your shares of Ruby Tuesday common stock for the merger
consideration.

THE MERGER (PROPOSAL 1)

The discussion of the merger in this proxy statement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the merger agreement, a copy of which is attached to
this proxy statement as Annex A and incorporated by reference into this proxy statement. You should read the merger agreement carefully as it is the
legal document that governs the merger.

Effects of the Merger

Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, at the effective time of the merger, Merger Subsidiary will be merged with and into Ruby Tuesday,
with Ruby Tuesday surviving the merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Holding.

At the effective time of the merger, each outstanding share of Ruby Tuesday common stock (other than any shares held by Ruby Tuesday,
Holding, Merger Subsidiary, any other wholly-owned subsidiary of Holding or Ruby Tuesday, or any stockholder who has properly demanded and not
validly withdrawn dissenters’ rights in accordance with Georgia law) will be automatically converted into the right to receive $2.40 in cash, without
interest and less any applicable withholding taxes.

Upon consummation of the merger, your shares of Ruby Tuesday common stock will no longer be outstanding and will automatically be canceled
and cease to exist in exchange for payment of the per share merger consideration described above unless you have properly demanded and not validly
withdrawn dissenters’ rights in accordance with Georgia law. As a result, you will not own any shares of the surviving corporation, and you will no
longer have any interest in its future earnings or growth. As a result of the merger, Ruby Tuesday will cease to be a publicly-traded company and will be
wholly owned by Holding. Following consummation of the merger, the surviving corporation will terminate the registration of our common stock on the
NYSE and we will no longer be subject to reporting obligations under the Exchange Act.

Upon consummation of the merger, each outstanding stock option, service-based restricted stock unit, performance-based restricted stock unit and
share of restricted stock of Ruby Tuesday will vest (and in the case of performance-based restricted stock units, will vest at “target” level), be cancelled
and the holder thereof paid, in each case based on the merger consideration of $2.40 per share. In addition, each outstanding performance-based cash
award of Ruby Tuesday will vest and pay out at its “target” level, prorated for the number of days that have elapsed since the beginning of the year in
which the effective time of the merger occurs (up to and including the date on which the effective time of the merger occurs).

In the event that, from the date of the merger agreement until the effective time of the merger, Ruby Tuesday takes certain actions to change the
number of shares of its common stock outstanding, including by split, combination or reclassification, or pays any dividend on or makes any distribution
of common stock, then any number or amount in the merger agreement, which is based on the price or number of shares of common stock, including the
merger consideration, will be adjusted to reflect such split, combination, dividend or change.

Effects on Ruby Tuesday If the Merger Is Not Completed

If the merger agreement is not adopted by Ruby Tuesday stockholders or if the merger is not completed for any other reason, Ruby Tuesday
stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares in connection with the merger. Instead, Ruby Tuesday will remain an independent public
company. In addition, if the merger is not completed, Ruby Tuesday stockholders will continue to be subject to the same risks and opportunities to
which they are currently subject, including, without limitation, risks related to the highly competitive casual dining industry in which Ruby Tuesday
operates and adverse economic conditions.

Furthermore, if the merger is not completed, and depending on the circumstances that would have caused the merger not to be completed, it is
likely that the price of Ruby Tuesday common stock will decline significantly. If that were to occur, it is uncertain when, if ever, the price of Ruby
Tuesday common stock would return to the price at which it trades as of the date of this proxy statement.

Accordingly, if the merger is not completed, there can be no assurance as to the effect of these risks and opportunities on the future value of your
shares of Ruby Tuesday common stock. If the merger is not completed, the Ruby Tuesday board will continue to evaluate and review Ruby Tuesday’s
business operations, properties, dividend policy, share repurchases and capitalization, among other things, make such changes as are deemed appropriate
and continue to seek to identify strategic alternatives to enhance stockholder value. If the merger agreement is not approved and adopted by Ruby
Tuesday stockholders or if the merger is not completed for any other reason, there can be no assurance that any other transaction acceptable to Ruby
Tuesday will be offered or that Ruby Tuesday’s business, prospects or results of operation will not be adversely impacted.

In addition, the merger agreement provides that, upon termination of the merger agreement under certain circumstances, Ruby Tuesday will be
required to pay to Holding a termination fee of $7.5 million. The merger agreement also provides that, upon termination of the merger agreement under
certain circumstances, Holding will be required to pay to Ruby Tuesday a termination fee of $7.5 million. See the section entitled “The Merger
Agreement—Termination Fee Payable by Ruby Tuesday” and “The Merger Agreement—Termination Fee Payable by Holding” beginning on pages 79
and 79, respectively, of this proxy statement.

Background of the Merger

The Ruby Tuesday board and management regularly review and assess Ruby Tuesday’s operations, performance, prospects and strategic direction,
as well as casual dining industry trends and the economic climate. In connection with these activities, the Ruby Tuesday board considers from time to
time potential strategic alternatives to maximize stockholder value, including potential business combinations, acquisitions, dispositions and sale-
leasebacks of certain real estate assets.

On August 11, 2016, Ruby Tuesday announced that it planned to close approximately 95 of its underperforming restaurants as part of an asset
rationalization plan, which Ruby Tuesday adopted following an extensive, cross-functional review led by Ruby Tuesday’s Chief Development Officer in
consultation with the Ruby Tuesday board and management. Ruby Tuesday also announced initiatives to improve its menu, salad bar offerings and
dining environment.

Also on August 11, 2016, Ruby Tuesday released its fiscal fourth quarter 2016 financial results for the quarter ended May 31, 2016, during which
period total revenue declined by 5.9% and same store sales declined by 3.7% compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year. Ruby Tuesday
reported a net loss of $0.46 per diluted share of Ruby Tuesday.

On September 13, 2016, James J. Buettgen, Ruby Tuesday’s President and Chief Executive Officer at the time, resigned, and the Ruby Tuesday
board appointed Lane Cardwell, Jr., a member of the Ruby Tuesday board, as interim President and Chief Executive Officer until a successor was found.

On September 23, 2016, NRD sent the Ruby Tuesday board an unsolicited letter of intent, which outlined NRD’s interest in a potential acquisition
of Ruby Tuesday at a price of $3.50 per share and requested a 60-day period of exclusive negotiations with Ruby Tuesday. The letter of intent was silent
as to NRD’s financing arrangements and the future role of Ruby Tuesday’s current management. Ruby Tuesday shared NRD’s letter of intent with UBS,
which had previously provided advice to Ruby Tuesday on an informal basis without a fee arrangement, including in connection with the sale of Ruby
Tuesday-owned Lime Fresh Mexican Grill restaurants to Rubio’s Restaurants, Inc. on June 1, 2016. The Ruby Tuesday board, after consultation with
UBS and management, concluded that pursuing the proposal was not in the best interests of Ruby Tuesday and decided to have Ruby Tuesday and its
management focus on implementing management’s plan to improve Ruby Tuesday’s operations and execution, which centered on a series of new
initiatives, including a “Fresh New Menu” and a “Fresh New Garden Bar.”

On October 5, 2016, the Ruby Tuesday board held a regularly scheduled meeting at which UBS discussed with the Ruby Tuesday board the
effects of merger and acquisition interest on the company’s securities, near term opportunities to buy back shares of Ruby Tuesday common stock, Ruby
Tuesday’s defensive profile with respect to potential merger and acquisition activity and the process for determining the value of Ruby Tuesday’s real
estate portfolio as an important step in evaluating Ruby Tuesday’s financing alternatives.

On October 6, 2016, Ruby Tuesday released its fiscal first quarter 2017 financial results for the quarter ended August 30, 2016, during which
period sales declined by 8.2% and same store sales declined by 2.7% compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year. Ruby Tuesday reported a net
loss of $0.66 per diluted share of Ruby Tuesday.

On October 11, 2016, Mr. Cardwell and Aziz Hashim, the Founder and Managing Partner of NRD, met for an introductory lunch meeting with the
understanding that Ruby Tuesday was not interested in pursuing a transaction with NRD.

On November 14, 2016, Engaged Capital LLC (“Engaged Capital”) filed a Schedule 13F with the SEC disclosing that, as of September 30, 2016,
it held approximately 3.3% of the outstanding shares of Ruby Tuesday common stock.

From late November 2016 to late December 2016, Engaged Capital and members of Ruby Tuesday’s management team spoke by email and
telephone to discuss various matters related to Ruby Tuesday, including the estimated value of Ruby Tuesday’s real estate assets.

On November 29, 2016, Ruby Tuesday entered into a waiver relating to its revolving credit agreement dated as of December 3, 2013 among Ruby
Tuesday, as borrower, certain subsidiaries of Ruby Tuesday, as the guarantors, the lenders from time to time party thereto and Bank of America, N.A., as
administrative agent and issuing bank (such credit agreement, the “2013 Credit Agreement”), in response to Ruby Tuesday’s failure in November 2016
to comply with a financial covenant under the credit agreement requiring Ruby Tuesday to maintain a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio.

On December 31, 2016, Ruby Tuesday entered into a waiver relating to its 2013 Credit Agreement in response to Ruby Tuesday’s failure in
November 2016 to comply with a financial covenant under the credit agreement requiring Ruby Tuesday to maintain a consolidated fixed charge
coverage ratio.

On January 4, 2017, UBS discussed with the Ruby Tuesday board its preliminary analysis of Ruby Tuesday’s valuation based on Ruby Tuesday
management’s financial projections dated November 11, 2016. UBS also reviewed with the Ruby Tuesday board methods of assessing the value of Ruby
Tuesday’s owned real estate for financing purposes. UBS further discussed with the Ruby Tuesday board a proposed commercial mortgage-backed
securities (“CMBS”) loan to provide Ruby Tuesday with working capital, along with an indicative timeline and terms for such a loan.

On January 5, 2017, Ruby Tuesday released its fiscal second quarter 2017 financial results for the quarter ended November 29, 2016, during
which period sales declined by 17.7% and same store sales declined by 4.1% compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year. Ruby Tuesday
reported a net loss of $0.63 per diluted share.

On January 11, 2017, NRD sent a follow-up letter to Ruby Tuesday and the Ruby Tuesday board reiterating its offer of $3.50 per share. This letter
was also silent as to NRD’s financing arrangements. In response to this letter, Ruby Tuesday contacted UBS on January 11, 2017 in connection with
exploring strategic alternatives and retained UBS as a financial advisor.

On January 14, 2017, the Ruby Tuesday board held a meeting, with senior management participating. Sue Briley, Chief Financial Officer of Ruby
Tuesday, informed the Ruby Tuesday board that, based on investor calls following the previous earnings release, investors felt that the “Fresh New
Garden Bar” initiative was not sufficient and that an alternative plan was needed. The Ruby Tuesday board then discussed the unsolicited proposal from
NRD and previous conversations with UBS and set a meeting for January 17, 2017 to discuss with UBS and Ruby Tuesday’s counsel, Davis Polk &
Wardwell LLP (“Davis Polk”) exploring strategic alternatives, including NRD’s proposal.

On January 17, 2017, the Ruby Tuesday board held a meeting where UBS led a discussion on NRD and its proposal, as well as potential responses
to NRD, including an announcement by Ruby Tuesday that it was exploring strategic alternatives and the associated illustrative timelines. Following the
discussion with UBS, Davis Polk reviewed with the Ruby Tuesday board the directors’ fiduciary duties and other legal matters relating to the
consideration of potential strategic alternatives.

On January 18, 2017, at the direction of the Ruby Tuesday board, UBS spoke with NRD and conveyed that Ruby Tuesday would allow NRD to
conduct limited due diligence on Ruby Tuesday over a 30-day period, without providing for exclusivity, and with the expectation that NRD would
provide an improved offer containing an enhanced price proposal and financing arrangements sufficient to address Ruby Tuesday’s concerns about the
execution risk in NRD’s proposal. At the request of Ruby Tuesday, NRD provided a letter on January 19, 2017 outlining NRD’s access to equity capital
to fund the proposed transaction. Subsequently, Ruby Tuesday and NRD entered into a confidentiality agreement dated January 25, 2017 with a
customary standstill provision, and Ruby Tuesday provided certain non-public due diligence information to NRD.

Over the course of NRD’s due diligence period, Ruby Tuesday entered into confidentiality agreements with a series of NRD’s prospective
financing sources. Ruby Tuesday also made a limited-scope data room available to NRD and its financing sources. NRD also requested that Ruby
Tuesday enter into a confidentiality agreement with a third-party franchise operator potentially interested in acquiring a number of Ruby Tuesday’s
restaurant locations, but Ruby Tuesday decided that it was premature for NRD to bring in additional parties until NRD submitted an improved offer.

On January 23, 2017, at the request of the Ruby Tuesday board, UBS provided a disclosure letter to Ruby Tuesday describing certain of its
investment banking relationships with Ruby Tuesday and NRD.

On January 31, 2017, Ruby Tuesday entered into the seventh amendment and waiver relating to its 2013 Credit Agreement in response to Ruby
Tuesday’s inability in November 2016 to comply with the financial covenant under the 2013 Credit Agreement requiring Ruby Tuesday to maintain a
consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio.

On February 13, 2017, the Ruby Tuesday board met telephonically with UBS, Davis Polk and management in attendance. UBS discussed with the
Ruby Tuesday board its analysis of Ruby Tuesday’s valuation based on revised financial projections provided by Ruby Tuesday management dated
February 6, 2017, which contained projections that were revised down from the previous financial plan provided on November 11, 2016 to reflect
ongoing softness in store performance despite Ruby Tuesday’s new initiatives. UBS also reviewed various potential strategic alternatives for Ruby
Tuesday, including a sale of Ruby Tuesday to another buyer, a sale of a minority equity interest in Ruby Tuesday to a non-strategic buyer, various
recapitalization transactions (including the issuance of CMBS for refinancing), a sale of the restaurants operated by Ruby Tuesday to new or existing
franchisees, closure of Ruby Tuesday’s underperforming restaurants and a sale of the related real estate, a sale-

leaseback financing transaction and remaining as a standalone public company. At the same meeting, Davis Polk discussed with the Ruby Tuesday
board its fiduciary duties in the context of the strategic alternatives before the Ruby Tuesday board, identifying various factors the Ruby Tuesday board
should consider in evaluating the alternatives. Davis Polk also reviewed with the Ruby Tuesday board certain aspects of NRD’s proposal and outlined
for the Ruby Tuesday board the process and timeline for executing a definitive agreement for a strategic transaction.

On February 27, 2017, NRD sent Ruby Tuesday and the Ruby Tuesday board a letter expressing continued interest in a potential acquisition of
Ruby Tuesday, but at a reduced price range of $2.50 to $3.00 per share. NRD stated that due diligence review was still underway, both for NRD and its
prospective lenders, and therefore a firmer price was not possible at that time. NRD did not provide any written proof of funds or any proposal on
financing arrangements to address Ruby Tuesday’s stated concerns about execution risk.

On March 2, 2017, the Ruby Tuesday board met telephonically, with UBS, Davis Polk and management in attendance. UBS reviewed with the
Ruby Tuesday board NRD’s proposal and recommended that Ruby Tuesday board announce publicly that it is exploring strategic alternatives if NRD
failed to provide a comprehensive offer without any financing contingencies.

On March 3, 2017, at the direction of the Ruby Tuesday board, UBS informed NRD that the Ruby Tuesday board was disappointed with NRD’s
latest proposal and that the Ruby Tuesday board had decided to make a public announcement on March 6, 2017 that it would undertake a review of
strategic alternatives, including a potential sale of Ruby Tuesday.

Also on March 3, 2017, Ruby Tuesday entered into a written engagement letter with UBS with respect to its retention as a financial advisor.

On March 5, 2017, NRD’s financial advisor, Arlington Capital Advisors (“Arlington”) contacted UBS to request that Ruby Tuesday delay its
strategic alternatives press release in order to give NRD additional time to submit a preemptive offer accompanied by evidence of NRD’s financing.

On March 6, 2017, after discussion with Ruby Tuesday, UBS informed NRD that Ruby Tuesday would delay making a strategic alternatives
announcement to allow NRD a further opportunity to submit a preemptive offer. UBS detailed the specific conditions that NRD would need to satisfy in
its response, namely (i) a revised offer by March 9, 2017 containing a preemptive value proposal with a specific per share purchase price, (ii) draft
commitment letters evidencing commitments for all of the capital required to consummate an acquisition of Ruby Tuesday at the proposed purchase
price and (iii) confirmation that NRD has begun its quality of earnings due diligence review with its third-party accountant.

On March 9, 2017, NRD submitted a revised offer of $2.51 per share. In that same letter, NRD also represented that it had obtained signed letters
of intent from institutions totaling $280 million in financing, in addition to equity commitments of $95 million from its affiliated equity funds. NRD
stated that it was not willing to provide written copies of its confidential financing letters to Ruby Tuesday prior to Ruby Tuesday’s commitment to
move forward with the transaction on an exclusive basis with NRD. This offer failed to demonstrate any financing commitments or credible paths to
financing commitments to fund its proposal. NRD did not provide any commitment letters for debt or real estate sale-leaseback arrangements, and did
not provide any proof of funds with respect to its equity financing sources. NRD also did not initially provide any documentation to substantiate its
claims of having third-party financing, and when prompted, NRD produced a highly conditional, non-binding letter of intent from a third-party
financing source that contained an agreement to attempt to negotiate and enter into a sale-leaseback transaction with NRD. The non-binding letter of
intent contemplated that any definitive agreement between the financing source and NRD would provide that a $5,000,000 earnest money deposit be
NRD’s sole remedy for any default by the financing source.

On March 10, 2017, the Ruby Tuesday board held a meeting with UBS, Davis Polk and management in attendance. UBS led a discussion on
NRD’s revised proposal and potential strategic alternatives. The Ruby Tuesday board determined that there was no basis to pursue exclusive
negotiations with NRD given that, aside from the offered price, NRD’s proposal would subject Ruby Tuesday and its stockholders to extraordinary
execution risk. Following conversations with UBS, Davis Polk and management, the Ruby Tuesday board decided to issue a press release on March 13,
2017 announcing that Ruby Tuesday was considering strategic alternatives. UBS also discussed Ruby Tuesday’s valuation based on revised financial
projections provided by Ruby Tuesday management on March 7, 2017, which contained projections that were further revised down from the previous
financial plan provided on February 6, 2017 to reflect ongoing and challenging market conditions in the casual dining industry and the performance of
the “Fresh New Garden Bar” initiative.

Following the March 10, 2017 board meeting, at the direction of the Ruby Tuesday board, UBS informed NRD that its most recent offer was
insufficient, that Ruby Tuesday would announce a strategic review process, and that NRD was welcome to continue its efforts and submit a potentially
preemptive offer.

On March 11, 2017, Mr. Hashim spoke with Stephen Sadove, Ruby Tuesday’s Non-Executive Chairman, to discuss the Ruby Tuesday board’s
decision to reject the offer made by NRD on March 9, 2017 and to discuss certain strategic steps that Ruby Tuesday may take in the future.

On March 13, 2017, Ruby Tuesday issued a press release after market close indicating that it was considering strategic alternatives. Thereafter, at
the direction of the Ruby Tuesday board, UBS engaged in preliminary discussions with a total of 47 parties (including four parties that only entered the
process in May 2017) regarding a potential acquisition of Ruby Tuesday or its real estate assets. These parties included a mix of financial sponsors,
strategic acquirors and family-controlled investment groups. The discussions were of an exploratory nature, during which UBS, at the direction of the
Ruby Tuesday board, informed parties that Ruby Tuesday was willing to consider a range of possible transaction structures, including an acquisition of
all of Ruby Tuesday’s outstanding common stock or a transfer of Ruby Tuesday’s real estate assets in a sale-leaseback transaction or other transaction.
Ruby Tuesday entered into confidentiality agreements with a total of 23 of these parties, including the four parties that only entered the process in May
2017. All of the confidentiality agreements contained a customary standstill provision prohibiting, among other things, the counterparty from acquiring
shares of Ruby Tuesday common stock and waging a proxy contest or other shareholder activism campaign.

On March 19, 2017, at the request of Ruby Tuesday, Davis Polk sent an initial draft of a definitive transaction agreement to NRD’s legal counsel
to enable NRD to prepare a bid for Ruby Tuesday that would preempt the strategic alternatives process.

On March 20, 2017, a representative of an unidentified party, which subsequently became identified as a party referred to here as Bidder 11
contacted UBS to inquire preliminarily about the contemplated sale process. The representative indicated that Bidder 11 would be in touch later if they
had further interest.

On March 23, 2017, NRD sent a letter to Ruby Tuesday and the Ruby Tuesday board reaffirming NRD’s interest in acquiring Ruby Tuesday and
reiterating various points discussed on the March 11, 2017 call between Mr. Hashim and Mr. Sadove. On March 23, 2017, NRD was provided access to
a virtual data room that contained detailed business, financial, regulatory, legal and other information concerning Ruby Tuesday.

Also on March 23, 2017, Leon Capital Partners, LLC (“Leon”) informed UBS that it anticipated filing a Schedule 13D with the SEC disclosing
that it had acquired approximately 9% of the outstanding shares of Ruby Tuesday on the open market since Ruby Tuesday’s March 13, 2017 strategic
alternatives announcement. Leon informed UBS that it was very interested in participating in the sale process and that it was not an activist investor.
Leon entered into a confidentiality agreement with Ruby Tuesday on the same day, which contained a customary standstill provision.

On March 24, 2017, Leon filed a Schedule 13D with the SEC after market close disclosing that it had acquired approximately 9.5% of the
outstanding shares of Ruby Tuesday common stock.

Beginning in late March 2017, at the direction of Ruby Tuesday, UBS sent letters to 19 parties (not including Bidder 11 as they had not contacted
UBS again since the preliminary discussion on March 20, 2017), instructing them to submit first-round, non-binding proposals for a strategic transaction
with Ruby Tuesday by April 13, 2017. The letters stated that all first-round proposals should include an overview of the bidder and specify the bidder’s
proposed consideration, assumptions, intended financing sources, required approvals, due diligence work plan, closing conditions and anticipated
timing.

On April 4, 2017, the Ruby Tuesday board held a meeting with UBS and management in attendance. UBS provided an update and advised the
Ruby Tuesday board that a number of preliminary expressions of interest were expected from both strategic acquirors and financial sponsors.

On April 6, 2017, Ruby Tuesday released its fiscal third quarter 2017 financial results for the quarter ended February 28, 2017, during which
period total revenue declined by 16.8% and same store sales declined by 4.0% compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year. Ruby Tuesday
reported a net loss of $0.33 per diluted share of Ruby Tuesday.

Also on April 6, 2017, Ruby Tuesday named James F. Hyatt, II as President and Chief Executive Officer of Ruby Tuesday and a member of the
Ruby Tuesday board. The Ruby Tuesday board considered the potential effect that Mr. Hyatt’s appointment may have on Ruby Tuesday’s strategic
alternatives review and structured Mr. Hyatt’s employment arrangement to take this into account. In particular, Mr. Hyatt’s restricted stock award would
vest in three annual installments and no further award grants would be made following Ruby Tuesday’s announcement of an agreement to be sold as a
result of the strategic alternatives review. In addition, in the event of termination, subject to certain conditions, Mr. Hyatt would only be entitled to a
cash severance payment equal to his base salary, and he would remain ineligible for Ruby Tuesday’s Executive Severance Plan (with cash severance
equal to two times base salary) until April 4, 2018.

On April 13 and April 14, 2017, Ruby Tuesday received preliminary non-binding indications of interest from nine parties, resulting in a total of
ten preliminary non-binding indications of interest, including NRD’s previously submitted proposal. Five parties (referred to here as Bidders 1 through
5) submitted proposals to acquire the entire company for consideration per share of $2.40 to $2.60 (Bidder 1), $3.05 (Bidder 2), $3.25 to $3.40 (Bidder
3), $5.75 (Bidder 4) and $2.25 to $2.75 (Bidder 5). Three parties submitted proposals to acquire Ruby Tuesday’s restaurant business (including NRD
and a party referred to here as Bidder 6, which also submitted a proposal to acquire the entire company), noting that in order to consummate such an
acquisition, they would expect to partner with a third party interested in entering into a sale-leaseback transaction with respect to Ruby Tuesday’s real
estate assets. NRD offered to purchase Ruby Tuesday at the price of $2.51 per share. Bidder 6 offered to purchase the entire company for an enterprise
value of $400 to $450 million. A party referred to here as Bidder 7 submitted an indication of interest that did not provide a purchase price. Two parties
(referred to here as Bidders 8 and 9) submitted proposals to acquire only Ruby Tuesday’s real estate assets, in the case of Bidder 8 pursuant to a sale-
leaseback transaction for an enterprise value of $315 million; and in the case of Bidder 9 pursuant to a transaction structure to be determined without
providing the purchase price.

On April 17, 2017, the Ruby Tuesday board held a meeting to review and discuss the first-round proposals with members of senior management
and UBS and Davis Polk present. UBS provided an overview of the process that UBS had conducted to identify potentially interested parties and
described the proposals that Ruby Tuesday had received, including NRD’s proposal. After discussion, the Ruby Tuesday board determined to invite
NRD and each of the parties that had submitted first-round proposals other than Bidder 5 (which had submitted a proposal to acquire Ruby Tuesday at a
purchase price of $2.25 to $2.75 per share, considerably lower than the price offered by other bidders) to proceed to a second-round bidding process.
Davis Polk then reviewed with the Ruby Tuesday board the key terms of the draft merger agreement to be provided by Ruby Tuesday to the

participants in the second-round bidding process. At the request of the Ruby Tuesday board, Davis Polk also reviewed with the Ruby Tuesday board the
takeover defenses available under Ruby Tuesday’s organizational documents.

Over the next several days, at the direction of Ruby Tuesday, UBS communicated the Ruby Tuesday board’s decision to NRD and the other parties
that had submitted proposals in the first round. UBS informed each bidder invited to participate in the second round that more detailed instructions
regarding the process would be provided in due course. In the case of Bidder 4, which was an unknown consortium bidder, as instructed by the Ruby
Tuesday board, UBS requested Bidder 4 to provide further detail on the identity of its equity financing sources before it would be permitted to
participate in the second round. No such information was ever provided and Bidder 4 did not progress further in the sales process.

On April 21, 2017, a party referred to here as Bidder 10 submitted a first-round proposal to acquire Ruby Tuesday at $2.00 to 2.50 per share, a
price well below that at which the Ruby Tuesday board had already decided not to allow Bidder 5 to proceed with the second round bid process. UBS,
after consulting with Ruby Tuesday, advised Bidder 10 that its price per share was considerably lower than the other bidders and that Bidder 10 would
not be permitted to participate in the second round.

On April 24, 2017, Bidder 5 submitted a revised first-round proposal to acquire Ruby Tuesday for a price of $2.75 to $3.25 per share. Since
Bidder 5’s revised price became comparable to the price submitted by the other first-round bidders whom the Ruby Tuesday board admitted to the
second round bid process, UBS, after consulting with management of Ruby Tuesday, invited Bidder 5 to participate in the second-round process as well.

In late April 2017, the eight other remaining bidders were provided access to the virtual data room that NRD had already been accessing. The
virtual dataroom contained detailed business, financial, regulatory, legal and other information concerning Ruby Tuesday.

On April 28, 2017, Arlington forwarded to UBS a letter from outside counsel to NRD seeking additional information regarding Ruby Tuesday’s
real estate.

On May 2, 2017, Bidder 2 met with UBS and management of Ruby Tuesday at Ruby Tuesday’s offices in Orlando, Florida. Later the same day,
Bidder 1 met with UBS and management of Ruby Tuesday by video conference.

Also on May 2, 2017, Bidder 3 advised UBS that Bidder 3 had decided not to move forward in the process due to its assessment that the
operational challenges would require more resources than first estimated to improve the financial performance of Ruby Tuesday.

On May 3, 2017, Bidder 8 met with UBS and management of Ruby Tuesday at Ruby Tuesday’s offices in Orlando, Florida.

On May 4, 2017, Bidder 9 contacted UBS to indicate that Bidder 9 had decided not to move forward with a proposal for a strategic transaction and
that it was only interested in acquiring a select portfolio of Ruby Tuesday’s real estate.

On May 5, 2017, following numerous discussions with the Ruby Tuesday board and UBS, management of Ruby Tuesday finalized its five-year
financial plan, which included lower same store sales revenue growth forecasts, higher EBITDA margins due to lower cost of goods sold, payroll and
marketing expenses, and higher maintenance capital expenditure, as compared to the previous financial plan provided on March 7, 2017.

On May 8, 2017, Bidder 5 met with UBS and management of Ruby Tuesday at Ruby Tuesday’s offices in Orlando, Florida. On the same day, at
the request of the Ruby Tuesday board, UBS provided a disclosure letter to Ruby Tuesday indicating certain of its investment banking relationships with
Ruby Tuesday and the first-round bidders.

On May 9, 2017, Bidder 6 met with UBS and management of Ruby Tuesday at Ruby Tuesday’s offices in Orlando, Florida. Later the same day,
Bidder 7 also met with UBS and management of Ruby Tuesday at Ruby Tuesday’s offices in Orlando, Florida.

On May 12, 2017, the Ruby Tuesday board held a meeting with UBS, Davis Polk and management present to review the status of the second-
round process. UBS reviewed with the Ruby Tuesday board the outcome of the management meetings that had been held with the six remaining first-
round bidders (not including NRD) and described certain strengths, weaknesses and areas of focus of the first-round bidders. UBS noted that Bidder 4
had become non-responsive after repeated inquiries by UBS as to the identity of its equity financing sources and had effectively withdrawn from the
process. UBS recommended that the draft merger agreement prepared by Davis Polk be distributed to the first-round bidders during the following week,
along with requests for second-round proposals.

On May 15, 2017, Mr. Hyatt, UBS and representatives of NRD met in New York City to discuss Mr. Hyatt’s initial perspectives and observations
on Ruby Tuesday and the challenges facing Ruby Tuesday.

On May 16, 2017, Bidder 6 advised UBS that Bidder 6 had decided not to move forward with a proposal for a strategic transaction with Ruby
Tuesday due to its assessment that significant investment would be required to improve the financial performance of Ruby Tuesday.

On May 16, 2017, Bidder 11 contacted UBS seeking to participate in the sale process.

Also on May 16, 2017, Ruby Tuesday entered into a confidentiality agreement containing a customary standstill provision with Bidder 11.

On May 18, 2017, at the direction of Ruby Tuesday, UBS sent letters to all parties remaining in the second-round sale process, six in total
(excluding Bidder 11, which received such letter later), describing the requirements established by the Ruby Tuesday board for the second round of the
process. The letters stated that all second-round non-binding proposals should be submitted to Ruby Tuesday by June 12, 2017, be accompanied by a
mark-up of the draft merger agreement and a mark-up of the limited guarantee (if applicable), confirm the completion of the bidder’s due diligence and
specify the bidder’s proposed consideration, proposed financing sources, required approvals and anticipated timing.

On May 19, 2017, the draft merger agreement and related draft documents were made available to all parties remaining in the second round,
(excluding Bidder 11, which received such materials later).

On May 25, 2017, Bidder 2 and Bidder 5 separately met with Mr. Hyatt and UBS to perform on-site visits of Ruby Tuesday’s headquarters in
Maryville, Tennessee and one of the Ruby Tuesday restaurants.

On May 26, 2017, Ruby Tuesday, as borrower, entered into a $20.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility with certain subsidiaries of
Ruby Tuesday, as the guarantors, the lenders from time to time party thereto, and UBS AG, Stamford Branch as administrative agent and as issuing bank
(such credit facility, the “2017 Credit Agreement”) to replace Ruby Tuesday’s existing 2013 Credit Agreement, which was scheduled to mature on
June 2, 2017. The 2017 Credit Agreement has a 364-day term, with a scheduled maturity date of May 25, 2018.

On June 1, 2017, the Ruby Tuesday board received a letter from Engaged Capital, which held approximately 3.3% of the outstanding shares of
Ruby Tuesday common stock at the time. In the letter, Engaged Capital urged the Ruby Tuesday board to conduct a robust review of strategic
alternatives and strongly consider all acquisition offers, which Engaged Capital believed to be the most viable path to realizing the value of Ruby
Tuesday’s assets. In addition, Engaged Capital requested the Ruby Tuesday board to delay the deadline for stockholders to submit director nominations
for the 2017 annual meeting of stockholders until the conclusion of the strategic alternatives review process.

On June 2, 2017, UBS received a preliminary proposal from Bidder 11 to acquire Ruby Tuesday’s domestic assets for $375.5 million on a debt-
free basis, by partnering with an identified third party and additional partners, if any, through a joint venture. The proposal noted that the proposed
transaction would be funded entirely in cash without any debt financing, although no financing commitments were provided.

On June 5, 2017, the Ruby Tuesday board sent a response letter to Engaged Capital stating that the Ruby Tuesday board takes its fiduciary duties
very seriously and was conducting a robust strategic review process with a view towards maximizing stockholder value. The letter also noted that the
date for the 2017 annual meeting of stockholders and the deadline for submission of director nominations and stockholder proposals at the meeting had
not yet been set by the Ruby Tuesday board.

Also on June 5, 2017, at the direction of Ruby Tuesday, UBS contacted a representative of Bidder 11 and encouraged Bidder 11 to accelerate its
diligence and bidding process, given the fact that Bidder 11 had submitted a first-round bid at a very late stage with only slightly more than one week
before the deadline for second-round bids. In addition, UBS requested Bidder 11 to provide more information on its financing commitment.

On June 6, 2017, Bidder 11 was provided access to a virtual data room that contained detailed business, financial, regulatory, legal and other
information concerning Ruby Tuesday and received the draft merger agreement and related draft documents.

Also on June 6, 2017, UBS had a discussion with Bidder 2 during which Bidder 2 conveyed that it was not interested in acquiring the whole
company but would be interested in acquiring Ruby Tuesday’s real estate. At the direction of Ruby Tuesday, UBS offered to partner Bidder 2 with
another potential buyer of Ruby Tuesday to develop a joint bid.

On June 8, 2017, at the direction of Ruby Tuesday, UBS sent a letter to Bidder 11, describing the requirements established by the Ruby Tuesday
board for the second round of the process, which were consistent with the requirements sent to other bidders on May 18, 2017.

Also on June 8, 2017, NRD submitted a revised proposal to the Ruby Tuesday board, including mark-ups of the merger agreement and limited
guarantee. The revised proposal increased the purchase price to $2.77 per share (up from the prior offer of $2.51 per share on March 9, 2017). The
proposal relied on Ruby Tuesday’s existing cash, proceeds of sale-leaseback financing, a senior secured term loan and cash equity for financing, without
specifying the financing sources, although NRD promised to deliver the financing commitments on June 9, 2017. NRD’s proposal included a request for
additional time for NRD and its financing sources to conduct due diligence. NRD also asked Ruby Tuesday to accept the offer by executing an
exclusivity agreement by 5 pm (Eastern Time), June 10, 2017.

On June 10, 2017, Ruby Tuesday and Bidder 11 conducted diligence calls.

Also on June 10, 2017, UBS responded to NRD and delivered Ruby Tuesday’s decision to decline granting exclusivity to NRD, because of,
among other factors, the inadequate purchase price, execution risk given that NRD had failed to provide its financing commitments on June 9, 2017 as
promised, and NRD’s continued request for additional time to conduct due diligence, notwithstanding the fact that Ruby Tuesday’s confidential due
diligence materials had been accessible to NRD and its financing sources since January 2017. During the conversation between UBS and NRD, NRD
repeatedly claimed that its proposal would not be extended past June 10, 2017. Later on that date, approximately ten minutes before the expiration time
of the NRD proposal, NRD provided an unexecuted commitment letter for a $400 million bridge loan facility from a third-party financing source, under
which the financing remained subject to numerous conditions, including further due diligence. On June 11, 2017, NRD reiterated to UBS that its
proposal would not be extended. UBS responded to NRD highlighting that NRD’s financing was highly conditional. After discussion among the
management of Ruby Tuesday, UBS and Davis Polk, Ruby Tuesday determined to not engage with NRD until after the bid deadline on June 12, 2017.

On June 12, 2017, Bidder 7 and Bidder 8 submitted a joint non-binding proposal valuing Ruby Tuesday at an enterprise value of $320 million,
including a mark-up of the merger agreement. The proposal contemplated financing of $315 million from Bidder 8 in connection with the sale-leaseback
of Ruby Tuesday’s real estate, consisting of $208 million in debt financing and $107 million in equity (half to be provided by Bidder 8 and half to be
provided by an affiliate of the owners of a leading restaurant chain subject to “customary conditions”). An additional $35 million would be funded by
Bidder 7 through a senior secured note from institutional financing sources to provide liquidity for Ruby Tuesday at closing. The joint proposal was
subject to further due diligence. The proposal was also accompanied by a non-binding financing letter from a financing source, which expressed interest
in providing or arranging debt financing up to $221 million.

Also on June 12, 2017, Bidder 2 submitted a proposal, including a term sheet outlining the key provisions of its proposal for the merger
agreement. The proposal offered to either purchase Ruby Tuesday as a whole based on a purchase price of $3.05 per share (valuing Ruby Tuesday at an
enterprise value of $375 million), or alternatively to purchase Ruby Tuesday’s 269 owned properties for $317.5 million through a hybrid sale-leaseback
structure. In connection with the acquisition of the whole company, Bidder 2 contemplated a $300 million bridge acquisition loan, but no binding
commitment was provided.

Also on June 12, 2017, Bidder 11 submitted a preliminary proposal which contemplated an aggregate merger consideration of $375 million. The
letter proposal was accompanied by a non-binding indicative letter of intent provided by a financing source for a sale-leaseback transaction in the
amount of $375 million with respect to Ruby Tuesday’s 269 owned properties. The financing source’s letter of intent was subject to due diligence and
approvals of the financing source’s investment committee and board.

On June 14, 2017, the Ruby Tuesday board held a meeting to review and discuss the second-round proposals with members of senior
management, UBS and Davis Polk present. UBS reviewed the timeline with respect to the various strategic alternatives, compared the four proposals
that Ruby Tuesday received, including the NRD proposal which had technically expired, evaluated the valuation of Ruby Tuesday based on multiple
methodologies and analyzed a range of other possible strategic alternatives in addition to a sale of Ruby Tuesday. The Ruby Tuesday board concluded
that none of the bidders had offered a satisfactory preemptive proposal and therefore the Ruby Tuesday board directed UBS to continue engaging with
the interested bidders and utilize the competitive dynamic to obtain a more favorable price and/or more firm financing commitments from the bidders.

Also on June 14, 2017, Bidder 2 delivered a letter from a financing source, which expressed confidence in arranging debt financing in the amount
of $300 million, subject to certain conditions, including satisfactory completion of due diligence.

Also on June 14, 2017, Bidder 11 presented a final offer to acquire the whole company for $2.883 per share with the proposed financing
comprised of $375 million from a financing source through a sale-leaseback transaction and $100 million in additional equity funding from an
unspecified equity partner. The final offer was accompanied by a mark-up of the merger agreement.

Over the next two days, at the direction of Ruby Tuesday, UBS reached out to the four remaining bidders to discuss the weaknesses in their
respective proposals and delivered the Ruby Tuesday board’s message that each bidder will be given a chance to make a proposal with compelling terms
and certainty to convince the Ruby Tuesday board to move forward with a transaction.

On June 16, 2017, NRD communicated to UBS that exclusivity was essential for NRD to proceed with its proposal as NRD claimed that such
exclusivity was required by its financing sources. In addition, NRD asked UBS if there was a price at which Ruby Tuesday would grant exclusivity, to
which, at the direction of Ruby Tuesday, UBS did not respond.

Also on June 16, 2017, UBS briefed the Ruby Tuesday board with management and Davis Polk participating on its communications with the
bidders in the previous two days. The Ruby Tuesday board agreed to reconvene in the coming week and discuss next steps based on the revised
proposals that were expected from the bidders.

Also on June 16, 2017, Bidder 2 delivered a mark-up of the merger agreement and asked Ruby Tuesday to respond and grant exclusivity to Bidder
2 by 5 pm (Eastern Time), June 20, 2017.

On June 19, 2017, the Ruby Tuesday board held a meeting with management, UBS and Davis Polk participating, during which UBS informed the
Ruby Tuesday board on the progress with various bidders.

Also on June 19, 2017, Bidder 11 delivered a revised final offer, which increased the offer price to $3.50 per share from the previously proposed
$2.883 per share but still did not provide any committed financing.

On June 20, 2017, Bidder 2 sent UBS revised mark-ups of the merger agreement and limited guarantee and again requested exclusivity.

On June 21, 2017, Bidder 2 met UBS in UBS’s New York office. Shifting from its earlier position, Bidder 2 stated that it viewed that its role in the
bid process was to generate competition and drive up the purchase price. Bidder 2 stated that Ruby Tuesday could still rely on Bidder 2 as a back-up
bidder, but with an unspecified purchase price substantially lower than $3.05 per share as previously offered.

Also on June 21, 2017, NRD sent an email to the Ruby Tuesday board, which set forth two options: (1) a proposal for NRD to acquire Ruby
Tuesday at $2.55 per share with 15 business days for exclusivity or (2) a proposal for NRD to acquire Ruby Tuesday at $2.85 per share with 30 business
days for exclusivity. NRD further stated that the exclusivity period could not be shortened and was required for its financing sources to complete their
due diligence.

On or around June 22, 2017, Bidder 7 dropped out of the joint proposal with Bidder 8 to acquire Ruby Tuesday after both parties failed to be able
to agree on terms for their investment. Bidder 8 contacted UBS and reiterated its interest in participating in a strategic transaction with Ruby Tuesday
but stated that it would need UBS’s assistance to identify a potential operating partner to replace Bidder 7 and manage the operations of Ruby Tuesday
after the transaction.

Also on June 22, 2017, after separate discussions with Bidder 8 and NRD and with the permission of the Ruby Tuesday board, UBS introduced
Bidder 8 and NRD to each other and encouraged them to jointly develop a proposal to acquire Ruby Tuesday.

On June 23, 2017, the Ruby Tuesday board held a meeting with management, UBS and Davis Polk participating. UBS briefed the Ruby Tuesday
board on the recent developments with the various bidders.

On June 24, 2017, Bidder 2 indicated willingness to purchase Ruby Tuesday at $2.50 per share and requested, in lieu of exclusivity, expense
reimbursement of up to $1 million to further facilitate their efforts in developing a proposal.

On June 26, 2017, NRD and Bidder 8 communicated to UBS that they were unable to reach an agreement to submit a joint proposal to acquire
Ruby Tuesday due to fundamental commercial differences.

On June 27, 2017, an article from an unspecified purported stockholder of Ruby Tuesday was published on Seeking Alpha. The article expressed
impatience with the progress of the Ruby Tuesday board’s review of strategic alternatives, urged the Ruby Tuesday board to consider all the bids
received, asked the Ruby Tuesday board to extend the nominating window for directors until the strategic alternatives review was completed and
threatened a proxy contest if such extension request was not honored by Ruby Tuesday.

On June 29, 2017, NRD submitted a revised proposal to acquire Ruby Tuesday at a price of $2.55 per share. Similar to its proposal on June 8,
2017, the revised proposal continued to request additional time for NRD and its financing sources to complete due diligence. The proposal requested
Ruby Tuesday to execute a no-shop

agreement by July 1, 2017, which agreement would prohibit Ruby Tuesday from further soliciting offers for a strategic transaction until August 4, 2017.
The proposal was also accompanied by mark-ups of the merger agreement and limited guarantee.

On June 30, 2017, the Ruby Tuesday board set December 6, 2017 as the date of the 2017 annual meeting of stockholders and September 7, 2017
as the deadline for submission of stockholder proposals and director nominations to be considered at the meeting. The Ruby Tuesday board also
amended and restated the bylaws of Ruby Tuesday to, among other changes, allow the Ruby Tuesday board to convene an annual meeting of
stockholders at a date and time determined by the Ruby Tuesday board and clarify the Ruby Tuesday board’s right to postpone, cancel or adjourn
stockholder meetings.

Also on June 30, 2017, Bidder 11 delivered a revised draft commitment letter from its sale-leaseback partner, which remained subject to
satisfactory completion of due diligence.

On July 1, 2017, NRD delivered a letter to the Ruby Tuesday board reiterating its commitment to acquire Ruby Tuesday and requested a 30-day
exclusivity period to obtain firm financing commitments from its providers.

On July 3, 2017, a meeting of the Ruby Tuesday board was held with management, UBS and Davis Polk present. UBS briefed the Ruby Tuesday
board on the status of interested bidders and discussed with the Ruby Tuesday board two potential paths: (i) work with Bidder 8 to develop a sale-
leaseback proposal which would not result in a sale of Ruby Tuesday; and/or (ii) grant exclusivity to one of the remaining bidders in the process to allow
that bidder to work on obtaining firm financing commitments. After discussion, the Ruby Tuesday board determined to proceed on both paths in
parallel.

On July 6, 2017, UBS delivered to NRD, Bidder 2 and Bidder 11 letters specifying July 12, 2017 as the submission deadline for final bids and
stating that Ruby Tuesday was willing to engage with the prevailing bidder on an exclusive basis.

On July 11, 2017, Bidder 8 presented to the management of Ruby Tuesday the model and analyses of its proposal involving a sale-leaseback of
properties owned by Ruby Tuesday and renegotiation of certain leases in the context of Ruby Tuesday continuing without a change-of-control
transaction.

On July 12, 2017, Mr. Sadove held a teleconference call with Davis Polk and UBS during which UBS raised the possibility of Bidder 8 exploring
a buyout of Ruby Tuesday with management participation and partnering with Mr. Hyatt in particular (an “MBO”). Following the call, Mr. Hyatt
confirmed to Mr. Sadove that he had no interest in participating in an MBO.

Also on July 12, 2017, Bidder 11 delivered a proposal, reiterating its prior proposal to acquire Ruby Tuesday at $3.50 per share, with $375 million
sale-leaseback financing from a financing source subject to various conditions and $100 million equity financing from an unspecified equity partner.
The proposal included a letter of intent from the financing source, which contemplated a 30-day period for real estate due diligence following the
execution of a binding commitment letter, and a mark-up of the merger agreement. The proposal claimed that the sale-leaseback financing would be
approved by the board of the financing source on July 14, 2017, and the equity financing would be finalized by July 15, 2017. Both sources of financing
ultimately failed to materialize.

Also on July 12, 2017, NRD submitted a proposal to acquire Ruby Tuesday at $2.55 per share. The proposal was accompanied by non-binding
term sheets and letters of intent with numerous conditions from multiple financing sources.

On July 13, 2017, Bidder 2 submitted an offer to acquire 62 fee simple sites owned by Ruby Tuesday for $46.5 million in cash.

On July 14, 2017, the Ruby Tuesday board met by telephone conference with UBS, Davis Polk and management participating. UBS presented the
Ruby Tuesday board with a summary of the proposals received from NRD, Bidder 11 and Bidder 2. The Ruby Tuesday board agreed to reconvene on
July 19, 2017 to make a decision as to whether to proceed with any bidder and, if so, which bidder.

On July 18, 2017, Bidder 11 forwarded to Ruby Tuesday a memorandum from its outside financial advisor, recommending Bidder 11 to revise its
proposal submitted on June 19, 2017, citing Ruby Tuesday’s unsatisfactory stock performance and financial condition.

On July 19, 2017, the Ruby Tuesday board met with members of senior management and UBS and Davis Polk participating. UBS discussed with
the Ruby Tuesday board an overview and status of the final proposals and considerations for Ruby Tuesday’s potential options. Davis Polk then
reviewed with the Ruby Tuesday board in detail the material terms of the draft merger agreements from NRD and Bidder 11. After deliberation, the
Ruby Tuesday board authorized Ruby Tuesday to proceed on two parallel paths: (i) to engage with NRD on an exclusive basis in connection with a
change-of-control transaction and (ii) to continue discussions with Bidder 8 in connection with a potential standalone sale-leaseback transaction.

From mid-July until August 14, 2017, Cheng Cohen LLC, the outside counsel of NRD (“Cheng Cohen”) and Davis Polk engaged in negotiations
regarding the terms of the no-shop agreement, merger agreement and other related documentation.

On July 20, 2017, the Ruby Tuesday board received a letter from Leon urging the Ruby Tuesday board to consider a sale-leaseback of certain real
estate assets as a possible strategic alternative.

On July 24, 2017, Bidder 8 held an in-person meeting with the management of Ruby Tuesday and UBS for a working session to jointly develop
the plan for a sale-leaseback transaction, which involved a store-by-store analysis.

On July 25, 2017, Ruby Tuesday received an updated offer from Bidder 11, which reduced the offer price to $2.88 per share. Once again, Bidder
11 did not specify the status of its financing sources in the letter.

On August 1, 2017, the Ruby Tuesday board received a letter (the “Nomination Letter”) from a holder of 451 shares of Ruby Tuesday common
stock purporting to nominate a director for election to the Ruby Tuesday board at the 2017 annual meeting of stockholders.

On August 8, 2017, Bidder 8 approached UBS and expressed strong interest in a change-of-control MBO transaction with the participation of
Mr. Hyatt instead of a sale-leaseback transaction. At this time, to avoid any potential conflict of interest, the Ruby Tuesday board decided to exclude
Mr. Hyatt from participating in discussions of strategic alternatives not relating to Bidder 8.

On August 10, 2017, Ruby Tuesday received a formal letter from Bidder 8, which described two options for Ruby Tuesday to consider. The first
option was the sale-leaseback transaction under which Ruby Tuesday would remain a standalone public company. The second option was the acquisition
of Ruby Tuesday at a purchase price of $2.45 per share contingent on debt financing and the equity rollover of Mr. Hyatt and other members of Ruby
Tuesday’s senior management with the aggregate management ownership representing approximately 10% of Ruby Tuesday common stock post
closing. The letter stated that, subject to certain conditions, a specified financing source would provide $221 million in debt financing and other
unidentified private equity sponsors may provide an additional $50 million in either debt or equity financing, but no binding financing commitments
were provided. In conjunction with the letter, Bidder 8 also provided a letter from an affiliate of a leading restaurant chain, which committed to provide
backstop financing for either option laid out in the letter in the amount of $315 million. Bidder 8 also requested to schedule an in-person meeting
between Mr. Hyatt and a representative of such restaurant chain during the week of August 13, 2017 to further discuss Bidder 8’s proposals.

On August 11, 2017, the Ruby Tuesday board held a meeting to receive an update regarding Bidder 8 and NRD from UBS and Davis Polk. The
Ruby Tuesday board directed UBS and Davis Polk to continue negotiating with NRD before Ruby Tuesday entered into the no-shop agreement with
NRD. The Ruby Tuesday board also directed UBS to communicate to Bidder 8 that its proposal was disappointing on both price and terms.

On August 12, 2017, NRD requested that Ruby Tuesday and NRD execute the no-shop agreement by the end of August 13, 2017, otherwise NRD
would be prepared to terminate discussions with Ruby Tuesday.

On August 13, 2017, the Ruby Tuesday board held a meeting and, after discussion, authorized the entry into a no-shop agreement with NRD, in
light of (i) the possibility of NRD terminating discussions with Ruby Tuesday, (ii) the uncertainty over whether Bidder 8 would improve its proposal,
(iii) the failure of Bidder 11 to present a credible and fully-financed proposal despite ample time and opportunity, and (iv) the absence of other
actionable opportunities for the sale of Ruby Tuesday.

On August 14, 2017, at the direction of the Ruby Tuesday board, UBS informed Bidder 8 and Bidder 11 that Ruby Tuesday was entering into
exclusive discussions with another bidder and that it was terminating discussions with Bidder 8 and Bidder 11 in connection with a change-of-control
transaction. At the same time, Ruby Tuesday agreed to waive Bidder 8’s and Bidder 11’s obligations under the standstill provision of their respective
confidentiality agreements to the extent necessary to permit each such party to continue to submit unsolicited confidential proposals to Ruby Tuesday.

Also on August 14, 2017, Ruby Tuesday entered into the No-Shop Agreement with NRD (the “No-Shop Agreement”), which prohibited Ruby
Tuesday from soliciting, discussing or negotiating, or entering into an agreement relating to, an alternative change-of-control acquisition proposal
relating to Ruby Tuesday’s assets or common stock with a third party for 30 days until September 13, 2017 (extendable to 45 days under certain
circumstances). Under the No-Shop Agreement, NRD may be entitled to the reimbursement of its expenses incurred during the period of the No-Shop
Agreement under certain circumstances, up to an aggregate amount of $3 million but reduced to $1 million if the period of the No-Shop Agreement is
extended to 45 days. During the course of the discussions regarding the No-Shop Agreement, NRD and Ruby Tuesday also discussed NRD’s plans to
have its real estate financing providers complete their work during the exclusivity period, and NRD assured UBS that NRD would not lower its offer
price below $2.55 in the future.

On August 15, 2017, Mr. Hyatt, a representative of the leading restaurant chain and UBS met to discuss a potential standalone sale-leaseback
transaction between Bidder 8 and Ruby Tuesday.

On August 18, 2017, the Ruby Tuesday board held a meeting with management and Ruby Tuesday’s activism counsel, Vinson & Elkins LLP
(“V&E”), present. V&E discussed considerations related to stockholder activism, the annual report and the related earnings release with the Ruby
Tuesday board. The Ruby Tuesday board approved the deferral of the 2017 annual meeting of stockholders to January 22, 2018 and set October 23,
2017 as the deadline for stockholders to submit director nominations and stockholder proposals for stockholder vote at the 2017 annual meeting of
stockholders to allow the Ruby Tuesday board time to continue with the strategic alternatives process.

On August 21, 2017, Ruby Tuesday released its fiscal fourth quarter 2017 financial results for the quarter ended May 31, 2017, during which
period total revenue declined by 8.8% and same store sales declined by 1.6% compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year. Ruby Tuesday
reported a net loss of $0.14 per diluted share of Ruby Tuesday.

Also on August 21, 2017, Ruby Tuesday delivered a response to the Nomination Letter explaining that the Nomination Letter did not meet the
requirements for a director nomination by a stockholder under Ruby Tuesday’s articles of incorporation and bylaws, and was therefore not valid and
could not be submitted to Ruby Tuesday stockholders at the 2017 annual meeting of stockholders.

Also on August 21, 2017, Ruby Tuesday announced publicly that “the strategic alternatives review process is ongoing and entering its final
phase.” In connection with this announcement, the Ruby Tuesday board announced the postponement of the 2017 annual meeting of stockholders to
January 22, 2018 and the postponement of the deadline for submission of stockholder proposals and director nominations to be considered at the 2017
annual meeting of stockholders to October 23, 2017.

Beginning in early September 2017, NRD informed Ruby Tuesday that the ongoing due diligence had identified numerous issues with respect to
Ruby Tuesday’s real estate portfolio, some of which were of a material

nature. NRD also asked questions regarding the status of restaurants affected by Hurricane Irma, and indicated that delays associated with review and
resolution of such real estate matters may necessitate an extension of the no-shop period.

On September 13, 2017, the 30-day no-shop period and expense reimbursement obligation under the No-Shop Agreement expired. NRD did not
deliver the requisite financing as contemplated by the No-Shop Agreement. Instead, NRD circulated a memorandum describing the status of financing,
including a potential term loan from a potential senior credit facility and real estate purchase and sale agreements (“PSA”) with four sale-leaseback
providers, none of which were finalized and all of which were subject to further approval as well as resolution of certain material diligence items
identified in connection with Ruby Tuesday’s real estate. NRD also verbally requested a two-week exclusivity extension, due to the impact of Hurricane
Irma on certain of NRD’s sale-leaseback providers, for their continuing review of diligence items and to ascertain the scope of hurricane-related
damage, which Ruby Tuesday declined.

Over the course of the next few weeks, NRD communicated hundreds of diligence items from their financing sources to Ruby Tuesday. Ruby
Tuesday engaged closely and diligently with Baker, Donelson, Bearman, Caldwell & Berkowitz (“Baker Donelson”), Ruby Tuesday’s real estate
counsel, Fidelity National Title (“Fidelity”) and Bock & Clark, which provided title commitments and surveys for the real estate, respectively, and
resolved a significant portion of the diligence items.

On September 18, 2017, Davis Polk at the request of Ruby Tuesday sent NRD a draft amendment to the No-Shop Agreement proposing to extend
the no-shop period for two additional weeks, conditioned upon NRD’s acceptance of certain revisions in the disclosure schedules to reflect recent
developments, including the impact of and relating to Hurricane Irma, among others. The foregoing amendment was never executed.

On September 26, 2017, Ruby Tuesday informed NRD that it would discontinue discussions with NRD beyond October 12, 2017 without a fully-
financed executable merger agreement. Ruby Tuesday expressed its willingness to resolve some diligence items but noted that the remaining diligence
items were NRD’s responsibility to resolve with its financing sources.

On September 27, 2017, the Ruby Tuesday board held a meeting with management, UBS and Davis Polk participating. The Ruby Tuesday board
was briefed by UBS and Davis Polk on recent developments including the efforts to address the numerous diligence items raised by NRD and its
financing sources as well as the October 12, 2017 deadline communicated to NRD which the Ruby Tuesday board endorsed.

On September 29, 2017, Ruby Tuesday, Baker Donelson, NRD and Fidelity held a teleconference call and discussed and agreed upon an approach
to manage and resolve outstanding diligence items identified by NRD and its financing sources.

On October 9, 2017, Ruby Tuesday received an updated offer from Bidder 11, with an offer price of $2.88 per share. Once again, Bidder 11 did
not provide any committed financing in the letter.

On October 10, 2017, the Ruby Tuesday board held a meeting with management, UBS and Davis Polk participating. UBS reviewed with the Ruby
Tuesday board the status of the proposed transaction with NRD, including the diligence items identified by NRD and its financing sources, as well as
alternative paths for Ruby Tuesday, if negotiations with NRD ended.

On October 11, 2017, the Ruby Tuesday board held a meeting, with V&E participating, to discuss Ruby Tuesday’s next steps in the event that the
strategic alternatives process did not result in a transaction.

Also on October 11, 2017, NRD contacted UBS to indicate that NRD’s financing providers had identified, as a result of their due diligence
findings, certain deficiencies with respect to certain properties that in the aggregate reflected approximately $60 million of Ruby Tuesday’s real estate
portfolio, and that NRD would like

to reach an agreement with Ruby Tuesday at $2.40 per share (reduced from NRD’s previous offer of $2.55 per share, which reduction NRD asserted was
reflective of a portion of such deficiencies) in exchange for submitting an offer with no conditions on October 12, 2017. At the direction of Ruby
Tuesday, UBS requested NRD to submit the proposal.

On October 12, 2017, Ruby Tuesday received executed PSAs from NRD executed by four sale-leaseback providers, with an aggregate financing
of $178 million containing numerous conditions to closing (the “Sale-leaseback PSAs”).

Also on October 12, 2017, NRD contacted UBS to indicate that NRD’s financing sources had requested NRD to contribute additional equity
financing to the transaction and that NRD could either delay submitting the proposal or lower its offer price below $2.40 per share. At the direction of
Ruby Tuesday, UBS indicated that Ruby Tuesday was unlikely to be accepting of a proposal below $2.40 per share.

On October 13, 2017, Ruby Tuesday received an unexecuted commitment letter from Goldman Sachs Specialty Lending Group, L.P. and TCW
Direct Lending Group for up to $156 million under senior secured credit facilities (the “Senior Debt Commitment,” together with the Sale-Leaseback
PSAs, the “Financing Commitments”).

Also on October 13, 2017, NRD presented to Ruby Tuesday a full package of its final proposal, including NRD’s executed copy of the merger
agreement (reflecting NRD’s agreement to accept Ruby Tuesday’s revised disclosure schedules to the merger agreement, including the impact of and
relating to Hurricane Irma) and limited guarantee, an executed equity commitment letter from NRD Partners II, L.P., and executed Sale-leaseback PSAs
from the sale-leaseback providers, and the Senior Debt Commitment accompanied by a letter from counsel to the senior lenders stating that such counsel
was holding all of the signature pages to the Senior Debt Commitment in escrow. This proposal provided for merger consideration of $2.40 per share of
common stock of Ruby Tuesday.

Also on October 13, 2017, the Ruby Tuesday board held a meeting with management, UBS, Davis Polk, Baker Donelson and V&E participating.
At the meeting, the Ruby Tuesday board directed UBS, Davis Polk and Baker Donelson to contact NRD and insist that its financing sources waive or
remove the numerous closing conditions in the Financing Commitments in order to provide greater closing certainty, consistent with NRD’s
communications to UBS on October 11, 2017. The Ruby Tuesday board also directed UBS to request that NRD agree to an increase to its termination
fee of $7.5 million to $10 million to compensate for the execution risks associated with those funding conditions.

Also on October 13, 2017, at the request of the Ruby Tuesday board, UBS provided a disclosure letter to Ruby Tuesday indicating certain of its
investment banking relationships with Ruby Tuesday and NRD.

From October 13 to October 14, 2017, Ruby Tuesday received a revised draft of the Senior Debt Commitment, which provided some concessions,
primarily with respect to the conditions to closing, and confirmation from all of the four sale-leaseback providers that, except for specified properties,
the remaining diligence items relating to Ruby Tuesday’s real properties were waived by the respective financing providers and would not constitute a
funding condition. NRD requested various amendments to the previously delivered executed merger agreement. Such amendments sought substantially
greater access to and control over Ruby Tuesday through the interim operating covenants in the merger agreement. Ruby Tuesday rejected such
amendments. NRD declined Ruby Tuesday’s request to increase its termination fee without a corresponding decrease in the per share merger
consideration to $2.35.

On October 15, 2017, the Ruby Tuesday board held a meeting, which was also attended by members of Ruby Tuesday’s senior management and,
by invitation of the Ruby Tuesday board, representatives from UBS, Davis Polk, Baker Donelson, Alston & Bird LLP (“Alston & Bird”), Ruby
Tuesday’s Georgia counsel and V&E. Prior to the meeting, the directors had received copies of NRD’s proposal package (including confirmation of
waivers from the four sale-leaseback providers and the revised Senior Debt Commitment), a summary of the merger agreement and the Financing
Commitments prepared by Davis Polk, as well as fairness opinion materials

prepared by UBS. Davis Polk reviewed with the directors the summary of the Financing Commitments and the terms of the merger agreement. Baker
Donelson reviewed with the directors the outstanding diligence items, including those deemed to be waived by financing sources as related to the
financing. UBS reviewed with the Ruby Tuesday board the strategic alternatives review process and its financial analysis of the potential merger with
NRD. UBS then orally delivered its opinion to the Ruby Tuesday board, which was subsequently confirmed in writing, that as of that date and subject to
various assumptions made, matters considered and qualifications and limitations described in the opinion, the $2.40 per share merger consideration to be
received by the holders of Ruby Tuesday common stock, other than Holding, Merger Subsidiary and their affiliates, was fair, from a financial point of
view, to such holders.

Alston & Bird reviewed with the directors the fiduciary duties applicable to the Ruby Tuesday board’s consideration of the merger agreement and
the merger under Georgia law. The Ruby Tuesday board discussed the conditions to funding under the Financing Commitments and NRD’s $7.5 million
termination fee, which provisions the Ruby Tuesday board considered acceptable.

Following further discussion, the Ruby Tuesday board unanimously approved the merger agreement and the merger.

On October 16, 2017, Ruby Tuesday, Holding and Merger Subsidiary entered into the merger agreement, and NRD Partners II, L.P., a fund
managed by NRD which is party to the equity commitment letter, entered into the limited guarantee with Ruby Tuesday.

Ruby Tuesday issued a press release announcing the transaction before the market opened on October 16, 2017.

Also on October 16, 2017, Ruby Tuesday released its fiscal first quarter 2018 financial results for the quarter ended September 5, 2017, during
which period total revenue declined by 15.3% and same store sales declined by 5.8% compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year. Ruby Tuesday
reported a net loss of $0.16 per diluted share of Ruby Tuesday.

On October 18, 2017, Leon filed a Schedule 13D/A with the SEC disclosing that its shareholding in Ruby Tuesday common stock had been
reduced to 2.7% as of October 18, 2017, after the sale of a substantial amount of stock following the public announcement of the transaction.

Ruby Tuesday’s Reasons for the Merger

At a meeting duly called and held on October 15, 2017, the Ruby Tuesday board determined that the merger and the other transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement are fair to, and in the best interests of, Ruby Tuesday and its stockholders and approved and declared advisable
the merger agreement and the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, in each case by the unanimous vote of the
directors. The Ruby Tuesday board also resolved that the merger agreement be submitted for consideration by the stockholders of Ruby Tuesday at a
special meeting of stockholders and to recommend that the stockholders of Ruby Tuesday vote to adopt the merger agreement. The Ruby Tuesday board
consulted with Ruby Tuesday’s outside financial and legal advisors and senior management at various times and considered a number of factors,
including the following principal factors (not in any relative order of importance) that the Ruby Tuesday board believes support its decision:
 

 
•  Ruby Tuesday’s business, financial performance and condition and future prospects in relation to the merger consideration of $2.40 per

share,
 

 
•  the Ruby Tuesday board’s belief that the merger was more favorable to Ruby Tuesday’s stockholders than the alternative of remaining a

standalone independent company, which belief was based on and informed by consideration of a number of factors, risks and uncertainties,
including:

 

 •  general industry, economic and market conditions, both on a historical and on a prospective basis,

Table of Contents

 

•  the risks and uncertainties associated with maintaining Ruby Tuesday’s performance as a standalone company, including, among
other risks and uncertainties, generally unfavorable economic trends impacting Ruby Tuesday’s business (which trends include,
among others, declining sales in the casual dining industry and intense competition in the restaurant and food service industry
generally with respect to prices, services, convenience, locations, employees, advertising, promotion and types and quality of food)
and the other risks and uncertainties described in Ruby Tuesday’s SEC filings,

 

 
•  the uncertain returns to Ruby Tuesday’s stockholders if Ruby Tuesday were to remain independent, taking into account, in particular,

management’s financial projections of the future financial performance and earnings of Ruby Tuesday and the risks involved in
achieving those returns, particularly in view of Ruby Tuesday’s weak financial performance in recent years,

 

 
•  Ruby Tuesday’s failure, for several years following the launch of various brand transformation initiatives, to define and deliver a

clear, relevant brand that generates sustainable same-restaurant traffic growth and produces sales and earnings growth opportunities,
and

 

 
•  Ruby Tuesday’s persistently weak financial performance notwithstanding numerous initiatives to enhance Ruby Tuesday’s

profitability, including the remodeling of its restaurants, the implementation of various menu changes and attempts to improve its
salad bar offerings,

 

 

•  the Ruby Tuesday board’s belief that, although Ruby Tuesday could, similar to Holding’s financing plan for its acquisition, seek to unlock
value from Ruby Tuesday’s real estate holdings (e.g., through a sale and leaseback or financing transaction), the remaining operational,
industry and other risks and challenges to Ruby Tuesday’s business described above create substantial execution risks relative to the $2.40
per share price in the merger,

 

 

•  the Ruby Tuesday board’s belief that, as a privately held entity, Ruby Tuesday’s management may have greater flexibility to focus on
improving Ruby Tuesday’s long-term financial performance without the pressures created by the public equity market’s emphasis on short-
term period-to-period financial performance, and the fact that as an SEC-reporting company, Ruby Tuesday’s management and accounting
staff, which comprises a relatively small number of individuals, must devote significant time to SEC reporting and compliance,

 

 

•  the fact that, over the approximately seven months leading up to the execution of the merger agreement, the Ruby Tuesday board thoroughly
explored and evaluated various strategic alternatives, including a sale of the whole company, a sale of a minority equity interest in Ruby
Tuesday to a non-strategic buyer, various recapitalization transactions (including the issuance of commercial mortgage-backed securities), a
sale of the restaurants operated by Ruby Tuesday to new or existing franchisees, closure of Ruby Tuesday’s underperforming restaurants
followed by a sale of the related real estate, a sale-leaseback financing transaction and remaining as a standalone public company, none of
which alternatives was more favorable to Ruby Tuesday’s stockholders than the merger,

 

 

•  the fact that Ruby Tuesday’s exploration of strategic alternatives involved a lengthy and thorough auction process involving both strategic
and financial potential acquirors, 23 of which entered into confidentiality agreements with Ruby Tuesday and received information related
to Ruby Tuesday, 12 of which submitted first-round non-binding proposals to acquire Ruby Tuesday and four of which submitted second-
round proposals to acquire Ruby Tuesday, with Ruby Tuesday actively soliciting proposals for alternative transactions throughout the
process, none of which resulted in a credible, financed alternative transaction other than the merger,

 

 

•  the current and historical market prices of Ruby Tuesday common stock, including the market performance of Ruby Tuesday common stock
relative to other participants in Ruby Tuesday’s industry and general market indices, and the fact that the merger consideration of $2.40 per
share in cash represented an attractive premium of approximately 38% to Ruby Tuesday’s closing stock price on March 13, 2017, the date
on which the Ruby Tuesday board announced exploration of strategic

alternatives, and a premium of approximately 21% to Ruby Tuesday’s closing stock price on October 13, 2017, the last trading day before
the announcement of the merger,

 

 •  current industry, economic and market conditions and trends in the markets in which Ruby Tuesday competes,
 

 

•  the opinion of UBS presented orally to the Ruby Tuesday board on October 15, 2017 and subsequently confirmed in writing, to the effect
that, as of the date of such opinion and based on and subject to the various factors, assumptions, qualifications and limitations described
therein, the merger consideration of $2.40 per share to be received by holders of Ruby Tuesday common stock pursuant to the merger
agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders,

 

 
•  the fact that the merger consideration is all cash, so that the transaction will allow Ruby Tuesday’s stockholders to realize a fair value, in

cash, for their investment and provides such stockholders certainty of value for their shares, and
 

 •  the material terms and conditions of the merger agreement, including:
 

 
•  the conditions to the consummation of the merger, including the requirement that the merger agreement be adopted by Ruby

Tuesday’s stockholders,
 

 
•  the Ruby Tuesday board’s “fiduciary out” with respect to third-party acquisition proposals likely to result in superior proposals, the

Ruby Tuesday board’s ability to negotiate with another party regarding a superior proposal and, subject to paying a termination fee
to Holding in the amount of $7.5 million, accept a superior proposal,

 

 
•  the Ruby Tuesday board’s belief that, if triggered, the termination fee payable by Ruby Tuesday to Holding is consistent with fees

payable in comparable transactions and would not be likely to preclude another party from making a competing proposal if that party
was otherwise compelled to make a superior proposal,

 

 
•  the fact that Holding and Merger Subsidiary had already obtained committed debt and equity financing for the transaction, the

limited number and nature of the conditions to the debt and equity financing and the obligation of Holding and Merger Subsidiary to
use reasonable best efforts to obtain the debt financing,

 

 
•  the requirement that, in the event of a failure of the merger to be consummated under certain circumstances, Holding must pay Ruby

Tuesday a termination fee of $7.5 million,
 

 
•  the fact that the Fund agreed to guarantee Holding’s obligation to pay its termination fee to Ruby Tuesday and certain other specified

payments to Ruby Tuesday, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Limited Guarantee, and
 

 •  the scope of the representations, warranties and covenants being made by Ruby Tuesday, Holding and Merger Subsidiary.

The Ruby Tuesday board also considered various potentially countervailing factors in its deliberations related to the merger, including the
following:
 

 
•  the fact that the holders of common stock will not have an opportunity to participate in any future earnings or growth of the combined

company following the merger,
 

 

•  the possibility that the merger might not be completed as a result of, among other reasons, the failure of Ruby Tuesday’s stockholders to
adopt the merger agreement, and the effect the termination of the transaction may have on the trading price of Ruby Tuesday common stock,
its business, operating results and prospects, which effect is likely to be exacerbated the longer the time period between the signing and any
termination of the merger agreement,

 

 
•  that the restrictions imposed by the merger agreement on the conduct of Ruby Tuesday’s business prior to completion of the merger,

requiring Ruby Tuesday to conduct its business only in the ordinary

course and imposing additional specific restrictions, may delay, limit or prevent Ruby Tuesday from undertaking business opportunities that
may arise during that period, which effect is likely to be exacerbated the longer the time period between the signing and any termination of
the merger agreement,

 

 
•  the risk that the equity or debt financing contemplated by the Financing Commitments will not be obtained, resulting in Holding not having

sufficient funds to complete the transaction,
 

 
•  the possible effects of the pendency (or termination) of the merger agreement on Ruby Tuesday’s business, operating results, prospects,

employees, customers, distributors and suppliers, which effects are likely to be exacerbated the longer the time period between the signing
and any termination of the merger agreement,

 

 

•  that Ruby Tuesday cannot solicit other acquisition proposals, and must pay Holding a termination fee in the amount of $7.5 million if the
merger agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, including if the Ruby Tuesday board changes its recommendation to Ruby
Tuesday’s stockholders to adopt the merger agreement or exercises its right to enter into a transaction that constitutes a superior proposal,
which may deter others from proposing an alternative transaction that may be more advantageous to Ruby Tuesday’s stockholders,

 

 
•  the fact that the receipt of cash in exchange for shares of common stock pursuant to the merger will generally be a taxable transaction for

U.S. federal income tax purposes,
 

 
•  the fact that Ruby Tuesday is subject to various remedies available to Holding should it fail to complete the merger or breach the merger

agreement, and
 

 

•  that if Holding fails to complete the merger as a result of a breach of the merger agreement, depending upon the reason for not closing,
remedies may be limited to a termination fee payable by Holding to Ruby Tuesday, which may be inadequate to compensate Ruby Tuesday
for the damage caused, and if available, other rights and remedies may be expensive and difficult to enforce through litigation, and the
success of any such action may be uncertain.

The foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by the Ruby Tuesday board is not intended to be exhaustive, but includes the
material factors considered by the Ruby Tuesday board. The Ruby Tuesday board did not undertake to make any specific determination as to whether
any factor, or any particular aspect of any factor, supported or did not support its ultimate determination. The Ruby Tuesday board based its
recommendation on the totality of the information it considered.

In considering the recommendation of the Ruby Tuesday board with respect to the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, you should be aware
that our directors and executive officers have interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, yours. The Ruby Tuesday board was aware
of and considered these interests, among other matters, in evaluating and negotiating the merger agreement and the merger, and in recommending that
the merger agreement be adopted by the stockholders of Ruby Tuesday. See the section entitled “The Merger (Proposal 1)—Interests of Ruby Tuesday’s
Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger.”

Recommendation of the Ruby Tuesday Board of Directors

After careful consideration, the Ruby Tuesday board unanimously approved the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement.

The Ruby Tuesday board unanimously recommends that the Ruby Tuesday stockholders vote “FOR” the proposal to approve and adopt
the merger agreement.

Opinion of Ruby Tuesday’s Financial Advisor

As part of that engagement, the Ruby Tuesday board requested that UBS render an opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the
holders of Ruby Tuesday common stock (other than Holding,

Merger Subsidiary and their affiliates) of the $2.40 per share merger consideration to be received by such holders in the merger. On October 15, 2017, at
a meeting of the Ruby Tuesday board held to evaluate the merger and the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, UBS delivered
to the Ruby Tuesday board an oral opinion, which opinion was subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion, dated October 16, 2017, to the
effect that, as of that date and based on and subject to various assumptions made, matters considered, and qualifications and limitations described in its
written opinion, the $2.40 per share merger consideration to be received by the holders of Ruby Tuesday common stock (other than Holding, Merger
Subsidiary and their affiliates) in the merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.

The full text of UBS’s opinion to the Ruby Tuesday board describes the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered, and
qualifications and limitations on the review undertaken by UBS. The opinion is attached to this proxy statement as Annex B and is incorporated into this
proxy statement by reference. Holders of Ruby Tuesday common stock are encouraged to read UBS’s opinion carefully in its entirety. UBS’s
opinion was provided for the benefit of the Ruby Tuesday board (in its capacity as such) in connection with, and for the purpose of, its
evaluation of the merger consideration to be received by the holders of Ruby Tuesday common stock (other than Holding, Merger Subsidiary
and their affiliates) in the merger from a financial point of view, and does not address any other aspect of the $2.40 per share merger or any
related transaction. UBS’s opinion does not address the relative merits of the merger or any related transaction as compared to other business
strategies or transactions that might be available with respect to Ruby Tuesday or Ruby Tuesday’s underlying business decision to effect the
merger or any related transaction. UBS’s opinion does not constitute a recommendation to any stockholder of Ruby Tuesday as to how such
stockholder should vote or act with respect to the merger or any related transaction. The following summary of UBS’s opinion is qualified in its
entirety by reference to the full text of UBS’s opinion.

In arriving at its opinion, UBS, among other things:
 

 •  reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information relating to Ruby Tuesday;
 

 
•  reviewed certain internal financial information and other data relating to the business and financial prospects of Ruby Tuesday that were not

publicly available, including financial forecasts and estimates prepared by the management of Ruby Tuesday that the Ruby Tuesday board
directed UBS to utilize for purposes of its analyses;

 

 
•  conducted discussions with members of the senior management of Ruby Tuesday concerning the business and financial prospects of Ruby

Tuesday;
 

 
•  performed a discounted cash flow analysis of Ruby Tuesday in which UBS analyzed the future cash flows of Ruby Tuesday using financial

forecasts and estimates prepared by the management of Ruby Tuesday;
 

 •  reviewed publicly available financial and stock market data with respect to certain other companies UBS believed to be generally relevant;
 

 
•  compared the financial terms of the merger with the publicly available financial terms of certain other transactions UBS believed to be

generally relevant;
 

 •  reviewed current and historical market prices of Ruby Tuesday common stock;
 

 •  reviewed the merger agreement; and
 

 
•  conducted such other financial studies, analyses and investigations, and considered such other information, as UBS deemed necessary or

appropriate.

In connection with its review, with the consent of the Ruby Tuesday board, UBS assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the
accuracy and completeness in all material respects of the information provided to or reviewed by UBS for the purpose of the opinion. In addition, with
the consent of the Ruby

Tuesday board, UBS did not make any independent evaluation or appraisal of any of the assets or liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of Ruby Tuesday,
nor was UBS furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal. With respect to the financial forecasts and estimates referred to above, UBS assumed, at
the direction of the Ruby Tuesday board, that they were reasonably prepared on a basis reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of
the management of Ruby Tuesday as to the future financial performance of Ruby Tuesday. In addition, UBS assumed, with the approval of the Ruby
Tuesday board, that the financial forecasts and estimates referred to above will be achieved at the times and in the amounts projected. The opinion of
UBS was necessarily based on economic, monetary, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information available to UBS as of, the date of
its opinion.

At the direction of the Ruby Tuesday board, UBS was not asked to, nor did it, offer any opinion as to the terms, other than the merger
consideration to the extent expressly specified in the opinion, of the merger agreement or any related documents or the form of the merger or any related
transaction. UBS expressed no opinion as to (i) the fairness of the amount or nature of any compensation to be received by any officers, directors or
employees of any parties to the merger, or any class of such persons, relative to the merger consideration, or (ii) the price at which Ruby Tuesday
common stock will trade at any time. In rendering its opinion, UBS assumed, with the consent of the Ruby Tuesday board, that (a) the parties to the
merger agreement will comply with all material terms of the merger agreement, and (b) the merger will be consummated in accordance with the terms of
the merger agreement without any adverse waiver or amendment of any material term or condition thereof. UBS also assumed that all governmental,
regulatory or other consents and approvals necessary for the consummation of the merger will be obtained without any material adverse effect on Ruby
Tuesday, Holding or the merger.

In connection with rendering its opinion to the Ruby Tuesday board, UBS performed a variety of financial and comparative analyses, which are
summarized below. The following summary is not a complete description of all analyses performed and factors considered by UBS in connection with
its opinion. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process involving subjective judgments and is not necessarily susceptible to partial
analysis or summary description. With respect to the selected public company analysis and the selected transactions analysis summarized below, no
company or transaction used as a comparison was identical to Ruby Tuesday, or the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. These analyses
necessarily involve complex considerations and judgments concerning financial and operating characteristics and other factors that could affect the
public trading or acquisition values of the companies concerned.

UBS believes its analyses and the summary contained in this proxy statement must be considered as a whole and that selecting portions of its
analyses and factors or focusing on information presented in tabular format, without considering all analyses and factors or the narrative description of
the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the processes underlying UBS’s analyses and opinion. UBS did not draw, in isolation,
conclusions from or with regard to any one factor or method of analysis for purposes of its opinion, but rather arrived at its ultimate opinion based on the
results of all analyses undertaken by it and assessed as a whole.

The estimates of the future performance of Ruby Tuesday underlying the analyses of UBS are not necessarily indicative of actual future results or
values, which may be significantly more or less favorable than those estimates. These estimates are necessarily subject to uncertainty because, among
other things, they are based upon numerous factors and events beyond the control of Ruby Tuesday or its advisors. In performing its analyses, UBS
considered industry performance, general business and economic conditions and other matters, many of which were beyond the control of Ruby
Tuesday. Estimates of the financial value of companies do not purport to be appraisals or necessarily reflect the prices at which businesses or securities
actually may be sold or acquired.

The merger consideration to be received by the holders of Ruby Tuesday common stock was determined through negotiations between Holding
and Ruby Tuesday and the decision by Ruby Tuesday to enter into the merger agreement to effect the transaction was solely that of the Ruby Tuesday
board. UBS’s opinion and

financial analyses were only one of many factors considered by the Ruby Tuesday board in its evaluation of the merger and should not be viewed as
determinative of the views of the Ruby Tuesday board or the management of Ruby Tuesday with respect to the merger or the merger consideration.
While UBS provided advice to the Ruby Tuesday board in connection with the proposed merger, the Ruby Tuesday board determined the consideration
and UBS did not recommend any specific amount or type of consideration.

Summary of the Financial Analyses of UBS

The following is a summary of the material financial analyses performed by UBS and reviewed with the Ruby Tuesday board on October 15, 2017
in connection with UBS’s opinion. Considering the data below without considering the full narrative description of the financial analyses,
including the methodologies and assumptions underlying the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of UBS’s financial
analyses.

Discounted Cash Flow Analysis

UBS performed discounted cash flow analyses utilizing financial forecasts and estimates prepared by the management of Ruby Tuesday. See the
section entitled “The Merger (Proposal 1)—Certain Financial Projections” beginning on page 53 of this proxy statement. UBS calculated ranges of
implied present values (as of October 15, 2017) of the standalone, after tax, unlevered, free cash flows that Ruby Tuesday was forecasted to generate
from October 15, 2017 through May 31, 2022 and of terminal values for Ruby Tuesday. Implied terminal values were derived by applying to Ruby
Tuesday’s 2022 estimated unlevered, free cash flows a range of perpetuity growth rates of 1.5% to 2.5%, which range was selected based on UBS’s
professional judgment and expertise. Implied present values of cash flows and terminal values were calculated using discount rates ranging from 9.5%
to 10.5%, based on the estimated range of Ruby Tuesday’s weighted average cost of capital. The discounted cash flow analyses resulted in a range of
implied equity values of $1.43 to $2.44 per share for Ruby Tuesday common stock.

Selected Transactions Analysis

UBS reviewed publicly available information relating to the following 14 acquisition transactions involving casual dining target companies which,
based on its professional judgment and expertise, UBS believed to be generally relevant to its analysis (the “Selected Transactions”).

determined from the date each Selected Transaction was announced. UBS observed that these analyses indicated median and mean enterprise value to
LTM EBITDA multiples of 7.8x and 7.9x, respectively, for the target companies in the Selected Transactions. UBS then selected, based on the results of
this analysis, a reference range of enterprise value to LTM EBITDA multiples of 7.0x to 9.0x and applied the range to the LTM EBITDA of Ruby
Tuesday. Financial data regarding the Selected Transactions and used to determine the corresponding multiples were based on public filings and press
releases. Financial data used for the LTM EBITDA of Ruby Tuesday were based on financial data provided by the management of Ruby Tuesday for the
twelve months ending September 5, 2017. This analysis resulted in a range of implied equity values of $1.77 to $3.12 per share for Ruby Tuesday
common stock.

Selected Public Companies Analysis

UBS compared selected financial data of Ruby Tuesday with corresponding data of the following four selected public casual dining publicly
traded U.S. companies which, based on its professional judgment and expertise, UBS believed to be generally relevant to its analysis (the “Selected
Companies”):

Selected Companies
 

 •  Bloomin’ Brands, Inc.
 

 •  Brinker International, Inc.
 

 •  Darden Restaurants, Inc.
 

 •  Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc.

UBS reviewed, among other things, the enterprise values, calculated as equity market value based on closing stock prices on October 13, 2017,
which was the last trading day prior to the delivery of UBS’s oral opinion, plus debt at book value, less cash and cash equivalents, plus minority interest
at book value of each of the Selected Companies as a multiple of next twelve months estimated EBITDA (“NTM EBITDA”) of such Selected Company
and of Ruby Tuesday, based on Ruby Tuesday’s unaffected closing stock price on March 13, 2017, which was the last trading day prior to Ruby
Tuesday’s announcement of its strategic alternatives review, and based on Ruby Tuesday’s closing stock price on October 13, 2017, which was the last
trading day prior to the delivery of UBS’s oral opinion. UBS observed that these analyses indicated median and mean enterprise value to NTM EBITDA
multiples of 6.9x and 7.5x, respectively, for the Selected Companies. UBS also observed an enterprise value to NTM EBITDA multiple of 5.8x for Ruby
Tuesday, based on Ruby Tuesday’s unaffected closing stock price on March 13, 2017, which was the last trading day prior to Ruby Tuesday’s
announcement of its strategic alternatives review, and an enterprise value to NTM EBITDA multiple of 6.2x for Ruby Tuesday, based on Ruby
Tuesday’s closing stock price on October 13, 2017, which was the last trading day prior to the delivery of UBS’s oral opinion. UBS selected, based on
the results of these observations, a reference range of enterprise value to NTM EBITDA multiples of 5.8x to 7.0x and applied the range to the NTM
EBITDA of Ruby Tuesday. This analysis resulted in a range of implied equity values of $1.74 to $2.67 per share for Ruby Tuesday common stock.
Financial data for the Selected Companies were based on FactSet data and public filings. Estimated financial data used for the NTM EBITDA of Ruby
Tuesday were based on the financial forecasts and estimates prepared by the management of Ruby Tuesday. See the section entitled “The Merger
(Proposal 1)—Certain Financial Projections” beginning on page 53 of this proxy statement.

Miscellaneous

Under the terms of UBS’s engagement, Ruby Tuesday agreed to pay UBS an aggregate fee of $5.36 million, of which $100,000 is payable on the
first day of each quarter beginning on March 3, 2017 during UBS’s engagement, $1.5 million became payable upon delivery of UBS’s opinion, and the
remainder of which is contingent upon consummation of the merger. In addition, Ruby Tuesday agreed to reimburse UBS for its reasonable and
documented expenses, including fees, disbursements and other charges of counsel, and to

indemnify UBS and related parties against liabilities, including liabilities relating to, or arising out of, its engagement. In the past, UBS and its affiliates
have provided mergers and acquisitions and investment banking services to Ruby Tuesday, unrelated to the proposed merger, for which UBS and its
affiliates received compensation, including, in the past two years, acting (i) as financial advisor to Ruby Tuesday in connection with share repurchases in
2016 and (ii) as lead arranger in connection with Ruby Tuesday’s $20 million revolving credit facility in 2017. During the two year period preceding
delivery of its opinion, the aggregate fees received by UBS from Ruby Tuesday for mergers and acquisitions and investment banking services and as a
participant in Ruby Tuesday’s $20 million revolving credit facility (together with interest payments) were approximately $1 million. UBS or an affiliate
is a participant in Ruby Tuesday’s $20 million revolving credit facility for which it received and continues to receive fees and interest payments, as
described in the preceding sentence. UBS has not in the past two years provided, and is not currently providing, financial advisory or investment
banking services to Holding or its affiliates for which UBS has received compensation. In the ordinary course of business, UBS and its affiliates may
hold or trade, for their own accounts and the accounts of their customers, securities of Ruby Tuesday and of public portfolio companies of the Fund, an
affiliate of Holding, and, accordingly, may at any time hold a long or short position in such securities. The issuance of UBS’s opinion was approved by
an authorized committee of UBS. The information disclosed in this paragraph is based on information provided to us by UBS.

Ruby Tuesday selected UBS as its financial advisor in connection with the merger because UBS is an internationally recognized investment
banking firm with substantial experience in similar transactions. UBS is regularly engaged in the valuation of businesses and their securities in
connection with mergers and acquisitions, leveraged buyouts, negotiated underwritings, competitive bids, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted
securities, and private placements.

Certain Financial Projections

Ruby Tuesday provided certain non-public financial information to UBS in its capacity as its financial advisor, including projections by
management of Ruby Tuesday’s standalone financial performance for fiscal years 2018 through 2022. These financial projections represent
management’s reasonable estimates and good faith judgments as to the future growth and financial performance of Ruby Tuesday, including forecasts of
total revenue, gross profit, payroll, operating costs and EBITDA. These financial projections were used by UBS in performing certain of the analyses
described in the section entitled “The Merger (Proposal 1)—Opinion of Ruby Tuesday’s Financial Advisor.” The financial projections were not prepared
with a view to public disclosure. The financial projections included in this proxy statement have been prepared by, and are the responsibility of, Ruby
Tuesday’s management. The financial projections were prepared solely for internal use of Ruby Tuesday and are subjective in many respects. Although
a summary of the financial projections is presented with numerical specificity, they reflect numerous assumptions and estimates as to future events made
by our management that our management believed were reasonable at the time the financial projections were prepared, taking into account the relevant
information available to management at the time. However, this information is not fact and should not be relied upon as being necessarily indicative of
actual future results. In addition, the financial projections do not take into account any circumstances or events occurring after the date that they were
prepared and do not give effect to the merger. As a result, there can be no assurance that the financial projections will be realized, and actual results may
be materially better or worse than those contained in the financial projections. The inclusion of this information should not be regarded as an indication
that the Ruby Tuesday board, Ruby Tuesday, UBS or any other recipient of this information considered, or now considers, the forecasts to be predictive
of actual future results.

The financial projections are forward-looking statements. For information on factors that may cause Ruby Tuesday’s future results to materially
vary or the financial projections not to be achieved, see the section entitled “Caution Regarding Forward Looking Statements” beginning on page 21 of
this proxy statement.

approximately 83% of such three fiscal quarter period).

Interests of Ruby Tuesday’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger

In considering the recommendation of the Ruby Tuesday board to approve and adopt the merger agreement, you should be aware that some of
Ruby Tuesday’s directors and executive officers have interests in the merger

Table of Contents

that are different from, or in addition to, those of Ruby Tuesday stockholders generally. The Ruby Tuesday board was aware of these interests and
considered them, among other matters, in evaluating the merger agreement, in reaching its decision to approve the merger agreement and in
recommending to our stockholders that the merger agreement be approved. These interests are described and quantified below.

Equity-Based and Cash Awards

Ruby Tuesday’s executive officers currently hold unvested restricted shares, vested and unvested stock options, service-based restricted stock
units (including service-based phantom stock units) (“RSUs”), and performance-based restricted stock units (including performance-based phantom
stock units) (“PSUs”). Executive officers also hold performance-based cash awards and participate in our annual incentive plan.

On consummation of the merger, the equity-based and cash awards then held by Ruby Tuesday executive officers and non-employee directors
would be treated as follows:
 

 
•  Stock Options. Each outstanding stock option, whether exercisable or not yet exercisable, will be canceled in exchange for an amount in

cash equal to the excess of the merger consideration per share of stock over the exercise price. If the exercise price is greater than or equal to
the merger consideration per share, the stock options will be canceled without any consideration being paid.

 

 
•  RSUs (including service-based phantom stock units). Each outstanding service-based RSU and phantom stock unit, whether vested or

unvested and settleable in shares of stock or cash, will be canceled, and the holder of each service-based RSU or phantom stock unit will be
paid an amount in cash equal to the merger consideration.

 

 
•  PSUs (including performance-based phantom stock units). Each outstanding performance-based PSU and phantom stock unit, whether

vested or unvested, will be canceled, and the holder will be paid an amount in cash determined by multiplying the merger consideration per
share of stock by the number of PSUs the holder would be entitled to if the PSUs vested at their “target” level.

 

 
•  Restricted Stock. Each outstanding restricted share of stock, whether vested or unvested, will be canceled, and the holder will be paid an

amount in cash equal to the merger consideration per restricted share of stock.
 

 
•  Performance-Based Cash Awards. All outstanding performance-based cash awards, whether vested or unvested, will vest and pay out at its

“target” level, prorated for the number of days that have elapsed since the beginning of the year in which the consummation of the merger
occurs, up to and including the closing date.

 

 

•  Annual Bonuses: Annual bonuses will pay out based on the actual achievement of the applicable performance metrics over the applicable
performance period up until the consummation of the merger, prorated for the number of days of the applicable performance period which
have elapsed prior to the consummation of the merger. In no event will annual cash-based bonuses be treated less favorably than they would
pursuant to the terms of the applicable employee plan or Ruby Tuesday’s change in control severance plan.

Change in Control Severance Plan

Some of Ruby Tuesday’s executive officers participate in the Ruby Tuesday, Inc. Change in Control Severance Plan (the “CIC Plan”), which
provides specified benefits to participants following qualifying terminations of employment following a change in control. The CIC Plan covers
employees of Ruby Tuesday with the title of Vice President or above, including the executive officers. All the executive officers except for the current
CEO, Mr. Hyatt, are covered by the CIC Plan. Mr. Hyatt will become eligible to participate in the CIC Plan on April 4, 2018, pursuant to the terms of his
employment agreement. The CIC Plan is a double-trigger plan that provides for the payment of severance and other benefits to eligible employees in the
event of a termination

Table of Contents

of employment by Ruby Tuesday, other than for “cause” (as defined in the CIC Plan) or death, or a termination of employment by the employee for
“good reason” (as defined below), provided such termination occurs within 24 months after a change in control.

In the event of a qualifying termination under the CIC Plan, and subject to the execution of a general release of liability against Ruby Tuesday and
a restrictive covenant agreement (which includes a non-competition covenant), the CIC Plan provides that the executive officer will receive the
following payments and benefits:
 

 
•  A lump-sum payment in an amount equal to two times the sum of the executive officer’s base salary and his or her target annual bonus in the

year of termination (or, if greater, his or her target annual bonus in the year the merger is consummated);
 

 
•  A lump-sum payment in an amount equal to the executive officer’s target annual bonus, adjusted on a pro rata basis based on the number of

days he or she was actually employed during the applicable bonus plan year;
 

 
•  A lump-sum payment in an amount equal to the product of (i) 1.5 and (ii) the annual employer contributions to the executive officer’s

medical, dental, optical and group term-life insurance coverage in effect for the year of termination based on the same coverage level and
cost to him or her as in effect immediately prior to his or her termination;

 

 
•  Reimbursement for outplacement services costs incurred within 18 months following the termination of employment up to a maximum of

$30,000, subject to certain restrictions; and
 

 
•  A lump-sum payment in an amount equal to unpaid base salary, accrued but unused vacation time, unreimbursed business expenses and

other items earned through and including the effective date of termination.

The CIC Plan does not provide for a gross-up payment to any executive officer to offset any excise taxes that may be imposed on excess parachute
payments under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) or any similar federal, state or local tax that may be
imposed. Instead, the CIC Plan provides that, in the event the payments described would, if paid, be subject to an excise tax, then the payments will be
reduced to the extent necessary so that no portion of the payments is subject to the excise tax, provided that the net amount of the reduced payments,
after giving effect to the income tax consequences, is greater than or equal to the net amount of the payments without such reduction, after giving effect
to the excise tax and income tax consequences.

The CIC Plan generally defines “good reason” to mean:
 

 •  a material reduction in the executive officer’s base salary or target annual bonus opportunity;
 

 •  a material diminution in the executive officer’s authority, duties or responsibilities;
 

 •  a change in the executive officer’s reporting relationship;
 

 
•  the requirement by Ruby Tuesday or Holding that the executive officer relocate his or her principal work location to a location more than 50

miles away from where he or she was previously located immediately prior to the merger; or
 

 •  any other material breach by Ruby Tuesday or Holding of any material provision of the CIC Plan.

Mr. Hyatt’s Employment Arrangements

Upon his appointment as President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Hyatt entered into an employment agreement with Ruby Tuesday. The
employment agreement provides for severance payments in the event of a termination of Mr. Hyatt’s employment, specifically in the case of a
termination without “cause” (as defined in the employment agreement) or a resignation for “good reason” (as defined below).
 

56



9/22/2019 DEFM14A

Table of Contents

In the event of a termination without “cause” or a resignation for “good reason” prior to April 4, 2018, Mr. Hyatt would be entitled to a lump-sum
payment equal to the amount of his base salary. Under the employment agreement, the payment is dependent upon Mr. Hyatt (i) executing a waiver and
release of claims against Ruby Tuesday and its affiliates and (ii) complying with specified restrictive covenants regarding confidentiality,
non-solicitation, trade secrets, disparagement and non-competition. Any violation of these restrictive covenants could subject Mr. Hyatt’s payment to
clawback.

Beginning on April 4, 2018, Mr. Hyatt will be eligible to participate in the CIC Plan, and the compensation and benefits he would receive in
connection with a termination of his employment after that date are those described above in connection with the CIC Plan.

The employment agreement generally defines “good reason” to mean, following a change in control, a material diminution in Mr. Hyatt’s
authority, duties or responsibilities.

Pursuant to the merger agreement, Mr. Hyatt will be entitled to receive an annual cash bonus for fiscal year 2018, as described in more detail in
the section entitled “The Merger Agreement—Employee Matters” beginning on page 74 of this proxy statement. The amount of the fiscal year 2018
cash bonus will be based on the actual achievement of the applicable performance metrics, prorated for the number of days of the applicable
performance period which have elapsed as of the consummation of the merger.

Deferred Compensation

Ruby Tuesday’s executive officers are eligible to participate in the Ruby Tuesday, Inc. 2005 Deferred Compensation Plan. If an executive officer’s
employment terminates, Ruby Tuesday would be required to distribute to the executive officer the amount in his or her deferred compensation account.
The timing and form of the distributions would depend on the executive officer’s deferral elections and the plan’s rules.

Certain of Ruby Tuesday’s non-employee directors hold unvested restricted shares and/or fully vested stock awards that they elected to defer
under the Ruby Tuesday, Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan for Directors (“DCPD”). The DCPD permits non-employee directors to defer all or a portion
of their annual retainers and any meeting and committee fees. Unless a director timely elects otherwise, amounts credited to a director’s deferred
compensation account will be distributed starting on the earlier of (a) the first day of the calendar month following the director’s 70th birthday or (b) the
first January 15th or July 15th following when the director ceases to be a member of the Board.

Indemnification

For information regarding indemnification of Ruby Tuesday’s directors and executive officers, see the section entitled “The Merger Agreement—
Directors’ and Officers’ Indemnification” beginning on page  75 of this proxy statement.”

Golden Parachute Compensation

The table below sets forth, for each of Ruby Tuesday’s eight named executive officers (as well as Ruby Tuesday’s other executive officers and
directors), estimates of the amounts of compensation that are based on or otherwise relate to the merger and that will or may become payable to the
named executive officer, executive officer or director either immediately on the consummation of the merger or on a qualifying termination of
employment within two years after the merger. Ruby Tuesday’s stockholders are being asked to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, such
compensation for these named executive officers (see the section entitled “Advisory Vote on Named Executive Officer Merger-Related Compensation
Arrangements (Proposal 2)” beginning on page 83 of this proxy statement). Because the vote to approve such compensation is advisory only, it will not
be binding on either Ruby Tuesday or Holding. Accordingly, if the merger agreement is adopted by Ruby Tuesday’s stockholders and the merger is
completed, the compensation will be payable regardless of the outcome of the advisory vote to approve such compensation, subject only to the
conditions applicable thereto, which are described in the footnotes to the table and above under the section entitled “The Merger (Proposal 1)—Interests
of Ruby Tuesday’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger” beginning on page 54 of this proxy statement.

The estimates in each of the tables in this section assume that the merger became effective on October 16, 2017 and that, immediately after the
consummation of the merger, each executive’s employment had been terminated by Ruby Tuesday without “cause” or by the executive for “good
reason.” See the footnotes to the table for additional assumptions.

The table also sets forth estimates of the amounts of such compensation for Ruby Tuesday’s executive officers other than the named executive
officers. Ruby Tuesday’s stockholders are not being asked to approve such compensation for these individuals.

Table of Contents

As described in the section entitled “The Merger (Proposal 1)—Interests of Ruby Tuesday’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—
Change in Control Severance Plan” beginning on page 55 of this proxy statement, the amounts payable to each participating executive officer are subject
to reduction under the CIC Plan to the extent necessary for the executive officer to avoid the excise tax imposed under Section 4999 of the Code, if such
reduction would result in the executive officer retaining a higher amount of the payments (net of the excise and other taxes) than if such reduction were
not made. The table does not take into account any such reduction.

payable following a termination of employment would depend on the date of termination, the manner of termination and the terms of the
agreements in effect at such time.

 

 
•  Each executive officer is assumed to experience a termination without cause or for good reason (if applicable), which is a qualifying

termination of employment pursuant to the CIC Plan, immediately following the consummation of the merger.
 

 •  Compensation levels on the date of termination are assumed to be the same as those as of October 16, 2017.
 

 •  Employee contributions to health insurance programs are assumed to be the same as they were on October 16, 2017.
 

 •  Each executive officer is assumed to request reimbursement of outplacement services equal to the specified maximum of $30,000.

Tuesday healthcare plans and long-term disability plan and (iii) payment of accrued but unused vacation time as of the date of termination of
employment.

Financing of the Merger

Completion of the merger is not subject to a financing condition.

Concurrently with the execution of the merger agreement, the Fund delivered an executed equity commitment letter pursuant to which the Fund
commits to purchase at or prior to the effective time of the merger, equity securities of Holding for up to $90,000,000 in cash. Such commitment is
subject only to the following conditions: (i) each of the conditions to Holding’s obligations to consummate the merger as set forth in the

merger agreement are satisfied in full or are waived by Holding; (ii) (x) successful consummation of the financing necessary for the consummation of
the merger or (y) the financing necessary for the consummation of the merger would be consummated at the closing assuming the commitment is
funded; and (iii) the substantially concurrent consummation of the closing.

Concurrently with the execution of the merger agreement, Holding entered into four real estate purchase and sale contracts (the “Sale-Leaseback
PSAs”) with four SLB Buyers, for 127 owned properties to be sold for an aggregate purchase price of $178,464,271. Under the Sale-Leaseback PSAs,
each SLB Buyer made an earnest money deposit of between 1% and 3% of the purchase price under the applicable Sale-Leaseback PSA. The retention
of earnest money deposit is Holding’s sole remedy in the event of a default by an SLB Buyer for all but one SLB Buyer, and the retention of earnest
money deposit plus $500,000 of liquidated damages is Holding’s sole remedy in the event of a default for one SLB Buyer.

Prior to execution of the merger agreement, each SLB Buyer confirmed that they completed their property review and approved all current title
commitments and surveys for all properties subject to the Sale-Leaseback PSAs, except for the resolution of rights of first refusal related to two
specified properties and for any future material liens and encumbrances. Otherwise, all existing liens and encumbrances of record, and all conditions
shown on updated surveys have been approved by the SLB Buyers, and any title objections made under the Sale-Leaseback PSAs have been waived or
resolved.

The Sale-Leaseback PSAs stipulate additional conditions to be satisfied on or before the closing date, including Ruby Tuesday’s exclusive and
sole possession of operating properties, accuracy of the representations and warranties set forth in the Sale-Leaseback PSAs, accuracy of environmental
Phase I reports, a minimum of $35 million equity contributions to Holding, no material deterioration of the financial condition of Ruby Tuesday and
delivery of final title commitments to the SLB Buyers (consistent with the approved title commitments).

Concurrently with the execution of the merger agreement, the Senior Debt Commitment was executed, pursuant to which up to $156 million of
debt financing in the aggregate is committed by Goldman Sachs Specialty Lending Group, L.P. and TCW Direct Lending Group, together with its
affiliates, consisting of: (i) up to $143.5 million aggregate principal amount of term loans (principally used for the merger) and (ii) up to $12.5 million
aggregate principal amount of a revolving facility (principally used to backstop and/or replace Ruby Tuesday’s existing letters of credit). The financing
commitment under the Senior Debt Commitment is subject to certain closing conditions that remain to be satisfied, including compliance with the terms
of the commitment letter and the fee letter, receipt of proceeds of certain sale-leaseback transactions, a minimum of common cash equity contribution
from the Fund constituting at least 30% of the total pro forma capitalization of Holding and its subsidiaries, the execution of the merger agreement and
the meeting of all conditions precedent thereto, the solvency of Ruby Tuesday after the merger and the incurrence of the new indebtedness, receipt of
various finance, legal and know-your-client deliverables, absence of a material adverse event (as such term is defined in the merger agreement) since
May 31, 2016, execution of the definitive credit agreement and other loan documents, accuracy and completeness of certain representations in the
merger agreement and the loan documents, and payoff of existing debt, release of liens and security interests securing existing debt and cancellation of
existing letters of credit.

Regulatory Clearances and Approvals Required for the Merger

No filing was necessary under the HSR Act. No other regulatory clearance or approval is required.

Accounting Treatment

The merger will be accounted for as a “purchase transaction” for financial accounting purposes.

Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger

The exchange of Ruby Tuesday common stock for cash in the merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes and may
also be taxable under state and local and other tax laws. In general, a U.S. holder (as defined in the section entitled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax
Consequences of the Merger” beginning on page 87 of this proxy statement) whose shares of Ruby Tuesday common stock are converted into the right
to receive cash in the merger will recognize capital gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes in an amount equal to the difference, if any,
between the amount of cash received with respect to such shares and the U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in such shares.

You should read the section entitled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger” beginning on page 87 of this proxy
statement and consult your tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger to you in your particular circumstances, as
well as tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or foreign taxing jurisdiction.

Delisting and Deregistration of Ruby Tuesday Common Stock

Upon completion of the merger, the Ruby Tuesday common stock currently listed on the NYSE will cease to be listed on the NYSE and will
subsequently be deregistered under the Exchange Act.

Litigation Related to the Merger

In connection with the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, as of November 15, 2017, various combinations of Ruby Tuesday, its
directors, Holding, Merger Subsidiary and the Fund have been named as defendants in six purported stockholder class actions filed in the United States
District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee by alleged stockholders of Ruby Tuesday. The lawsuits are captioned Maseman v. Ruby Tuesday,
Inc., et al., 3:17-cv-00478 (filed on November 8, 2017), Sun v. Ruby Tuesday, Inc., et al., 3:17-cv-00482 (filed on November 9, 2017), Rosenfeld v. Ruby
Tuesday, Inc., et al., 3:17-cv-00485 (filed on November 10, 2017), Raul v. Ruby Tuesday, Inc., et al., 3:17-cv-00494 (filed on November 13, 2017),
Patterson v. Ruby Tuesday, Inc., et al., 3:17-cv-00495 (filed on November 14, 2017) (“Patterson”) and Breslau v. Ruby Tuesday, Inc., et al., 3:17-cv-
00496 (filed on November 14, 2017) (collectively, the “Actions”). The complaints in the Actions assert claims against various combinations of Ruby
Tuesday, its directors, Holding, Merger Subsidiary and the Fund pursuant to Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act and Ruby Tuesday’s directors pursuant
to Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act and generally allege that the preliminary proxy statement omitted certain material information regarding the
merger, and that Ruby Tuesday’s directors had control person liability for the alleged material omissions. In addition, the Patterson complaint asserts a
claim against Ruby Tuesday’s directors for breach of fiduciary duties. The complaints generally seek, among other remedies, to enjoin the merger, or in
the event that the merger is consummated, rescission of the merger and unspecified damages, costs and attorney’s fees. The defendants believe that the
Actions are without merit and intend to defend vigorously against all claims asserted.

Dissenters’ Rights (page 82 and Annex C)

Under the GBCC, any record holder of Ruby Tuesday common stock who does not vote in favor of the merger, and who exercises its dissenters’
rights and fully complies with all of the provisions of Article 13 of the GBCC (but not otherwise), will be entitled to demand and receive payment of the
“fair value” for all (but not less than all) of his or her shares of Ruby Tuesday common stock if the merger is completed. See the section entitled
“Dissenters’ Rights of Stockholders” beginning on page 82 of this proxy statement. A copy of Article 13 of the GBCC is attached as Annex C to this
proxy statement.

Plan of Merger, dated as of October 16, 2017, a copy of which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex A, and which is incorporated by reference
into this proxy statement. We encourage you to read the merger agreement carefully and in its entirety because it is the legal document that governs the
merger.

Explanatory Note Regarding the Merger Agreement

The following summary of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of October 16, 2017, a copy of which is attached hereto as Annex A to this
proxy statement, is intended to provide information regarding the terms of the merger agreement and is not intended to modify or supplement any factual
disclosures about Ruby Tuesday in its public reports filed with the SEC. In particular, the merger agreement and the related summary are not intended to
be, and should not be relied upon as, disclosures regarding any facts and circumstances relating to Ruby Tuesday or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates.
The merger agreement contains representations and warranties by Ruby Tuesday, Holding and Merger Subsidiary which were made only for purposes of
that agreement and as of specified dates. The representations, warranties and covenants in the merger agreement were made solely for the benefit of the
parties to the merger agreement; may be subject to limitations agreed upon by the contracting parties, including being qualified by the disclosure
schedules to the merger agreement; were made for the purposes of allocating contractual risk between the parties to the merger agreement instead of
establishing these matters as facts; and may apply contractual standards of materiality or material adverse effect that generally differ from those
applicable to investors. In addition, information concerning the subject matter of the representations, warranties and covenants may change after the
date of the merger agreement, which subsequent information may or may not be fully reflected in Ruby Tuesday’s public disclosures.

Additional information about Ruby Tuesday may be found elsewhere in this proxy statement and Ruby Tuesday’s other public filings. See the
section entitled “Where You Can Find More Information,” beginning on page 91 of this proxy statement.

Structure of the Merger

At the effective time of the merger, Merger Subsidiary will be merged with and into Ruby Tuesday. Ruby Tuesday will be the surviving
corporation in the merger and will continue its corporate existence under Georgia law as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Holding. The articles of
incorporation and bylaws of Ruby Tuesday as in effect immediately prior to the effective time of the merger will be amended by virtue of the merger at
the effective time of the merger in form and substance satisfactory to Holding. The managers of Merger Subsidiary at the effective time of the merger
will be the directors of the surviving corporation until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified, as the case may be. The
officers of Ruby Tuesday at the effective time of the merger will be the officers of the surviving corporation.

Closing and Effective Time of the Merger

Unless otherwise mutually agreed by Ruby Tuesday and Holding, the closing of the merger will take place no later than the fifth business day
following the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in the merger agreement and described in the section entitled “The Merger Agreement—
Conditions to Completion of the Merger” beginning on page 77 of this proxy statement (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions) at the closing of the merger.

The merger will become effective at such time as the certificate of merger is duly filed with the Georgia Secretary of State or at such later time as
may be specified in the certificate of merger. As of the date of this proxy statement, we expect to complete the merger by the first calendar quarter of
2018. However, completion of the merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to the completion of the merger, which are described
below, and it is possible that factors outside the control of Ruby Tuesday or Holding could delay the completion of the merger, or prevent it from being
completed at all. There may be a substantial amount of time between the special meeting and the completion of the merger. We expect to complete the
merger promptly following the receipt of all required approvals.

Effect of the Merger on Ruby Tuesday Common Stock

At the effective time of the merger, each share of Ruby Tuesday common stock outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger
(other than shares owned by Ruby Tuesday, Holding or any of their respective subsidiaries or any stockholder who has properly demanded and not
validly withdrawn dissenters’ rights in accordance with Georgia law, together, the “excluded shares”) will be converted into the right to receive $2.40 in
cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes. At the effective time of the merger, all of the shares of Ruby Tuesday common stock
(other than the excluded shares) will cease to be outstanding, will be cancelled and will cease to exist, and will thereafter represent only the right to
receive the per share merger consideration of $2.40 for each such share, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes.

At the effective time of the merger, each share of Ruby Tuesday common stock held by Ruby Tuesday, Holding or any of their respective
subsidiaries will cease to be outstanding and will be canceled without payment of any consideration. In addition, each share of Ruby Tuesday common
stock the holder of which has properly demanded dissenters’ rights in accordance with Georgia law will not be canceled and converted into the right to
receive the merger consideration unless and until such holder fails to perfect or withdraws or otherwise loses its dissenters’ right. If any holder of Ruby
Tuesday common stock that demands dissenters’ rights properly perfects such rights, such holder will be entitled to the fair value of such shares as
determined by the superior court of Georgia plus interest, if any, on the amount determined to be the fair value, as further described in the section
entitled “Dissenters’ Rights of Stockholders” beginning on page 82 of this proxy statement.

Each share of common stock of Merger Subsidiary outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger will be converted into one
share of common stock of the surviving corporation.

Procedures for Surrendering Shares for Payment

At or prior to the effective time of the merger, Holding will make available to an exchange agent selected by Holding and reasonably acceptable to
Ruby Tuesday, for the benefit of the holders of Ruby Tuesday common stock, cash in the aggregate amount necessary for the exchange agent to make
the payment of the merger consideration to Ruby Tuesday stockholders.

Promptly after the effective time of the merger (but not later than two business days thereafter), Holding will send or cause the exchange agent to
send to each record holder of Ruby Tuesday common stock at the effective time of the merger a letter of transmittal and instructions (which shall specify
that the delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the certificate or transfer of the uncertificated shares
to the exchange agent) for use in such exchange.

Each holder of shares of Ruby Tuesday common stock that have been converted into the right to receive the merger consideration will be entitled
to receive, upon (i) surrender to the exchange agent of a certificate, together with a properly completed letter of transmittal, and such other documents as
may be reasonably requested by the exchange agent or the surviving corporation, or (ii) receipt of an “agent’s message” by the exchange agent (or such
other evidence, if any, of transfer as the exchange agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry transfer of uncertificated shares, the merger
consideration in respect of Ruby Tuesday common stock represented by a certificate or uncertificated share. Until so surrendered or transferred, as the
case may be, each such certificate or uncertificated share shall represent after the effective time of the merger for all purposes only the right to receive
such merger consideration.

Any portion of the funds deposited with the exchange agent for payment to the stockholders that remains unclaimed by the stockholders of Ruby
Tuesday for six months after the effective time of the merger will be delivered to the surviving corporation, upon demand. Any holder of Ruby Tuesday
common stock will thereafter look only to the surviving corporation for payment of the merger consideration.

Withholding

Holding, the surviving corporation and the exchange agent are entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any
person pursuant to the merger agreement such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under any
provision of federal, state, local or foreign tax law. If the exchange agent, the surviving corporation or Holding, as the case may be, so withholds
amounts, the exchange agent, the surviving corporation or Holding, as the case may be, will remit any such amounts to the applicable taxing authority,
and, to the extent so withheld and remitted, such amounts will be treated for all purposes of the merger agreement as having been paid to the person in
respect of whom the exchange agent, the surviving corporation or Holding, as the case may be, made such deduction and withholding.

Treatment of Ruby Tuesday Equity and Performance-Based Cash Awards

At or immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, to the extent required or permitted by the applicable employee plan:
 

 

•  Each outstanding option to purchase Ruby Tuesday common stock under any employee plan, whether or not exercisable or vested, will be
canceled, and Ruby Tuesday will pay each holder of any such option at or promptly after the effective time of the merger for each stock
option an amount in cash determined by multiplying (i) the excess, if any, of the merger consideration of $2.40 per share over the applicable
exercise price of such stock option, by (ii) the number of shares that such holder could have purchased (assuming full vesting of all stock
options) had such holder exercised such stock option in full immediately prior to the effective time of the merger. In the event that the per
share exercise price of any stock option is equal to or greater than the merger consideration of $2.40 per share, such stock option will be
cancelled, without any consideration being payable in respect thereof, and will have no further force or effect;

 

 

•  Each outstanding service-based restricted stock unit (including service-based phantom stock units) of Ruby Tuesday under any employee
plan, whether or not vested, and whether settleable in shares of Ruby Tuesday common stock or cash, will be canceled, and Ruby Tuesday
will pay each holder of any such restricted stock unit at or promptly after the effective time of the merger for each such Ruby Tuesday
restricted stock unit an amount in cash equal to the merger consideration of $2.40 per share;

 

 

•  Each outstanding performance-based restricted stock unit (including performance-based phantom stock units) of Ruby Tuesday under any
employee plan, whether or not vested, will be canceled, and Ruby Tuesday will pay each holder of any such outstanding restricted stock unit
at or promptly after the effective time of the merger for each Ruby Tuesday performance-based restricted stock unit an amount in cash
determined by multiplying (i) the merger consideration of $2.40 per share by (ii) the number of Ruby Tuesday performance-based restricted
stock units that such holder would have been entitled to if such Ruby Tuesday performance-based restricted stock award had vested at its
“target” level;

 

 
•  Each outstanding restricted share of Ruby Tuesday common stock under any employee plan, whether or not vested, shall be canceled, and

Ruby Tuesday will pay each holder of any such outstanding restricted shares at or promptly after the effective time for each such restricted
share an amount in cash equal to the merger consideration of $2.40 per share; and

 

 
•  Each outstanding performance-based cash award of Ruby Tuesday under any employee plan, whether or not vested, will vest and pay out at

its “target” level, prorated for the number of days that have elapsed since the beginning of the year in which the effective time of the merger
occurs (up to and including the date on which the effective time of the merger occurs).

Definition of “Material Adverse Effect”

Many of Ruby Tuesday, Holding and Merger Subsidiary’s representations and warranties in the merger agreement are qualified by a “material
adverse effect” standard (that is, they will not be deemed to be untrue or incorrect unless their failure to be true or correct has had or would reasonably
be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect). For purposes of the merger agreement, a “material adverse effect”
means a material adverse effect on (i) the financial condition, business, assets or results of operations of such person and its subsidiaries, or (ii) such
person’s ability to consummate the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement on a timely basis taken as a whole, excluding any effect resulting
from:
 

 •  Changes in GAAP or changes in the accounting requirements applicable to any industry in which such person or its subsidiaries operate;
 

 •  Changes in the financial or securities markets generally or general economic or political conditions in the United States;
 

 
•  Changes (including changes of applicable law) or conditions generally affecting the industry in which such person or its subsidiaries operate

and not specifically relating to or having a materially disproportionate effect on such person and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole;
 

 •  Acts of war, sabotage or terrorism involving the United States;
 

 •  The announcement or consummation of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement;
 

 
•  Any failure by such person and its subsidiaries to meet any internal or published budgets, projections, forecasts or predictions of financial

performance for any period (it being understood that such failure will not prevent a party from asserting that any fact, change, event,
occurrence or effect that may have contributed to such failure independently constitutes or contributes to a material adverse effect);

 

 •  Any action taken (or omitted to be taken) at the request of the other parties to the merger agreement;
 

 
•  Any action taken by such person or any of its subsidiaries that is required, expressly contemplated or permitted pursuant to the merger

agreement;
 

 
•  Changes in the market price or trading volume of the shares of Ruby Tuesday common stock (it being understood that such changes will not

prevent a party from asserting that any fact, change, event, occurrence or effect that may have contributed to such change independently
constitutes or contributes to a material adverse effect); or

•  Any hurricane, tropical storm, flood, forest fire, earthquake, winter storm, snow storm, or any other natural disaster, weather-related event or

calamity.

Notwithstanding these exclusions, any event, occurrence, fact, condition, or change referred to in the first, second, fourth and tenth bullet points
above will be taken into account in determining whether a material adverse effect has occurred or would reasonably be expected to occur only to the
extent that such event, change, or effect has a disproportionate effect on such person, compared to other participants in the industries in which such
person conducts its businesses.

Conduct of the Business Pending the Merger

Ruby Tuesday has agreed to certain covenants in the merger agreement restricting the conduct of its business between the date of the merger
agreement and the effective time of the merger. In general, except as expressly contemplated by the merger agreement, as set forth on the disclosure
schedules to the merger agreement, or with the prior written consent of Holding (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), Ruby Tuesday is required
to and cause each of its subsidiaries to conduct its business in the ordinary course and use its reasonable best efforts to preserve intact its business
organization and relationships with third parties (including customers, suppliers, distributors and franchisees) and to keep available the services of its
present officers and employees.

In addition, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, except as expressly contemplated by the merger agreement, as set forth on the
disclosure schedules to the merger agreement, or with the prior written consent of Holding (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), Ruby Tuesday
will not, nor will Ruby Tuesday permit any of its subsidiaries to:
 

 •  Amend its articles of incorporation, bylaws or other similar organizational documents;
 

 •  Split, combine or reclassify any shares of its capital stock;
 

 
•  Declare, set aside or pay any dividend or other distribution (whether in cash, stock or property or any combination thereof) in respect of its

capital stock, except for dividends by any of its wholly-owned subsidiaries;
 

 
•  Redeem, repurchase or otherwise acquire or offer to redeem, repurchase, or otherwise acquire certain securities of Ruby Tuesday or certain

securities of Ruby Tuesday’s subsidiaries;
 

 

•  Issue, deliver or sell, or authorize the issuance, delivery or sale of, any shares of certain securities of Ruby Tuesday or certain securities of

Board Obligation to Call a Stockholders’ Meeting

Ruby Tuesday has agreed under the merger agreement to cause a meeting of Ruby Tuesday stockholders to be duly called and held as soon as
reasonably practicable for the purpose of voting to approve and adopt the merger agreement. In connection therewith, Ruby Tuesday will mail or
otherwise make available this proxy statement to the holders of Ruby Tuesday common stock in advance of such meeting. Under the merger agreement,
the Ruby Tuesday board is required to (i) recommend approval of the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the
merger agreement by Ruby Tuesday stockholders, (ii) use its reasonable best efforts to obtain such approval by Ruby Tuesday stockholders and
(iii) otherwise comply with all applicable laws relating to such meeting.

Once the stockholders’ meeting has been called and noticed, Ruby Tuesday will not postpone or adjourn such meeting without the consent of
Holding, other than: (i) in order to obtain a quorum of its stockholders; or (ii) to allow reasonable additional time after the filing and mailing of any
supplemental or amended disclosures to this proxy statement for compliance with applicable legal requirements.

Restrictions on Solicitation of Acquisition Proposals

Ruby Tuesday has agreed that, prior to approval and adoption of the merger agreement by Ruby Tuesday stockholders, it and its subsidiaries will
not, and will not authorize or permit any of its or their respective directors, officers, employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants and other
advisors or representatives (collectively, “Representatives”) to, directly or indirectly:
 

 •  Solicit, initiate or knowingly take any action to facilitate or encourage the submission of any Acquisition Proposal (as defined below);
 

 

•  Enter into or participate in any discussions or negotiations with, furnish any information relating to Ruby Tuesday or any of its subsidiaries
or afford access to the business, properties, assets, books or records of Ruby Tuesday or any of its subsidiaries to, or otherwise cooperate in

an Acquisition Proposal;

Table of Contents

 
•  Amend, modify or grant any waiver or release under any standstill, confidentiality or similar agreement of Ruby Tuesday or any of its

subsidiaries; or
 

 
•  Enter into any agreement in principle, letter of intent, term sheet, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement or other

similar instrument relating to an Acquisition Proposal (an “Alternative Acquisition Agreement”).

Ruby Tuesday also agreed to (and agreed to cause its subsidiaries and its and their respective Representatives to) immediately cease and cause to
be terminated all activities, discussions and negotiations with any third party and its Representatives conducted prior to the date of the merger agreement
with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, and to promptly request that all copies of confidential information that Ruby Tuesday or any of its
Representatives have distributed or made available to any such third party in connection with their consideration of the Acquisition Proposal be
promptly destroyed or returned, and cause any physical or virtual data room to no longer by accessible by such third party.

Notwithstanding the restrictions described above, if at any time prior to obtaining the approval of Ruby Tuesday stockholders, Ruby Tuesday or
any of its Representatives receives a bona fide written, unsolicited Acquisition Proposal (including bona fide unsolicited Acquisition Proposals from
third parties that may have otherwise submitted proposals prior to the date of the merger agreement), that the Ruby Tuesday board reasonably believes
may constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal (as defined below) after consultation with outside legal counsel, then
Ruby Tuesday and its representatives may:
 

 •  Engage in negotiations or discussions with the person making such Acquisition Proposal and its Representatives; or
 

 

•  Furnish, pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement (as defined below, a copy of which will be promptly provided to Holding),
non-public information relating to Ruby Tuesday and its subsidiaries to the person making such Acquisition Proposal and its
Representatives; provided, that all such information (to the extent that such information has not been previously provided or made available
to Holding) is provided or made available to Holding, as the case may be, prior to or substantially concurrently with the time it is provided
or made available to such person making such Acquisition Proposal.

Ruby Tuesday may not take any of the actions referred to in the above bullets unless it has delivered to Holding prior written notice advising
Holding that it intends to take such action. In addition, at any time until the receipt of stockholder approval, Ruby Tuesday will notify Holding promptly
(but in no event later than two business days) after receipt by Ruby Tuesday (or any of its Representatives) of any Acquisition Proposal, any indication
that a third party is considering making an Acquisition Proposal or any request for non-public information relating to Ruby Tuesday or any of its
subsidiaries or for access to the business, properties, assets, books or records of Ruby Tuesday or any of its subsidiaries by any third party that could
reasonably be expected to make, or has made, an Acquisition Proposal. Ruby Tuesday will provide such notice in writing and shall, to the extent
permitted by any agreements with such third party or its affiliates, identify the third party making such Acquisition Proposal, indication or request, and
the material terms and conditions thereof. Ruby Tuesday will, to the extent permitted by any agreements with such third party or its affiliates, keep
Holding fully informed, on a current basis, of the status and material details of any such Acquisition Proposal, indication or request, including any
amendments to the price and other material terms thereof. Prior to the receipt of stockholder approval, Ruby Tuesday will provide Holding with at least
two business days prior notice of any meeting of the Ruby Tuesday board (or such lesser notice as is provided to the members of the Ruby Tuesday
board) at which the Ruby Tuesday board is reasonably expected to consider any Acquisition Proposal.

For purposes of the merger agreement, an “Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement” means a confidentiality agreement with a third party that
contains provisions that are no less favorable in the aggregate to Ruby Tuesday than those contained in the confidentiality agreement between Ruby
Tuesday and NRD. In addition, such

Table of Contents

confidentiality agreements may not prohibit or otherwise restrict Ruby Tuesday from (i) disclosing to Holding the identity of such third party or the
material terms and conditions of any Acquisition Proposal from such third party or (ii) keeping Holding fully informed of the status and material details
of any such Acquisition Proposal, including any amendments to the price and other material terms thereof.

For purposes of the merger agreement, “Acquisition Proposal” means any inquiry, offer or proposal or other indication of interest in making a
proposal or offer, relating to (i) any acquisition or purchase, direct or indirect, of 15% or more of the consolidated assets of Ruby Tuesday and its
subsidiaries, or to which 15% or more of Ruby Tuesday’s net revenue or income on a consolidated basis are attributable, or 15% or more of any class of
equity or voting securities of Ruby Tuesday or any of its subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute 15% or more of the
consolidated assets of Ruby Tuesday, (ii) any tender offer (including a self-tender offer) or exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in a third
party beneficially owning 15% or more of any class of equity or voting securities of Ruby Tuesday or any of its subsidiaries whose assets, individually
or in the aggregate, constitute 15% or more of the consolidated assets of Ruby Tuesday, (iii) a merger, consolidation, share exchange, business
combination, sale of substantially all the assets, reorganization, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or other similar transaction involving Ruby
Tuesday or any of its subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute 15% or more of the consolidated assets of Ruby Tuesday, or
to which 15% or more of Ruby Tuesday’s net revenue or income on a consolidated basis are attributable, or (iv) any combination of the foregoing.

For purposes of the merger agreement, “Superior Proposal” means a bona fide, unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal (including bona fide
unsolicited Acquisition Proposals from third parties that may have otherwise submitted proposals prior to the date of the merger agreement) for at least a
majority of the outstanding shares of Ruby Tuesday common stock or all or substantially all of the consolidated assets of Ruby Tuesday and its
subsidiaries on terms that the Ruby Tuesday board determines in good faith by a majority vote, after considering the advice of a financial advisor of
nationally recognized reputation and outside legal counsel and taking into account all the terms and conditions of the Acquisition Proposal, including the
identity of the third party, any break-up fees, expense reimbursement provisions, conditions to consummation, likelihood of satisfying all such
conditions, the other terms and conditions of the Acquisition Proposal, any terms of the merger agreement proposed by Holding during the Proposal
Period (as defined below), the availability and terms of any financing, and the estimated time period necessary prior to consummation of the transactions
contemplated by such Acquisition Proposal, are more favorable to Ruby Tuesday’s stockholders than as provided under the merger agreement.

Changes in Board Recommendation

Except as provided in the paragraphs below, under the terms of the merger agreement, Ruby Tuesday has agreed not to make an Adverse
Recommendation Change.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to approval and adoption by Ruby Tuesday stockholders of the merger agreement, the Ruby Tuesday board
may effect an Adverse Recommendation Change if:
 

 •  Ruby Tuesday has received a Superior Proposal; or
 

 
•  In response to an Intervening Event (as defined below), the Ruby Tuesday board determines in good faith, after consultation with outside

legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties.

At least five business days before making an Adverse Recommendation Change or entering into (or causing a subsidiary to enter into) any
Alternative Acquisition Agreement, or taking any other action with respect to a Superior Proposal (the “Proposal Period”), Ruby Tuesday is required to,
and is required to cause its Representatives to, negotiate with Holding in good faith to make adjustments in the terms and conditions of the merger
agreement so that such Acquisition Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal, if Holding, in its discretion, proposes to make such adjustments.

Table of Contents

For purposes of the merger agreement, “Intervening Event” means a material fact, event, change or development in circumstances that (i) arises
after the date of the merger agreement and was not known (or if known, the consequences or magnitude of which were not known or reasonably
foreseeable) to the Ruby Tuesday board as of or prior to the date of the merger agreement and (ii)  involves or relates to the financing of the merger and
not to an Acquisition Proposal.

Required Efforts to Consummate the Merger

Subject to certain exceptions described below and the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, Ruby Tuesday and Holding have agreed to
use their reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under
any applicable laws to consummate, as soon as reasonably practicable, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement,
including (i) preparing and filing as promptly as practicable with any governmental authority or other third party all documentation to effect all
necessary filings, notices, petitions, statements, registrations, submissions of information, applications and other documents; (ii) obtaining and
maintaining all approvals, consents, registrations, permits, authorizations, waivers, and other confirmations required to be obtained from any
governmental entity or other third party that are necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement;
(iii) the execution and delivery of any additional instruments necessary to consummate the merger and to fully carry out the purposes of the merger
agreement; and (iv) providing such other assistance as Holding may deem reasonably necessary in connection with the anticipated transition of Ruby
Tuesday and its subsidiaries.

From the signing of the merger agreement until the effective time, Holding has agreed not to take any action that is intended to, or would
reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, prevent, materially delay or materially impede the ability of Holding and Merger Subsidiary
to consummate the merger or the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the financing.

Litigation Related to the Merger

Ruby Tuesday has agreed that it will not initiate, settle, or offer or propose to settle any stockholder litigation or dispute against Ruby Tuesday or
any of its officers or directors or any litigation, arbitration, proceeding or dispute that relates to the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement
without the prior written consent of Holding (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

Ruby Tuesday will give Holding prompt notice of any demands received by Ruby Tuesday for appraisal of shares, any waiver or withdrawal of
such demands, and any other notice delivered to Ruby Tuesday prior to the effective time of the merger that relates to such demand, and Holding will
have the right to participate in, and Ruby Tuesday is required to consult Holding in connection with, all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
such demands.

Employee Matters

For 12 months following the closing of the merger, Holding will provide each Ruby Tuesday employee who continues to be employed by Holding
with salary and incentive opportunities (including any value attributable to equity-based compensation) that are no less favorable than those that such
employee received immediately prior to the closing of the merger. This includes (i) cash incentive opportunities that are no less than such employee’s
2016 cash incentive opportunity and (ii) equity-based compensation with a value based on the value of the actual equity award granted in 2016 by Ruby
Tuesday. Additionally, for 12 months following the closing of the merger, employees who remain employed with Holding will remain entitled to receive
severance benefits that are no less favorable than those provided to such employee (i) as disclosed in connection with the merger or (ii) established or
amended after the closing of the merger in connection with the merger agreement. Holding will also provide each employee with employee benefits that
are substantially comparable in the aggregate to those provided to

Table of Contents

such employee by Ruby Tuesday immediately prior to the closing of the merger, until the end of each applicable plan year of each applicable employee
benefit plan. In addition, each employee who continues to be employed by Holding will be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time,
in any and all Holding employee benefit plans to the extent coverage under any such plan replaces coverage under a comparable Ruby Tuesday plan.

With respect to Holding employee benefit plans (except benefit accrual under any defined benefit plan or retiree welfare benefit plan or vesting
under any equity compensation plan), service with Ruby Tuesday (or a predecessor employer of Ruby Tuesday) by each employee who continues to be
employed by Holding will generally be treated as service with Holding.

Annual cash bonuses for the fiscal year in which the closing of the merger occurs will be paid out based on the actual achievement of the
applicable performance metrics over the applicable performance period having occurred as of such time, prorated for the number of days which have
elapsed in the performance period. In any case, annual cash bonuses will be treated no less favorably than they would have been treated pursuant to the
terms of the applicable bonus plan or the change in control severance plan.

For clarity, the merger agreement will not cause any employee to be treated less favorably than he or she would have been treated pursuant to the
terms of the change in control severance plan.

Directors’ and Officers’ Indemnification and Insurance

For six years after the effective time of the merger, Holding has agreed to cause the surviving corporation to indemnify and hold harmless
Indemnified Persons, in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the effective time of the merger to the fullest extent permitted by the GBCC
or any other applicable law or provided under Ruby Tuesday’s most recent articles of incorporation and bylaws.

For six years after the effective time of the merger, Holding has agreed to cause the surviving corporation to maintain in effect the provisions in its
articles of incorporation and bylaws (or in such documents of any successor to the business of the surviving corporation) regarding elimination of
liability of directors, indemnification of officers and directors and advances of expenses that are no less advantageous to the intended beneficiaries than
the corresponding provisions in existence on the date of the merger agreement.

Prior to the effective time of the merger, Ruby Tuesday will or, if Ruby Tuesday is unable to, Holding will and will cause the surviving
corporation as of the effective time of the merger to, obtain and fully pay the premium for the non-cancellable extension of the directors’ and officers’
liability coverage of Ruby Tuesday’s existing directors’ and officers’ insurance policies and Ruby Tuesday’s existing fiduciary liability insurance
policies (collectively, “D&O Insurance”), in each case for a claims reporting or discovery period of at least six years from and after the effective time of
the merger with respect to any claim related to any period of time at or prior to the effective time of the merger from an insurance carrier with the same
or better credit rating as Ruby Tuesday’s current insurance carrier with respect to D&O Insurance with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of
liability that are no less favorable than the coverage provided under Ruby Tuesday’s existing policies with respect to any actual or alleged error,
misstatement, misleading statement, act, omission, neglect, breach of duty or any matter claimed against a director or officer of Ruby Tuesday or any of
its subsidiaries by reason of him or her serving in such capacity that existed or occurred at or prior to the effective time of the merger (including in
connection with the merger agreement or the transactions or actions contemplated by the merger agreement).

If Ruby Tuesday or the surviving corporation for any reason fail to obtain such “tail” insurance policies as of the effective time, the surviving
corporation agrees to continue to maintain in effect, for a period of at least six years from and after the effective time of the merger, the D&O Insurance
in place as of the date of the merger agreement with Ruby Tuesday’s current insurance carrier or with an insurance carrier with the same or better credit
rating as Ruby Tuesday’s current insurance carrier with respect to D&O Insurance with terms, conditions,

retentions and limits of liability that are no less favorable than the coverage provided under Ruby Tuesday’s existing policies as of the date of the merger
agreement, or the surviving corporation agrees to purchase from Ruby Tuesday’s current insurance carrier or from an insurance carrier with the same or
better credit rating as Ruby Tuesday’s current insurance carrier with respect to D&O Insurance comparable D&O Insurance for such six-year period
with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are no less favorable than as provided in Ruby Tuesday’s existing policies as of the date of
the merger agreement. In no event will Holding or the surviving corporation be required to expend for policies pursuant to the foregoing sentence an
annual premium amount in excess of 200% of the amount Ruby Tuesday paid for such policies for the period beginning on March 9, 2017 and ending on
March 9, 2018.

Takeover Provisions

If any “control share acquisition,” “fair price,” “moratorium,” or other anti-takeover applicable law becomes or is deemed to be applicable to
Ruby Tuesday, the merger, or any other transaction contemplated by the merger agreement, then Ruby Tuesday and the Ruby Tuesday board agree to
grant such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by the merger agreement and otherwise act to render such applicable law inapplicable to the
foregoing.

Financing of the Merger

Completion of the merger is not subject to a financing condition.

In the merger agreement, Holding represented that the Financing Commitments include sufficient available proceeds to consummate the merger
without any requirements or closing conditions with respect to Ruby Tuesday’s real property not otherwise expressly provided as closing conditions in
Article 9 of the merger agreement, unless the aggregate value (based on the values specified in the applicable Debt Financing Commitment) of the
owned real property affected by Real Property Deficiencies (as defined in the merger agreement) exceeds ten percent (10%) of the total value of all
owned real property specified in the Debt Financing Commitments.

Furthermore, if any portion of the financing under the Debt Financing Commitments becomes or could become unavailable in the manner or from
the sources contemplated in the Debt Financing Commitments, Holding has agreed to immediately notify Ruby Tuesday, and Holding and Merger
Subsidiary will use their reasonable best efforts to arrange to obtain any such portion from alternative sources, on terms, taken as a whole, that are no
more adverse to Holding and Ruby Tuesday (including after giving effect to the flex provisions) as promptly as practicable.

In the merger agreement, Ruby Tuesday has agreed to, and to cause its subsidiaries and their respective Representatives to, cooperate with the
arrangement of the financing as may be reasonably requested by Holding; provided that such requested cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with
the ongoing operations of Ruby Tuesday or any of its subsidiaries.

Ruby Tuesday and its subsidiaries are not required to pay any commitment or other similar fees or incur any other liability or obligation in
connection with the Financing Commitments, and Holding will promptly reimburse Ruby Tuesday and its subsidiaries’ documented third-party
expenses and costs incurred in connection with the foregoing other than: (i) those costs incurred by Ruby Tuesday for the information, surveys,
commitments or reports already delivered into the data room or (ii) costs associated with correcting real property title defects, releasing liens or curing
any real property deficiency, in each case to the extent such correction, release or cure is not effective prior to the effective time of the merger.

For more information on Holding’s financing arrangements for the merger, see the section entitled “The Merger (Proposal 1)—Financing of the
Merger” beginning on page 61 of this proxy statement.

and conditions set forth in the Limited Guarantee. The foregoing summary of the Limited Guarantee is qualified in its entirety by reference to the
complete text of the Limited Guarantee, a copy of which have been filed on Ruby Tuesday’s Current Report on Form 8-K dated October 16, 2017, and
which is incorporated by reference into this proxy statement.

Remedies; Maximum Liability

The merger agreement provides that in no event will either Ruby Tuesday or Holding be required to pay its termination fee more than once.

The merger agreement also provides that, upon any termination of the merger agreement under circumstances where the termination fee is payable
by either party and is paid in full, the other party is precluded from any other remedy against such party, and neither the other party nor any of its
respective former, current and future direct or indirect equity holders, controlling persons, stockholders, directors, officers, employees, agents, affiliates,
members, managers, general or limited partners or assignees will have any further liability or obligation arising out of the merger agreement or the
transactions contemplated thereby.

Specific Performance

The merger agreement provides that the parties will be entitled to an injunction to prevent breaches of the merger agreement and to specifically
enforce the performance of the terms and provisions of the merger agreement.

Fees and Expenses

Except as set forth in the sections “The Merger (Proposal 1)—Financing of the Merger,” “The Merger Agreement—Termination Fee Payable by
Ruby Tuesday” and “The Merger Agreement—Termination Fee Payable by Holding” beginning on pages 61, 79 and 79, respectively, of this proxy
statement, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with the merger agreement will be paid by the party incurring such cost or expense.

Amendments and Waivers

At any time prior to the effective time of the merger, the parties may amend or waive any provision of the merger agreement. Any such
amendment must be in writing and signed by each party to the merger agreement and any such waiver must be in writing and signed by each party
against whom the waiver is to be effective. After the Ruby Tuesday stockholders have approved and adopted the merger agreement, there will be no
amendment or waiver that would require the further approval of the Ruby Tuesday stockholders under GBCC without such approval having first been
obtained.

Governing Law and Venue, Waiver of Jury Trial

The parties agreed that the merger agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without
regard to the conflicts of law rules of such state, except that the merger and the internal corporate matters of Ruby Tuesday will be governed by and
construed in accordance with the GBCC, to the extent applicable.

The parties to the merger agreement have agreed that any suit, action or proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any matter
arising out of or in connection with, the merger agreement or the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement (whether brought by any party or
any of its affiliates or against any party or any of its affiliates) will be brought in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York or

therefrom) in any such suit, action or proceeding and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection that it may have to the
laying of the venue of any such suit, action or proceeding in any such court or that any such suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court has
been brought in an inconvenient forum. Process in any such suit, action or proceeding may be served on any party anywhere in the world, whether
within or without the jurisdiction of any such court.

Each party further irrevocably waived any and all right to trial by jury in any legal proceeding arising out of or related to the merger agreement or
the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

Table of Contents

DISSENTERS’ RIGHTS OF STOCKHOLDERS

Under the GBCC, record holders of Ruby Tuesday common stock will be entitled to dissent from the merger and obtain payment in cash equal to
the fair value of their shares of Ruby Tuesday common stock. Set forth below is a summary of the procedures that must be followed by the holders of
Ruby Tuesday common stock in order to exercise their dissenters’ rights of appraisal. This summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the text of
Article 13 of the GBCC, a copy of which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex C. Stockholders who desire to exercise dissenters’ rights
should review carefully Article 13 of the GBCC and are urged to consult a legal advisor before electing or attempting to exercise these rights.

Any record holder of Ruby Tuesday common stock who does not vote in favor of the merger, and who fully complies with all of the provisions of
Article 13 of the GBCC (but not otherwise), will be entitled to demand and receive payment of the “fair value” for all (but not less than all) of his or her
shares of Ruby Tuesday common stock if the merger is consummated. If you hold your shares of Ruby Tuesday common stock through a broker, bank
or other nominee, you must contact your broker, bank or other nominee if you wish to exercise dissenters’ rights.

A stockholder of Ruby Tuesday who does not vote in favor of the merger and desires to receive payment of the “fair value” of his or her Ruby
Tuesday common stock: (i) must deliver to Ruby Tuesday, prior to the time the stockholder vote on the merger is taken, a written notice of such
stockholder’s intent to demand payment for those shares registered in the dissenting stockholder’s name if the merger is completed; and (ii) must not
vote his or her shares in favor of the approval of the merger agreement.

A failure to vote against the merger will not constitute a waiver of dissenters’ rights. A vote against the approval and adoption of the merger
agreement alone will not constitute the separate written notice and demand for payment referred to immediately above. Dissenting stockholders must
separately comply with the above conditions.

Any notice required to be given should be sent to Ruby Tuesday, Inc., 333 East Broadway Avenue, Maryville, Tennessee 37804, Attention:
Corporate Secretary.

If the merger agreement is approved, Ruby Tuesday will mail, no later than ten days after the effective time of the merger, to each stockholder
who has timely submitted a written notice of intent to dissent, written notice addressed to the stockholder at such address as the stockholder has
furnished Ruby Tuesday in writing or, if none, at the stockholder’s address as it appears on the records of Ruby Tuesday. The dissenters’ notice will:
(i) state where the dissenting stockholder must send a payment demand, and where and when the certificates for the dissenting stockholder’s shares, if
any, are to be deposited; (ii) inform holders of uncertificated shares to what extent transfer of the shares will be restricted after the payment demand is
received; (iii) set a date by which Ruby Tuesday must receive the stockholder’s payment demand (which date may not be fewer than 30 nor more than
60 days after the date the dissenters’ notice is delivered); and (iv) be accompanied by a copy of Article 13 of the GBCC. Within ten days after the later
of the effective time of the merger, or the date on which Ruby Tuesday receives a payment demand, Ruby Tuesday will send a written offer to each
stockholder who complied with the provisions set forth in the dissenters’ notice to pay each such stockholder an amount that Ruby Tuesday estimates to
be the fair value of those shares, plus accrued interest. The offer of payment will be accompanied by: (a) Ruby Tuesday’s balance sheet as of the end of a
fiscal year ending not more than 16 months before the date of payment, an income statement for that year, a statement of changes in stockholder’s equity
for that year, and the latest available interim statements, if any; (b) a statement of Ruby Tuesday’s estimate of the fair value of the shares; (c) an
explanation of how any interest was calculated; (d) a statement of the dissenting stockholder’s right to demand payment of a different amount under
Section 14-2-1327 of the GBCC; and (e) a copy of Article 13 of the GBCC.

A dissenting stockholder choosing to accept Ruby Tuesday’s offer of payment must do so by written notice to Ruby Tuesday within 30 days after
receipt of Ruby Tuesday’s offer of payment. A dissenting stockholder not responding to that offer within the 30-day period will be deemed to have
accepted the offer of payment. Ruby Tuesday must make payment to each stockholder who accepts the offer of payment within 60 days after the

Table of Contents

making of the offer of payment, or the effective date of the merger, whichever is later. Upon payment, the dissenting stockholder will cease to have any
interest in his or her shares of Ruby Tuesday common stock.

If a dissenting stockholder does not accept, within 30 days after Ruby Tuesday’s offer, the estimate of fair value in payment for such shares and
interest due thereon and demands payment of some other estimate of the fair value of Ruby Tuesday shares and interest due thereon, then Ruby Tuesday,
within 60 days after receiving the payment demand of a different amount from a dissenting stockholder, must commence a proceeding in the superior
court of the county where its registered office is located to determine the fair value of his or her shares of Ruby Tuesday common stock and accrued
interest. If Ruby Tuesday does not commence the proceedings within the 60-day period, then it must pay each dissenter whose demand remains
unsettled the amount demanded by the dissenting stockholder.

In the event of a court proceeding, the court will determine all costs of the proceeding, including the reasonable compensation and expenses of
appraisers appointed by the court, but not including fees and expenses of attorneys and experts for the respective parties. The court will assess these
costs against Ruby Tuesday, except that the court may assess these costs against all or some of the dissenters in amounts the court finds equitable to the
extent the court finds the dissenters acted arbitrarily, vexatiously or not in good faith in demanding payment under the dissenters’ provisions. The court
may also assess the fees and expenses of attorneys and experts for the respective parties in amounts the court finds equitable: (i) against Ruby Tuesday
and in favor of any or all dissenters if the court finds Ruby Tuesday did not substantially comply with the dissenters’ rights provisions of the GBCC; or
(ii) against Ruby Tuesday or a dissenter in favor of any other party if the court finds that the party against whom fees and expenses are assessed acted
arbitrarily, vexatiously or not in good faith with respect to the rights provided by the dissenters’ rights provisions of the GBCC. If the court finds that the
services of attorneys for any dissenter were of substantial benefit to other dissenters similarly situated and that the fees for those services should not be
assessed against Ruby Tuesday, the court may award these attorneys reasonable fees to be paid out of the amounts awarded the dissenters who were
benefited.

Stockholders should be aware that cash paid to dissenting stockholders in satisfaction of the fair value of their shares of Ruby Tuesday common
stock will result in the recognition of any gain or loss realized for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

Failure by a record holder of Ruby Tuesday common stock to follow the steps required by the GBCC for perfecting dissenters’ rights may
result in the loss of such rights. In view of the complexity of these provisions and the requirement that they be strictly complied with, if you hold
Ruby Tuesday common stock and are considering dissenting from the approval of the merger agreement and exercising your dissenters’ rights
under the GBCC, you should consult your legal advisors.

ADVISORY VOTE ON NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICER MERGER-RELATED COMPENSATION
ARRANGEMENTS (PROPOSAL 2)

As required by Section 14A of the Exchange Act and the applicable SEC rules issued thereunder, Ruby Tuesday is required to submit a proposal
to Ruby Tuesday stockholders for a non-binding, advisory vote to approve the payment by Ruby Tuesday of certain compensation that will or may be
paid by Ruby Tuesday to its named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the merger. This proposal, commonly known as
“say-on-golden parachutes,” and which we refer to as the named executive officer merger-related compensation proposal, gives Ruby Tuesday
stockholders the opportunity to vote, on a non-binding, advisory basis, on the named executive officer merger-related compensation. This compensation
is summarized in the table under “The Merger (Proposal 1)—Interests of Ruby Tuesday’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—Golden
Parachute Compensation” beginning on page 58 of this proxy statement, including the footnotes to the table.

The Ruby Tuesday board encourages you to review carefully the named executive officer merger-related compensation information disclosed in
this proxy statement.

Table of Contents

The Ruby Tuesday board unanimously recommends that the stockholders of Ruby Tuesday approve the following resolution:

“RESOLVED, that the stockholders of Ruby Tuesday hereby approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the agreements or understandings with
and compensation to be paid or become payable by Ruby Tuesday to its named executive officers that are based on or otherwise relate to the merger as
disclosed pursuant to Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K in the Golden Parachute Compensation table, the footnotes to that table and the accompanying
narrative disclosure.”

The vote on the proposal to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the named executive officer merger-related compensation is a vote separate
and apart from the vote on the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement. Accordingly, you may vote to approve and adopt the merger
agreement and vote not to approve the named executive officer merger-related compensation proposal and vice versa. Because the vote on the named
executive officer merger-related compensation proposal is advisory only, it will not be binding on either Ruby Tuesday or Holding. Accordingly, if the
merger agreement is approved and adopted and the merger is completed, the compensation will be payable, subject only to the conditions applicable
thereto, regardless of the outcome of the non-binding, advisory vote of Ruby Tuesday stockholders.

The above resolution approving the named executive officer merger-related compensation on an advisory basis will require that the number of
votes cast in favor of the proposal exceed the number of votes opposing the proposal measured by the stock power present in person or represented by
proxy at the special meeting (provided a quorum is present in person or represented by proxy).

The Ruby Tuesday board unanimously recommends a vote “FOR” the proposal to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, certain
compensation that will or may be paid by Ruby Tuesday to its named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the merger.

VOTE ON ADJOURNMENT (PROPOSAL 3)

Ruby Tuesday stockholders are being asked to approve a proposal to, as permitted under the terms of the merger agreement, adjourn the special
meeting for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies in favor of the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement if there are not sufficient
votes at the time of the special meeting to approve and adopt the merger agreement. If this proposal to adjourn the special meeting is approved, the
special meeting could be adjourned by Ruby Tuesday as permitted under the terms of the merger agreement to any date. In addition, Ruby Tuesday, as
permitted under the terms of the merger agreement, could postpone the special meeting before it commences, if there are not sufficient votes at the time
of the special meeting to approve and adopt the merger agreement. If the special meeting is adjourned for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies,
stockholders who have already submitted their proxies will be able to revoke them at any time prior to their use. If you return a proxy and do not
indicate how you wish to vote on any proposal, your shares will be voted in favor of such proposal. Ruby Tuesday does not intend to call a vote on this
proposal if the merger proposal has been approved at a special meeting.

The special meeting may be adjourned to another place, date or time, if the number of votes cast in favor of the proposal exceed the number of
votes opposing the proposal measured by the stock power present in person or represented by proxy at the special meeting (whether or not a quorum is
present). The chairman of the meeting or the Ruby Tuesday board may also adjourn the special meeting to another date, place or time.

The Ruby Tuesday board unanimously recommends a vote “FOR” the proposal to adjourn the special meeting, including if necessary to
solicit additional proxies in favor of the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement, if there are not sufficient votes at the time of such
adjournment to approve and adopt the merger agreement.

MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER

The following are the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger to “U.S. holders” and “non-U.S. holders” (in each case, as
defined below) of Ruby Tuesday common stock. This discussion applies only to holders that hold their Ruby Tuesday common stock as capital assets
within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment). This discussion does not describe all of the tax consequences
that may be relevant to a holder in light of the holder’s particular circumstances or to holders subject to special rules, such as:
 

 •  Dealers or traders subject to a mark-to-market method of tax accounting with respect to Ruby Tuesday common stock;
 

 
•  Persons holding Ruby Tuesday common stock as part of a straddle, hedging transaction, conversion transaction, integrated transaction or

constructive sale transaction;
 

 •  U.S. holders whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar;
 

 •  Partnerships or other entities classified as partnerships or pass through entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes;
 

 •  Persons who acquired Ruby Tuesday common stock through the exercise of employee stock options or otherwise as compensation;
 

 •  Certain financial institutions and insurance companies;
 

 •  Regulated investment companies;
 

 •  Real estate investment trusts;
 

 •  Certain former citizens or residents of the United States;
 

 •  Holders of Ruby Tuesday common stock who exercise dissenters’ rights;
 

 •  Tax-exempt entities, including an “individual retirement account” or “Roth IRA;” or
 

 •  Persons subject to the United States alternative minimum tax.

If an entity that is classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds Ruby Tuesday common stock, the U.S. federal income tax
treatment of a partner will generally depend on the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. Partnerships holding Ruby Tuesday
common stock and partners in such partnerships should consult their tax advisors as to the particular U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger
to them.

This discussion is based on the Code, administrative pronouncements, judicial decisions and final and temporary Treasury regulations, all as of the
date hereof, any of which is subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. Tax considerations under state, local and foreign laws are not addressed.

U.S. Holders

For purposes of this discussion, the term “U.S. holder” means a beneficial owner of Ruby Tuesday common stock that is:
 

 •  A citizen or resident of the United States;
 

 
•  A corporation, or other entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, created or organized in or under the laws of the

United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia;
 

 •  An estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or

•  A trust (A) if a U.S. court is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more U.S. persons have the

authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust, or (B) that has elected to be treated as a U.S. person under applicable U.S. Treasury
regulations.

The exchange of Ruby Tuesday common stock for cash in the merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In
general, a U.S. holder whose shares of Ruby Tuesday common stock are converted into the right to receive cash in the merger will recognize capital gain
or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received with respect to such
shares and the U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in such shares. A U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis generally will equal the price the U.S. holder paid for
such shares. Gain or loss will be determined separately for each block of shares of Ruby Tuesday common stock (i.e., shares of Ruby Tuesday common
stock acquired at the same cost in a single transaction). Such gain or loss generally will be treated as long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. holder’s
holding period in the shares of Ruby Tuesday common stock exceeds one year at the time of the completion of the merger. Long-term capital gains of
non-corporate U.S. holders generally are subject to U.S. federal income tax at preferential rates. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to
limitations. Capital gains recognized by individuals, trusts and estates also may be subject to a 3.8% federal Medicare contribution tax.

Non-U.S. Holders

A “non-U.S. holder” is a beneficial owner of Ruby Tuesday common stock that is not a U.S. holder or a partnership. Payments made to a non-U.S.
holder in exchange for shares of Ruby Tuesday common stock pursuant to the merger generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax unless:
 

 
•  The gain, if any, on such shares is effectively connected with a trade or business of the non-U.S. holder in the United States (or, if required

by an applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to the non-U.S. holder’s permanent establishment or fixed base in the United States);
 

 
•  The non-U.S. holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of the exchange of shares

of Ruby Tuesday common stock for cash pursuant to the merger and certain other conditions are met; or
 

 

•  The non-U.S. holder owned, directly or under certain constructive ownership rules of the Code, more than 5% of the Ruby Tuesday common
stock at any time during the five-year period preceding the merger, and Ruby Tuesday is or has been a “United States real property holding
corporation” for U.S. federal income tax purposes at any time during the shorter of the five-year period preceding the merger or the period
that the non-U.S. holder held Ruby Tuesday common stock.

A non-U.S. holder described in the first bullet point immediately above will be subject to regular U.S. federal income tax on any gain realized as if
the non-U.S. holder were a U.S. holder, subject to an applicable income tax treaty providing otherwise. If such non-U.S. holder is a foreign corporation,
it may also be subject to a branch profits tax equal to 30% of its effectively connected earnings and profits (or a lower treaty rate). A non-U.S. holder
described in the second bullet point immediately above will be subject to tax at a rate of 30% (or a lower treaty rate) on any gain realized, which may be
offset by certain U.S.-source capital losses recognized in the same taxable year, even though the individual is not considered a resident of the United
States.

Ruby Tuesday believes that it is likely that it is, or may have been in the past five years, a “United States real property holding corporation” for
U.S. federal income tax purposes. Even if Ruby Tuesday is or has been treated as a United States real property holding corporation, a non-U.S. holder
would be subject to U.S. federal income tax on payments made to the non-U.S. holder in exchange for shares of Ruby Tuesday common stock pursuant
to the merger only if the non-U.S. holder actually or constructively owned, during the shorter of its holding period for its Ruby Tuesday common stock
or the five-year period preceding the merger, more than 5% of Ruby Tuesday common stock. If Ruby Tuesday is or has been treated as a United States
real property holding corporation, a non-U.S. holder who owns more than 5% of Ruby Tuesday common stock either actually or

constructively during the shorter of its holding period for its Ruby Tuesday common stock or the five-year period preceding the merger will be subject to
regular U.S. federal income tax on any gain realized as if the non-U.S. holder were a U.S. holder, subject to an applicable income tax treaty providing
otherwise. If such non-U.S. holder is a foreign corporation, it may also be subject to a branch profits tax equal to 30% of its effectively connected
earnings and profits (or a lower treaty rate).

Information Reporting and Backup Withholding

Payments made in exchange for shares of Ruby Tuesday common stock generally will be subject to information reporting unless the holder is an
“exempt recipient” and may also be subject to backup withholding at a rate of 28%. To avoid backup withholding, U.S. holders that do not otherwise
establish an exemption should complete and return Internal Revenue Service Form W-9, certifying that such U.S. holder is a U.S. person, the taxpayer
identification number provided is correct and such U.S. holder is not subject to backup withholding. A non-U.S. holder that provides the applicable
withholding agent with an Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN, W-8BEN-E or W-8ECI, as appropriate, will generally establish an exemption from
backup withholding.

Amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules are not additional taxes and may be refunded or credited against a holder’s U.S. federal
income tax liability, provided the relevant information is timely furnished to the Internal Revenue Service.

You are urged to consult your tax advisor with respect to the application of U.S. federal income tax laws to your particular circumstances
as well as any tax consequences arising under the U.S. federal estate or gift tax rules, or under the laws of any state, local or foreign tax laws.

FUTURE RUBY TUESDAY STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS

As of the date of this proxy statement, the 2017 annual meeting of stockholders, previously scheduled for January 22, 2018, has been indefinitely
postponed due to the pendency of the special meeting. If the merger is completed, Ruby Tuesday will not hold the 2017 annual meeting of stockholders
and there will be no public participation in any future meetings of Ruby Tuesday’s stockholders because, following the merger, the Ruby Tuesday
common stock will be delisted from the NYSE and will be deregistered under the Exchange Act, and Ruby Tuesday will no longer be a publicly-held
company. However, if the merger is not completed or if Ruby Tuesday is otherwise required to do so under applicable law, Ruby Tuesday will take such
further action as it deems necessary or appropriate to call and convene the 2017 annual meeting of stockholders, and the deadlines and requirements
described below will apply to the submission of stockholder proposals and director nominations to be considered at such meeting.

Ruby Tuesday’s articles of incorporation and bylaws require stockholders to give Ruby Tuesday advance notice of any stockholder proposal or
director nomination for submission to stockholder vote at any meeting of stockholders. The articles of incorporation and bylaws set forth the information
that must be included in a valid notice on these matters. Notice of a stockholder proposal or director nomination to be considered at the 2017 annual
meeting of stockholders must be received at our principal executive office no later than 90 days in advance of the meeting. In addition, any stockholder
proposal submitted for inclusion in Ruby Tuesday’s proxy statement for the 2017 annual meeting of stockholders pursuant to Rule 14a-8 of the
Exchange Act must be received at our principal executive office a reasonable time before Ruby Tuesday begins to print and mail the proxy statement for
the 2017 annual meeting of stockholders.

MULTIPLE STOCKHOLDERS SHARING ONE ADDRESS

The SEC has adopted rules that permit companies and intermediaries, such as brokers, to satisfy the delivery requirements for proxy statements
and annual reports with respect to two or more stockholders sharing the same

address by delivering a single annual report or proxy statement, as applicable, addressed to those stockholders. This process, which is commonly
referred to as “householding,” potentially provides extra convenience for stockholders and cost savings for companies.

Ruby Tuesday and some brokers may be householding our proxy materials by delivering proxy materials to multiple stockholders who request a
copy and share an address, unless contrary instructions have been received from the affected stockholders. Once you have received notice from your
broker or us that they or we will be householding materials to your address, householding will continue until you are notified otherwise or until you
revoke your consent. If at any time you no longer wish to participate in householding and would prefer to receive a separate proxy statement and annual
report, please notify your broker if your shares are held in a brokerage account or Ruby Tuesday if you are a stockholder of record. You can notify us by
sending a written request to Ruby Tuesday, Inc., 333 East Broadway Avenue, Maryville, Tennessee 37804, Attn: Corporate Secretary, or calling (865)
379-5700. Stockholders who share a single address, but receive multiple copies of the proxy statement, may request that in the future they receive a
single copy by notifying Ruby Tuesday at the telephone and address set forth in the prior sentence. In addition, Ruby Tuesday will promptly deliver,
upon written or oral request to the address or telephone number above, a separate copy of the proxy statement to a stockholder at a shared address to
which a single copy of the documents was delivered pursuant to a prior request.

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this “Agreement”) dated as of October 16, 2017 among Ruby Tuesday, Inc., a Georgia corporation
(the “Company”), RTI Holding Company, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Parent”), and RTI Merger Sub, LLC, a Georgia limited
liability company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (“Merger Subsidiary”).

W I T N E S S E T H :

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company has approved and deemed it advisable that the shareholders of the Company approve and
adopt this Agreement pursuant to which, among other things, Parent would acquire the Company by means of a merger of Merger Subsidiary with and
into the Company on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement;

Section 2.02. Conversion of Shares. At the Effective Time:

(a) Except as otherwise provided in Section 2.02(b) or Section 2.04, each share of Company Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be converted into the right to receive $2.40 in cash, without interest (the “Merger Consideration”). As of the Effective Time, all such shares
of Company Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and shall thereafter represent
only the right to receive the Merger Consideration to be paid in accordance with Section 2.03, without interest.

(b) Each share of Company Stock held by the Company as treasury stock or owned by Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
canceled, and no payment shall be made with respect thereto.

(c) Each share of Company Stock held by any Subsidiary of either the Company or the Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into such number of shares of stock of the Surviving Corporation such that each such Subsidiary owns the same percentage of Surviving
Corporation immediately following the Effective Time as such Subsidiary owned in the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(d) Each membership interest in Merger Subsidiary issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted at the
Effective Time into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, of the Surviving Corporation. At the Effective
Time, new stock certificates of the Surviving Corporation shall be issued and will be deemed for all purposes to represent all issued and outstanding
shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation into which membership interests in Merger Subsidiary were converted in accordance with the
immediately preceding sentence.

Section 2.03. Surrender and Payment. (a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint an agent reasonably acceptable to the Company (the
“Exchange Agent”) for the purpose of exchanging for the Merger Consideration (i) certificates representing shares of Company Stock (the
“Certificates”) or (ii) uncertificated shares of Company Stock (the “Uncertificated Shares”). At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall make
available to the Exchange Agent the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the Certificates and the Uncertificated Shares in accordance with this
Section 2.03 (other than shares to be cancelled and retired in accordance with Section 2.02(b) or any shares subject to proper exercise of dissenter’s
rights (if applicable), which will be treated as specified in Section 2.04). Promptly after the Effective Time (but not later than two Business Days
thereafter), Parent shall send, or shall cause the Exchange Agent to send, to each holder of shares of Company Stock at the Effective Time a letter of
transmittal and instructions (which shall specify that the delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the
Certificates or transfer of the Uncertificated Shares to the Exchange Agent) for use in such exchange.

(b) Each holder of shares of Company Stock that have been converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to
receive, upon (i) surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with a properly completed letter of transmittal, and such other documents as
may be reasonably requested by the Exchange Agent or the Surviving Corporation, or (ii) receipt of an “agent’s message” by the Exchange Agent (or
such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares, the
Merger Consideration in respect of the Company Stock represented by a Certificate or Uncertificated Share. Until so surrendered or transferred, as the
case may be, each such Certificate or Uncertificated Share shall represent after the Effective Time for all purposes only the right to receive such Merger
Consideration.

(c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the
transferred Uncertificated Share is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall
otherwise be in proper form for transfer or such Uncertificated Share shall be properly transferred and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall pay
to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other taxes required as a result of such payment to a Person other

than the registered holder of such Certificate or Uncertificated Share or establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or
is not payable. No interest will be paid or accrued on any Merger Consideration payable upon due surrender of Certificates or Uncertificated Shares.

(d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of Company Stock. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates
or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the Merger
Consideration provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth, in this Article 2.

(e) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 2.03(a) that remains unclaimed by the
holders of shares of Company Stock six months after the Effective Time shall be returned to Surviving Corporation, upon demand, and any such holder
who has not exchanged shares of Company Stock for the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Section 2.03 prior to that time shall thereafter
look only to Surviving Corporation for payment of the Merger Consideration in respect of such shares without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Parent shall not be liable to any holder of shares of Company Stock for any amounts paid to a public official pursuant to applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of Company Stock two years after the Effective
Time (or such earlier date, immediately prior to such time when the amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental
Authority) shall become, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, the property of the Surviving Corporation free and clear of any claims or interest of
any person previously entitled thereto.

(f) The Exchange Agent shall invest all cash held by it as Merger Consideration as reasonably directed by Parent; provided, however, that any
investment of such cash shall be limited to direct short-term obligations of, or short-term obligations fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, the
U.S. government. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to the Surviving Corporation pursuant to Section 2.03(e).

Section 2.04. Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding Section 2.02, shares of Company Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and
held by a holder who has not voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in writing and who is entitled to demand and has demanded and properly
exercised appraisal rights for such shares in accordance with the GBCC shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, but
instead shall only be entitled to such rights as are granted by the GBCC, unless such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses the right to
appraisal. If, after the Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses the right to appraisal, such shares shall be treated as if
they had been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 2.02, without interest
thereon, upon surrender or transfer, as the case may be, in accordance with Section 2.03. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any demands
received by the Company for appraisal of shares, any waiver or withdrawal of such demands, and any other notice delivered to the Company prior to the
Effective Time that relates to such demand, and Parent shall have the right to participate in, and the Company shall consult Parent in connection with, all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Except with the prior written consent of Parent, the Company shall not make any payment
with respect to, or offer to settle or settle, any such demands.

Section 2.05. Treatment of Equity and Performance-Based Cash Awards.

(a) Stock Options. At or immediately prior to the Effective Time, to the extent required or permitted by the applicable Employee Plan, each
outstanding option to purchase shares of Company Stock under any Employee Plan (a “Company Stock Option”), whether or not exercisable or vested,
shall be canceled, and the Company shall pay each such holder at or promptly after the Effective Time for each Company Stock Option an amount in
cash determined by multiplying (i) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration per share of Company Stock over the applicable exercise price of
such Company Stock Option, by (ii) the number of shares of Company

Stock such holder could have purchased (assuming full vesting of all Company Stock Options) had such holder exercised such Company Stock Option
in full immediately prior to the Effective Time. In the event that the per share exercise price of any Company Stock Option is equal to or greater than the
per share Merger Consideration, such Company Stock Option shall be cancelled, without any consideration being payable in respect thereof, and shall
have no further force or effect. The consideration paid to holders of Company Stock Options under this Section, shall constitute the Merger
Consideration for each share of Company Stock that was subject to a Company Stock Option, and the holder of such Company Stock Options shall
receive no other payment or consideration for such Company Stock Options, and such Company Stock Options shall be cancelled immediately upon
payment of such consideration.

(b) Restricted Stock Units, Including Phantom Stock Units. At or immediately prior to the Effective Time, to the extent required or permitted by
the applicable Employee Plan, each outstanding service-based restricted stock unit of the Company (each, a “Company RSU”) under any Employee
Plan, whether or not vested, and whether settleable in shares of Company Stock or cash, shall be canceled, and the Company shall pay each such holder
at or promptly after the Effective Time for each such Company RSU an amount in cash equal to the Merger Consideration per share of Company Stock.

(c) Performance-Based Stock Units. At or immediately prior to the Effective Time, to the extent required or permitted by the applicable Employee
Plan, each outstanding performance-based restricted stock unit of the Company (each, a “Company PSU”) under any Employee Plan, whether or not
vested, shall be canceled, and the Company shall pay each such holder at or promptly after the Effective Time for each Company PSU an amount in cash
determined by multiplying (i) the Merger Consideration per share of Company Stock by (ii) the number of Company PSUs such holder would have been
entitled to if such Company PSU award had vested at its “target” level.

(d) Restricted Stock. At or immediately prior to the Effective Time, to the extent required or permitted by the applicable Employee Plan, each

existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization and has all powers and all governmental licenses, authorizations, permits,
consents and approvals required to carry on its business as now conducted, except for those licenses, authorizations, permits, consents and approvals the

Section 5.02. Corporate Authorization. The execution, delivery and performance by Parent and Merger Subsidiary of this Agreement and the

Section 5.04. Non-contravention. The execution, delivery and performance by Parent and Merger Subsidiary of this Agreement and the
consummation by Parent and Merger Subsidiary of the transactions contemplated hereby do not and will not (i) contravene, conflict with, or result in

obligation or the loss of any benefit to which Parent or Merger Subsidiary is entitled under any provision of any material agreement or other instrument
binding upon Parent or Merger Subsidiary or (iv) result in the creation or imposition of any Lien on any asset of the Parent or Merger Subsidiary, with
only such exceptions, in the case of each of clauses (ii) through (iv), as would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a

Section 5.06. Finders’ Fees. Except for M&A Securities Group, Inc. (MAS), whose fees will be paid by Parent, there is no investment banker,
broker, finder or other intermediary that has been retained by or is authorized to act on behalf of Parent who might be entitled to any fee or commission
from the Company or any of its Affiliates upon consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 5.07. Financing. (a) Parent has delivered to the Company true and complete copies of (i) fully executed commitment letters or agreements
(the “Debt Commitment Letters”) pursuant to which the parties thereto have confirmed their respective commitments to provide Parent with sale and
leaseback and/or debt financing in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby (the “Debt Financing”), and (ii) a fully executed commitment
letter (the “Equity Commitment Letter” and together with the Debt Commitment Letters, the “Financing Commitment Letters”) from NRD Partners
II, L.P. confirming its commitments to provide Parent with equity financing, directly or indirectly, in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby (the “Equity Financing” and together with the Debt Financing, the “Financing”). There are no side letters or other agreements, contracts,
arrangements or understandings (written or oral) related to the funding of the Financing other than as expressly set forth in the Financing Commitment
Letters.

(b) The Equity Commitment Letter is in full force and effect and is a valid and binding obligation of Parent and the other parties thereto. Each of
the Debt Commitment Letters is in full force and effect and is a valid and binding obligation of Parent and, to the knowledge of Parent, the other parties
thereto. As of the date hereof, none of the Financing Commitment Letters have been amended or modified in any respect, and the respective
commitments contained therein have not been withdrawn, rescinded or otherwise modified in any respect. As of the date hereof, no event has occurred
which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a material default or material breach on the part of Parent or Merger Subsidiary
under any Financing Commitment Letter. There are no conditions precedent to the funding of the full amount of the Financings other than the conditions
precedent set forth in the Financing Commitment Letters, and Parent has no reason to believe that it will not be able to satisfy any term or condition of
closing of the Financing that is required to be satisfied as a condition of the Financing, or that the Financing will not be made available to Parent on the
date of the Closing. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Financing Commitment Letters, the aggregate proceeds of the Financings are in an
amount sufficient to consummate the Merger upon the terms contemplated by this Agreement, effect any other repayment or refinancing of debt
contemplated in connection with the consummation of the Merger and pay all related fees and expenses of Parent, Merger Subsidiary and their
respective Representatives pursuant to this Agreement. Parent has fully paid any and all commitment fees or other fees required by the Financing
Commitment Letters, which are required to be paid on or prior to the date hereof.

(c) The Debt Commitment Letters contemplate, in part, a sale leaseback related to the Real Property. Each financing source party to a Debt
Commitment Letter involving a sale leaseback or contemplating a security interest in Real Property (the “Real Property Financing Sources”) has
reviewed, and unconditionally approves and accepts, all information and documents referenced in the due diligence materials contained as of the date
hereof in the electronic data room established by the Company or its Representatives in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (the “Data Room”) with respect to the Real Property, including, without limitation, title reports and title exceptions, surveys and site plans,
zoning reports, appraisals, environmental and property condition reports and all other Real Property related documents and materials. Such Debt
Commitment Letters (x) do not impose any requirements or closing conditions with respect to the Leased Real Property not otherwise expressly
provided in Article 9 of this Agreement and (y) with respect to the Owned Real Property, do not impose any requirements or closing conditions not
otherwise expressly provided in Article 9 of this Agreement, except to the extent that (A) updated title commitments or surveys for the Owned Real
Property, if any, disclose new Liens that are not Permitted Liens and the final title policies issued with respect to such affected Owned Real Property
would not insure against or otherwise protect the Real Property Financing Sources from loss or liability arising from such new Liens, and (B) updated
environmental reports for the Owned Real Property, if any, disclose new violations of any Environmental Law involving the Owned Real Property,
which violations cause the loss of Debt Financing for any affected Owned Real Property (the event of (A) and/or

(B), a “Real Property Deficiency”); provided, however, that, collectively, the Financing Commitment Letters include sufficient available proceeds to
consummate the Merger without any requirements or closing conditions with respect to the Real Property not otherwise expressly provided in Article 9
of this Agreement, unless the aggregate value (based on the values specified in the applicable Debt Commitment Letters) of the Owned Real Property
affected by Real Property Deficiencies exceeds ten percent (10%) of the total value of all Owned Real Property specified in the Debt Commitment
Letters.

Section 5.08. Solvency. Assuming (i) the satisfaction of the conditions to Parent’s obligation to consummate the Merger, (ii) the accuracy of the
representations and warranties set forth in Article 4 of this Agreement (for this purpose, such representations and warranties shall be true and correct in
all material respects) and (iii) after giving effect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Financing, any alternative financing,
the payment of the aggregate Merger Consideration, any repayment or refinancing of debt contemplated in this Agreement or the Debt Commitment
Letters and the payment of all related fees and expenses, the Surviving Corporation on a consolidated basis will be Solvent as of the Effective Time and
immediately after the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. For purposes of this Agreement, “Solvent” when used with respect to any
Person, means that, as of any date of determination, (A) the amount of the “fair saleable value” of the assets of such Person will, as of such date, exceed
(1) the value of all “liabilities of such Person, including contingent and other liabilities,” as of such date, as such quoted terms are generally determined
in accordance with applicable federal laws governing determinations of the insolvency of debtors, and (2) the amount that will be required to pay the
probable liabilities of such Person on its existing debts (including contingent liabilities) as such debts become absolute and matured, (B) such Person
will not have, as of such date, an unreasonably small amount of capital for the operation of the businesses in which it is engaged or proposed to be
engaged following such date and (C) such Person will be able to pay its liabilities, including contingent and other liabilities, as they mature.

Section 5.09. Guarantee. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Parent has delivered to the Company the guarantee (the
“Guarantee”) executed by NRD Partners II, L.P. (the “Guarantor”). The Guarantee is in full force and effect and is a valid and binding obligation of
the Guarantor, enforceable against the Guarantor in accordance with its terms (subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer,
reorganization, moratorium and other laws affecting creditors’ rights generally and general principles of equity) and no event has occurred, which, with
or without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default on the part of the Guarantor under such Guarantee.

Section 5.10. Ownership of Company Stock. Parent, Guarantor and their respective affiliates (as such term is defined in Rule 13d-3 promulgated

Section 6.02. Company Shareholder Meeting. (a) The Company shall cause a meeting of its shareholders (the “Company Shareholder Meeting”)
to be duly called and held as soon as reasonably practicable for the purpose of voting on the approval of this Agreement and the Merger (and in
connection therewith, the Company will mail or otherwise make available the Proxy Statement to the holders of Company Stock in advance of such
meeting). Subject to Section 6.03, the Board of Directors of the Company shall (i) recommend approval of this Agreement, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby by the Company’s shareholders, (ii) use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Company Shareholder Approval and
(iii) otherwise comply with all Applicable Laws relating to such meeting.

(b) The Company shall not submit any other proposals for approval at the Company Shareholder Meeting without the prior written consent of

Shareholder Meeting has been called and noticed, the Company shall not postpone or adjourn the Company Shareholder Meeting without the consent of
Parent (other than: (A) in order to obtain a quorum of its stockholders; or (B) to allow reasonable additional time after the filing and mailing of any
supplemental or amended disclosures to the Proxy Statement for compliance with applicable legal requirements). If the Company’s Board of Directors
modifies or withdraws the Company Board Recommendation, it will not alter the obligation of the Company to submit the adoption of this Agreement
and the approval of the Merger to the holders of Company Stock at the Company Shareholder Meeting to consider and vote upon, unless this Agreement
shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms prior to the Company Shareholder Meeting.

Section 6.03. No Solicitation; Other Offers. (a) General Prohibitions. Prior to the satisfaction of Section 9.01(a), neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries shall, nor shall the Company or any of its Subsidiaries authorize or permit any of its or their respective directors, officers, employees,
investment bankers, attorneys, accountants and other advisors or representatives (collectively, “Representatives”) to, directly or indirectly, solicit,
initiate or knowingly take any action to facilitate or encourage the submission of any Acquisition Proposal, or subject to the remainder of this
Section 6.03, (i) enter into or participate in any discussions or negotiations with, furnish any information relating to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or afford access to the business, properties, assets, books or records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to, otherwise cooperate in
any way with, or knowingly assist, participate in, facilitate or encourage any effort by any Third Party that is seeking to make, or has made, an
Acquisition Proposal, (ii) fail to make, withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Parent the Company Board Recommendation (or recommend an
Acquisition Proposal or make any public statement inconsistent with the Company Board Recommendation) (any of the foregoing in this clause (ii), an
“Adverse Recommendation Change”), (iii) amend, modify or grant any waiver or release under, any standstill, confidentiality or similar agreement of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or (iv) enter into any agreement in principle, letter of intent, term sheet, merger agreement, acquisition
agreement, option agreement or other similar instrument relating to an Acquisition Proposal (an “Alternative Acquisition Agreement”).

(b) Exceptions to No-Shop Prohibitions.

Shareholder Approval, the Company or any of its Representatives has received a bona fide, unsolicited, written Acquisition Proposal (including
bona fide unsolicited Acquisition Proposals from Third Parties that may have otherwise submitted proposals prior to the date hereof), then (x) the
Company (directly or through its Representatives) may make inquiries solely for the purpose of clarifying such Acquisition Proposal, and only to
the extent necessary for such purpose) and (y) if the Board of Directors reasonably believes such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or would
reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal, after consultation with outside legal counsel, then the Company, directly or indirectly
through its Representatives, may (A) engage in negotiations or discussions with such Third Party and its Representatives and (B) furnish to such
Third Party or its Representatives non-public information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement (a

copy of which shall be promptly provided to Parent); provided that all such information (to the extent that such information has not been
previously provided or made available to Parent) is provided or made available to Parent, as the case may be, prior to or substantially concurrently
with the time it is provided or made available to such Third Party.

(ii) Exception for Superior Proposal. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, at any time prior to obtaining the Company
Shareholder Approval, if the Company has received a Superior Proposal then the Board of Directors may make an Adverse Recommendation
Change and/or cause the Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to and in accordance with Section 10.01(d)(i) in order to pursue and
negotiate a definitive Alternative Acquisition Agreement in respect of such Superior Proposal.

(iii) Exception for Intervening Events. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, at any time prior to obtaining the Company
Shareholder Approval, if the Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such
action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties, the Board of Directors may, in response to an Intervening Event, make an Adverse
Recommendation Change.

(iv) Compliance with Rule 14e-2(a). In addition, nothing contained herein shall prevent the Board of Directors of the Company from
(i) complying with Rule 14e-2(a) under the 1934 Act with regard to an Acquisition Proposal so long as any action taken or statement made to so
comply is consistent with this Section 6.03, if the Company determines after consultation with outside legal counsel that failure to take such action
or make such statement may constitute a violation of Applicable Law; provided that any such action taken or statement made that relates to an
Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be an Adverse Recommendation Change unless the Board of Directors of the Company reaffirms the
Company Board Recommendation in such statement or in connection with such action or (ii) issuing a “stop, look and listen” disclosure or similar
communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the 1934 Act.

(c) Required Notices.

(i) None of the Board of Directors, any of the Company’s Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives, shall take any of the
actions referred to in Section 6.03(b) unless the Company shall have delivered to Parent a prior written notice advising Parent that it intends to
take such action.

(ii) In addition, at any time until the satisfaction of Section 9.01(a), the Company shall notify Parent promptly (but in no event later than two
Business Days) after receipt by the Company (or any of its Representatives) of any Acquisition Proposal, any indication that a Third Party is
considering making an Acquisition Proposal or any request for non-public information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or for
access to the business, properties, assets, books or records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by any Third Party that could reasonably be
expected to make, or has made, an Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall provide such notice in writing and shall, to the extent permitted by
any agreements with such Third Party or its Affiliates, identify the Third Party making such Acquisition Proposal, indication or request, and the
material terms and conditions thereof. The Company shall, to the extent permitted by any agreements with such Third Party or its Affiliates, keep
Parent fully informed, on a current basis, of the status and material details of any such Acquisition Proposal, indication or request, including any
amendments to the price and other material terms thereof. Prior to the satisfaction of Section 9.01(a), the Company shall provide Parent with at
least two Business Days prior notice of any meeting of the Company’s Board of Directors (or such lesser notice as is provided to the members of
the Company’s Board of Directors) at which the Company’s Board of Directors is reasonably expected to consider any Acquisition Proposal.

(iii) At least five Business Days before making an Adverse Recommendation Change or entering into (or causing a Subsidiary to enter into)
any Alternative Acquisition Agreement, or taking any other action with respect to a Superior Proposal (the “Proposal Period”), Company shall,
and shall cause its Representatives to negotiate with Parent in good faith to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement
so that such Acquisition Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal, if Parent, in its discretion, proposes to make such adjustments.

(d) Application of this Provision to Representatives. It is agreed that any violation of the restrictions on the Company set forth in this Section 6.03
by any Representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be a breach of this Section 6.03 by the Company.

(e) Obligation to Terminate Discussions. Subject to this Section 6.03, the Company (A) shall, and shall cause any of its Subsidiaries and its and
their Representatives to cease immediately and cause to be terminated any and all existing activities, discussions or negotiations, if any, with any Third
Party and its Representatives conducted prior to the date hereof with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, and (B) shall promptly request that all copies
of all confidential information that the Company or any of its Representatives have distributed or made available to any such Third Party in connection
with their consideration of any Acquisition Proposal (and all analyses and other materials prepared by or on behalf of such Third Party that contains,
reflects or analyzes that information) be promptly destroyed or returned, and cause any physical or virtual data room to no longer be accessible to or by

Acquisition Proposal, including any amendments to the price and other material terms thereof;

(iii) “Superior Proposal” means a bona fide, unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal (including bona fide unsolicited Acquisition
Proposals from Third Parties that may have otherwise submitted proposals prior to the date hereof) for at least a majority of the outstanding shares
of Company Stock or all or substantially all of the consolidated assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries on terms that the Board of Directors
determines in good faith by a majority vote, after considering the advice of a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation and outside
legal counsel and taking into account all the terms and conditions of the Acquisition Proposal, including the identity of the Third Party, any
break-up fees, expense reimbursement provisions, conditions to consummation, likelihood of satisfying all such conditions, the other terms and
conditions of the Acquisition Proposal, any terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent during the Proposal Period, the availability and terms of
any financing, and the estimated time period necessary prior to consummation of the transactions contemplated by such Acquisition Proposal, are
more favorable to the Company’s shareholders than as provided hereunder.

Section 6.04. Access to Information. From the date hereof until the Effective Time and subject to Applicable Law and the Confidentiality
Agreement, the Company shall and shall cause its Subsidiaries to (i) give to Parent, its counsel, financial advisors, auditors and other authorized

Company’s most recent consolidated balance sheet disclosed in any Company SEC Document, including but not limited to financial advisors,

estimate of Projected Transaction Costs (taking into account the information then available to the Company).

Section 6.06. Takeover Statutes. If any “control share acquisition,” “fair price,” “moratorium,” or other anti-takeover Applicable Law becomes or
is deemed to be applicable to the Company, the Merger, or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement, then the Company and the Board of
Directors of the Company shall grant such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that the transactions contemplated hereby may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to render such Applicable Law inapplicable to the
foregoing.

Section 6.07. Stock Exchange Delisting; Exchange Act Deregistration. Before the Effective Time, the Company shall cooperate with Parent and

Section 7.04. Director and Officer Liability. Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation, and the Surviving Corporation hereby agrees, to do the
following:

(a) For six years after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless the present and former officers and
directors of the Company, exclusively in their capacity as such (each, an “Indemnified Person”), in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time to the fullest extent permitted by the GBCC or any other Applicable Law or provided under the Company’s most recent articles of
incorporation and bylaws.

(b) For six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be maintained in effect provisions in the Surviving Corporation’s articles of
incorporation and bylaws (or in such documents of any successor to the business of the Surviving Corporation) regarding elimination of liability of
directors, indemnification of officers, directors and employees and advancement of expenses that are no less advantageous to the intended beneficiaries
than the corresponding provisions in existence on the date of this Agreement.

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall or, if the Company is unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective
Time to obtain and fully pay the premium for the non-cancellable extension of the directors’ and officers’ liability coverage of the Company’s existing
directors’ and officers’ insurance policies and the Company’s existing fiduciary liability insurance policies (collectively, “D&O Insurance”), in each
case for a claims reporting or discovery period of at least six years from and after the Effective Time with respect to any claim related to any period or
time at or prior to the Effective Time from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Company’s current insurance carrier with
respect to D&O Insurance with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are no less favorable than the coverage provided under the
Company’s existing policies with respect to any actual or alleged error, misstatement, misleading statement, act, omission, neglect, breach of duty or any
matter claimed against a director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by reason of him or her serving in such capacity that existed or
occurred at or prior to the Effective Time (including in connection with this Agreement or the transactions or actions contemplated hereby). If the
Company or the Surviving Corporation for any reason fail to obtain such “tail” insurance policies as of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall continue to maintain in effect, for a period of at least six years from and after the Effective Time, the D&O Insurance in place as of the date hereof
with the Company’s current insurance carrier or with an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Company’s current insurance
carrier with respect to D&O Insurance with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are no less favorable than the coverage provided
under the Company’s existing policies as of the date hereof, or the Surviving Corporation shall purchase from the Company’s current insurance carrier
or from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Company’s current insurance carrier with respect to D&O Insurance comparable
D&O Insurance for such six-year period with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are no less favorable than as provided in the
Company’s existing policies as of the date hereof; provided that in no event shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to expend for such
policies pursuant to this sentence an annual premium amount in excess of 200% of the amount the Company paid for such policies for the period
beginning on March 9, 2017 and ending on March 9, 2018, which amount is set forth in Section 7.04(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule; and
provided further that if the aggregate premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain
a policy with the greatest coverage available, with respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective Time, for a cost not exceeding such amount.

(d) The Surviving Corporation shall pay on an as-incurred basis the fees and expenses of such Indemnified Person (including the reasonable fees
and expenses of counsel) in advance of the final disposition of any action, suit, proceeding or investigation that is the subject of the right to
indemnification, provided that such Person shall undertake to reimburse the Surviving Corporation for all amounts so advanced if a court of competent
jurisdiction determines, by a final, nonappealable order, that such Person is not entitled to indemnification.

(e) If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be
the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or

merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each case, to the extent necessary, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set
forth in this Section 7.04.

(f) The rights of each Indemnified Person under this Section 7.04 shall be in addition to any rights such Person may have under the articles of
incorporation or bylaws of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or under the GBCC or any other Applicable Law or under any agreement of any
Indemnified Person with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. These rights shall survive consummation of the Merger and are intended to benefit, and
shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Person.

Section 7.05. Employee Matters.

(a) For a period of twelve (12) months following the Effective Time (the “Continuation Period”), Parent shall provide or cause the Surviving
Corporation to provide to each individual who is a Company Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time and continues to be employed
immediately following the Effective Time by Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary thereof (each, a “Continuing Employee”), the
terms and conditions of which shall be honored by Parent and the Surviving Corporation, (i) for so long as such Company Employee is so employed by
the Company or respective Subsidiary, salary and incentive opportunities that are each no less favorable (including any value attributable to equity-
based compensation) than those provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time; provided that (A) cash incentive
opportunities for each individual covered under this clause shall be no less than such individual’s 2016 cash incentive opportunity and (B) the value
attributable to equity-based compensation to any individual covered under this clause shall be based on the value of the actual equity award granted in
2016 by the Company to such individual (unless 2017 opportunities and equity grants have been made, in which case references to “2016” shall be
replaced by “2017”), and (ii) severance benefits that are no less favorable than those provided to such Continuing Employee (A) as in effect at the date
hereof and disclosed to Parent prior to the date hereof or (B) established or amended after the date hereof in compliance with this Agreement. Parent
shall also provide or cause the Surviving Corporation to provide each Continuing Employee with employee benefits that are substantially comparable in
the aggregate to those provided to such Continuing Employee by the Company or the applicable Subsidiary immediately prior to the Effective Time,
until the end of each applicable plan year of each applicable Employee Plan under which such benefits accrue; provided that Parent shall comply with or
cause the Surviving Corporation to provide the severance benefits set forth in the preceding sentence for the Continuation Period. In addition, and
without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Continuing Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any
and all plans of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or their respective affiliates (“Surviving Corporation Plans”) to the extent coverage under any such
plan replaces coverage under a comparable Employee Plan in which such Continuing Employee was eligible to participate immediately prior to the
Effective Time.

(b) With respect to all Surviving Corporation Plans, including any “employee benefit plan”, as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, maintained by
Parent or any of its respective Subsidiaries (including any vacation, paid time-off and severance plans), for all purposes (but not for benefit accrual
under any defined benefit plan or retiree welfare benefit plan or vesting under any equity compensation plan), including determining eligibility to
participate, level of benefits, vesting, benefit accruals and early retirement subsidies, each Continuing Employee’s service with the Company or any
Subsidiaries (as well as service with any predecessor employer of the Company or any such Subsidiary, to the extent service with the predecessor
employer is recognized by the Company or such Subsidiary) shall be treated as service with Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries; provided,
however, that such service need not be recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in any duplication of benefits for the same period of
service, or such service was not credited under the corresponding Employee Plan.

(c) With respect to any welfare plan maintained by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries in which any Continuing Employee is eligible to participate
after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to use commercially reasonable best efforts to (i) waive all limitations
as to preexisting conditions

and exclusions and waiting periods and actively-at-work requirements with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to such
Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents and beneficiaries, to the extent such limitations were waived, satisfied or did not apply to such
Continuing Employees or eligible dependents or beneficiaries under the corresponding welfare Employee Plan in which such Continuing Employees
participated immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) provide Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents and beneficiaries with credit
for any co-payments and deductibles paid prior to the Effective Time in satisfying any analogous deductible or out-of-pocket maximum requirements to
the extent applicable under any such plan.

(d) Annual cash-based bonuses for the fiscal year in which the Effective Time occurs shall pay out based on the actual achievement of any
applicable performance metrics over the applicable performance period having occurred as of such time, prorated for the number of days which have
elapsed in the applicable bonus plan or performance period (up to and including the date on which the Effective Time occurs), and, in any case, annual
cash-based bonuses shall be treated no less favorably than provided by the terms of the applicable Employee Plan and, if applicable, the Company’s
Change in Control Plan. Annual cash-based bonuses for the fiscal year prior to the fiscal year in which the Effective Time occurs, but which have not yet
been paid as of the Effective Time, shall pay out based on the actual achievement of any applicable performance metrics over the applicable
performance period, as determined by the Compensation Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors (or such committee’s delegate) prior to the
Effective Time.

(e) For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Section 7.05 shall cause any Company Employee to be treated less favorably than he or she would
be treated pursuant to the terms set forth in the Company’s change in control severance plan.

(f) With respect to any Continuing Employees whose principal place of employment is outside of the United States, Parent’s obligations under this
Section 7.05(f) shall be modified to the extent necessary to comply with Applicable Law where such Company Employees primarily perform their
duties.

(g) The provisions of this Section 7.05 are solely for the benefit of the parties to this Agreement, and no Company Employee, Continuing
Employee or any other Person (including any beneficiary or dependent thereof) shall be regarded for any purpose as a third-party beneficiary of this
Agreement, and no provision of this Section 7.05 shall create such rights in any such Persons in respect of any benefits that may be provided, directly or
indirectly, under any Employee Plan or any compensation or benefit plan, program, agreement or policy of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries. Nothing
herein shall be construed as an amendment to any Employee Plan or compensation or benefit plan, program, agreement or policy of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries.

(h) Nothing contained herein, express or implied: (i) shall alter or limit the ability of the Surviving Corporation, Parent or any of their respective
Affiliates to amend, modify, or terminate any benefit plan, program, agreement, or arrangement at any time assumed, established, sponsored, or
maintained by any of them; (ii) shall prevent the Surviving Corporation, Parent, or any of their respective Affiliates from terminating the employment of
any Company Employee, including any Continuing Employee, following the Effective Time, or (iii) otherwise confer upon any current or former
employee of the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates, any rights (including for sake of clarity, any
third party beneficiary rights) or remedies of any nature or kind whatsoever under or by reason of this Section 7.05(h). The parties hereto acknowledge
and agree that the terms set forth in this Agreement shall not create any right in any Company Employee or any other Person to any continued
employment with the Surviving Corporation, Parent, or any of their respective Subsidiaries or compensation or benefits of any nature or kind
whatsoever, or otherwise alters any existing at-will employment relationship between any Company Employee and the Surviving Corporation.

ARTICLE 8
COVENANTS OF PARENT AND THE COMPANY

The parties hereto agree that:

Section 8.01. Company Efforts. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Company and Parent shall use their reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under Applicable Law to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including (i) preparing and filing as promptly as practicable with any Governmental
Authority or other third party all documentation to effect all necessary filings, notices, petitions, statements, registrations, submissions of information,
applications and other documents, (ii) obtaining and maintaining all approvals, consents, registrations, permits, authorizations, waivers, and other
confirmations required to be obtained from any Governmental Authority or other third party that are necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (iii) the execution and delivery of any additional instruments necessary to consummate the Merger and to
fully carry out the purposes of this Agreement, and (iv) providing such other assistance as Parent may deem reasonably necessary in connection with the
anticipated transition of the Company and its Subsidiaries.

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of Parent and the Company shall make an appropriate filing of a Notification and
Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act, to the extent necessary and appropriate, with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as
practicable and in any event within 10 Business Days of the date hereof and to supply as promptly as practicable any additional information and
documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act and to use their reasonable best efforts to take all other actions necessary to cause
the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act as soon as practicable. Neither Parent nor the Company shall commit
to or agree (or permit any of their respective Subsidiaries to commit to or agree) with any Governmental Authority to stay, toll, or extend any applicable
waiting period under the HSR Act, without the prior written consent of the other (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or
delayed).

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, Parent agrees, and agrees to cause its Affiliates, to use reasonable best
efforts to take any and all steps, and to make any and all undertakings, to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any antitrust, merger
control, competition, or trade regulation laws that may be asserted by any Governmental Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, so as to enable the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby to occur as soon as reasonably possible (and in any
event, no later than the End Date).

(d) Each of Parent and Merger Subsidiary agrees not to issue any equity interests to any Person other than: (i) pursuant to the terms and conditions
of the Equity Commitment Letter, and/or (ii) to any Affiliates of Parent, newly-formed to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, but which
have no assets prior to the Closing.

Section 8.02. Financing. (a) Each of Parent and Merger Subsidiary acknowledges and agrees that neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
shall have any responsibility for, or incur any Liability to any Person under or with respect to, the Financing, or any cooperation provided pursuant to
this Section 8.02, and Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective directors,
officers, employees, agents and Representatives from and against any and all damage, loss and expense (including reasonable expenses of investigation
and reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses in connection with any action, suit or proceeding whether involving a third party claim or a claim solely
between the parties hereto) suffered or incurred by any of them in connection with the Financing and any information utilized in connection therewith.

(b) Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall use, and shall cause their Affiliates to use, its and their best efforts to (i) arrange and obtain the proceeds of
the Financing on substantially the terms and conditions described in the

Financing Commitment Letters, (ii) enter into definitive agreements with respect thereto on substantially the terms and conditions contained in the
Financing Commitment Letters (including the flex provisions thereof) or on such other terms as Parent and Merger Subsidiary deem appropriate to
satisfy their financing requirements to facilitate the Closing provided that such other terms shall be no less favorable to Parent, Merger Subsidiary and
the Company (the “Financing Agreements”), which agreements shall be in effect as promptly as practicable after the date hereof, but in no event later
than the Closing, and (iii) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions applicable to Parent, Merger Subsidiary, the Guarantor or their respective Affiliates
under the Financing Agreements (including the consummation of the Equity Financing), except where such failures would not be reasonably expected to
materially delay or prevent the consummation of the Financing and the Closing on the terms contemplated hereby or make the funding of the Financing
less likely to occur.

(c) Subject to the following sentence, Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall not, and shall cause their Affiliates not to, amend, alter or waive, or
agree to amend, alter or waive, any term or provision of the Financing Commitment Letters without the written consent of the Company unless (in the
case of the Debt Commitment Letters only) such amendment, alteration or waiver would not reasonably be expected to delay or prevent the Closing or
to make the funding of the Debt Financing less likely to occur. If any portion of the Debt Financing becomes or could become unavailable in the manner
or from the sources contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letters, (i) Parent shall immediately so notify the Company and (ii) Parent and Merger
Subsidiary shall use their reasonable best efforts to arrange to obtain any such portion from alternative sources, on terms, taken as whole, that are no
more adverse to Parent and the Company (including after giving effect to the flex provisions) as promptly as practicable, including by entering into one
or more new debt commitment letters providing for such alternative financing and definitive agreements with respect to the alternative financing
contemplated by such new debt commitment letters. If and to the extent that the Financing is supplemented or superseded by any such alternative
financing, Parent shall deliver to the Company true and complete copies of all commitments or definitive agreements with respect to such alternative
financing, and the terms “Debt Financing”, “Financing”, “Financing Agreements”, “Debt Commitment Letter” and “Financing Commitment
Letters” shall each be deemed to be modified, mutatis mutandis, to refer to such alternative financing and any commitments or definitive agreements
with respect thereto.

(d) Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall comply, shall cause their Affiliates to comply, and shall use its and their reasonable best efforts to cause its
and their Representatives to comply, with the terms, and satisfy on a timely basis all conditions, of the Financing Commitment Letters and the Financing
Agreements, except those terms and conditions the failure to comply with which would not be reasonably expected to materially delay or prevent the
consummation of the Financing or the Closing or to make the funding of the Debt Financing less likely to occur. Any breach of the Financing
Commitment Letters or the Financing Agreements by Parent, Merger Subsidiary or the Guarantor or any of their respective Affiliates that materially
delays or prevents the consummation of the Financing and the Closing or makes the funding of the Financing less likely to occur shall be deemed a
breach by Parent and Merger Subsidiary of this Section 8.02 to the extent that such delay or breach is not caused by: (i) any breach of this Agreement by
the Company, and/or (ii) any Real Property Deficiencies pertaining to Owned Real Property specified in the Debt Commitment Letters, to the extent that
the aggregate value of such Owned Real Property affected by Real Property Deficiencies exceeds ten percent (10%) of the total value of all Owned Real
Property specified in the Debt Commitment Letters. Parent shall (x) furnish to the Company complete, correct and executed copies of the Financing
Agreements promptly upon their execution, (y) give the Company prompt notice of any breach or threatened breach by any party of any of the
Financing Commitment Letters, the Financing Agreements or any related fee or engagement letter of which Parent or Merger Subsidiary becomes aware
or any termination or threatened termination thereof and (z) otherwise keep the Company reasonably informed of the status of its efforts to arrange the
Financing, including by promptly providing the Company with all drafts and term sheets relating to the Financing Agreements and, if applicable, all
drafts and term sheets relating to any alternative financing.

(e) The Company shall and shall cause its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives to, subject to the last two sentences of this
Section 8.02(e), cooperate with the arrangement of the Financing as may be reasonably

Subsidiaries. Such cooperation by the Company shall include, at the reasonable request of Parent, (i) agreeing to enter into such agreements, and to use
reasonable best efforts to deliver such officer’s certificates, as are customary in financings of such type and as are, in the good faith determination of the
persons executing such officer’s certificates, accurate, and agreeing to pledge, grant security interests in, and otherwise grant liens on, the assets of the
Company and its Subsidiaries pursuant to such agreements as may be reasonably requested (provided that no obligation under any such agreement,
pledge or grant shall be effective until the Closing), (ii) subject to Section 6.04 and Section 8.06, providing to the lenders specified in the Financing
Commitment Letters financial and other information with respect to the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries, making the senior officers of the
Company and its Subsidiaries available to assist the lenders specified in the Financing Commitment Letters and otherwise reasonably cooperating in
connection with the Financing, (iii) providing assistance in obtaining any consents of third parties necessary in connection with such financing,
(iv) providing assistance in extinguishing existing indebtedness of the Company and its Subsidiaries and releasing Liens securing such indebtedness, and
(v) assisting Parent in securing the cooperation of the independent accountants of the Company and its Subsidiaries. Parent shall promptly reimburse the
Company’s and its Subsidiaries’ documented third-party expenses and costs incurred in connection with this Section 8.02, other than: (a) those costs
incurred by the Company for the information, surveys, commitments or reports already delivered into the Data Room, which shall be at the Company’s
sole cost and expense, or (b) costs associated with correcting Real Property title defects, releasing Liens or curing any Real Property Deficiency, in each
case to the extent such correction, release or cure is not effective prior to the Effective Time, which shall be paid by the Company as of the Effective
Time using then available cash. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiary shall be
required to pay any commitment or other similar fee or incur any other liability or obligation in connection with the Financing.

Section 8.03. Certain Filings. (a) In connection with the Company Shareholder Meeting, as soon as reasonably practicable following the date of
this Agreement the Company shall prepare and file the Proxy Statement with the SEC. The Company and Parent shall cooperate with one another (i) in
connection with the preparation of the Proxy Statement, (ii) in determining whether any action by or in respect of, or filing with, any Governmental
Authority is required, or any actions, consents, approvals or waivers are required to be obtained from parties to any Material Contracts, in connection
with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (iii) in taking such actions or making any such filings, furnishing
information required in connection therewith or with the Proxy Statement and seeking timely to obtain any such actions, consents, approvals or waivers,
and (iv) by disclosing the frequency and content of any communications with any Governmental Authority to the other party, and obtaining the other
party’s input on all communications, responses and meetings with any such Governmental Authority.

the SEC, and the Company shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to any comments made by Parent and its counsel. The Company shall
provide Parent and its counsel with (i) any comments or other communications, whether written or oral, that the Company or its counsel may receive
from time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Proxy Statement promptly after receipt of those comments or other communications and
(ii) a reasonable opportunity to participate in the Company’s response to those comments and to provide comments on that response (to which
reasonable and good faith consideration shall be given), including by participating with the Company or its counsel in any discussions or meetings with
the SEC.

Section 8.04. Public Announcements. Parent and the Company shall consult with each other before issuing any press release, having any
communication with the press (whether or not for attribution), making any other public statement or scheduling any press conference or conference call
with investors or analysts with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and, except in respect of any public statement or press

The Board of Directors
Ruby Tuesday, Inc.
333 East Broadway Avenue
Maryville, Tennessee 37804

Dear Members of the Board:

We understand that Ruby Tuesday, Inc., a Georgia corporation (the “Company”), is considering a transaction whereby RTI Holding Company,
LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Parent”), will effect a merger involving the Company. Pursuant to the terms of an Agreement and Plan of
Merger, dated as of October 16, 2017 (the “Agreement”), among Parent, the Company and RTI Merger Sub, LLC, a Georgia limited liability company
and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (“Sub”), Parent will undertake a transaction whereby the Company will become a wholly owned subsidiary of
Parent (the “Merger”). Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, all of the issued and outstanding shares of the common stock, par value of $0.01 per
share, of the Company (“Company Common Stock”), will be converted into the right to receive, for each outstanding share of Company Common
Stock, $2.40 in cash (the “Consideration”). The terms and conditions of the Merger are more fully set forth in the Agreement.

You have requested our opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of the Company Common Stock (other than
Parent, Sub and their affiliates) of the Consideration to be received by such holders in the Merger.

UBS Securities LLC (“UBS”) has acted as financial advisor to the Company in connection with the Merger and will receive a fee for its services,
a portion of which is payable in connection with this opinion and a significant portion of which is contingent upon consummation of the Merger. In the
past, UBS and its affiliates have provided mergers and acquisitions advisory and other investment banking services to the Company unrelated to the
proposed Merger, for which UBS and its affiliates received compensation, including having acted as (i) financial advisor to the Company in connection
with share repurchases in 2016 and (ii) as lead arranger in connection with the Company’s $20,000,000 revolving credit facility in 2017. In addition,
UBS or an affiliate is a participant in the Company’s $20,000,000 revolving credit facility for which it received and continues to receive fees and interest
payments. In the ordinary course of business, UBS and its affiliates may hold or trade, for their own accounts and the accounts of their customers,
securities of the Company and of public portfolio companies of NRD Partners II, L.P., an affiliate of Parent, and, accordingly, may at any time hold a
long or short position in such securities. The issuance of this opinion was approved by an authorized committee of UBS.

Our opinion does not address the relative merits of the Merger or any related transaction as compared to other business strategies or transactions
that might be available with respect to the Company or the Company’s underlying business decision to effect the Merger or any related transaction. Our
opinion does not constitute a recommendation to any shareholder as to how such shareholder should vote or act with respect to the Merger or any related
transaction. At your direction, we have not been asked to, nor do we, offer any opinion as to the

terms, other than the Consideration to the extent expressly specified herein, of the Agreement or any related documents or the form of the Merger or any
related transaction. In addition, we express no opinion as to the fairness of the amount or nature of any compensation to be received by any officers,
directors or employees of any parties to the Merger, or any class of such persons, relative to the Consideration. We express no opinion as to the price at
which Company Common Stock will trade at any time. In rendering this opinion, we have assumed, with your consent, that (i) the parties to the
Agreement will comply with all material terms of the Agreement, and (ii) the Merger will be consummated in accordance with the terms of the
Agreement without any adverse waiver or amendment of any material term or condition thereof. We also have assumed that all governmental, regulatory
or other consents and approvals necessary for the consummation of the Merger will be obtained without any material adverse effect on the Company or
the Merger.

In arriving at our opinion, we have, among other things: (i) reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information relating to the
Company; (ii) reviewed certain internal financial information and other data relating to the business and financial prospects of the Company that were
not publicly available, including financial forecasts and estimates prepared by the management of the Company that you have directed us to utilize for
purposes of our analysis; (iii) conducted discussions with members of the senior management of the Company concerning the business and financial
prospects of the Company; (iv) performed a discounted cash flow analysis of the Company in which we analyzed the future cash flows of the Company
using financial forecasts and estimates prepared by the management of the Company; (v) reviewed publicly available financial and stock market data
with respect to certain other companies we believe to be generally relevant; (vi) compared the financial terms of the Merger with the publicly available
financial terms of certain other transactions we believe to be generally relevant; (vii) reviewed current and historical market prices of Company
Common Stock; (viii) reviewed the Agreement; and (ix) conducted such other financial studies, analyses and investigations, and considered such other
information, as we deemed necessary or appropriate. At your request, we have contacted third parties to solicit indications of interest in a possible
transaction with the Company and held discussions with certain of these parties prior to the date hereof.

In connection with our review, with your consent, we have assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the accuracy and
completeness in all material respects of the information provided to or reviewed by us for the purpose of this opinion. In addition, with your consent, we
have not made any independent evaluation or appraisal of any of the assets or liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of the Company, nor have we been
furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal. With respect to the financial forecasts and estimates referred to above, we have assumed, at your
direction, that they have been reasonably prepared on a basis reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the management of the
Company as to the future financial performance of the Company. In addition, we have assumed with your approval that the financial forecasts and
estimates referred to above will be achieved at the times and in the amounts projected. Our opinion is necessarily based on economic, monetary, market
and other conditions as in effect on, and the information available to us as of, the date hereof.

Based upon and subject to the foregoing, it is our opinion that, as of the date hereof, the Consideration to be received by the holders of Company
Common Stock (other than Parent, Sub and their affiliates) in the Merger is fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.

This opinion is provided for the benefit of the Board of Directors (in its capacity as such) in connection with, and for the purpose of, its evaluation
of the Consideration in the Merger.

Very truly yours,

/s/ UBS Securities LLC

(a) A dissenter may notify the corporation in writing of his own estimate of the fair value of his shares and amount of interest due, and demand
payment of his estimate of the fair value of his shares and interest due, if:

due is incorrectly calculated; or

(2) The corporation, having failed to take the proposed action, does not return the deposited certificates or release the transfer restrictions
imposed on uncertificated shares within 60 days after the date set for demanding payment.

(b) A dissenter waives his or her right to demand payment under this Code section and is deemed to have accepted the corporation’s offer unless

PART 3: JUDICIAL APPRAISAL OF SHARES

§14-2-1330. Court action.

(a) If a demand for payment under Code Section 14-2-1327 remains unsettled, the corporation shall commence a proceeding within 60 days after
receiving the payment demand and petition the court to determine the fair value of the shares and accrued interest. If the corporation does not commence
the proceeding within the 60 day period, it shall pay each dissenter whose demand remains unsettled the amount demanded.

(b) The corporation shall commence the proceeding, which shall be a nonjury equitable valuation proceeding, in the superior court of the county
where a corporation’s registered office is located. If the surviving corporation is a foreign corporation without a registered office in this state, it shall
commence the proceeding in the county in this state where the registered office of the domestic corporation merged with or whose shares were acquired
by the foreign corporation was located.

(c) The corporation shall make all dissenters, whether or not residents of this state, whose demands remain unsettled parties to the proceeding,
which shall have the effect of an action quasi in rem against their shares. The corporation shall serve a copy of the petition in the proceeding upon each
dissenting shareholder who is a resident of this state in the manner provided by law for the service of a summons and complaint, and upon each
nonresident dissenting shareholder either by registered or certified mail or statutory overnight delivery or by publication, or in any other manner
permitted by law.

(d) The jurisdiction of the court in which the proceeding is commenced under subsection (b) of this Code section is plenary and exclusive. The
court may appoint one or more persons as appraisers to receive evidence and recommend decision on the question of fair value. The appraisers have the
powers described in the order appointing them or in any amendment to it. Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, Chapter 11 of Title 9, known as
the “Georgia Civil Practice Act,” applies to any proceeding with respect to dissenters’ rights under this chapter.

(e) Each dissenter made a party to the proceeding is entitled to judgment for the amount which the court finds to be the fair value of his shares,
plus interest to the date of judgment.

§ 14-2-1331. Court costs and counsel fees.

(a) The court in an appraisal proceeding commenced under Code Section 14-2-1330 shall determine all costs of the proceeding, including the
reasonable compensation and expenses of appraisers appointed by the court, but not including fees and expenses of attorneys and experts for the
respective parties. The court shall assess the costs against the corporation, except that the court may assess the costs against all or some of the dissenters,
in amounts the court finds equitable, to the extent the court finds the dissenters acted arbitrarily, vexatiously, or not in good faith in demanding payment
under Code Section 14-2-1327.

(b) The court may also assess the fees and expenses of attorneys and experts for the respective parties, in amounts the court finds equitable:

(1) Against the corporation and in favor of any or all dissenters if the court finds the corporation did not substantially comply with the
requirements of Code Sections 14-2-1320 through 14-2-1327; or

(2) Against either the corporation or a dissenter, in favor of any other party, if the court finds that the party against whom the fees and
expenses are assessed acted arbitrarily, vexatiously, or not in good faith with respect to the rights provided by this article.

(c) If the court finds that the services of attorneys for any dissenter were of substantial benefit to other dissenters similarly situated, and that the
fees for those services should not be assessed against the corporation, the court may award to these attorneys reasonable fees to be paid out of the
amounts awarded the dissenters who were benefited.

§ 14-2-1332. Limitation of actions.

No action by any dissenter to enforce dissenters’ rights shall be brought more than three years after the corporate action was taken, regardless of
whether notice of the corporate action and of the right to dissent was given by the corporation in compliance with the provisions of Code
Section 14-2-1320 and Code Section 14-2-1322.
