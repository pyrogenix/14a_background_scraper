DATALINK CORPORATION
10050 Crosstown Circle, Suite 500

Eden Prairie, MN 55344
(952) 944-3462 

November 29, 2016

To Our Shareholders:

        You are invited to attend a special meeting of the shareholders of Datalink Corporation, a Minnesota corporation (which we refer to as "Datalink," the "Company," "we,"
"our" or "us"), which we will hold at our principal executive offices located at 10050 Crosstown Circle, Suite 500, Eden Prairie, MN 55344, on Thursday, January 5, 2017 at 9:00
a.m. local time. We refer to such meeting, including any adjournment or postponement thereof, as the "special meeting."

        At the special meeting, you will be asked to consider and vote on a proposal to approve and adopt the Agreement and Plan of Merger (as it may be amended from time to
time, the "merger agreement"), dated as of November 6, 2016, by and among Datalink, Insight Enterprises Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Insight"), and Reef Acquisition Co., a
Minnesota corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Insight ("Merger Sub"), pursuant to which Merger Sub will be merged with and into Datalink (the "merger"), the
separate existence of Merger Sub will cease, and Datalink will continue as the surviving corporation. You will also be asked to consider and vote on (1) a proposal to approve, on
an advisory (non-binding) basis, certain compensation that may be paid or become payable to our named executive officers in connection with the merger; and (2) a proposal to
adjourn the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, including to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the
proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement or in the absence of a quorum.

        If the merger agreement is adopted and the merger is completed, Datalink will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Insight, and, at the effective time, each share of our
common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger (other than shares owned by Merger Sub, Insight or any direct or indirect wholly
owned subsidiary of Insight or of Datalink immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, which will be cancelled and not converted, and any dissenting shares) will be
cancelled and converted into the right to receive the merger consideration of $11.25 per share in cash, without interest.

        Our board of directors has unanimously adopted and approved the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, determined that the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement are fair to, advisable and in the best interests of Datalink and its shareholders and resolved to recommend that Datalink
shareholders vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement. Accordingly, our board unanimously recommends that the shareholders of Datalink Corporation vote
(1) "FOR" the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement, (2) "FOR" the advisory (non-binding) proposal to approve certain compensation that may be paid or become
payable to the named executive officers of Datalink in connection with the merger, and (3) "FOR" the proposal to adjourn the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate,
including to solicit additional proxies or in the absence of a quorum.

        Your vote is very important.    The merger cannot be completed unless holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock entitled to vote on the proposal
cast their vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement. A failure to vote your shares of our common stock on the proposal to adopt the merger agreement will have
the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the proposal to adopt the merger agreement.

        The attached proxy statement provides you with detailed information about the special meeting, the merger agreement and the merger. A copy of the merger
agreement is attached as Annex A to this document. We encourage you to read this document and the merger agreement carefully and in their entirety. You may also
obtain more information about Datalink from documents we have filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. See "Where You Can Find Additional
Information" on page 89.

        On behalf of our board, I thank you for your support and appreciate your consideration of this matter.

        Neither the Securities and Exchange Commission nor any state securities regulatory agency has approved or disapproved the merger, passed upon the merits or
fairness of the merger, the merger agreement or the other transactions contemplated thereby or passed upon the adequacy or accuracy of the disclosure in this
document. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense.

SUMMARY 

        This summary highlights selected information from this proxy statement related to the merger of Reef Acquisition Co. with and into Datalink Corporation, with
Datalink Corporation surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of Insight Enterprises, Inc., which transaction we refer to as the merger, and may not contain all of the
information that is important to you. To understand the merger more fully and for a more complete description of the legal terms of the merger, you should read carefully

and who is entitled to properly demand dissenter's rights with respect to such shares (the "dissenting shares"), will be converted automatically into the right to receive
$11.25 in cash, without interest (the "merger consideration").

The Special Meeting of Our Shareholders (page 20)

        Place, Date and Time.    The special meeting will be held at 9:00 a.m., local time, on January 5, 2017 at 10050 Crosstown Circle, Suite 500, Eden Prairie, Minnesota
55344. To attend the meeting, you will need to present valid photo identification, such as a driver's license or passport, and proof of ownership of our common stock. If
your shares are held in the name of a broker, bank or other nominee, you will need to present a recent brokerage statement or letter from such entity reflecting your stock
ownership as of the record date. If you do not provide photo identification or comply with the other procedures outlined in this document, you will not be admitted to the
special meeting. For security reasons, you and your bags may be subject to search prior to your admittance to the meeting.

        Purpose of the Special Meeting.    At the special meeting, you will be asked (1) to consider and vote on the proposal to approve and adopt the Agreement and Plan of
Merger, dated as of November 6, 2016, by and among Datalink, Insight, and Merger Sub, pursuant to which Merger Sub will be merged with and into Datalink; (2) to
consider and vote on the proposal to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, certain compensation that may be paid or become payable to Datalink's named executive
officers in connection with the merger; and (3) to consider and vote on the proposal to approve the adjournment of the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate,
including to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement or
in the absence of a quorum.

        Who Can Vote at the Meeting.    You can vote at the special meeting, in person or by proxy, all of the shares of our common stock you own of record as of
November 23, 2016, which is the record date for the special meeting. If you own shares that are registered in someone else's name, for example, a broker, you need to
direct that person to vote those shares or obtain a legal proxy from them and vote the shares yourself at the meeting. As of November 23, 2016, there were 22,256,459
shares of our common stock outstanding held by 158 holders of record.

        What Vote is Required for Approval of the Merger Agreement.    Approval of the merger agreement requires that shareholders holding a majority of the shares of our
common stock outstanding at the close of business on the record date for the special meeting and entitled to be cast on such proposal vote "FOR" the proposal to approve
and adopt the merger agreement. A failure to vote your shares of our common stock or an abstention from voting will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the
proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement. If your shares are held in "street name" by your broker, bank or other nominee and you do not instruct the nominee
how to vote your shares, such failure to instruct your nominee will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement.

        Quorum.    A quorum will be present if holders of record of a majority of the shares of our common stock outstanding on the close of business on the record date are
present in person or represented by proxy at the special meeting. If a quorum is not present at the special meeting, the special meeting may be adjourned or postponed from
time to time until a quorum is obtained.

        Procedure for Voting.    You can vote shares you hold of record by attending the special meeting and voting in person or by mailing the enclosed proxy card or voting
by telephone or through the Internet. If your shares are held in "street name" by your broker, you should instruct your broker on how to vote your shares using the
instructions provided by your broker. If you do not instruct your broker to vote your shares, your shares will not be voted, which will have the same effect as a vote against
approval of the merger agreement.

        How to Revoke Your Proxy.    You may revoke your proxy and change your vote at any time before your proxy is voted at the annual meeting. To revoke your proxy,
you must (a) submit a new proxy with a more recent date than that of the first proxy given before 11:59 P.M. Eastern Time on January 4, 2017 by (1) following the Internet
voting instructions or (2) following the telephone voting instructions; (b) complete, sign, date and return a new proxy card to us, which must be received by us before the
time of the meeting; or (c) if you are a registered shareholder, attend the meeting in person and deliver a proper written notice of revocation of your proxy. Attendance at
the meeting will not by itself revoke a previously granted proxy. Unless you decide to vote your shares in person, you should revoke your prior proxy in the same way you
initially submitted it—that is, by Internet, telephone or mail.

Shares Held by Directors and Executive Officers (page 83)

        At the close of business on the record date, directors and executive officers of Datalink were entitled to vote approximately 1,814,504 shares of our common stock,
which in the aggregate represented approximately 8.2% of the shares of our common stock issued and outstanding on such date. See "Security Ownership of Certain
Beneficial Owners and Management" beginning on page 83.

        Each of Datalink's directors has agreed with Insight that they will vote their shares in favor of the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement and a proposal
to adjourn the meeting, if necessary or appropriate, and we expect the directors to also vote their shares in favor of the other proposal to be considered at the special
meeting. See "The Voting Agreement" beginning on page 78. We currently expect that our executive officers will also vote their shares in favor of the proposal to approve
and adopt the merger agreement and the other proposals to be considered at the special meeting, although they have no obligation to do so.

Recommendation of the Datalink Board of Directors (page 24); Reasons for the Merger (page 35)

        Our board has unanimously approved the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. Our board unanimously
recommends that Datalink shareholders vote "FOR" the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement at the special meeting.

        For a description of the reasons considered by our board in deciding to recommend approval of the merger agreement, see the section entitled "The Merger (Proposal
1)—Reasons for our Board's Recommendation in Favor of the Merger" beginning on page 35.

Opinion of Datalink's Financial Advisor (page 41)

        At the November 6, 2016 meeting of our board, representatives of Raymond James & Associates, Inc. ("Raymond James") rendered Raymond James' oral opinion,
which was subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion to our board dated November 6, 2016, as to the fairness, as of such date, from a financial point of view,
to the holders of our outstanding common stock of the merger consideration to be received by such holders in the merger pursuant to the merger agreement, based upon
and subject to the qualifications, assumptions and other matters considered in connection with the preparation of its opinion. The Raymond James opinion was based in
part on certain non-public unaudited prospective financial information prepared by our management, described below under "The Merger (Proposal 1)—Certain Datalink
Unaudited Prospective Financial Information" beginning on page 39.

        The full text of the written opinion of Raymond James, dated November 6, 2016, which sets forth, among other things, the various qualifications, assumptions and
limitations on the scope of the review undertaken, is attached as Annex D to this document. Raymond James provided its opinion for the information and assistance of our
board (solely in its capacity as such) in connection with, and for purposes of, its consideration of the merger and its opinion only addresses whether the merger

Table of Contents

consideration to be received by the holders of our common stock in the merger pursuant to the merger agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.
The opinion of Raymond James did not address any other term or aspect of the merger agreement or the merger contemplated thereby. The Raymond James opinion does
not constitute a recommendation to our board or any holder of our common stock as to how our board, such shareholder or any other person should vote or otherwise act
with respect to the merger or any other matter.

Certain Effects of the Merger on Datalink (page 26)

        Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, Merger Sub will be merged with and into Datalink, with Datalink surviving the merger. Throughout this proxy
statement, we use the term "surviving corporation" to refer to Datalink as the surviving corporation following the merger. If the merger is consummated, you will not own
any shares of the capital stock of the surviving corporation.

        The time at which the merger will become effective, which we refer to as the effective time of the merger, will occur at the time the articles of merger are duly filed
with the Secretary of State of the State of Minnesota or at such later date as may be agreed by Datalink and Merger Sub and specified in the articles of merger.

Effect on Datalink if the Merger is Not Completed (page 26)

        If the merger agreement is not approved by our shareholders or if the merger is not consummated for any other reason, our shareholders will not receive any payment
for their shares of common stock. Instead, we will remain a public company, the common stock will continue to be listed and traded on the Nasdaq Global Market, a listing
tier of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC ("Nasdaq") and registered under the U.S. Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") and we will continue to file
periodic reports with the SEC. Under specified circumstances, we may be required to pay Insight a termination fee upon or following the termination of the merger
agreement, as described under "The Merger Agreement—Termination Fee" beginning on page 76.

When the Merger Becomes Effective (page 62)

        The merger agreement provides that the merger will become effective within two business days after the satisfaction of the conditions to the merger, but no earlier
than January 3, 2017. As of the date of this document, the parties expect to complete the merger in the first quarter of 2017, shortly after the approval and adoption of the
merger agreement by our shareholders. However, completion of the merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to the completion of the merger, and
factors outside the control of Datalink or Insight may delay the completion of the merger, or prevent it from being completed at all. There can be no assurances as to
whether or when the merger will be completed.

Treatment of Datalink Equity Awards (page 63)

        Restricted Stock.    At the effective time, each share of restricted stock that is outstanding immediately prior to the effective time will terminate and be cancelled in
exchange for the merger consideration (subject to any applicable withholding tax).

        Stock Options.    At the effective time, each option to purchase our common stock (a "stock option") that is outstanding prior to the effective time, whether vested or
unvested, will, (i) if the exercise price of such option is equal to or greater than the merger consideration, terminate and be cancelled without any consideration being
payable; or (ii) if the exercise price of such option is less than the merger consideration, terminate and be cancelled in exchange for the aggregate option consideration with
respect to such option (subject to applicable withholding tax). The option

Table of Contents

consideration equals the difference between the merger consideration and the exercise price payable for each share issuable under such option.

        Restricted Stock Units and Performance Stock Units.    At the effective time, each award of Datalink restricted stock units ("RSUs") or performance stock units
("PSUs") that is outstanding or payable prior to the effective time, whether vested or unvested, will terminate and be cancelled as of immediately prior to the effective time
in exchange for the right to receive the product of (i) the number of shares subject to such RSU or PSU, as applicable; and (ii) the merger consideration (subject to any
applicable withholding tax). For purposes of the merger agreement, the deferred stock units held by certain of our directors are considered RSUs.

No Solicitation; Alternative Proposals (page 68)

        The merger agreement restricts our ability to solicit or engage in discussions or negotiations with a third party regarding competing transactions and our board's
ability to change or withdraw its recommendation in favor of the merger agreement. Notwithstanding these restrictions, under circumstances specified in the merger
agreement, our board may respond to unsolicited bona fide written competing proposals or terminate the merger agreement and enter into an agreement with respect to a
superior proposal or withdraw its recommendation in favor of the merger agreement. See "The Merger Agreement—No Solicitation; Alternative Proposals" beginning on
page 68.

Change in Board Recommendation (page 70)

        Our board unanimously recommends that our shareholders vote "FOR" the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement. Nevertheless, our board may make a
change of recommendation or terminate the merger agreement to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to a superior proposal (as defined in the section entitled
"The Merger Agreement—No Solicitation; Alternative Proposals" beginning on page 68) if we receive an unsolicited bona fide written takeover proposal that our board,
after consultation with outside legal and financial advisors, concludes constitutes a superior proposal (taking into account any offers made by Insight to adjust the terms of
the merger agreement) or if there has been an intervening event unrelated to a takeover proposal and, in any event, failure to take such action would be inconsistent with
our board's fiduciary duties under applicable law.

Interests of Datalink's Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger (page 48)

        When considering the recommendation by our board in favor of the merger agreement and the merger, you should be aware that our directors and executive officers
have interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, yours, including the following:

• An agreement among Insight, us and each of our directors (Brent G. Blackey, Paul F. Lidsky, Greg R. Meland, J. Patrick O'Halloran, James E. Ousley,
Mercedes Walton and James L. Zucco, Jr.) pursuant to which the directors will vote (i) in favor of the approval and adoption of the merger agreement and
all agreements related to the merger; (ii) in favor of any related proposal in furtherance of the merger agreement and/or in furtherance of effecting the
merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement; and (iii) against any alternative proposal, any other extraordinary transaction
involving us other than the merger, any corporate action that could frustrate the purposes or prevent or delay the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement, or any other proposal relating to any such action; 

• The payment to each of our named executive officers (Paul F. Lidsky, Gregory T. Barnum, Patricia A. Hamm, M. Shawn O'Grady and Denise M.
Westenfield) of the amounts that would be payable to such officers under our 2016 incentive plan if "target" were achieved, even if "target" performance is
not achieved;

merger, as described in the section entitled "The Merger Agreement—Treatment of Datalink Equity Awards" on page 63; 

• A retention bonus letter agreement between us and Mr. Lidsky pursuant to which, contingent upon the closing of the merger and Mr. Lidsky's engagement
as a consultant for 60 days after the closing of the merger, Mr. Lidsky will be eligible to receive either (i) a retention bonus payment in the amount of
$200,000 or (ii) a consulting separation payment in the amount of $200,000, in addition to the existing severance benefits outlined in Mr. Lidsky's
employment agreement with us; 

• A retention bonus letter agreement between us and Ms. Westenfield pursuant to which, contingent upon the closing of the merger, Ms. Westenfield will be
eligible to receive (i) a retention bonus payment in the amount of $90,000, subject to her continued employment through the five-month anniversary of the
closing of the merger or earlier termination without cause, and (ii) upon a termination without cause, a severance payment in the amount of $90,000 or, if
such termination occurs after the five-month anniversary of the merger, determined in accordance with Insight's Separation Plan; 

• An offer letter between Insight and Mr. O'Grady pursuant to which Mr. O'Grady will be employed by Insight as a Senior Vice President and General
Manager and will be entitled to base compensation, a target annual variable bonus opportunity, and a one-time award of restricted stock units of Insight,
among other benefits and compensation as further described in such offer letter; 

• The entitlement of certain of our executive officers to receive severance payments and benefits under their respective executive employment agreements in
the event the officer's employment is terminated on or following the closing of the merger either by the surviving corporation without cause or by the
officer for good reason; and 

• Continued indemnification and directors' and officers' liability insurance to be provided by the surviving corporation.

        If the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement is approved by our shareholders and the merger closes, any shares of our common stock held by our
directors and executive officers will be treated in the same manner as outstanding shares of our common stock held by all of our other shareholders entitled to receive the
per-share merger consideration.

        See "The Merger (Proposal 1)—Interests of Datalink's Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger" beginning on page 48.

        The members of our board were aware of these interests of our directors and executive officers and considered them, among other matters, when approving the
merger agreement and the merger and determining to recommend that its shareholders vote "FOR" the approval of the merger agreement and the merger.

Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger (page 57)

        If you are a U.S. holder (as defined in the section entitled "The Merger (Proposal 1)—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger" beginning on
page 57), the receipt of cash in exchange for shares of our common stock pursuant to the merger will generally be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, and may also be a taxable transaction under applicable state, local or foreign income or other tax laws. You should consult your own tax advisor regarding the
particular tax consequences to you of the exchange of shares of our common stock for cash pursuant to the merger

Regulatory Approvals (page 59)

        HSR Waiting Period.    Under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the "HSR Act"), and the rules promulgated thereunder, the
merger may not be completed until notifications have been given and information furnished to the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice (the
"Antitrust Division") and the United States Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC") and all statutory waiting period requirements have been satisfied.

        German Competition Clearance.    The merger is also subject to the merger control provisions of the German Act against Restraints of Competition (Gesetz gegen
Wettbewerbsbeschränkungen) (the "German Competition Act"), which among other things provides that the merger may not be completed until notification has been
given, and clearance has been received from, Germany's Federal Cartel Office (the "FCO").

Financing of the Merger (page 48)

        The merger is not conditioned upon receipt of financing by Insight. Insight plans to finance the transaction through a combination of existing cash on hand and
borrowing under its existing credit facilities.

Conditions to Completion of the Merger (page 73)

        The conditions to each party's obligations to complete the merger include the following:

that would make illegal or otherwise prevent or prohibit the consummation of the merger; 

• the expiration or early termination of the waiting period applicable to the consummation of the merger under the HSR Act and the receipt of clearance of
the FCO under the German Competition Act; 

• the accuracy of the other party's representations and warranties in the merger agreement, subject to certain qualifications; and

appealable judgment, law or other legal restraint or prohibition; 

• the requisite vote of our shareholders is not obtained at the special meeting; or

earlier of April 25, 2017 or 30 days after receipt of written notice of such breach or failure; or 

• by Insight, if: 

• our board has changed or failed to reaffirm its recommendation in favor of approval of the merger agreement and the merger to our shareholders; 

• our board has approved, adopted, or recommended a takeover proposal or approved, recommended, entered into, or allowed us to enter into a
definitive agreement with respect to a takeover proposal; or

Termination Fee (page 76)

termination fee of $7.5 million.

Employee Matters (page 72)

        The merger agreement provides for the following treatment with respect to those employees of Datalink and its subsidiaries who continue to be employed by the
surviving corporation or one of its subsidiaries after the effective time, whom we refer to as the "continuing employees":

effective time, or (ii) compensation and benefits currently provided by Insight to similarly-situated employees of Insight;

• Insight will honor all employee benefit plans of Datalink and all employment, severance and termination plans and contracts in accordance with their terms
as in effective immediately before the effective time; and 

• for purposes of vesting, eligibility and level of benefits under the employee benefit plans of Insight, each continuing employee will receive credit for his or
her years of service with Datalink before the effective time, to the same extent as such employee was entitled before the effective time, to credit for such
service under any similar employee benefit plan in which such employee participated immediately prior to the effective time.

Market Prices and Dividend Data (page 82)

        Our common stock is traded on Nasdaq, under the symbol "DTLK." The closing sale price of our common stock on November 4, 2016, which was the last trading day
before the merger was publicly announced, was $9.43 per share. On November 28, 2016 the most recent practicable date before the filing of this document, the closing
price for our common stock was $11.16 per share. See "Market Price of Datalink Common Stock" on page 82.

        Under the terms of the merger agreement, during the period from the date of the merger agreement until the earlier of the effective time of the merger or the
termination of the merger agreement (such period, the "pre-closing period"), we may not declare or pay any cash dividends to our shareholders without Insight's written
consent. We have paid no dividends on our common stock since our initial public offering in 1999. Under our current dividend policy, we intend to retain future earnings
for use in our business, and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.

Dissenters' Rights (page 85)

        If the merger agreement is approved by Datalink shareholders at the special meeting and the merger is consummated, shareholders of Datalink who do not vote in
favor of the Merger Agreement and who otherwise comply with Sections 302A.471 and 302A.473 of the Minnesota Business Corporation Act will be entitled to demand
payment for his or her shares and an appraisal of the value of those shares. The rights of dissenting shareholders under the Minnesota Business Corporation Act are
discussed in the section entitled "Dissenters' Rights" beginning on page 85. Any exercise of dissenters' rights must be in accordance with the procedures set forth in

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE SPECIAL MEETING AND THE MERGER 

        The following questions and answers address briefly some questions you may have regarding the special meeting and the proposals to be voted on at the special meeting.
These questions and answers may not address all of the questions that may be important to you as a shareholder of Datalink. Please refer to the more detailed information
contained elsewhere in this document, the annexes to this document and the documents referred to or incorporated by reference in this document, which we urge you to read
carefully and in their entirety. You may obtain the information incorporated by reference into this document without charge by following the instructions under the section
entitled "Where You Can Find Additional Information" on page 89.

Q: Why am I receiving this document? 

A: On November 6, 2016, Datalink entered into a definitive agreement providing for the merger of Merger Sub, a wholly owned subsidiary of Insight, with and into
Datalink, with Datalink surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Insight. You are receiving this document in connection with the solicitation of proxies by
our board in favor of the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement and a proposal to adjourn the meeting, if necessary or appropriate, and to approve the other
related proposal to be voted on at the special meeting. 

Q: What is a proxy? 

A: A proxy is your legal designation of another person, referred to as a "proxy," to vote your shares of our common stock. The written document describing the matters to be
considered and voted on at the special meeting is called a "proxy statement." The document used to designate a proxy to vote your shares of our common stock is called a
"proxy card." Our board has designated Gregory T. Barnum and Paul F. Lidsky, and each of them with full power of substitution, as proxies for the special meeting. 

Q: When and where is the special meeting? 

A: The special meeting will be held at Datalink's principal executive offices located at 10050 Crosstown Circle, Suite 500, Eden Prairie, MN 55344, on Thursday, January 5,
2017, at 9:00 a.m. local time (including any adjournment or postponement thereof, the "special meeting"). 

Q: Who is entitled to vote at the special meeting? 

A: Only holders of record of our common stock as of the close of business on November 23, 2016, the record date for the special meeting, are entitled to receive these proxy
materials and to vote their shares at the special meeting. As of the close of business on the record date, there were 22,256,459 shares of our common stock outstanding
and entitled to vote at the special meeting, held by 158 holders of record. Each share of our common stock issued and outstanding as of the record date will be entitled to
one vote on each matter submitted to a vote at the special meeting. 

Q: What is the difference between holding shares as a shareholder of record and as a beneficial owner? 

A: If your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, Wells Fargo Shareowner Services, you are considered, with respect to those shares, to be the
"shareholder of record." In this case, we have sent this proxy statement and your proxy card to you directly. 

If your shares are held through a broker, bank or other nominee, you are considered the "beneficial owner" of the shares of our common stock held in "street name." In
that case, this proxy statement has been forwarded to you by your broker, bank or other nominee who is

Table of Contents

considered, with respect to those shares, to be the shareholder of record. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your broker, bank or other nominee on how
to vote your shares by following their instructions for voting. You are also invited to attend the special meeting. However, because you are not the shareholder of record,
you may not vote your shares in person at the special meeting unless you request and obtain a valid legal proxy from your broker, bank or other nominee.

Q: What matters will be voted on at the special meeting? 

A: You will be asked to consider and vote on the following proposals: 

• to approve and adopt the merger agreement; 

• to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, certain compensation that may be paid or become payable to the named executive officers of Datalink in
connection with the merger; and 

• to approve the adjournment of the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, including to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of
the special meeting to approve the proposal to approve the merger agreement or in the absence of a quorum. 

Q: What is the proposed merger and what effects will it have on Datalink? 

A: The proposed merger is the acquisition of Datalink by Insight pursuant to the merger agreement. If the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement is approved
by the holders of our common stock and the other closing conditions under the merger agreement have been satisfied or waived, Merger Sub will merge with and into
Datalink, with Datalink continuing as the surviving corporation. As a result of the merger, Datalink will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Insight. We will cooperate
with Insight to de-list our common stock from Nasdaq and de-register under the Exchange Act as soon as reasonably practicable following the effective time of the
merger, and at such time, we will no longer be a publicly traded company and will no longer file periodic reports with the SEC. If the merger is consummated, you will
not own any shares of the capital stock of the surviving corporation. 

Q: What happens if the merger is not completed? 

A: If the merger agreement is not approved by our shareholders or if the merger is not consummated for any other reason, our shareholders will not receive any payment for
their shares of common stock. Instead, we will remain a public company, the common stock will continue to be listed and traded on Nasdaq and registered under the
Exchange Act and we will continue to file periodic reports with the SEC. 

Under specified circumstances, we may be required to pay Insight a termination fee upon the termination of the merger agreement, as described under "The Merger
Agreement—Termination Fee" beginning on page 76.

Q: What will I receive if the merger is completed? 

A: Upon completion of the merger, you will be entitled to receive the per-share merger consideration of $11.25 in cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding
taxes, for each share of common stock that you own. For example, if you own 100 shares of common stock, you will receive $1,125.00 in cash in exchange for your
shares of common stock, less any applicable withholding taxes. In any case, you will not own shares in the surviving corporation.

Q: What will the holders of Datalink restricted stock, stock options, RSUs and PSUs receive in the merger? 

A: Restricted Stock. At the effective time, each share of restricted stock that is outstanding immediately prior to the effective time will terminate and be cancelled in
exchange for the merger consideration. 

Stock Options. At the effective time, each stock option that is outstanding prior to the effective time, whether vested or unvested, will, (i) if the exercise price of such
option is equal to or greater than the merger consideration, terminate and be cancelled without any consideration being payable; or (ii) if the exercise price of such option
is less than the merger consideration, terminate and be cancelled in exchange for the aggregate option consideration with respect to such option. The option consideration
equals the difference between the merger consideration and the exercise price payable for each share issuable under such option.

Restricted Stock Units and Performance Stock Units. At the effective time, each award of Datalink RSUs or PSUs that is outstanding or payable prior to the effective
time, whether vested or unvested, will terminate and be cancelled as of immediately prior to the effective time in exchange for the right to receive the product of (i) the
number of shares subject to such RSU or PSU, as applicable; and (ii) the merger consideration (subject to any applicable withholding tax). For purposes of the merger
agreement, the deferred stock units held by certain of our directors are considered RSUs.

Q: When do you expect the merger to be completed? 

A: We are working toward completing the merger as soon as possible on or after the date of the special meeting, and currently expect to consummate the merger during the
first quarter of 2017. However, the exact timing of completion of the merger cannot be predicted because the merger is subject to conditions, including approval of the
merger agreement by our shareholders and the receipt of regulatory approvals. See "The Merger Agreement—When the Merger Becomes Effective" on page 62 and "The
Merger Agreement—Conditions to Completion of the Merger" beginning on page 73. 

Q: Am I entitled to appraisal or dissenters' rights under Minnesota Law? 

A: Yes. As a holder of the Company's common stock, you are entitled to exercise dissenters' rights under the Minnesota Business Corporation Act in connection with the
merger if you take certain actions and meet certain conditions. See "Dissenters' Rights" beginning on page 85. 

Q: Will I be subject to U.S. federal income tax upon the exchange of our common stock for cash pursuant to the merger? 

A: If you are a U.S. holder (as defined under "The Merger (Proposal 1)—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger" beginning on page 57), the
exchange of our common stock for cash pursuant to the merger generally will require a U.S. holder to recognize a gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes in an
amount equal to the difference between the amount of cash received by such U.S. holder pursuant to the merger and such U.S. holder's adjusted tax basis in the shares of
our common stock surrendered pursuant to the merger. Backup withholding may also apply to the cash payment pursuant to the merger unless the U.S. holder or other
payee provides a taxpayer identification number, certifies that such number is correct and otherwise complies with the backup withholding rules. Because particular
circumstances may differ, we recommend that you consult your own tax advisor to determine the U.S. federal income tax consequences relating to the merger in light of
your own particular circumstances and any consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or foreign taxing jurisdiction. A more

complete description of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger is provided under "The Merger (Proposal 1)—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax
Consequences of the Merger" beginning on page 57 of this proxy statement.

Q: How do I attend the special meeting? 

A: To attend the meeting, you will need to present valid photo identification, such as a driver's license or passport, and proof of ownership of our common stock. If your
shares are held in the name of a broker, bank or other nominee, you will need to present a recent brokerage statement or letter from such entity reflecting your stock
ownership as of the record date. If you do not provide photo identification or comply with the other procedures outlined in this document, you will not be admitted to the
special meeting. For security reasons, you and your bags may be subject to search prior to your admittance to the meeting. 

If you are not a holder of record as of the record date, you may be admitted to the meeting only if you have a valid legal proxy from a holder of record as of the record
date. You must present that proxy, as well as a form of valid photo identification, at the entrance to the meeting.

Q: How many shares are needed to constitute a quorum? 

A: A quorum will be present if holders of record of a majority of the shares of our common stock outstanding on the close of business on the record date are present in
person or represented by proxy at the special meeting. If a quorum is not present at the special meeting, the special meeting may be adjourned or postponed from time to
time until a quorum is obtained. 

If you submit a proxy but fail to provide voting instructions or abstain on any of the proposals listed on the proxy card, your shares will be counted for the purpose of
determining whether a quorum is present at the special meeting.

If your shares are held in "street name" by your broker, bank or other nominee and you do not instruct the nominee how to vote your shares, your broker, bank or other
nominee will not vote on your behalf with respect to any of the proposals, and your shares will not be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present
for the transaction of business at the special meeting.

Q: What vote of Datalink shareholders is required to approve and adopt the merger agreement? 

A: Approval of the merger agreement requires that shareholders holding a majority of the shares of our common stock outstanding at the close of business on the record date
for the special meeting and entitled to be cast on such proposal vote "FOR" the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement. A failure to vote your shares of our
common stock or an abstention from voting will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST " the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement. If your shares are
held in "street name" by your broker, bank or other nominee and you do not instruct the nominee how to vote your shares, such failure to instruct your nominee will have
the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement. 

Q: What vote of Datalink shareholders is required to approve the other proposals to be voted upon at the special meeting? 

A: Each of the advisory (non-binding) proposal to approve certain compensation that may be paid or become payable to the named executive officers of Datalink in
connection with the merger and the proposal to adjourn the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, including to solicit additional proxies or in the absence of a
quorum, requires that more shares are voted "FOR" such proposal than "AGAINST."

Table of Contents

An abstention with respect to either proposal and a failure to vote your shares of our common stock on either proposal (including a failure of your broker, bank or other
nominee to vote shares held on your behalf), assuming a quorum is present, will not have the effect of either a vote "FOR" or a vote "AGAINST" such proposals.

Q: How does our board recommend that I vote? 

A: Our board unanimously recommends that our shareholders vote: 

• "FOR" the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement; 

• "FOR" the advisory (non-binding) proposal to approve certain compensation that may be paid or become payable to our named executive officers in connection
with the merger; and 

• "FOR" the proposal regarding adjournment of the special meeting.

For a discussion of the factors that our board considered in determining to recommend the approval of the merger agreement, please see the section entitled "The Merger
(Proposal 1)—Reasons for our Board's Recommendation in Favor of the Merger" beginning on page 35. In addition, in considering the recommendation of our board
with respect to the merger agreement, you should be aware that some of our directors and executive officers have potential interests that may be different from, or in
addition to, the interests of our shareholders generally. For a discussion of these interests, please see the section entitled "The Merger (Proposal 1)—Interests of Datalink's
Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger" beginning on page 48.

Q: How do Datalink's directors and officers intend to vote? 

A: Each of our directors has agreed with Insight that they will vote their shares in favor of the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement and a proposal to adjourn
the meeting, if necessary or appropriate, and we expect the directors to also vote their shares in favor of the other proposal to be considered at the special meeting. See
"The Voting Agreement" beginning on page 78. We currently expect that our executive officers will also vote their shares in favor of the proposal to approve and adopt the
merger agreement and the other proposals to be considered at the special meeting, although they have no obligation to do so. 

Q: What will happen if shareholders do not approve the advisory (non-binding) proposal on certain compensation that may be paid or become payable to
Datalink's named executive officers in connection with the merger? 

A: The inclusion of this proposal is required by the SEC rules; however, the approval of this proposal is not a condition to the completion of the merger and the vote on this
proposal is an advisory vote by shareholders and is not binding on Datalink or Insight. If the merger agreement is approved by Datalink shareholders and the merger is
completed, the merger-related compensation will be paid to Datalink's named executive officers in accordance with the terms of their compensation agreements and
arrangements even if shareholders do not approve this proposal. 

Q: What do I need to do now? How do I vote my shares of our common stock? 

A: We urge you to read this entire document carefully, including its annexes and the documents incorporated by reference, and to consider how the merger affects you. Your
vote is important, regardless of the number of shares of our common stock you own. See page i at the beginning of this proxy statement for instructions on how to vote
your shares in person or by proxy over the internet, by telephone or by mail.

Q: Can I revoke my proxy? 

A: Yes. You may revoke your proxy and change your vote at any time before your proxy is voted at the annual meeting. To revoke your proxy, you must (a) submit a new
proxy with a more recent date than that of the first proxy given before 11:59 P.M. Eastern Time on January 4, 2017 by (1) following the Internet voting instructions or
(2) following the telephone voting instructions; (b) complete, sign, date and return a new proxy card to us, which must be received by us before the time of the meeting;
or (c) if you are a registered shareholder, attend the meeting in person and deliver a proper written notice of revocation of your proxy. Attendance at the meeting will not
by itself revoke a previously granted proxy. Unless you decide to vote your shares in person, you should revoke your prior proxy in the same way you initially submitted
it—that is, by Internet, telephone or mail. 

Q: Will my shares of our common stock held in "street name" or another form of record ownership be combined for voting purposes with shares I hold of record? 

A: No. Because any shares of our common stock you may hold in "street name" will be deemed to be held by a different shareholder (that is, your custodial bank, broker or
other financial nominee) than any shares of our common stock you hold of record, any shares of our common stock held in "street name" will not be combined for voting
purposes with shares of our common stock you hold of record. Similarly, if you own shares of our common stock in various registered forms, such as jointly with your
spouse, as trustee of a trust or as custodian for a minor, you will receive, and will need to sign and return, a separate proxy card for those shares of our common stock
because they are held in a different form of record ownership. Shares of our common stock held by a corporation or business entity must be voted by an authorized officer
of the entity. Please indicate title or authority when completing and signing the proxy card. Shares of our common stock held in an individual retirement account must be
voted under the rules governing the account. This means that, to ensure all your shares are voted at the special meeting, you should read carefully any proxy materials
received and follow the instructions included therewith. 

Q: What does it mean if I get more than one proxy card or voting instruction card? 

A: If your shares of our common stock are registered differently or are held in more than one account, you will receive more than one proxy or voting instruction card. Please
complete and return all of the proxy cards and voting instruction cards you receive (or submit each of your proxies by telephone or the internet, if available to you) to
ensure that all of your shares of our common stock are voted. 

Q: What happens if I sell my shares of our common stock before completion of the merger? 

A: In order to receive the merger consideration, you must hold your shares of our common stock through completion of the merger. Consequently, if you transfer your shares
of our common stock before completion of the merger, you will have transferred your right to receive the merger consideration in the merger. 

The record date for shareholders entitled to vote at the special meeting is earlier than the consummation of the merger. If you transfer your shares of our common stock
after the record date but before the closing of the merger, you will have the right to vote at the special meeting but not the right to receive the merger consideration.

Q: Should I send in my stock certificates or other evidence of ownership now? 

A: No. After the merger is completed, you will receive a letter of transmittal and related materials from the paying agent for the merger with detailed written instructions for
exchanging your shares

of our common stock evidenced by stock certificates for the merger consideration. If your shares of our common stock are held in "street name" by your broker, bank or
other nominee, you may receive instructions from your broker, bank or other nominee as to what action, if any, you need to take to effect the surrender of your "street
name" shares in exchange for the merger consideration. Do not send in your certificates now.

Q: Where can I find the voting results of the special meeting? 

A: We intend to announce preliminary voting results at the special meeting and publish final results in a Current Report on Form 8-K that will be filed with the SEC
following the special meeting. All reports that we file with the SEC are publicly available when filed. See "Where You Can Find Additional Information" on page 89 of
this proxy statement. 

Q: Where can I find more information about Datalink? 

A: You can find more information about us from various sources described in the section entitled "Where You Can Find Additional Information" on page 89. 

Q: Who can help answer my other questions?

THE SPECIAL MEETING 

        We are furnishing this document to Datalink shareholders as part of the solicitation of proxies by our board for use at the special meeting or any adjournment or
postponement thereof. This document provides Datalink shareholders with the information they need to know to be able to vote or instruct their vote to be cast at the special
meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof.

Date, Time and Place of the Special Meeting 

        This document is being furnished to our shareholders as part of the solicitation of proxies by our board for use at the special meeting to be held at Datalink's principal
executive offices located at 10050 Crosstown Circle, Suite 500, Eden Prairie, Minnesota 55344, on Thursday, January 5, 2017 at 9:00 a.m. local time, or at any adjournment or
postponement thereof.

        To attend the meeting, you will need to present valid photo identification, such as a driver's license or passport, and proof of ownership of our common stock. If your shares
are held in the name of a broker, bank or other nominee, you will need to present a recent brokerage statement or letter from such entity reflecting your stock ownership as of the
record date.

        If you are not a holder of record as of the record date, you may be admitted to the meeting only if you have a valid legal proxy from a holder of record as of the record date
who has obtained an admission ticket. You must present that proxy and admission ticket, as well as a form of valid photo identification, at the entrance to the meeting.

Purposes of the Special Meeting 

        At the special meeting, Datalink shareholders will be asked to consider and vote on the following proposals:

• to approve and adopt the merger agreement, dated as of November 6, 2016, by and among Datalink, Insight and Merger Sub, a wholly owned subsidiary of
Insight; 

• to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, certain compensation that may be paid or become payable to Datalink's named executive officers in connection
with the merger, the value of which is disclosed in the table in the section of this document entitled "The Merger (Proposal 1)—Interests of Datalink's Directors
and Executive Officers in the Merger" beginning on page 48; and 

• to approve the adjournment of the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, including to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of
the special meeting to approve the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement or in the absence of a quorum.

        Our shareholders must approve and adopt the merger agreement for the merger to occur. If our shareholders fail to approve and adopt the merger agreement, the merger will
not occur. A copy of the merger agreement is attached to this document as Annex A, and the material provisions of the merger agreement are described in the section entitled
"The Merger Agreement" beginning on page 61.

        The vote on executive compensation payable in connection with the merger is a vote separate and apart from the vote to approve and adopt the merger agreement.
Accordingly, a shareholder may vote to approve the executive compensation and vote not to approve and adopt the merger agreement and vice versa. Because the vote on
executive compensation is advisory in nature only, it will not be binding on either Datalink or Insight. Accordingly, if the merger agreement is approved by Datalink shareholders
and the merger is completed, the merger-related compensation may be paid to Datalink's executive officers even if the shareholders fail to approve the proposal.

Record Date and Quorum 

        The holders of record of our common stock as of the close of business on November 23, 2016, the record date for the special meeting, are entitled to receive notice of and to
vote at the special meeting. At the close of business on the record date, 22,256,459 shares of our common stock were outstanding.

        The presence at the special meeting, in person or represented by proxy, of the holders of record of a majority of our common stock outstanding at the close of business on
the record date will constitute a quorum. Once a share is represented at the special meeting, it will be counted for the purpose of determining a quorum at the special meeting.
However, if a new record date is set for an adjourned special meeting, then a new quorum will have to be established. Proxies received but marked as abstentions will be included
in the calculation of the number of shares considered to be present at the special meeting.

Required Vote 

        Each share of our common stock outstanding at the close of business on the record date is entitled to one vote on each of the proposals to be considered at the special
meeting.

        For Datalink to complete the merger, Datalink shareholders holding a majority of the shares of our common stock outstanding at the close of business on the record date and
entitled to vote on such proposal must vote "FOR" the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement. A failure to vote your shares of our common stock or an abstention
from voting will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement.

        Approval of each of the advisory (non-binding) proposal on certain compensation that may be paid or become payable to Datalink's named executive officers in connection
with the merger and the adjournment proposal requires that more shares are voted "FOR" than "AGAINST" such proposal. An abstention with respect to either proposal and a
failure to vote your shares of our common stock (including a failure of your broker, bank or other nominee to vote shares held on your behalf), assuming a quorum is present, will
not have the effect of either a vote "FOR" or a vote "AGAINST" these proposals.

Voting by Datalink's Directors and Executive Officers 

        At the close of business on the record date, our directors and executive officers were entitled to vote approximately 1,814,504 shares of our common stock, which in the
aggregate represents approximately 8.2% of the shares of our common stock issued and outstanding on that date. Each of our directors has agreed with Insight that they will vote
their shares in favor of the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement and a proposal to adjourn the meeting, if necessary or appropriate, and we expect the directors to
also vote their shares in favor of the other proposal to be considered at the special meeting. See "The Voting Agreement" beginning on page 78. We currently expect that our
executive officers will also vote their shares in favor of the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement and the other proposals to be considered at the special meeting,
although they have no obligation to do so.

Table of Contents

        A total of 11,128,230 votes are needed to approve and adopt the merger agreement. Approximately 1,558,264 shares are held by our directors and subject to the voting
agreement. Therefore, approximately 9,569,966 additional votes entitled to be cast by shareholders other than our directors must be cast to approve and adopt of the merger
agreement in order to approve the transaction.

Voting; Proxies; Revocation 

Attendance

        All holders of shares of our common stock as of the close of business on November 23, 2016, the record date, including shareholders of record and beneficial owners of our
common stock registered in the "street name" of a broker, bank or other nominee, are invited to attend the special meeting. If you are a shareholder of record, please be prepared
to provide valid photo identification, such as a driver's license or passport, and proof of ownership of our common stock. If your shares are held in the name of a broker, bank or
other nominee, you will need to present a recent brokerage statement or letter from such entity reflecting your stock ownership as of the record date. If you do not provide photo
identification or comply with the other procedures outlined in this document, you will not be admitted to the special meeting. For security reasons, you and your bags may be
subject to search prior to your admittance to the meeting.

        If you are not a holder of record as of the record date, you may be admitted to the meeting only if you have a valid legal proxy from a holder of record as of the record date.
You must present that proxy, as well as a form of valid photo identification, at the entrance to the meeting.

Voting in Person

        Shareholders of record will be able to vote in person at the special meeting. We will give you a ballot when you arrive. If you are not a shareholder of record but instead hold
your shares of our common stock in "street name" through a broker, bank or other nominee, you must provide a legal proxy executed in your favor from your broker, bank or
other nominee in order to be able to vote in person at the special meeting. Attending the meeting in person does not itself constitute a vote on any proposal.

Providing Voting Instructions by Proxy

        To ensure that your shares of our common stock are voted at the special meeting, we recommend that you provide voting instructions promptly by proxy, even if you plan to
attend the special meeting in person.

Shares of Common Stock Held by Record Holder

        If you are a shareholder of record, you may provide voting instructions by proxy using one of the methods described below.

        To vote over the internet, go to the web address www.proxyvote.com and follow the instructions for voting. Have your proxy card available when you access the web page. If
you vote over the internet, please do not mail your proxy card.

        To vote by telephone, dial 1 (800) 690-6903 in the United States from any touch-tone telephone and follow the instructions. Have your proxy card available when you call. If
you vote by telephone, please do not mail your proxy card.

stock with the proxy card. If the merger is completed, the paying agent for the merger will send you a letter of transmittal and related materials and instructions for exchanging
your shares of our common stock for the merger consideration.

        If you vote by proxy (regardless of whether you vote over the internet, by telephone or by mail), your votes must be received by 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, on January 4,
2017 to be counted.

        Your proxy card will count as a "vote" if you sign, date and return your proxy card without indicating how you wish to vote with respect to a proposal. In this case, your
proxy will be voted "FOR" such proposal.

        A failure to vote or an abstention will have the same effect as voting "AGAINST" the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement. An abstention and, assuming a
quorum is present, a failure to vote will not have the effect of either a vote "FOR" or a vote "AGAINST" on the other two proposals.

Shares of Common Stock Held in "Street Name"

        If you hold your shares in "street name" through a broker, bank or other nominee, you should follow the directions provided by your broker, bank or other nominee
regarding how to instruct your broker, bank or other nominee to vote your shares. Without those instructions, your shares will not be voted on any of the proposals, which will
have the same effect as voting "AGAINST" the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement, but, assuming a quorum is present, will not have the effect of either a vote
"FOR" or a vote "AGAINST" the other two proposals.

        In accordance with the rules of Nasdaq, brokers, banks and other nominees that hold shares of our common stock in "street name" for their customers do not have
discretionary authority to vote the shares with respect to the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement, the advisory (non-binding) proposal to approve certain
compensation that may be paid or become payable to the named executive officers of Datalink in connection with the merger, or the adjournment of the special meeting, if
necessary or appropriate, including to solicit additional proxies or in the absence of a quorum. Accordingly, if brokers, banks or other nominees do not receive specific voting
instructions from the beneficial owner of such shares, they may not vote such shares with respect to these proposals. Therefore, unless you attend the special meeting in person
with a properly executed legal proxy from your broker, bank or other nominee, your failure to provide instructions to your broker, bank or other nominee will result in your
shares of our common stock not being present at the meeting and not being voted on any of the proposals. Consequently, there cannot be any broker non-votes occurring in
connection with any of the proposals at the special meeting.

Revocation of Proxies

        Any person giving a proxy pursuant to this solicitation has the power to revoke and change it at any time before it is voted. If you are a shareholder of record, you may
revoke your proxy by:

• submitting a new proxy card with a later date, which is received by Datalink prior to the final vote at the special meeting; 

• using the telephone or internet proxy submission procedures described above, or by completing, signing, dating and returning a new proxy card by mail to
Datalink; 

• attending the special meeting and voting in person; or 

• delivering a written notice of revocation by mail to Datalink in care of the Secretary at 10050 Crosstown Circle, Suite 500, Eden Prairie, MN 55344, Attn:
Secretary, which is received by Datalink prior to the final vote at the special meeting.

Table of Contents

        Please note that only your last-dated proxy will count. Attending the special meeting without taking one of the actions described above will not in itself revoke your proxy. If
you want to revoke your proxy by mailing a new proxy card to Datalink or by sending a written notice of revocation to Datalink, you should ensure that you send your new proxy
card or written notice of revocation in sufficient time for it to be received by Datalink before the special meeting.

        Please note that if you hold your shares in "street name" and you have instructed a broker, bank or other nominee to vote your shares, you should instead follow the
instructions received from your broker, bank or other nominee to revoke your prior voting instructions. If you hold your shares in "street name," you may also revoke a prior
proxy by voting in person at the special meeting if you obtain a proxy executed in your favor from your broker, bank or other nominee in order to be able to vote in person at the
special meeting.

Abstentions 

        An abstention occurs when a shareholder attends a meeting, either in person or represented by proxy, but abstains from voting. Abstentions will be included in the
calculation of the number of shares of our common stock present or represented at the special meeting for purposes of determining whether a quorum has been achieved.

        Abstaining from voting will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement. The requisite number of shares to approve
the other two proposals is based on the total number of shares voted "FOR" such proposal compared to the number of shares voted "AGAINST" such proposal. If you abstain
from voting with respect to such proposals or do not vote on such proposals, such failure to vote will not have the effect of either a vote "FOR" or a vote "AGAINST" the
advisory (non-binding) proposal on certain compensation that may be paid or become payable to the named executive officers of Datalink in connection with the merger or the
proposal regarding adjournment of the special meeting.

Board of Directors' Recommendation 

        Our board, after considering various factors described in the section entitled "The Merger (Proposal 1)—Reasons for our Board's Recommendation in Favor of the Merger"
beginning on page 35, unanimously determined that the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the merger, are fair to, advisable
and in the best interests of Datalink and our shareholders, and approved the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the merger.

        The Board unanimously recommends that you vote (1) "FOR" the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement, (2) "FOR" the advisory (non-binding) proposal to
approve certain compensation that may be paid or become payable to the named executive officers of Datalink in connection with the merger, and (3) "FOR" the proposal to
adjourn the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, including to solicit additional proxies or in the absence of a quorum.

Solicitation of Proxies 

        Our board is soliciting your proxy, and we will bear the cost of this solicitation of proxies. This includes the charges and expenses of brokerage firms and others for
forwarding solicitation material to beneficial owners of our outstanding common stock. We have retained MacKenzie Partners, Inc. ("MacKenzie"), a proxy solicitation firm, to
assist our board in the solicitation of proxies for the special meeting, and we expect to pay MacKenzie $12,500, plus reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses. Proxies may be
solicited by mail, personal interview, email, telephone, or via the internet by MacKenzie or, without additional compensation, by certain of our directors, officers and employees.

THE MERGER (PROPOSAL 1) 

        The description of the merger in this section and elsewhere in this document is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text of the merger agreement and the
voting agreement, copies of which are attached as Annex A and Annex B and are incorporated by reference into this document. This summary does not purport to be complete
and may not contain all of the information about the merger that is important to you. You are encouraged to read the transaction documents carefully and in their entirety.

Certain Effects of the Merger 

        If the merger agreement is approved by our shareholders and the other conditions to the closing of the merger are either satisfied or waived, Merger Sub will be merged with
and into Datalink, and the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub will cease. Datalink will be the surviving corporation in the merger and will continue its corporate
existence as a Minnesota corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Insight.

        Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the merger agreement, at the effective time, each share of our common stock issued and outstanding immediately before the
effective time (other than cancelled shares and dissenting shares) will be converted into the right to receive $11.25 in cash, without interest, less any required withholding taxes.
At the effective time of the merger, our current shareholders will cease to have ownership interests in the company or rights as its shareholders. Therefore, our current
shareholders will not participate in any of our future earnings or growth and will not benefit from any appreciation in our value.

        Our common stock is currently registered under the Exchange Act and is quoted on Nasdaq under the symbol "DTLK." As a result of the merger, Datalink will cease to be a
publicly traded company and will be a wholly owned subsidiary of Insight. Following the consummation of the merger, our common stock will be delisted from Nasdaq and
deregistered under the Exchange Act, and Datalink will no longer be required to file periodic reports with the SEC with respect to our common stock, in each case in accordance
with applicable law, rules and regulations.

Effects on Datalink if the Merger is Not Completed 

        If the merger agreement is not approved by our shareholders or if the merger is not consummated for any other reason, our shareholders will not receive any payment for
their shares of common stock. Instead, we will remain a public company, the common stock will continue to be listed and traded on Nasdaq and registered under the Exchange
Act and we will continue to file periodic reports with the SEC. In addition, if the merger is not completed, we expect that management will operate the business in a manner
similar to that in which it is being operated today and that our shareholders will continue to be subject to the same risks and opportunities as they currently are, including, among
other things, general industry, economic and market conditions. Accordingly, if the merger is not consummated, there can be no assurance as to the effect of these risks and
opportunities on the future value of your shares of our common stock. From time to time, our board will evaluate and review our business operations, properties, dividend policy
and capitalization, among other things, make such changes as are deemed appropriate and continue to seek to identify strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value. If the
merger agreement is not approved by our shareholders or if the merger is not consummated for any other reason, there can be no assurance that any other transaction acceptable
to us will be offered or that our business, prospects or results of operations will not be adversely impacted.

        If the merger agreement is terminated, under specified circumstances, we may be required to pay Insight a termination fee, as described under "The Merger Agreement—
Termination Fee" on page 76.

Background of the Merger 

        The following chronology summarizes certain key events and contacts that led to the signing of the merger agreement. It does not purport to catalogue every conversation
among our board, members of our management, or our representatives and other parties.

        During the past several years, as part of our ongoing strategic-planning process, our management and our board regularly reviewed and assessed, among other things, our
long-term strategic goals and opportunities, competitive environment, and short- and long-term performance in light of our strategic plan, with the goal of maximizing
shareholder value.

        In January 2016, Paul F. Lidsky, our President and Chief Executive Officer, received an unsolicited request for an in-person meeting with Party A, a strategic party. On
January 19, 2016, Mr. Lidsky met with the President of Party A, and at that meeting received an unsolicited letter from Party A proposing to acquire the Company at a price of
$10.00 in cash per share. The closing price of our common stock on that date was $6.40 per share. At the meeting, the President of Party A provided his views regarding
operational plans and potential synergies, as well as the next steps required in connection with a potential transaction. Mr. Lidsky then discussed the meeting with Jim Ousley,
chair of our board, and Brent Blackey and Greg Meland, two other non-employee members of our board. On January 28, 2016, at the direction of Messrs. Ousley, Blackey and
Meland, Mr. Lidsky followed up with Party A and indicated that our board would need to discuss the proposal but that the proposed price of $10.00 in cash per share was at the
very low end of the range Mr. Lidsky expected our board would consider.

        On January 29, 2016, our board convened to consider the proposal from Party A. Our legal counsel, Faegre Baker Daniels LLP ("FaegreBD"), provided a presentation to our
board regarding their fiduciary duties in connection with a potential sale transaction. Our board then discussed the offer from Party A and the competitive environment in which
we operate, and determined that our management should continue to pursue the opportunity with Party A while being mindful of our board's concerns regarding a potential leak
of a Company sale process. Our board also directed our management to contact representatives of Raymond James, based on their industry expertise and prior presentations
regarding the industry to our board, to determine their interest in serving as our board's financial advisor in connection with the proposed process, which management did on
February 1, 2016. Our management subsequently negotiated the terms of an engagement letter with representatives of Raymond James and, after our board approved the
engagement letter, it was executed on February 4, 2016. We also negotiated and entered into a non-disclosure agreement with Party A on February 4, 2016, and provided Party A
with limited financial information regarding the Company in a data room that opened on February 24, 2016.

        As we requested in mid-March 2016, on March 29, 2016, Party A provided a written proposal to acquire the Company for a price of at least $10.30 per share, with the offer
price potentially being as high as $10.75 per share if certain financial criteria were met. The offer was contingent on the receipt of financing by Party A. The closing price of our
common stock on that date was $8.51 per share. Party A affirmed substantially all of these transaction terms, including the price per share, in an updated indication of interest
received on April 12, 2016. The closing price of our common stock on that date was $9.13 per share.

        During February, March, April and May, and including after Party A's initial and updated indications of interest were received, Mr. Lidsky and representatives of Raymond
James had periodic conversations with Party A regarding a potential sale transaction, including Party A's sources of financing, to determine whether Party A would be able to
consummate a transaction if the parties could agree on terms.

        On April 20, 2016, our board met to consider the proposal from Party A. FaegreBD provided a presentation to our board regarding its fiduciary duties in connection with a
potential sale transaction. Raymond James provided a presentation regarding the terms of the potential transaction with Party A, including price and the likelihood of
consummating a transaction based on the limited information regarding Party A's financing sources that Party A had provided to us and our advisors. Our board then determined
that Raymond James should inform Party A that our board was not interested in pursuing a transaction with Party A at that time, but that our board would consider a definitive
proposal offered by Party A that had a higher likelihood of consummation, based on, among other things, executed commitment letters for financing in an amount sufficient to
fund the transaction, and a higher price. The closing price of our common stock on that date was $8.84 per share.

        On May 25, 2016, our board met to discuss with representatives of Raymond James the financial markets, the systems integrator landscape and the competitive landscape
for the Company, including the pressures that traditional information technology vendors were facing from next-generation technologies and the ongoing erosion of industry
profit margins. Raymond James provided a presentation regarding Datalink's strategic alternatives, including remaining as an independent public company (while considering a
share buyback or dividend), pursuing a consolidation with another company in the industry, or pursuing a sale to a third party. That presentation also included profiles of certain
potential strategic buyers and identified certain financial sponsors that might be interested in acquiring the Company. After this update and presentation, our board discussed
whether the challenges in the industry and competitive landscape for the Company made this a good time to consider a potential sale of the Company. At the conclusion of the
meeting, our board directed Mr. Lidsky to instruct Raymond James to prepare for a sale process, subject to confirmation at a board meeting on June 1, 2016, which Mr. Lidsky
did on May 26, 2016. The closing price of our common stock on May 25, 2016 was $8.11 per share.

        At its meeting on June 1, 2016 and after FaegreBD provided a presentation to our board regarding their fiduciary duties in connection with a potential sale transaction, our
board discussed our recent performance and a potential sale in more detail. Raymond James provided a list of potential third-party acquirers to approach during a sale process.
Our board discussed a preliminary timeline for a potential sale, the process for identifying potential participants in a sale process and control of confidential information to
minimize the risk of information leakage. After these discussions, our board authorized Raymond James to identify a list of potential acquirers, including Party A, based on our
board's input, review that list with our management to determine which parties to approach, and begin discussions with potential acquirers to determine interest in acquiring us.
The closing price of our common stock on June 1, 2016 was $8.17 per share.

        On June 6, 2016, Raymond James began contacting potential strategic acquirers, with management's authorization, to gauge their interest in a potential transaction. Potential
participants were selected based on, among other things, their financial capabilities, anticipated interest in conducting transactions similar to the proposed transaction and
acquisition histories. In response to requests from FaegreBD on behalf of our board, Raymond James provided completed questionnaires inquiring as to the existence of potential
conflicts of interest with identified strategic acquirers and financial sponsors. The questionnaires, which confirmed the absence of any material relationship with Insight or the
other potential acquirers, were circulated to our board. Beginning June 6, Raymond James contacted 13 strategic acquirers (including Party A, Party B and Insight), 10 of which
(including Party A, Party B and Insight) signed a non-disclosure agreement, in each case with a standstill clause that terminated upon public announcement of certain transactions
(including the merger), with us. Later in June, Raymond James also contacted 14 financial sponsors (including Party C), 13 of which (including Party C) signed a non-disclosure
agreement, in each case with a standstill clause that terminated upon public announcement of certain transactions (including the merger), with us. Potential acquirers that signed
non-disclosure agreements were provided with a management presentation and access to a data room to allow them to conduct limited due diligence to determine their interest in
a potential transaction.

        Beginning on June 21, 2016 through July 7, 2016, our management team participated in executive presentations with eight parties that had expressed an interest in acquiring
us. An executive presentation was conducted with Insight on June 28, 2016. Throughout July, we also responded to limited due diligence requests from the interested parties.
Raymond James also communicated to the interested parties that initial indications of interest were due on July 18, 2016 from strategic buyers and July 21, 2016 from financial
sponsors.

        On July 27, 2016, our board met for an update on the sale process, including a review of the initial indications of interest. FaegreBD provided a presentation to our board
regarding their fiduciary duties in connection with a potential sale transaction. Raymond James reviewed the initial indications of interest that had been received. Four strategic
parties (in addition to Party A, which submitted the proposal described above on March 29, 2016), including Insight and Party B, and five financial sponsors, including Party C,
submitted initial indications of interest. The highest price included in an initial indication of interest was submitted by Insight, with a range of $10.75-11.75 per share. Party B
submitted a range of $10.50-11.00 per share, and Party C submitted a price of $11.00 per share. The other initial indications of interest included prices from a low of $8.80 per
share to a high of $10.50 per share. Raymond James also reviewed the conditions and significant open diligence items with respect to the initial indications of interests, as well as
potential alternatives with respect to the sale process for our board to consider. FaegreBD reviewed potential transaction structures, a transaction timeline and other transaction-
related matters with our board. Mr. Lidsky addressed the impacts a transaction and the sale process might have on us. After discussion, our board directed our management and
the Raymond James team to continue to pursue a transaction with the five parties that submitted the highest-priced initial indications of interest, including Insight, Party B and
Party C. The closing price of our common stock on July 27, 2016 was $7.82 per share.

        After the close of trading on July 28, 2016, we announced our results for the second quarter ending June 30, 2016, and the closing price of our common stock on July 29,
2016 was $8.58 per share.

        Our management team provided management presentations to the five parties that were selected by our board. The presentation to the Insight management team was
conducted on August 4, 2016, the presentation to Party C was conducted on August 8, 2016, and the presentation to Party B was conducted on August 15, 2016. Presentations to
the two other participants were made on August 5 and 10, 2016. During August 2016, the five parties were also provided with additional diligence materials relating to the
Company, we responded to certain diligence requests submitted by the parties and our management team held several meetings with representatives of the parties, including
Insight, Party B and Party C, on various matters, including human resources and benefits, sales and financial matters.

        Raymond James provided a draft of the merger agreement by email to Party B on August 5, 2016, to Insight on August 9, 2016, and to Party C on August 15, 2016. During
August, FaegreBD had telephone conferences with legal counsel for each of Insight, Party B and Party C to discuss transaction structure and requirements under Minnesota law.

        On August 16, 2016, Raymond James provided each of Insight, Party B and Party C with an instruction letter relating to their final proposals. The letter instructed each party
to submit its proposal by 5:00 p.m. Eastern time on August 30, 2016, and, among other items, to include a mark-up of the merger agreement with the proposal.

        On August 30, 2016, each of Parties B and C submitted their final proposals to acquire us, and on August 31, 2016, Insight submitted its proposal. Party B offered a price of
$12.00 per share and indicated that it expected to be able to execute a definitive merger agreement within 30 days from the date it was granted exclusivity. Party B indicated that
its proposal was contingent on the satisfactory completion of due diligence calls to certain third parties, and provided negotiated commitment letters required to finance its
proposal. Party B's mark-up of the merger agreement added a financing

structure that potentially extended the timeline to closing and included a reverse termination fee payable by Party B if it did not obtain its debt financing, among other matters.

        Party C offered a price of $11.00 per share and indicated that it expected to be able to execute a definitive merger agreement within 30 to 45 days from the date it was
granted exclusivity. Party C indicated that its proposal was contingent on the satisfactory completion of due diligence calls to certain third parties. Although Party C's markup did
not include any financing contingency or reverse termination fee, it indicated that it was still exploring third-party financing.

        Insight offered a price of $11.75 per share and indicated that it expected to be able to execute a definitive merger agreement within 30 days from the date it was granted
exclusivity. Insight indicated that it required no new financing for the acquisition. Insight's mark-up of the merger agreement added a condition regarding continued employment
of certain unspecified individuals, increased the termination fee from 2.5% of enterprise value as provided in our auction draft to 4.0% of enterprise value, and indicated that
certain performance awards for which vesting conditions had not been met would be forfeited at closing, among other things.

        On August 31, 2016, our management, Raymond James and FaegreBD convened for an initial review of the financial and legal terms of the three proposals. Our
management instructed Raymond James to contact each of the three parties to suggest they make certain initial improvements to their proposals in order to make them more
competitive before our board met to consider the proposals. Based on these instructions, Raymond James contacted Party B to convey that our board was likely to be concerned
with the risks and delay associated with their financing provisions and to also gauge their willingness to increase their $12.00 per share price, contacted Party C to suggest that
their price was not competitive and to request greater clarity on their approach to financing and related contingencies, and contacted Insight to suggest that their price was not
competitive and to request removal of the employee closing condition.

        On September 1, 2016, our board met to consider the three proposals. FaegreBD provided a presentation to our board regarding their fiduciary duties in connection with a
potential sale transaction. Raymond James reviewed the sale process to date, and noted that two of the five interested parties had not submitted proposals. Raymond James then
reviewed the key terms of the proposals that had been received, noted that two of the bidders, Insight and Party B, were strategic acquirers and that one, Party C, was a financial
sponsor, and summarized the remaining diligence items highlighted by each of the parties.

        When reviewing the Insight proposal, Raymond James noted that the proposal did not include any financing contingency. Our board also discussed with Raymond James the
likelihood of Insight increasing its price from $11.75 to $12.00 per share. In addition, Raymond James advised that Insight had agreed to delete the closing condition relating to
continued employment of certain individuals.

        Our board also discussed with Raymond James the fact that Party B's proposal of $12.00 per share was a considerable increase from its initial verbal indication of interest
earlier in the process, and that it therefore would be unlikely that Party B would be willing to increase its offer price further. Our board also discussed the fact that the proposal
from Party B would require financing, that Party B's proposal included a financing structure with a reverse termination fee as our sole remedy for Party B's failure to obtain
financing, and that the proposal included a request to conduct certain third party diligence calls. However, Raymond James explained that Party B had, in response to initial
feedback, revised its proposal to eliminate or reduce the delays associated with their financing.

        Raymond James noted that Party C had updated its proposal and increased its price to $11.25 per share and agreed not to include any financing contingency in the merger
agreement. Raymond James also provided the update that the two other interested parties that remained in the process but had not

submitted proposals were still considering whether they would submit proposals. Both parties ultimately determined not to submit proposals.

        FaegreBD then reviewed the summary of the legal terms and conditions offered by each of Insight, Party B and Party C, including the request by Insight and Party B for
customary voting agreements in favor of the proposed transaction from our directors. Our board discussed the terms of the proposals, including the possibility that Insight would
increase its offer price to $12.00 per share, and noted that the financing structure and third-party diligence requests proposed by Party B were problematic when compared with
the Insight proposal, which appeared to present a more straightforward path to signing and closing. Our board also considered and discussed the likelihood that further
negotiations with either Party B or Party C or further engagement with the other two remaining potential acquirers would result in a proposal superior to the proposal offered by
Insight, in particular if Insight increased its price to $12.00 per share, in light of the financing arrangements and third party diligence requirements contemplated by Party B and
the price offered and financing arrangements contemplated by Party C. Following additional discussions regarding the terms of the proposals, our board directed our management
and our advisors to further negotiate terms of the Insight proposal before our board would consider Insight's request for a 30-day exclusivity period, and to present the results of
those negotiations to our board at a meeting on September 2, 2016. The closing price of our common stock on September 1, 2016 was $9.98 per share.

        On September 1, 2016, Insight increased its offer price to $12.00 per share.

        Also on September 1, 2016, FaegreBD contacted representatives of Sullivan & Cromwell LLP, Insight's legal counsel, to discuss certain terms in Insight's proposed merger
agreement. The negotiations resulted in, among other things, a reduction of the termination fee from 4.0% of enterprise value as proposed by Insight to 3.5% of enterprise value
(we proposed 3.0% of enterprise value in response to Insight's proposal of 4.0%, and Insight countered with 3.5%, which we agreed to), certain changes favorable to us regarding
the scope of the "intervening event" limitation on our board's ability to change its recommendation, agreement on the terms of the post-closing employee benefits covenant and
treatment of certain performance units, and agreement on governing law and venue in Minnesota.

        On September 2, 2016, our board convened for a report regarding negotiations with Insight. Raymond James noted that Insight had increased its proposed price to $12.00
per share. FaegreBD then updated our board on the negotiations with Insight regarding certain legal terms, and indicated that Insight had responded favorably on most of the
terms. FaegreBD also reported that Insight was unwilling to shorten its requested exclusivity period from 30 days to 20 days. Our board discussed the improved terms, and
directed our management to grant exclusivity to Insight for 30 days to negotiate the terms of Insight's acquisition of the Company.

        Later on September 2, 2016, the parties signed an exclusivity agreement with an expiration time of 11:59 p.m. Eastern time on September 30, 2016. The closing price of our
common stock on September 2, 2016 was $9.93 per share.

        Over the next few weeks, the parties and their advisors negotiated the terms of the merger agreement and related transaction documents. Insight also conducted additional
due diligence regarding the Company, including with respect to certain accounting matters and proposed adjustments to be made to our historical financial statements in the pro
forma combined financial statements to be included in the Form 8-K that would be required to be filed by Insight in connection with the closing of the merger (such adjustments,
the "pro forma 8-K adjustments"). On September 23, 2016, the parties, their legal advisors and their accounting firms convened a telephone conference to discuss the proposed
pro forma 8-K adjustments and Insight's related requests. The parties agreed to further consider the issue. On September 26, 2016, representatives of Sullivan & Cromwell
provided FaegreBD with draft language for the merger agreement that, among other things, provided for completion of the

pro forma 8-K adjustments before closing and a provision requiring the receipt of the consent of our independent auditors to the inclusion of their report on our 2015 audited
financial statements filed with the SEC in a Form 8-K to be filed by Insight and of certain management representation letters as a condition to closing. Insight also proposed to
include certain disclosure regarding our projected revenue and Insight's adjustments in the Form 8-K to be filed by Insight upon signing of the merger agreement. On
September 27 and September 28, Insight, representatives of Sullivan & Cromwell and representatives of Raymond James and FaegreBD exchanged revised drafts of the proposed
disclosure and covenants and additional discussion ensued. On September 28, 2016, Mr. Lamneck and Ms. Bryan informed Mr. Lidsky and Mr. Barnum that unless we would
agree to Insight's requests that were discussed on September 23, 2016, and in subsequent drafts, Insight would not be willing to enter into the merger agreement.

        On September 29, 2016, our board met to discuss the status of the proposed transaction. FaegreBD provided a presentation to our board regarding their fiduciary duties in
connection with a potential sale transaction. FaegreBD also summarized the requests from Insight relating to the pro forma 8-K adjustments, including their insistence that the
accounting work related to the adjustments be completed and the consent from our auditor relating to including their report on our financial statements be obtained before
closing, and the risks and considerations relating to moving these tasks from after closing, when they more typically occur, to before closing. Our auditors also summarized the
conversations that they had with Insight and its auditors and alternative approaches offered to address Insight's objectives and concerns. Our board discussed the requested pro
forma 8-K adjustments and asked further questions of our legal counsel and auditors. Our board discussed the fact that the exclusivity period granted to Insight would expire on
September 30, 2016 at 11:59 p.m. Eastern time if it was not extended, and that we would be free to contact other interested parties, including Party B and Party C, after
exclusivity expired. It was noted that the pro forma combined financial statements are required because of Insight's reporting requirements as a public company and we believed
it would not represent any issue for Party B or Party C. Following further discussion, our board directed management to allow Insight's exclusivity period to expire and to
approach Party B and Party C, while continuing to engage with Insight regarding Insight's requests. On September 29, 2016, Mr. Lidsky contacted Mr. Lamneck to inform him
that our board was not willing to accept Insight's requests but was willing to discuss further. Mr. Lamneck informed Mr. Lidsky that the requests were a requirement to move
forward. The closing price of our common stock on September 29, 2016 was $10.61 per share.

        On October 1, 2016, Raymond James contacted Party B and Party C by telephone, each of whom expressed interest on those calls in reengaging in the process. Raymond
James also sent Party B and Party C revised drafts of the merger agreement, reflecting comments from us to the drafts they provided on August 30 and 31, 2016 as part of their
earlier proposals. On October 3, 2016, Party B informed Raymond James that after they submitted their proposal on August 30, 2016, they had entered into another transaction
that would need to be completed before they would be able to re-engage in full on the proposed acquisition of the Company. On October 4, 2016, Party C reaffirmed its earlier
offer of $11.25 per share.

        On October 4, 2016, Mr. Lidsky reached out to Mr. Lamneck to explore continued discussions regarding the potential transaction. Representatives of Raymond James also
reached out to Ms. Bryan. On October 4 and 5, 2016, Mr. Brent Blackey, the chair of our audit committee, and Ms. Bryan had calls during which they discussed the requested pro
forma 8-K adjustments and related provisions. On October 6, 2016, Samuel Cowley, Senior Vice President and General Counsel of Insight, informed representatives of Raymond
James that in order for Insight to be willing to perform additional work regarding the pro forma 8-K adjustments, Insight would need to see a revised draft of the merger
agreement and an exclusivity agreement. On October 6, 2016, FaegreBD provided a revised draft of the merger agreement to Insight and its counsel responding to the open points
in the draft. Representatives of Sullivan & Cromwell circulated a revised draft of the merger agreement to FaegreBD on October 8,

2016, and indicated that Insight would not resume transaction negotiations unless we agreed to Insight's requests relating to the requested pro forma 8-K adjustments and
provided a new exclusivity period to Insight.

        On October 10, 2016, Mr. Lidsky, Mr. Ousley, Mr. Blackey and representatives from Raymond James and FaegreBD convened via telephone conference to discuss the open
items in the transaction and the merger agreement, which included certain representations and warranties and certain restrictions placed on us between signing and closing
relating to material contracts and employee benefit matters. Mr. Lidsky then called Mr. Lamneck to discuss the open items and indicated that our board would likely be willing to
provide an exclusivity period to Insight until October 30, 2016 if there was a satisfactory resolution of the open items. From October 10-13, 2016, members of our and Insight's
management teams and their legal counsel held calls to discuss open items remaining in the merger agreement and the pro forma 8-K adjustments. On October 13, 2016,
Mr. Lidsky informed Mr. Cowley and Helen Johnson, CFO, North America, of Insight, that we were prepared to move forward with the proposed transaction and agreed to
provide Insight with further access to due diligence, accepting Insight's proposed covenants regarding the pro forma combined financial statements. On October 18, 2016,
FaegreBD provided a revised draft of the merger agreement to representatives of Sullivan & Cromwell.

        On October 20, 2016, representatives of Sullivan & Cromwell reiterated Insight's requirement for an exclusivity agreement between us and Insight. The Company delayed
execution of the exclusivity agreement until after its October 26, 2016 board meeting. Insight and our management had calls regarding open items between October 19 and 25,
2016. During this period, we continued to respond to diligence requests from Insight.

        Also on October 20, 2016, we posted to the data room our draft third quarter financial statements and our expectations for the fourth quarter, which were available to Insight
and to Party B. Party C was not provided this financial information because its re-affirmed proposed price of $11.25 per share was less than the price of $12.00 per share
proposed by Insight and Party B and because Party C had less certainty of closing. On October 24, 2016, Party B indicated that it was not willing to acquire the Company at that
time and was withdrawing its earlier proposal, based on, among other things, our draft third quarter financial statements. On October 24, 2016, we provided to Insight a draft of
our third quarter GAAP financial statements.

        On October 26, 2016, our board met to discuss the potential sale to Insight. Prior to the meeting, the members of our board were provided with materials relating to the
proposed acquisition, including, among other things, the current draft of the merger agreement, a summary of the material terms of the merger agreement and other transaction
documents prepared by FaegreBD, and a preliminary financial analysis of the proposed transaction prepared by Raymond James. FaegreBD provided a presentation to our board
regarding their fiduciary duties in connection with a potential sale transaction. The directors received an update on the transaction's progress since their last meeting, including
with respect to the pro forma 8-K adjustments, and Raymond James noted that Party B, after its review of our third quarter financial statements, was no longer willing to acquire
us on the terms set forth in its earlier proposal. Raymond James also reviewed with our board the financial terms of the offer from Insight. Our board discussed Party C's lower
proposed price of $11.25 per share and the greater certainty of closing offered by the Insight proposal. After discussing the transaction status, our board directed our management
to contact Insight to confirm that Insight was still interested in the transaction and to enter into an exclusivity agreement with Insight for an exclusivity period ending
November 7, 2016.

        After our board meeting, Mr. Lidsky and a representative from Raymond James contacted Mr. Lamneck, who confirmed Insight's offer, including, in particular, its offer
price of $12.00 per share. On October 26, 2016, we executed the exclusivity agreement with Insight granting Insight exclusivity through 9:00 a.m. on November 7, 2016, during
which time Insight would continue its due diligence and

the parties would continue to negotiate the merger agreement. The closing price of our common stock on October 26, 2016 was $10.03 per share.

        On October 28, 2016, Ms. Bryan contacted Mr. Lidsky to inform him that following completion of Insight's earning release process Insight's senior management had some
concerns after focusing its attention on our third quarter financial statements and fourth quarter expectations and would like to conduct a detailed financial review of the third
quarter results and expectations for the fourth quarter. Over the next several days, we and Insight had several discussions and exchanged additional information as part of such
financial review. Additional commercial and legal due diligence continued during this period as well.

        Also in the period after our board meeting, our management discussed integration plans and communication plans relating to the transaction announcement with Insight
management. The parties' counsel continued to negotiate terms of the merger agreement, in particular the interim operating covenants, and other transaction documents.

        On November 1, 2016, Mr. Lamneck and Ms. Bryan called Mr. Lidsky to inform him that based on the third quarter financial results, including the gross margin erosion in
the third quarter, and additional information provided, Insight was reducing its offer price to $11.00 per share. Mr. Lidsky discussed the revised offer price with certain members
of our board, including Mr. Ousley. On November 2, 2016, after a call with Raymond James and Mr. Ousley, Mr. Lidsky contacted Mr. Lamneck and requested that Insight
increase its revised offer price to $11.25 per share. On a subsequent call, Mr. Lamneck agreed to the increased offer price of $11.25 per share.

        On November 2, 2016, our board convened to discuss Insight's revised offer price in light of our third quarter results, including the gross margin erosion in the third quarter,
and our fourth quarter expectations. FaegreBD provided a presentation to our board regarding their fiduciary duties in connection with a potential sale transaction. After
discussion of the revised offer price, the board's belief that further negotiations with Insight or the other interested parties would not result in a proposal superior to the proposal
offered by Insight, the trends and uncertainties affecting our business as an independent public company and the greater certainty of closing offered by the Insight proposal, our
board directed our management to proceed to finalize the documentation for the sale of the Company to Insight at $11.25 per share. The closing price of our common stock on
November 2, 2016 was $9.35 per share.

        Between November 2, 2016 and November 6, 2016, Insight completed its due diligence investigation of the Company and FaegreBD and representatives of Sullivan &
Cromwell completed negotiations of the merger agreement and the related transaction documents. Also during that period, our management and Insight management continued
conversations regarding various topics, including open items in the transaction documents and integration and communications planning.

        On Sunday afternoon, November 6, 2016, our board convened via telephone conference to consider approval of the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated
thereby. Prior to the meeting, the members of our board were provided with materials relating to the proposed acquisition, including, among other things, the current draft of the
merger agreement, a summary of the material terms of the merger agreement and other transaction documents prepared by FaegreBD, and a financial analysis prepared by
Raymond James. At the meeting:

• representatives of FaegreBD reviewed with the directors their fiduciary duties under Minnesota law in connection with their consideration of the merger; 

• representatives of FaegreBD presented a summary of the material terms of the merger agreement and the other transaction documents; and

• Raymond James reviewed with our board its financial analysis of the merger consideration and delivered to our board an oral opinion, which was confirmed by
delivery of a written opinion dated November 6, 2016, to the effect that, as of that date and based on and subject to various assumptions and limitations described
in its opinion, the merger consideration to be received by holders of our common stock, was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.

        Following consideration and discussion of the proposed merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby:

• our board formed a special committee composed solely of disinterested directors who were not, and who had not been, our officers or employees during the prior
five years, in order for the committee to consider the voting agreement, the merger agreement, and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, solely
for purposes of certain Minnesota anti-takeover statutes; 

• the special committee approved the voting agreement, the merger agreement, and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement for purposes of certain
Minnesota anti-takeover statutes and recommended that the full board approve the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby; 

• the compensation committee of our board approved the acceleration and cash-out of our equity awards, as contemplated by the merger agreement, and treatment
of the 2016 bonus and retention bonuses for certain members of our management (as discussed in "—Interests of Datalink's Directors and Executive Officers in
the Merger" on page 48); and 

• our board unanimously (i) approved the merger agreement, the merger, and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement; (ii) declared the merger
agreement, the merger, and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement to be fair, advisable, and in the best interests of the Company and our
shareholders; (iii) directed that the approval of the merger agreement be submitted to a vote at a meeting of our shareholders; and (iv) recommended to our
shareholders that they approve the merger agreement.

        The parties executed the merger agreement during the evening of Sunday, November 6, 2016, and Insight and we issued a joint press release prior to the opening of the
market on Monday, November 7, 2016, announcing the parties' entry into the merger agreement.

Reasons for our Board's Recommendation in Favor of the Merger 

        On November 6, 2016, our board unanimously (i) approved the merger agreement, the merger, and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement;
(ii) declared the merger agreement, the merger, and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement to be fair, advisable, and in the best interests of us and our
shareholders; (iii) directed that the approval of the merger agreement be submitted to a vote at a meeting of our shareholders; and (iv) recommended to our shareholders that they
approve the merger agreement.

        In evaluating the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, our board consulted with our executive management,
outside legal counsel and outside financial advisor. In recommending that our shareholders vote their shares of common stock in favor of the proposal to approve and adopt the
merger agreement, our board also considered a number of factors potentially weighing in favor of the merger, including the following (which are not presented in order of relative
importance):

• The belief of our board, after a review of our current and historical financial condition, results of operations, prospects, business strategy, competitive position,
and industry, including the potential impact (which cannot be quantified numerically) of those factors on the trading price

of our common stock, that the value offered to our shareholders under the merger agreement is more favorable to our shareholders than the potential value that
might have resulted from remaining an independent public company, considering:

• The uncertain and volatile demand in the enterprise-class IT services and solutions market; 

• Rapidly changing technologies in the IT services industry, including with respect to data centers and public cloud; 

• Competition from our suppliers and other resellers for the products and services that we sell; 

• Commoditization of data center infrastructure, which our board believes will lead to reduced gross margins over time; 

• Consolidation of our OEM partners, which could lead to a reduction in our growth; and 

• The volatility in our financial performance resulting from various factors, including the factors described above. 

• The challenges and risks that we have faced, and would likely continue to face, if we remained an independent company, including competition from much larger
firms possessing greater financial resources and more comprehensive service offerings, including in some instances our suppliers, recruiting and retention of
qualified personnel, changing client demands and pricing pressures, execution risks involved with the implementation of management's key objectives for
Datalink, the additional costs and burdens involved with being a public company, and general market risks. 

• The risks and uncertainties inherent in our ability to execute on our strategic plan and achieve management's related financial projections, including uncertainties
about our ability to execute on long-term, high-potential opportunities and the other risks and uncertainties described in the section entitled "risk factors" set forth
in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015. 

• The challenges and risks that we would face to significantly increase our service business, as we expect that we would need to rely on acquisitions to reach critical
mass in that business, which would create significant integration risk and would require external financing or the use of our stock as consideration. In addition,
acquisitions of services companies may be dilutive to our earnings given the difference in valuation multiples in services companies. 

• The historic trading ranges of our common stock and the potential trading range of the common stock absent announcement of the merger agreement, and the
possibility that absent such announcement it could take a considerable period of time before the trading price of the common stock would trade at a level in excess
of the per-share merger consideration on a present-value basis. 

• The fact that our board and our senior management and financial advisor sought offers to acquire Datalink from a broad group of 27 potential bidders, including
financial sponsors and strategic bidders, 23 of whom entered into confidentiality agreements with us and received information related to us. 

• The fact that our board and our senior management, in coordination with our independent legal and financial advisor, implemented a robust sale process, including
requiring Insight, Party B and Party C to submit and affirm best and final acquisition proposals. 

• The relationship of the per-share merger consideration to the trading price of our common stock, including that the per-share merger consideration constituted a
premium of approximately

19.3% over the closing share price on November 4, 2016, the last trading day prior to the announcement of the execution of the merger agreement, which was
prior to our announcement of our third quarter results after the close of the market on November 7, 2016.

• The oral opinion, subsequently confirmed in writing, provided to our board at its meeting on November 6, 2016 by representatives of Raymond James, as to the
fairness, as of such date, from a financial point of view, to the holders of our outstanding common stock of the $11.25 per share in cash to be received by such
holders in the merger pursuant to the merger agreement, based upon and subject to the qualifications, assumptions and other matters considered in connection with
the preparation of such opinion. Raymond James's opinion is more fully described below in the section entitled "—Opinion of Datalink's Financial Advisor." The
full text of the written opinion of Raymond James is attached hereto as Annex D. 

• The fact that the all-cash merger consideration will provide certainty of value and liquidity to our shareholders, while eliminating long-term business and
execution risk. 

• Our board's belief that the per-share merger consideration was the best price reasonably attainable for our shareholders. 

• Our board's view that the terms of the merger agreement would be unlikely to deter third parties from making an unsolicited superior proposal. 

• Our board's right under the merger agreement to respond to third parties submitting unsolicited acquisition proposals by providing non-public information subject
to an acceptable confidentiality agreement, and to engage in negotiations or substantive discussions with any such person, if our board, prior to taking any such
actions, determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and legal counsel) that (i) the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with
the directors' fiduciary duties under Minnesota law and (ii) the competing proposal either constitutes a superior proposal or is reasonably likely to constitute a
superior proposal. 

• Our board's right, under certain circumstances, to withdraw, withhold, qualify or modify its recommendation that our shareholders approve and adopt the merger
agreement. 

• Our ability to terminate the merger agreement to enter into an alternative acquisition agreement that our board determines to be a superior proposal, subject to
certain conditions, provided that we concurrently pay a $7.5 million termination fee to Insight under circumstances as described in "The Merger Agreement—
Termination Fee" beginning on page 76. 

• The other terms of the merger agreement, including: 

• the fact that our board believed that the termination fee of $7.5 million, or approximately 2.9% of the equity value of Datalink, is reasonable in light of,
among other things, the benefits of the merger to our shareholders, the typical size of such fees in similar transactions and the likelihood that a fee of such
size would not be preclusive or unreasonably restrictive of other offers; 

• the conditions to the closing, including our board's belief that while the closing is subject to certain antitrust approvals, there were not likely to be
significant antitrust or other regulatory impediments to the closing, as well as the obligations of Insight and Merger Sub to take actions to obtain such
approvals; 

• the fact that the merger agreement is not conditioned on Insight obtaining any outside financing; and 

• the fact that the end date of April 25, 2017 under the merger agreement on which either party, subject to certain exceptions, can terminate the merger
agreement, allows for sufficient time to consummate the merger.

Table of Contents

• Our board's belief, based on the fact that the merger agreement was the product of arms-length negotiations, that the price to be paid by Insight is the highest price
per share that Insight was willing to pay and that the terms and conditions of the merger agreement were, in our board's view, the most favorable to us and our
shareholders to which Insight was willing to agree. 

• The availability of dissenters' rights to our shareholders who comply with specified procedures under Minnesota law.

        In its deliberations concerning the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, our board also considered and balanced against the factors
potentially weighing in favor of the merger a number of uncertainties, risks, restrictions and other factors potentially weighing against the merger, including the following (not
necessarily in order of relative importance):

• The fact that our shareholders would forgo the opportunity to realize the potential long-term value of the successful execution of our current strategy as an
independent public company by participating in any future earnings or growth or in any future appreciation in value of shares of our common stock. 

• The fact that receipt of the all-cash merger consideration would be taxable to those of our shareholders that are treated as U.S. holders for U.S. federal income tax
purposes. 

• The fact that, under specified circumstances, we may be required to pay fees and expenses in the event the merger agreement is terminated and the effect this
could have on us, including: 

• the possibility that the $7.5 million termination fee payable by us to Insight upon the termination of the merger agreement under certain circumstances
could discourage other potential acquirers from making a competing proposal, although our board believed that the termination fee was reasonable in
amount and would not unduly deter any other party that might be interested in acquiring us; and 

• if the merger is not consummated, we will generally be required to pay our own expenses associated with the merger agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby. 

• The significant costs involved in connection with entering into and completing the merger and the substantial time and effort of management required to
consummate the merger, which could disrupt our business operations. 

• The fact that the announcement and pendency of the merger, or the failure to complete the merger, may cause substantial harm to our relationships with its
employees (including making it more difficult to attract and retain key personnel and the possible loss of key management and other personnel), vendors and
customers. 

• The restrictions in the merger agreement on our ability to actively solicit competing bids to acquire the Company. 

• The restrictions on our conduct of business prior to completion of the merger, which could delay or prevent us from undertaking business opportunities that may
arise or taking other actions with respect to our operations during the pendency of the merger, whether or not the merger is completed. 

• The fact that, while we expect the merger to be consummated if the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement is approved by our shareholders, there
can be no assurance that all conditions to the parties' obligations to consummate the merger, including the obligation to receive the consent of our independent
auditors as described in "The Merger Agreement—Conditions to Completion of the Merger" beginning on page 73, will be satisfied.

• The fact that the market price of our common stock could be affected by many factors, including: (i) if the merger agreement is terminated, the reason or reasons
for such termination and whether such termination resulted from factors adversely affecting us; (ii) the possibility that, as a result of the termination of the merger
agreement, possible acquirers may consider us to be an unattractive acquisition candidate; and (iii) the possible sale of our common stock by short-term investors
following an announcement that the merger agreement was terminated. 

• The fact that certain of our directors and executive officers may have interests in the merger that may be deemed to be different from, or in addition to, those of
our shareholders. Our board was made aware of and considered these interests; for more information about such interests, see below under the heading "The
Merger (Proposal 1)—Interests of Datalink's Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger" beginning on page 48. 

• The fact that the completion of the merger would require antitrust clearance in the United States and Germany.

        After taking into account all of the factors set forth above, as well as others, our board concluded that the risks, uncertainties, restrictions and potentially negative factors
associated with the merger were outweighed by the potential benefits of the merger to our shareholders.

        The foregoing discussion of factors considered by our board is not intended to be exhaustive, but summarizes the material factors considered by our board. In light of the
variety of factors considered in connection with its evaluation of the merger, our board did not find it practicable to, and did not, quantify or otherwise assign relative weights to
the specific factors considered in reaching its determination and recommendation. Moreover, each member of our board applied his or her own personal business judgment to the
process and may have given different weight to different factors. Our board did not undertake to make any specific determination as to whether any factor, or any particular
aspect of any factor, supported or did not support its ultimate determination. Our board based its recommendation on the totality of the information presented, including thorough
discussions with, and questioning of, our executive management, financial advisor and legal counsel. It should be noted that this explanation of the reasoning of our board and
certain information presented in this section is forward-looking in nature and should be read in light of the factors set forth in "Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-
Looking Statements" beginning on page 17.

Certain Datalink Unaudited Prospective Financial Information 

        Datalink does not, as a matter of course, develop or publicly disclose long-term projections or internal projections of its future financial performance revenues, earnings,
financial condition or other results due to, among other reasons, the uncertainty of the underlying assumptions and estimates. However, in connection with the opinion of
Raymond James, certain non-public unaudited prospective financial information prepared by our management was prepared and provided to Raymond James for use in
performing its financial analyses summarized under "—Opinion of Datalink's Financial Advisor." The final version of the forecasts was used as the basis for the financial
analyses summarized below and presented to the Datalink board by Raymond James, which we refer to as the "Projections." The Projections were also provided to Insight in
connection with its due diligence review of a possible transaction and to our board and certain other advisors in connection with our evaluation of a possible transaction.

        The Projections were not prepared with a view to public disclosure and are included in this proxy statement because such information was part of the basis for the opinion of
Raymond James. The Projections were not prepared with a view to compliance with generally accepted accounting principles as applied in the United States, which we refer to as
GAAP, the published guidelines of the SEC regarding projections and forward-looking statements or the guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants for preparation and presentation of prospective financial

information. Furthermore, RSM US LLP, our independent auditor, has not examined, reviewed, compiled or otherwise applied procedures to, the Projections and, accordingly,
assumes no responsibility for, and expresses no opinion on, them. The Projections included in this proxy statement have been prepared by, and are the responsibility of, Datalink
management. The Projections were prepared solely for internal use of Datalink and its financial advisor and are subjective in many respects.

        Although a summary of the Projections is presented with numerical specificity, the Projections reflect numerous assumptions and estimates as to future events made by our
management that our management believed were reasonable at the time the Projections were prepared, taking into account the relevant information available to management at
the time. However, this information is not fact and should not be relied upon as being necessarily indicative of actual future results. Important factors that may affect actual
results and cause the Projections not to be achieved include general economic conditions, accuracy of certain accounting assumptions, changes in actual or projected cash flows,
competitive pressures, and changes in tax laws. In addition, the Projections do not take into account any circumstances or events occurring after the date that they were prepared
and do not give effect to the merger. As a result, there can be no assurance that the Projections will be realized, and actual results may be materially better or worse than those
contained in the Projections. The inclusion of this information should not be regarded as an indication that our board, Datalink, our financial advisor or any other recipient of this
information considered, or now considers, the Projections to be material information of Datalink or predictive of actual future results nor should it be construed as financial
guidance, and it should not be relied upon as such. The summary of the Projections is not included in this proxy statement in order to induce any shareholder to vote in favor of
the proposal to adopt the merger agreement or any of the other proposals to be voted on at the special meeting or to influence any shareholder to make any investment decision
with respect to the merger, including whether or not to seek dissenters' rights with respect to shares of our common stock.

        The Projections should be evaluated, if at all, in conjunction with the historical financial statements and other information regarding Datalink contained in our public filings
with the SEC. The Projections were reviewed by Datalink's management with, and considered by, the Datalink board in connection with their evaluation and approval of the
merger.

        The Projections are forward-looking statements. For information on factors that may cause Datalink's future results to materially vary, see "Cautionary Statement
Concerning Forward-Looking Statements" beginning on page 17.

        Except to the extent required by applicable federal securities laws, we do not intend, and expressly disclaim any responsibility, to update or otherwise revise the Projections
to reflect circumstances existing after the date when Datalink prepared the Projections or to reflect the occurrence of future events or changes in general economic or industry
conditions, even in the event that any of the assumptions underlying the Projections are shown to be in error.

        In light of the foregoing factors and the uncertainties inherent in the Projections, shareholders are cautioned not to rely on the Projections included in this proxy statement.

        Certain of the measures included in the Projections may be considered non-GAAP financial measures, as noted below. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be
considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information presented in compliance with GAAP, and non-GAAP financial measures as used by Datalink may not be
comparable to similarly titled amounts used by

other companies. These non-GAAP measures are included because they were used by Raymond James in the preparation of their opinion, as described under "—Opinion of
Datalink's Financial Advisor"

Opinion of Datalink's Financial Advisor 

        We retained Raymond James as financial advisor on February 4, 2016. Pursuant to that engagement, our board requested that Raymond James evaluate the fairness, from a
financial point of view, to the holders of our outstanding common stock of the merger consideration to be received by such holders pursuant to the merger agreement.

        At the November 6, 2016 meeting of our board, representatives of Raymond James rendered its oral opinion, which was subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written
opinion to our board dated November 6, 2016, as to the fairness, as of such date, from a financial point of view, to the holders of our outstanding common stock of the merger
consideration to be received by such holders in the merger pursuant to the merger agreement, based upon and subject to the qualifications, assumptions and other matters
considered in connection with the preparation of its opinion.

        The full text of the written opinion of Raymond James is attached as Annex D to this document. The summary of the opinion of Raymond James set forth in this document
is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such written opinion. You are urged to read the opinion in its entirety. You should read this section together with the
information under "—Certain Datalink Unaudited Prospective Financial Information," which describes the Projections that Raymond James used, with our instruction and
approval, as part of the bases for and methods of arriving at their opinion.

        Raymond James provided its opinion for the information of our board (solely in its capacity as such) in connection with, and for purposes of, its consideration of the merger
and Raymond James' opinion only addresses whether the merger consideration to be received by the holders of our common stock in the merger pursuant to the merger agreement
was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. The opinion of Raymond James does not address any other term or aspect of the merger agreement or the merger
contemplated thereby. The Raymond James opinion does not constitute a recommendation to our board or to any holder of our common stock as to how our board, such
shareholder or any other person should vote or otherwise act with respect to the merger or any other matter.

        In connection with its review of the proposed merger and the preparation of its opinion, Raymond James, among other things:

• reviewed the financial terms and conditions as stated in the draft of the merger agreement dated as of November 6th, 2016; 

• reviewed certain information related to the historical, current and future operations, financial condition and prospects of Datalink made available to Raymond
James by us, including, but not limited to, the Projections approved by us for Raymond James' use; 

• reviewed our recent public filings and certain other publicly available information regarding us; 

• reviewed financial, operating and other information regarding us and the industry in which we operate; 

• reviewed our financial and operating performance and those of other selected public companies that Raymond James deemed to be relevant; 

• considered the publicly available financial terms, and terms available to Raymond James on a confidential basis, of certain transactions Raymond James deemed
to be relevant; 

• reviewed the current and historical market prices for our common stock, and the current market prices of the publicly traded securities of certain other companies
that Raymond James deemed to be relevant; 

• reviewed a certificate addressed to Raymond James from a member of our senior management regarding, among other things, the accuracy of the information,
data, and other materials (financial or otherwise) provided to, or discussed with, Raymond James by us or on our behalf; 

• conducted such other financial studies, analyses and inquiries and considered such other information and factors as Raymond James deemed appropriate; and 

• discussed with members of our senior management certain information relating to the aforementioned and any other matters which Raymond James deemed
relevant to its inquiry.

        With our consent, Raymond James assumed and relied upon the accuracy and completeness of all information supplied by us or on our behalf, or otherwise reviewed by or
discussed with Raymond James, and Raymond James did not undertake any duty or responsibility to, nor did Raymond James, independently verify any of such information.
Raymond James did not make or obtain an independent appraisal of our assets or liabilities (contingent or otherwise). With respect to the Projections and any other information
and data provided to or otherwise reviewed by or discussed with Raymond James, Raymond James, with our consent, assumed that the Projections and such other information
and data were reasonably prepared in good faith on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of our management and Raymond James relied upon us
to advise Raymond James promptly if any information previously provided became inaccurate or was required to be updated during the period of its review. Raymond James
expressed no opinion with respect to the Projections or the assumptions on which they were based. Raymond James relied upon and assumed, without independent

verification, that the final form of the merger agreement would be substantially similar to the draft of the merger agreement reviewed by Raymond James in all respects material
to its analysis, and that the merger would be consummated in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement without waiver of or amendment to any of the conditions
thereto. Furthermore, Raymond James assumed, in all respects material to its analysis, that the representations and warranties of each party contained in the merger agreement
were true and correct and that each party will perform all of the covenants and agreements required to be performed by it under the merger agreement without being waived.
Raymond James also relied upon and assumed, without independent verification, that (i) the merger would be consummated in a manner that complies in all respects with all
applicable international, federal and state statutes, rules and regulations, and (ii) all governmental, regulatory or other consents and approvals necessary for the consummation of
the merger would be obtained and that no delay, limitations, restrictions or conditions would be imposed or amendments, modifications or waivers made that would have an
effect on the merger or Datalink that would be material to its analysis or opinion.

        Raymond James expressed no opinion as to the underlying business decision to effect the merger, the structure or tax consequences of the merger, or the availability or
advisability of any alternatives to the merger. The Raymond James opinion is limited to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the merger consideration to be received by
the holders of common stock. Raymond James expressed no opinion with respect to any other reasons (legal, business, or otherwise) that may support the decision of our board to
approve or consummate the merger. Furthermore, no opinion, counsel or interpretation was intended by Raymond James on matters that require legal, accounting or tax advice.
Raymond James assumed that such opinions, counsel or interpretations had been or would be obtained from appropriate professional sources. Furthermore, Raymond James
relied, with our consent, on the fact that we were assisted by legal, accounting and tax advisors, and, with our consent relied upon and assumed the accuracy and completeness of
the assessments by us and our advisors, as to all legal, accounting and tax matters with respect to Datalink and the merger.

        In formulating its opinion, Raymond James considered only the merger consideration to be received by the holders of common stock, and Raymond James did not consider,
and its opinion did not address, the fairness of the amount or nature of any compensation to be paid or payable to any of our officers, directors or employees, or such class of
persons, in connection with the merger whether relative to the merger consideration or otherwise. Raymond James was not requested to opine as to, and its opinion did not
express an opinion as to or otherwise address, among other things: (1) the fairness of the merger to the holders of any class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of
Datalink, or to any other party, except and only to the extent expressly set forth in the last sentence of its opinion or (2) the fairness of the merger to any one class or group of
Datalink's or any other party's security holders or other constituents vis-à-vis any other class or group of Datalink's or such other party's security holders or other constituents
(including, without limitation, the allocation of any consideration to be received in the merger amongst or within such classes or groups of security holders or other constituents).
Raymond James expressed no opinion as to the impact of the merger on our solvency or viability or our ability to pay our obligations when they come due.

Material Financial Analyses

        The following summarizes the material financial analyses reviewed by Raymond James with our board at its meeting on November 6, 2016, which material was considered
by Raymond James in rendering its opinion. No company or transaction used in the analyses described below is identical or directly comparable to Datalink, Insight or the
contemplated merger.

        Selected Companies Analysis.    Raymond James analyzed the relative valuation multiples of five publicly traded companies that engage primarily in the systems integrator
business that it deemed relevant and for which future financial estimates were publicly available, including:

• CDW Corporation 

• Insight Enterprises Inc. 

• ePlus inc. 

• PC Connection, Inc. 

• PCM, Inc.

        Although none of the selected companies are directly comparable to Datalink, the selected companies were chosen because they are publicly traded companies that operate
in a similar industry as Datalink and have lines of business and financial and operating characteristics similar to Datalink. Raymond James determined, using its professional
judgment, that these selected companies were the most appropriate for purposes of this analysis and, while there may have been other companies that operate in similar industries
to Datalink or have similar principal lines of business or financial or operating characteristics to Datalink, Raymond James did not specifically identify any other companies for
this purpose.

        Raymond James calculated various financial multiples for each company, including (i) enterprise value (market value plus debt, plus preferred stock, plus minority interests,
less cash) compared to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, excluding stock-based compensation and non-recurring charges, or "EBITDA," for the most
recent actual twelve months results ended September 30, 2016, referred to as "TTM," as well as to Wall Street research analysts' projected revenue and EBITDA for the selected
companies for calendar years ending December 31, 2016 and 2017, referred to as "CY16" and "CY17," and (ii) equity value per share compared to earnings per share excluding
stock-based compensation and non-recurring charges, net of tax, a non-GAAP measure referred to as "non-GAAP EPS," using the TTM results as well as Wall Street estimates
for the selected companies for CY16 and CY17. The estimates published by Wall Street research analysts were not prepared in connection with the merger or at the request of
Raymond James and may or may not prove to be accurate. Raymond James reviewed the mean, median, minimum and maximum relative valuation multiples of the selected
public companies and compared them to corresponding valuation multiples for Datalink implied by the merger consideration. The results of the selected public companies
analysis are summarized below:

        Furthermore, Raymond James applied the mean, median, minimum and maximum relative valuation multiples for each of the metrics to our actual and projected financial
results and determined

        Selected Transaction Analysis.    Raymond James analyzed information relating to selected acquisitions since 2010 of companies that engage primarily in the systems
integrator business and prepared a summary of the relative valuation multiples paid in these transactions. The selected transactions used in the analysis included:

• 09/03/2015 Acquisition of Sirius Computer Solutions, Inc. by Kelso & Company 

• 03/11/2014 Acquisition of Accuvant Inc. by Blackstone Group L.P.

        Raymond James examined valuation multiples of transaction enterprise value compared to the target companies' EBITDA for twelve months ended prior to announcement
of the transaction. Raymond James reviewed the mean, median, minimum and maximum relative valuation multiples of the selected transactions and compared them to
corresponding valuation multiples for Datalink implied by the merger consideration. Furthermore, Raymond James applied the mean, median, minimum and maximum relative
valuation multiples to our actual trailing twelve months EBITDA to determine the implied equity price per share and then compared those implied equity values per share to the
merger consideration of $11.25 per share. The results of the selected transactions analysis are summarized below:

        Discounted Cash Flow Analysis.    Raymond James analyzed the discounted present value of our projected free cash flows for the years ending December 31, 2017 through
2019 on a standalone basis. Raymond James calculated and used unleveraged free cash flows, defined as earnings before interest, after taxes, plus depreciation, plus amortization,
less capital expenditures, less investment in working capital.

        The discounted cash flow analysis was based on the Projections. Consistent with the periods included in the Projections, Raymond James used calendar year 2019 as the
final year for the analysis and applied terminal growth rates, based on Raymond James' professional judgment and experience, ranging from 1.0% to 3.0%, to calendar year 2019
EBITDA in order to derive a range of terminal values for Datalink in 2019.

        The projected unleveraged free cash flows and terminal values were discounted using rates ranging from 9.0% to 13.0%, which reflected the weighted average after-tax cost
of debt and equity capital associated with executing our business plan calculated by Raymond James based on its judgment and experience. The resulting range of present
enterprise values was adjusted by our current capitalization and divided by the number of diluted shares outstanding in order to arrive at a range of present values per share of our
common stock. Raymond James reviewed the range of per share prices derived in the discounted cash flow analysis and compared them to the price per share for Datalink
implied by the merger consideration. The results of the discounted cash flow analysis are summarized below:

Other

        Transaction Premiums.    Raymond James reviewed the stock price premiums paid in 30 merger and acquisition transactions announced since January 16, 2015 with market
capitalization between $100 million and $500 million one day prior to the announcement where 100% of the target was acquired for cash and the target was a non-OTC public
company located in the United States. Raymond James measured each transaction price per share relative to each target's closing price per share one day, 30 days and 60 days
prior to announcement of the transaction. Raymond James compared the mean, median, minimum and maximum premiums paid from this set of transactions to the merger
consideration expressed as a premium relative to the closing stock price of Datalink on November 4, 2016, October 5, 2016 and September 5, 2016. The results of this transaction
premium review, which was presented merely for reference purposes only and was not relied upon for valuation purposes, are summarized below:

        Stock Price Performance.    Raymond James reviewed Datalink's stock price performance from November 2013 through November 4, 2016 and compared such performance
during such period to the performance of the Nasdaq stock market and an index comprised of CDW Corporation, Insight Enterprises Inc., ePlus inc., PC Connection, Inc. and
PCM, Inc. During the period, the price of our common stock ranged from a low of $5.10 on August 24, 2015 to a high of $15.84 on March 4, 2014. This stock price performance
review was presented merely for reference purposes only and was not relied upon for valuation purposes.

        Additional Considerations.    The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not susceptible to a partial analysis or summary description. Raymond James
believes that its analyses must be considered as a whole and that selecting portions of its analyses, without considering the analyses taken as a whole, would create an incomplete
view of the process underlying its opinion. In addition, Raymond James considered the results of all such analyses and did not assign relative weights to any of the analyses, but
rather made qualitative judgments as to significance and relevance of each analysis and factor, so the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis described above
should not be taken to be the view of Raymond James as to our actual value.

        In performing its analyses, Raymond James made numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance, general business, economic and regulatory conditions and
other matters, many of which are beyond our control. The analyses performed by Raymond James are not necessarily indicative of actual values, trading values or actual future
results which might be achieved, all of which may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by such analyses. Such analyses were provided to our board (solely in
its capacity as such) and were prepared solely as part of the analysis of Raymond James of the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of our common stock of the
merger consideration to be received by such holders in connection with the proposed merger pursuant to the merger agreement. The analyses do not purport to be appraisals or to
reflect the prices at which companies may actually be sold, and such estimates are inherently subject to uncertainty. The opinion of Raymond James was one of many factors
taken into account by our board in making its determination to approve the merger. Neither Raymond James' opinion nor the analyses described above should be viewed as
determinative of our board or our management's views with respect to Datalink, Insight or the merger. Raymond James provided advice to us with respect to the proposed merger.
Raymond James did not, however, recommend any specific amount of consideration to our board or that any specific merger consideration constituted the only appropriate
consideration for the merger. We placed no limits on the scope of the analysis performed, or opinion expressed, by Raymond James.

        The Raymond James opinion was necessarily based upon market, economic, financial and other circumstances and conditions existing and disclosed to it on November 6,
2016, and any material change in such circumstances and conditions may affect the opinion of Raymond James, but Raymond James does not have any obligation to update,
revise or reaffirm that opinion. Raymond James relied upon and assumed, without independent verification, that there had been no change in the business, assets, liabilities,
financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or prospects of Datalink since the respective dates of the most recent financial statements and other information, financial or
otherwise, provided to Raymond James that would be material to its analyses or its opinion, and that there was no information or any facts that would make any of the
information reviewed by Raymond James incomplete or misleading in any material respect.

        During the two years preceding the date of Raymond James' written opinion, Raymond James has not been engaged by, performed services for or received any
compensation from us (other than any amounts that were paid to Raymond James under the engagement letter described in this proxy statement pursuant to which Raymond
James was retained as our financial advisor to assist in reviewing strategic alternatives). In addition, during the two years preceding the date of Raymond James' written

opinion, Raymond James has not been engaged by, performed services for or received any compensation from Insight.

        For services rendered in connection with its engagement and the delivery of its opinion, a fee of $350,000 became payable to Raymond James upon delivery of its opinion,
which fee was not contingent upon the successful completion of the merger or the conclusion reached within Raymond James' opinion. We have agreed to pay Raymond James a
fee of approximately $3.86 million at closing, for its advisory services in connection with the merger, which payment is contingent upon the closing of the merger, with all fees
previously paid to Raymond James credited towards such amount, including the $350,000 paid upon delivery of Raymond James's opinion, and a $50,000 retainer fee that was
paid to Raymond James following the signing of the engagement letter. We also agreed to reimburse Raymond James for its expenses incurred in connection with its services,
including the fees and expenses of its counsel, up to $100,000 to be paid at closing and will indemnify Raymond James against certain liabilities arising out of its engagement.

        Raymond James is actively involved in the investment banking business and regularly undertakes the valuation of investment securities in connection with public offerings,
private placements, business combinations and similar transactions. In the ordinary course of business, Raymond James may trade in the securities of Datalink and Insight for its
own account and for the accounts of its customers and, accordingly, may at any time hold a long or short position in such securities. Raymond James may provide investment
banking, financial advisory and other financial services to Datalink and/or Insight or other participants in the merger in the future, for which Raymond James may receive
compensation.

Financing of the Merger 

        We anticipate that the total amount of funds necessary to consummate the merger and the related transactions, including the funds needed to (i) pay our shareholders the
amounts due to them under the merger agreement; (ii) make payments in respect of Datalink's outstanding restricted stock, stock options, RSUs and PSUs pursuant to the merger
agreement; and (iii) pay all fees and expenses payable by Insight and Merger Sub under the merger agreement and in connection with the transactions, will be funded through a
combination of Insight's cash on hand and borrowings under its existing credit facilities.

        The funding under Insight's existing credit facilities is subject to certain customary conditions, including conditions that do not relate directly to the merger agreement.
Insight has informed us that the amounts committed under the debt facility will be sufficient to complete the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, but we cannot
be assured that borrowing capacity will be available or that the borrowings will be sufficient to complete the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. The amounts
committed might be insufficient if, among other things, one or more of the parties to the credit facilities fails to fund the committed amounts or if the conditions to the
commitments to fund the amounts are not met.

        The merger is not conditioned upon receipt of financing by Insight.

Interests of Datalink's Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger 

        When considering the recommendation of our board that you vote for the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement, you should be aware that certain of our
directors and executive officers may have interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, your interests as a shareholder. Our board was aware of these interests
in approving the merger agreement and the merger and in recommending that the merger agreement be approved and adopted by our shareholders.

Agreements with Datalink

Paul F. Lidsky Retention Bonus and Consulting Agreement

        On November 16, 2016, we entered into a retention bonus and consulting agreement with Mr. Lidsky, which we refer to as the "Lidsky Letter Agreement." The Lidsky
Letter Agreement provides that upon and subject to the closing of the merger, Mr. Lidsky's employment with us will terminate and he will be engaged by us as a consultant for a
period of 60 days after the closing of the merger (the "Lidsky Retention Date"). If Mr. Lidsky's consulting relationship continues through the Lidsky Retention Date, then
Mr. Lidsky will be eligible to receive a retention bonus payment in the amount of $200,000. If Mr. Lidsky's consulting relationship is terminated by Datalink, Insight or any of
their related subsidiaries without Cause (as defined in the Lidsky Letter Agreement) before the Lidsky Retention Date, then Mr. Lidsky will be eligible to receive a consulting
separation payment in the amount of $200,000, but will not be eligible to receive his retention bonus. Mr. Lidsky's retention bonus or consulting separation payment, as
applicable, is payable in a single lump sum cash payment no later than 65 days following the Lidsky Retention Date. Upon and subject to the closing of the merger, Mr. Lidsky's
employment with us will terminate effective as of the closing date of the merger. As a result of such termination, Mr. Lidsky will be eligible to receive the existing severance
benefits outlined in Mr. Lidsky's employment agreement with us, dated July 20, 2009 (as amended on January 17, 2011), which will be payable in accordance with the terms of
such employment agreement. In order to receive his retention bonus or his consulting separation payment, Mr. Lidsky must execute and not revoke a release in favor of Datalink
and/or Insight.

        In the event that his engagement as a consultant is terminated either (a) by Mr. Lidsky for any reason or for no reason, with or without notice, or (b) by us, in accordance
with our general employee discipline and termination policies, for Cause, then Mr. Lidsky will not be eligible for his retention bonus or his consulting separation payment. For a
description of the severance benefits payable upon the termination of Mr. Lidsky's employment, please see below under "—Payments Upon Termination or Change of Control
Provisions—Severance Payments and Change of Control Provisions."

Denise M. Westenfield Retention Bonus Agreement

        On November 16, 2016, we entered into a retention bonus letter agreement with Ms. Westenfield, which we refer to as the "Westenfield Letter Agreement." The Westenfield
Letter Agreement provides that, contingent on the closing of the merger and Ms. Westenfield's continued employment through the five month anniversary of the closing of the
merger (the "Westenfield Retention Date"), Ms. Westenfield will be eligible to receive (i) a retention bonus payment in the amount of $90,000, and (ii) a severance payment in
the amount of $90,000 or, in the case of a termination that occurs after the Westenfield Retention Date, determined in accordance with Insight's Separation Plan.
Ms. Westenfield's retention bonus is payable in a single lump sum cash payment no later than 65 days following the Westenfield Retention Date, and her severance payment is
payable in a single lump sum cash payment no later than 65 days after her last day of employment with Insight, Datalink or any of their related subsidiaries. To receive her
retention bonus and severance payment, Ms. Westenfield must execute and not revoke a release of claims in favor of Datalink and/or Insight.

Table of Contents

        In the event that her employment is involuntarily terminated by Insight, Datalink or the surviving corporation prior to the Westenfield Retention Date, Ms. Westenfield will
be entitled to receive her retention bonus and her severance payment. If her employment is terminated either (a) by Ms. Westenfield for any reason or for no reason, with or
without notice, or (b) by us, in accordance with our general employee discipline and termination policies, for Cause (as defined in the Westenfield Agreement), then
Ms. Westenfield will not be eligible for her retention bonus or her severance payment.

2016 Cash Incentive Program

        In connection with entry into the merger agreement, the compensation committee of our board approved the payment of 2016 bonuses under our previously disclosed annual
cash incentive program to each of our named executive officers (Paul F. Lidsky, Gregory T. Barnum, M. Shawn O'Grady, Denise M. Westenfield, and Patricia A. Hamm) at each
officer's target payment amount, regardless of whether we meet, do not meet, or exceed the applicable financial performance objectives under the cash incentive program. The
compensation committee also confirmed that the termination of any named executive officer upon or following the closing of the merger will not affect his or her right to receive
such cash bonus. Each officer's target payment amount, which will be paid no later than the closing date of the merger (or, in the case of Ms. Hamm, no later than the earlier of
the closing date of the merger and December 31, 2016), is as follows:

2016 Annual Cash Incentive Program 

Agreements with Insight

M. Shawn O'Grady Offer Letter

        On October 26, 2016, Mr. O'Grady and Insight entered into an offer letter, which we refer to as the "O'Grady Offer Letter," which provides that upon and subject to the
closing of the merger, Mr. O'Grady will be employed by Insight as a Senior Vice President and General Manager. The O'Grady Offer Letter provides that Mr. O'Grady's starting
annual base compensation will be $407,000, with a target annual variable bonus opportunity equal to 60% of his annual base compensation, or $244,200 (the "Variable Bonus
Plan"). Mr. O'Grady will also receive a one-time award of RSUs of Insight (the "Initial RSU Grant") on the 10th day of the month following the month in which he commences
his employment with Insight. The value of the Initial RSU Grant will be $500,000, with the number of shares granted under the Initial RSU Grant calculated by dividing
$500,000 by the closing stock price of Insight on the date of grant. The Initial RSU Grant will vest on the two-year anniversary of the date of grant, or upon an earlier termination
of employment by Insight without Cause or by Mr. O'Grady for Good Reason (each as will be defined in the RSU award agreement) and is subject to the terms and conditions of
the Amended Insight Enterprises, Inc. 2007 Omnibus Plan, as amended (the "2007 Omnibus Plan").

        Additionally, Mr. O'Grady will be eligible to participate in Insight's 2017 plan for annual RSU grants. (The equivalent annual grant for 2016 was valued at $200,000 and
consisted of 60% service-based RSUs and 40% performance-based RSUs.) The design and awards under such 2017 plan and any

such future plan are at the discretion of Insight's compensation committee. The service-based RSUs vest over four years in equal annual installments on the anniversary of the
grant date. The performance-based RSUs vest over three years in equal annual installments, with the final number of RSUs based on the attainment of Insight's annual
performance metric. (The annual performance metric for 2016 was defined as return on invested capital.) The performance-based RSUs are granted on a scale from 0%-200%
depending on the attainment of Insight's annual performance metric.

        Mr. O'Grady will be eligible to participate in Insight's Executive Management Separation Plan (the "Separation Plan"). Upon a qualifying event (as defined in the Separation
Plan), Mr. O'Grady will be entitled to severance benefits at the Senior Vice President level, including (i) 12 months of base salary, (ii) three months of COBRA continuation
coverage, and (iii) three months of outplacement assistance. Mr. O'Grady will also be entitled to receive a payment equal to the amount paid to him in the preceding year under
the Variable Bonus Plan, payable within 60 days following the termination of Mr. O'Grady's employment, provided that Mr. O'Grady enters into a release agreement with Insight
in connection with the termination of his employment. In addition, following the first anniversary of his employment with Insight, Mr. O'Grady will be entitled to receive a
prorated portion of the payment that he would be entitled to receive under the Variable Bonus Plan for the calendar year in which his employment is terminated, payable at the
time that Variable Bonus Plan payments are made to other Insight employees and in no event later than March 15 of the calendar year following the termination of his
employment.

Voting Agreement

        In connection with the merger agreement, each of our directors (Brent G. Blackey, Paul F. Lidsky, Greg R. Meland, J. Patrick O'Halloran, James E. Ousley, Mercedes
Walton and James L. Zucco, Jr.) entered into the voting agreement with Insight and us, pursuant to which each director agreed to, among other things, vote his or her shares of
our common stock (i) in favor of the approval and adoption of the merger agreement and all agreements related to the merger; (ii) in favor of any related proposal in furtherance
of the merger agreement and/or in furtherance of effecting the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement; and (iii) against any alternative proposal,
any other extraordinary transaction involving us other than the merger, any corporate action that could frustrate the purposes or prevent or delay the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, or any other proposal relating to any such action. The voting agreement will terminate upon until the earlier to occur of
(a) the effective time of the merger, and (b) the termination of the merger agreement in accordance with its terms. See "The Voting Agreement" beginning on page 78.

Treatment of Equity Awards

        Under the merger agreement, the equity-based awards held by our directors and executive officers under our stock plans will be treated as described in the section entitled
"The Merger Agreement—Treatment of Datalink Equity Awards" on page 63.

        For an estimate of the amounts that would be payable to each of our named executive officers in settlement of their outstanding unvested equity awards, see the "Equity"

        Patricia A. Hamm.    On September 2, 2014, we entered into an employment agreement with Patricia A. Hamm, our Executive Vice President, Human Resources (the
"Hamm Employment Agreement"). Under the Hamm Employment Agreement, Ms. Hamm is entitled to a severance payment if (i) she is terminated by us without Cause, (ii) she
resigns for Good Reason, (iii) we terminate her employment in anticipation of, in connection with, at the time of or within 90 days after a change of control, the definition of
which includes the merger, or (iv) she resigns employment with us for Good Reason arising in anticipation of, in connection with, at the time of or within 90 days after a change
of control. Under any of these conditions Ms. Hamm would receive, provided that she complies with certain confidentiality, non-competition and non-solicitation covenants,
(i) her base salary accrued through the date of termination and reimbursement of expenses, (ii) any earned but unpaid annual bonus, (iii) a single lump sum equal to her annual
base salary, and (iv) 12 months of premiums for COBRA health insurance continuation coverage subject to earlier termination if she is later employed and eligible to receive any
health insurance benefits under another employer's plans.

        M. Shawn O'Grady.    On December 17, 2009, we entered into an employment agreement with M. Shawn O'Grady, our Chief Operating Officer (the "O'Grady Employment
Agreement"). Under the O'Grady Employment Agreement, Mr. O'Grady is entitled to a severance payment if (i) he is terminated by us without Cause, (ii) he resigns for Good
Reason, (iii) we terminate his employment in anticipation of, in connection with, at the time of or within 90 days after a change of control, the definition of which includes the
merger, or (iv) he resigns employment with us for Good Reason arising in anticipation of, in connection with, at the time of or within 90 days after a change of control. Under
any of these conditions Mr. O'Grady would receive, provided that he complies with certain confidentiality, non-competition and non-solicitation covenants, (i) his base salary
accrued through the date of termination and reimbursement of expenses, (ii) any earned but unpaid annual bonus, (iii) a single lump sum equal to his annual base salary, and
(iv) 12 months of premiums for COBRA health insurance continuation coverage subject to earlier termination if he is later employed and eligible to receive any health insurance
benefits under another employer's plans.

        Denise M. Westenfield.    Other than the Westenfield Letter Agreement, we have not entered into any arrangements with Ms. Westenfield that call for payments upon
termination or change of control.

        Each named executive officer holds unvested restricted stock, performance stock units or stock options that were granted pursuant to either our 2009 Incentive
Compensation Plan (the "2009 Plan") or our 2011 Incentive Compensation Plan (the "2011 Plan").

        For awards that were granted under our 2009 Plan, unless otherwise provided in the applicable award agreement, our compensation committee is expressly authorized upon
a change of control to accelerate the vesting of an award, cause all restrictions to lapse and deem all performance goals to have been met. Our compensation committee may also,
in connection with a change of control, cause outstanding awards to be assumed or replaced with comparable awards or cancel and cash out in-the-money options and stock
appreciation rights. Unless provided in an award agreement or otherwise waived by our compensation committee, if a named executive officer is terminated for any reason, other
than in connection with a change of control, all unvested and unexercisable portions of any outstanding awards are immediately forfeited. In connection with the change of
control contemplated by the merger agreement, our compensation committee has determined that the treatment of equity awards described above and under "The Merger
Agreement—Treatment of Datalink Equity Awards" on page 63 is appropriate, fair and equitable, consistent with the terms of our 2009 Plan, and is advisable and in the best
interests of us and our shareholders.

        Under our 2011 Plan, unless an award agreement provides otherwise, if there is a change of control that involves a corporate transaction, the definition of which includes the
merger, and the awards under the 2011 Plan are not continued, assumed or replaced in connection with the corporate transaction, then our compensation committee may provide
that any or all awards become fully vested

and, if applicable, exercisable for a certain period of time prior to the effective time of the corporate transaction. Alternatively, under these circumstances our compensation
committee may cancel and cash out some or all outstanding awards. In the event awards are continued, assumed, or replaced and a participant is involuntarily terminated for
reasons other than Cause within one year after the corporate transaction, then awards will immediately vest and become exercisable. In addition, if there is a change of control
that does not involve a corporate transaction, then our compensation committee may provide that an award becomes fully vested and exercisable upon the change of control or
upon the involuntary termination of the named executive officer without Cause within one year of the change of control. Unless provided in an award agreement or determined
otherwise by our compensation committee, if a named executive officer is terminated for any reason, other than in connection with a change of control, all unvested and
unexercisable portions of any outstanding awards are immediately forfeited. In connection with the change of control contemplated by the merger agreement, our compensation
committee has determined that the treatment of equity awards described above and under "The Merger Agreement—Treatment of Datalink Equity Awards" on page 63 is
appropriate, fair and equitable, consistent with the terms of our 2011 Plan, and is advisable and in the best interests of us and our shareholders.

        No severance payments are made to any of our named executive officers upon their death or disability.

Noncompete and Nonsolicitation Covenants

        All of our named executive officers who have entered into employment agreements have agreed in their respective employment agreements that during and for one year
after termination of employment with us, they will be restricted from participating in certain competitive businesses and from soliciting our employees and customers.

Definition of Cause and Good Reason

        Under the employment agreements with our named executive officers, "Cause" generally means one or more of the following events:

• gross negligence in the performance or intentional nonperformance of the named executive officer to perform his material duties under the employment
agreement; 

• willful dishonesty, fraud or misconduct with respect to our business or affairs; 

• conviction of a felony crime; or 

• willful, material and irreparable breach of the employment agreement.

        Under the employment agreements with our named executive officers, "Good Reason" generally means one or more of the following events:

• imposition by us of material and adverse changes in the named executive officer's principal duties; 

• certain reductions in the named executive officer's annual base salary; or 

• relocation of our offices to a location more than 50 miles from the prior location.

Quantification of Payments and Benefits to Datalink Executives

        The table below and its footnotes show the estimated amounts of payments and benefits that each named executive officer would receive in connection with the merger,
assuming that the merger was consummated and each such executive officer's employment were terminated by Datalink without cause or by the executive officer without good
reason (each of which we refer to as a "qualifying

termination") on November 23, 2016 (certain benefits reflected in the table below, specified below, are not payable upon a resignation for good reason).

        The amounts reflected in the table and the footnotes are determined using a per-share price for our common stock of $11.25, as specified in the merger agreement. The
compensation summarized in the table and footnotes below in respect of the named executive officers is subject to approval, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, by our
shareholders, as described below in the section entitled "Advisory Vote on Named Executive Officer Merger-Related Compensation (Proposal 2)" beginning on page 80.

        The calculations in the tables below do not include amounts the officers were already entitled to receive or that were vested as of November 23, 2016, or amounts under
contracts, agreements, plans or arrangements to the extent they do not discriminate in scope, terms or operation in favor of an officer and that are available generally to all of our
salaried employees. The estimated amounts below are based on multiple assumptions that may not actually occur, including assumptions described in this proxy statement. In
addition, certain amounts will vary depending on the actual date of closing of the merger, which is presently expected to occur in the first calendar quarter of 2017. As a result,
the actual amounts, if any, to be received by an applicable individual may differ in material respects from the amounts set forth below.

        For purposes of this discussion, "single-trigger" refers to benefits that arise as a result of the closing of the merger and "double-trigger" refers to benefits that require two
conditions, which are the closing of the merger, as well as a qualifying termination following the closing of the merger, a termination without cause following the closing of the
merger, or continued employment through a specified date following the closing of the merger, as applicable.

certain exceptions.

        Insight and the surviving corporation are required to make proper provision for the continuation of these rights in connection with certain future corporate transactions.

Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger 

        The following is a general discussion of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger to U.S. holders (as defined below) of our common stock whose
shares are exchanged for cash pursuant to the merger. This discussion does not address U.S. federal income tax consequences with respect to holders other than U.S. holders. This
discussion is based on the provisions of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations, judicial opinions and
administrative rulings and published positions of the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS"), each as in effect as of the date hereof. These authorities are subject to change or
differing interpretations, possibly on a retroactive basis, and any such change or interpretation could affect the accuracy of the statements and conclusions set forth in this
discussion. This discussion is for general information purposes only and does not purport to be a complete analysis of all potential tax consequences. This discussion does not
address any tax consequences arising under the unearned income Medicare contribution tax pursuant to the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, nor does it
address any tax considerations under state, local or foreign laws or U.S. federal laws other than those pertaining to the U.S. federal income tax. This discussion is not binding on
the IRS or the courts and, therefore, could be subject to challenge, which could be sustained. No ruling will be sought from the IRS with respect to the merger.

Table of Contents

        For purposes of this discussion, the term "U.S. holder" means a beneficial owner of our common stock that is for U.S. federal income tax purposes:

• a citizen or individual resident of the United States; 

• a corporation, or other entity classified as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any
state thereof, or the District of Columbia; 

• a trust if (1) a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the trust's administration, and one or more U.S. persons are authorized to
control all substantial decisions of the trust or (2) such trust has a valid election in effect under applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations to be treated as a U.S. person;
or 

• an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of its source.

        This discussion applies only to U.S. holders of shares of our common stock who hold such shares as a capital asset within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code
(generally, property held for investment). Further, this discussion does not purport to consider all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to a U.S. holder in
light of its particular circumstances, or that may apply to U.S. holders subject to special treatment under U.S. federal income tax laws (including, for example, insurance
companies, dealers or brokers in securities or foreign currencies, traders in securities who elect the mark-to-market method of accounting, holders subject to the alternative
minimum tax, U.S. holders that have a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar, tax-exempt organizations, tax-qualified retirement plans, banks and other financial
institutions, mutual funds, certain expatriates, S corporations, or other pass-through entities, or investors in such S corporations or other pass-through entities, real estate
investment trusts, regulated investment companies, U.S. holders who hold shares of our common stock as part of a hedge, straddle, constructive sale, conversion or other
integrated transaction, U.S. holders who will hold (actually or constructively) an equity interest in Insight immediately after the merger, and U.S. holders who acquired their
shares of our common stock through the exercise of employee stock options or other compensation arrangements).

        If a partnership (including for this purpose any entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) holds shares of our common stock, the
tax treatment of a partner in such partnership will generally depend on the status of the partners and the activities of the partnership. If you are, for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, a partner in a partnership holding shares of our common stock, you should consult your tax advisor.

        This summary of U.S. federal income tax consequences is for general information purposes only and is not tax advice. Holders of our common stock are urged to
consult their own tax advisors to determine the particular tax consequences to them of the merger, including the applicability and effect of the alternative minimum
tax, the unearned income Medicare contribution tax and any other U.S. federal, or state, local, foreign or other tax laws.

Tax Consequences of the Merger

        The receipt of cash by U.S. holders in exchange for shares of our common stock pursuant to the merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In
general, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, a U.S. holder who receives cash in exchange for shares of our common stock pursuant to the merger will recognize capital gain or
loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between (1) the amount of cash received and (2) the U.S. holder's adjusted tax basis in such shares.

        Any such gain or loss will be long-term capital gain or loss if a U.S. holder's holding period in the shares of our common stock surrendered in the merger is greater than one
year as of the date of the merger. Long-term capital gains of certain non-corporate holders, including individuals, are generally

Table of Contents

subject to U.S. federal income tax at preferential rates. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. If a U.S. holder acquired different blocks of our common stock
at different times and different prices, such U.S. holder must determine its adjusted tax basis, gain or loss and holding period separately with respect to each block of our common
stock.

Information Reporting and Backup Withholding

        Payments made in exchange for shares of our common stock pursuant to the merger may be subject, under certain circumstances, to information reporting and backup
withholding (currently at a rate of 28%). To avoid backup withholding, a U.S. holder that does not otherwise establish an exemption should complete and return to the applicable
withholding agent a properly completed and executed IRS Form W-9, certifying that such U.S. holder is a U.S. person, that the taxpayer identification number provided is
correct, and that such U.S. holder is not subject to backup withholding.

        Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be refunded or credited against a holder's U.S. federal income
tax liability, if any, provided that such holder furnishes the required information to the IRS in a timely manner.

Regulatory Approvals 

        HSR Waiting Period.    Under the HSR Act and the rules promulgated thereunder, certain transactions, including the merger, may not be completed until notifications have
been given and information furnished to the Antitrust Division and the FTC and all statutory waiting period requirements have been satisfied. Completion of the merger is subject
to the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act.

        Under the HSR Act, the merger may not be completed until the expiration of a 30 calendar day waiting period, which begins when Insight and Datalink file Premerger
Notification and Report Forms under the HSR Act with the FTC and the Antitrust Division, unless such waiting period is earlier terminated by the FTC and the Antitrust
Division. Insight and Datalink filed their Premerger Notification and Report Forms on November 21, 2016 in connection with the merger, and the waiting period will therefore
expire at 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, on December 21, 2016. If prior to the expiration or termination of the waiting period either the FTC or the Antitrust Division issues a request
for additional information or documentary material from Insight or Datalink, the waiting period with respect to the merger would be extended until the 30th calendar day
following the date of Insight's and Datalink's substantial compliance with that request. After that time, absent Insight's and Datalink's agreement, the acquisition can be blocked
only by court order. The FTC and the Antitrust Division may terminate the applicable waiting period at any time before its expiration.

        At any time (regardless of whether before or after the expiration or termination of the statutory waiting periods under the HSR Act, or before or after the effective time), the
Antitrust Division or the FTC may take action under the antitrust laws, including seeking to enjoin the completion of the merger, to rescind the merger or to conditionally permit
completion of the merger subject to regulatory conditions or other remedies. In addition, U.S. state attorneys general could take action under the antitrust laws as they deem
necessary or desirable in the public interest, including, without limitation, seeking to enjoin the completion of the merger or permitting completion subject to regulatory
conditions. Private parties may also seek to take legal action under the antitrust laws under some circumstances. Although neither Datalink nor Insight believes that the merger
will violate the antitrust laws, there can be no assurance that a challenge to the merger on antitrust grounds will not be made or, if such a challenge is made, that it would not be
successful.

        German Competition Clearance.    The merger is also subject to the merger control provisions of the German Competition Act, which among other things provides that the
merger may not be completed

until notification has been given, and clearance has been received from, the FCO. Completion of the merger is subject to receipt of such clearance from the FCO. Insight, with the
consent of Datalink, filed the appropriate notification with the FCO on November 24, 2016, and the applicable waiting period under the German Competition Act will therefore
expire on December 24, 2016, unless it is earlier terminated or extended by the FCO.

Delisting and Deregistration of Datalink Common Stock 

        If the merger is completed, our common stock will be delisted from Nasdaq and deregistered under the Exchange Act.

        We are asking you to approve a proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement. For a detailed discussion of the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, see the
section entitled "The Merger Agreement" beginning on page 61. A copy of the merger agreement is attached to this proxy statement as Annex A.

Vote Required and Board Recommendation 

        Under Minnesota Law, approval of the merger agreement requires the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock entitled to be
cast on the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement. Abstentions and broker non-votes, if any, will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the proposal.

        As discussed in the section entitled "The Merger (Proposal 1)—Reasons for our Board's Recommendation in Favor of the Merger" beginning on page 35, and after
considering various factors described in such section, our board has determined that the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger, are
fair to, advisable and in the best interests of Datalink and its shareholders and resolved to recommend that Datalink shareholders vote in favor of the approval of the merger
agreement. Accordingly, our board unanimously recommends that you vote "FOR" the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement.

Structure of the Merger; Articles of Incorporation; Bylaws; Directors and Officers; Principal Executive Offices 

        At the effective time, Merger Sub will merge with and into Datalink, and the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub will cease. Datalink will be the surviving
corporation in the merger and will continue its corporate existence as a Minnesota corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Insight.

        At the effective time, the articles of incorporation of Datalink will be amended and restated in their entirety to be identical to the form attached as Exhibit B to the merger
agreement, which is attached as Annex A hereto, and such articles will be the articles of incorporation of the surviving corporation. Also at the effective time, the bylaws of
Merger Sub will become the bylaws of the surviving corporation (except that all references therein to Merger Sub shall be automatically amended and shall become references to
surviving corporation).

        At the effective time, the individuals holding positions as directors of Merger Sub immediately before the effective time will become the initial directors of the surviving
corporation, and the

individuals holding positions as officers of Datalink immediately before the effective time will continue as the initial officers of the surviving corporation.

When the Merger Becomes Effective 

        The closing of the merger will take place at 9:00 a.m. (central time) at the offices of Faegre Baker Daniels LLP, 2200 Wells Fargo Center, 90 South Seventh Street,
Minneapolis, Minnesota 55402, no later than the later of (a) January 3, 2017, and (b) the second business day after the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted by
applicable Law) of the conditions set forth in the merger agreement to be satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the closing of
the merger, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions).

        At the closing, we will cause articles of merger to be filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Minnesota. The merger will become effective at the time when the
articles of merger are filed or at such later date or time as may be agreed by Datalink and Merger Sub and specified in the articles of merger.

        As of the date of the filing of this document, the parties expect to complete the merger in the first quarter of 2017, within several business days following the approval and
adoption of the merger agreement by Datalink's shareholders. However, completion of the merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to the completion of the
merger, and factors outside the control of Datalink or Insight may delay the completion of the merger, or prevent it from being completed at all. There can be no assurances as to
whether or when the merger will be completed.

Effect of the Merger on the Common Stock 

        At the effective time, each share of our common stock outstanding immediately prior to the effective time (other than shares of our common stock owned directly by
Datalink or Merger Sub or by any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Insight or of Datalink as of immediately prior to the effective time (the "cancelled shares") and
any shares of our common stock held of record or beneficially by a person who has not voted in favor of approval and adoption of the merger agreement and who is entitled to
properly demand dissenter's rights with respect to such shares (the "dissenting shares")) will be converted into the right to receive the merger consideration. The merger
consideration will be $11.25 per share in cash, without interest, and subject to any applicable withholding taxes.

        At the effective time, each cancelled share will be cancelled and retired and cease to exist, and no consideration will be delivered in exchange for such cancellation. Each
dissenting share will be entitled only to payment of the fair value (including interest determined in accordance with Section 302A.473 of the Minnesota Business Corporation
Act); however, if the holder of any dissenting share fails to perfect or otherwise waives, withdraws or loses the right to dissent under the dissenters' rights provisions of the
Minnesota Business Corporation Act, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such holder's dissenting shares shall cease and such dissenting shares shall be
deemed to have been converted as of the effective time into, and to have become exchangeable solely for the right to receive the merger consideration. For more information
regarding dissenters' rights, see "Dissenters' Rights" beginning on page 85.

        At the effective time, each share of common stock of Merger Sub outstanding immediately prior to the effective time will be converted into and become one validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the surviving corporation, and such shares will constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the surviving
corporation.

Treatment of Datalink Equity Awards 

        Restricted Stock.    At the effective time, each share of restricted stock that is outstanding immediately prior to the effective time will terminate and be cancelled in exchange
for the merger consideration (subject to any applicable withholding tax).

        Stock Options.    At the effective time, each stock option that is outstanding prior to the effective time, whether vested or unvested, will, (i) if the exercise price of such
option is equal to or greater than the merger consideration, terminate and be cancelled without any consideration being payable; or (ii) if the exercise price of such option is less
than the merger consideration, terminate and be cancelled in exchange for the aggregate option consideration with respect to such option (subject to any applicable withholding
tax). The option consideration equals the difference between the merger consideration and the exercise price payable for each share issuable under such option.

        Restricted Stock Units and Performance Stock Units.    At the effective time, each award of Datalink RSUs or PSUs that is outstanding or payable prior to the effective time,
whether vested or unvested, will terminate and be cancelled in exchange for the product of (i) the number of shares subject to such RSU or PSU, as applicable; and (ii) the merger
consideration (subject to any applicable withholding tax). For purposes of the merger agreement, the deferred stock units held by certain of our directors are considered RSUs.

Payment for Common Stock in the Merger 

        Promptly after the effective time, Insight will deposit, or cause to be deposited, with a U.S. bank or trust company reasonably approved in advance by Datalink (the "paying
agent"), in trust for the benefit of the holders of our common stock, cash in U.S. dollars sufficient to pay the aggregate merger consideration. Promptly after the effective time,
Insight will cause the paying agent to mail to each holder of record of shares of our common stock whose shares were converted into the right to receive the merger consideration
(1) a letter of transmittal and (2) instructions for effecting the surrender of certificates or book-entry shares formerly representing shares of our common stock in exchange for the
merger consideration. Upon surrender of certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu of certificates and, if required, the posting of a bond) or book-entry shares, as
applicable, to the paying agent together with the letter of transmittal (or a valid "agent's message" agreeing to the terms of such letter of transmittal in accordance with the
applicable procedures of The Depositary Trust Company), duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions to the letter of transmittal, and such other
documents as may customarily be required by the paying agent, the holder of such certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu of certificates) or book-entry shares will be
entitled to receive the merger consideration for all such shares.

No Solicitation; Alternative Proposals 

        We and our board will generally not be permitted to solicit or participate in discussions regarding any inquiry, indication of interest or proposal that would reasonably be
expected to lead to a takeover proposal. For purposes of the merger agreement:

• "takeover proposal" means any indication of interest, offer or proposal (other than an indication of interest, offer or proposal made or submitted by Insight)
contemplating or otherwise relating to any transaction or series of transactions involving: (a) any merger, consolidation, amalgamation, share exchange, business
combination, issuance of securities, acquisition of securities, reorganization, recapitalization, tender offer, exchange offer or other similar transaction involving
Datalink or any of its subsidiaries and (i) in which a person or group of persons directly or indirectly would acquire or own beneficial or record ownership of
securities representing more than 20% of the outstanding securities or voting power of any class of voting securities of Datalink or any surviving entity or the
resulting direct or indirect parent of Datalink or such surviving entity or (ii) in which Datalink would issue securities representing more than 20% of the
outstanding securities of any class of voting securities of Datalink; (b) any sale, lease, exchange, transfer, extraordinary dividend, license, acquisition or

• "superior proposal" means an unsolicited, bona fide written takeover proposal (provided, that for purposes of this definition, references to 20% in the definition of
"takeover proposal" shall be deemed to be references to 50%) made by a third party that our board determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal
counsel and our financial advisor (x) is reasonably capable of being consummated in accordance with its terms and (y) if consummated, would be more favorable
to the shareholders of Datalink from a financial point of view than the merger, in each case taking into account all legal, regulatory, financing (including certainty
of financing) and other factors deemed relevant by our board (including adjustments to the terms of the merger offered by Insight).

        Notwithstanding these restrictions, which we refer to as the "no-shop restrictions," or anything else to the contrary in the merger agreement, if at any time prior to the time
the requisite shareholder vote is obtained we receive a bona fide written takeover proposal that was not solicited in violation of the merger agreement, we and our representatives
will be permitted to participate in discussions regarding such takeover proposal solely to clarify the terms of such takeover proposal.

        In addition, prior to the time, but not after, the requisite shareholder vote is obtained, we and our representatives may enter into and participate in discussions or negotiations
with such third party in response to an unsolicited bona fide written takeover proposal made after the date of the merger agreement that has not been withdrawn and that did not
result (nor did any precursor thereto result) from a breach of the no-shop restrictions by us, our subsidiaries or our representatives (as if they were bound thereby), and may
furnish access and nonpublic information to such third party if (A) our board has determined in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel and our financial advisor,
that such takeover proposal is reasonably likely to constitute a superior proposal and failure to take such action would be inconsistent with our board's fiduciary duties under
applicable law; and (B) any nonpublic information furnished to such third party is (1) subject to an executed confidentiality agreement in a customary form that is no less
favorable to us with respect to confidentiality than the confidentiality agreement with Insight and that does not contain any provision that would prevent us from complying with
our obligation to provide disclosure to Insight required pursuant to the merger agreement, and (2) is furnished to Insight substantially concurrently with (but not more than
24 hours after) such nonpublic information is furnished to such person.

        During the pre-closing period, we are also required to promptly (and in any event within 24 hours after the occurrence thereof) advise Insight of the receipt of any takeover
proposal or any inquiries, proposals or offers with respect to a takeover proposal, or any non-public information with regard to a takeover proposal that is requested from, or any
discussions or negotiations sought to be initiated regarding such takeover proposal that is made or submitted by any person during such period, specifying the material terms and
conditions thereof (including the identity of the party making the takeover proposal, inquiry, proposal, offer or request). Thereafter, we are required to advise and confer with
Insight and keep Insight reasonably informed, on a prompt basis (and in any event within 24 hours after the occurrence of any changes, developments, discussions or
negotiations), regarding any material

changes to the status or material terms of any such inquiries, proposals or offers (including any modifications to the financial or other material terms and conditions of such
takeover proposal).

        Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the merger agreement, prior to the time, but not after, the requisite shareholder vote is obtained, our board may modify, waive,
amend or release any existing standstill obligations owed by any person to us or any of our subsidiaries if our board has determined in good faith, after consultation with outside
legal counsel, that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with our board's fiduciary duties under applicable law.

Change in Board Recommendation 

        As described in "The Merger (Proposal 1)—Reasons for our Board's Recommendation in Favor of the Merger" beginning on page 35, and subject to the provisions
described below, our board has unanimously recommended that our shareholders vote "FOR" the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement. We refer in this document
to the recommendation of our board that shareholders approve this merger agreement as the "board recommendation." We refer to the board recommendation and the approval of
the merger by the special committee of our board of directors together as the "board actions."

        The merger agreement provides that, except as described below, our board may not (any of the following, a "company adverse change recommendation"):

• withhold, withdraw (or amend, modify or qualify in a manner adverse to Insight), or publicly propose to withhold, withdraw (or amend, modify or qualify in a
manner adverse to Insight), the board actions; 

• fail to include the board actions in the Proxy Statement; 

• approve, recommend or declare advisable, or publicly propose to approve, recommend or declare advisable or recommend the adoption of, any takeover proposal; 

• following the commencement of any tender offer or exchange offer that constitutes a takeover proposal, fail to publicly reject or recommend against any such
takeover proposal, tender offer or exchange offer and issue a press release expressly reaffirming the board actions within certain specified time periods following a
request by Insight; or 

• following the public announcement of any other takeover proposal (or the public announcement of an intention to make any other takeover proposal), fail to issue
a press release expressly reaffirming the board actions within certain specified time periods following a request by Insight.

        Notwithstanding the restrictions described above and in "—No Solicitation; Alternative Proposals," at any time prior to the time the requisite Datalink shareholder vote is
obtained, our board may, in response to a superior proposal received on an unsolicited basis or an intervening event, (x) make a change of recommendation and/or (y) terminate
the merger agreement in order to enter into a definitive agreement providing for the implementation of a superior proposal. Our board is permitted to take these actions solely if:

• our board has received a superior proposal that did not result from or arise in connection with a breach of the no-shop restrictions or there has been an intervening
event unrelated to a takeover proposal after the date of the merger agreement; 

• in the case of any termination of the merger agreement to enter into a definitive agreement, prior to or simultaneously with such termination, Datalink pays the
termination fee (described below "—Termination Fee"); 

• Datalink has given Insight at least four business days' written notice advising Insight of its intention to take such action, which notice will include, as applicable,
the terms and conditions

of the superior proposal that is the basis for the proposed action of our board and a copy of the most recent draft of any written agreement relating to such superior
proposal (and any amendment to any material term or condition of such superior proposal shall require a new written notice to Insight and an additional two
business day notice period), or the facts and circumstances in reasonable detail of the intervening event;

• Datalink has given Insight four or two, as applicable, business days after Insight's receipt of the written notice of such superior proposal or intervening event to
propose revisions to the terms of the merger agreement or make another proposal and has negotiated in good faith with Insight with respect to such proposed
revisions or other proposal; 

• after considering the results of such negotiations and giving effect to such proposed revisions or other proposal, if any, our board has determined in good faith,
after consultation with outside legal counsel and our financial advisor, that, as applicable, such superior proposal continues to meet the definition of superior
proposal or the intervening event continues to warrant a company adverse change recommendation; and 

• after consultation with outside legal counsel, our board has determined in good faith that the failure to make such company adverse change recommendation
and/or the failure to terminate the merger agreement would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law.

        Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in the merger agreement prohibits us or our board from stating and disclosing to our shareholders a position with respect
to a tender or exchange offer by a third party pursuant to Rules 14a-9, 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act, subject to
compliance with the restrictions on a company adverse change recommendation described above. Any "stop, look and listen" communication by or on behalf of Datalink
pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) will not be considered a company adverse change recommendation.

        If, before the date of the special meeting, there has been a change of recommendation and the merger agreement has not been terminated, Datalink will nonetheless submit
the merger agreement to the shareholders of Datalink for approval and adoption at the shareholder meeting.

Datalink Shareholders' Meeting 

        Subject to the relevant provisions of the merger agreement, including our board's right to change its recommendation in favor of the merger and our right to terminate the
merger agreement to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to a superior proposal, as described in the section entitled "—Change in Board Recommendation," we have
agreed to (1) convene and hold the special meeting as promptly as practicable following the mailing of this document (and in any event no more than 30 business days or such
longer period as Datalink and Insight may agree after the date of mailing of this proxy statement), (2) recommend that Datalink shareholders vote to approve the merger and
adopt the merger agreement, and (3) use our reasonable best efforts to solicit from our shareholders proxies in favor of the approval and adoption of the merger agreement.

Preparation of Pro Forma Financial Information 

        We have agreed to cooperate and use commercially reasonable efforts during the pre-closing period to assist Insight in connection with its preparation and filing of a Current
Report on Form 8-K containing pro forma financial information with respect to the merger and Datalink, including using commercially reasonable efforts to cause and enable
RSM US LLP to provide to Insight (and not withdraw) its consent to incorporation by reference of its audit report with respect to our historical financials into Insight's SEC
registration statements.

Employee Matters 

        The merger agreement provides for the following treatment with respect to those employees of Datalink and its subsidiaries who continue to be employed by the surviving
corporation or one of its subsidiaries after the effective time, whom we refer to as "continuing employees":

• from the effective time through the first anniversary of the effective time, Insight will provide each continuing employee compensation and benefits opportunities
(excluding defined benefit plans and equity and equity-based awards) that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to either (i) the compensation and benefits
provided to such employee immediately prior to the effective time, or (ii) compensation and benefits currently provided by Insight to similarly-situated employees
of Insight; 

• Insight will honor all employee benefit plans of Datalink and all employment, severance and termination plans and contracts in accordance with their terms as in
effective immediately before the effective time; and 

• for purposes of vesting, eligibility and level of benefits under the employee benefit plans of Insight, each continuing employee will receive credit for his or her
years of service with Datalink before the effective time, to the same extent as such employee was entitled, before the effective time, to credit for such service
under any similar employee benefit plan in which such employee participated immediately prior to the effective time.

Indemnification and Insurance 

        Insight and Merger Sub have agreed that all rights to advancement of expenses, indemnification and exculpation by Datalink existing in favor of each person who is or has
been at any time prior to the date of the merger agreement or who becomes prior to the effective time, an officer or director of Datalink (each an "indemnified party"), as
provided in our indemnification agreements in effect on the date of the merger agreement, will survive the merger from the effective time through the sixth anniversary of the
date on which the effective time occurs.

        From and after the effective time, the surviving corporation is also required to (and Insight is required to cause the surviving corporation to) indemnify, defend and hold
harmless, and advance expenses to, any officer or director of Datalink as of the date of the merger agreement or who becomes such prior to the effective time with respect to
(x) all acts or omissions by them in their capacities as such at any time at or prior to the effective time or (y) any costs or expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines,
losses, claims, damages, liabilities, and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative
or investigative, to the extent such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation arises out of or pertains to the merger, the merger agreement, and any transactions, in their
capacities as such, in either case, to the fullest extent permitted by our indemnification agreements in effect on the date of the merger agreement or applicable law. In the event of
any such action, (A) the surviving corporation will have the right to control the defense thereof after the effective time; (B) the surviving corporation will advance all expenses as
incurred by such director or officer in the defense of such action upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such director or officer to repay such amount if it is ultimately
determined that such director or officer is not entitled to be indemnified; and (C) no person seeking to be indemnified will be liable for any settlement of such action effected
without his or her consent, provided that the foregoing clauses (A), (B), and (C) shall not be deemed to limit or impose additional conditions on the rights of any indemnified
party. The articles of incorporation and bylaws of the surviving corporation will contain, and Insight will cause the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the surviving
corporation to so contain, provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of each indemnified party than are set forth in
Datalink's charter documents as in effect on the date of the merger agreement.

        Insight has also agreed to either (i) cause to be maintained in effect, for a period of six years after the Effective Time, the directors' and officers' liability insurance policy
that was in effect on the date of the merger agreement (the "D&O insurance") covering acts or omissions at or prior to the effective time with respect to those persons who are
covered by the D&O insurance as of the effective time, or (ii) obtain, in consultation with Datalink, a prepaid (or "tail") directors' and officers' liability insurance policy covering
acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the effective time for a period of six years after the effective time, with respect to those persons who are covered by the D&O insurance
as of the effective time on terms with respect to such coverage and amounts no less favorable to such indemnified persons than those of the D&O insurance, subject in each case
to certain exceptions.

        Insight and the surviving corporation are required to make proper provision for the continuation of these rights in connection with certain future corporate transactions.

Coordination on Litigation 

        The merger agreement requires Datalink and Insight to promptly notify the other party of any litigation related to the merger agreement, the merger or the transactions that is
brought, or to the knowledge of such party, threatened in writing, in the name of or against Datalink, Insight, Merger Sub, or any of their respective directors, and to keep the
other party fully informed on a reasonably current basis with respect to the status of such litigation. We must give Insight the opportunity to participate, subject to a customary
joint defense agreement, and each party has agreed to cooperate with the other, in the defense or settlement of any such litigation. We are not allowed to settle, agree to any
undertakings or approve or otherwise agree to any waiver that may be sought in connection with such litigation against us or our directors except with Insight's prior written
consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

Other Covenants and Agreements 

        The merger agreement also contains additional covenants, including, among others, covenants relating to the filing of this document, public announcements relating to the
merger, elimination or any applicable takeover statutes, exemptions of dispositions of Datalink securities in connection with the merger under Rule 16b-3 of the Exchange Act
and the delisting and deregistration of our common stock.

Conditions to Completion of the Merger 

        Each party's obligation to complete the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement is subject to the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted by applicable law)
of the following conditions:

• the adoption of the merger agreement by Datalink shareholders; 

• the absence of an injunction or judgment issued by any court of competent jurisdiction or governmental authority, and of any law or other legal restraint, that
would make illegal or otherwise prevent or prohibit the consummation of the merger; and 

• the expiration or early termination of the waiting period applicable to the consummation of the merger under the HSR Act and the receipt of clearance of the FCO
under the German Competition Act.

that this condition will not apply if Insight would not otherwise be prepared to file a Current Report on Form 8-K containing pro forma financial information with

judgment, law or other legal restraint or prohibition; or 

• the requisite vote of our shareholders is not obtained at the special meeting;

provided, however, that these rights to terminate the merger agreement will not be available to any party if the circumstances giving rise to such termination right
were primarily caused or resulted primarily from the failure of such party (or in the case of Insight, by Merger Sub) to fulfill any of its obligations under the

agreement with respect to a takeover proposal; 

• this proxy statement is distributed without including our board's recommendation in favor of the merger; or

• by Datalink, 

• at any time prior to the time the Datalink shareholder vote is obtained, in order to accept a superior proposal in accordance with the no-shop restrictions,
provided that Datalink pays the termination fee; or 

• if Insight or Merger Sub has breached or failed to perform any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set forth in the merger agreement such that
the closing conditions would not be satisfied, and such breach or failure cannot be cured or, if capable of being cured, has not been cured by the earlier of
April 25, 2017 or 30 days after written notice thereof has been given by Datalink to Insight (provided, however, that this right to terminate the merger
agreement will not be available to Datalink if Datalink is then in breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set forth in the merger
agreement such that the closing conditions would not be satisfied).

Termination Fee 

        Datalink will pay Insight a termination fee in an amount equal to $7.5 million if the merger agreement is terminated in the following circumstances:

• if the merger agreement is terminated by Datalink to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to a superior proposal;

agreement with respect to a takeover proposal; or

respect to 50%, rather than 20%, of Datalink) had been made or publicly announced or otherwise become publicly known, or any Person shall have publicly
announced an intention to make a takeover proposal, and such takeover proposal has not been withdrawn without qualification at least 10 days prior to the date of
termination or, in the case of a failure by our shareholders to approve the proposal to approve and adopt the merger, at least 10 days prior to the date of the special
meeting); (2) within twelve months after the date of termination, a takeover proposal is consummated or the Company enters into a definitive agreement for a
takeover proposal that is subsequently consummated, and (3) the termination is because: 

• the effective time has not occurred by the outside date;

• we have breached or failed to perform any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement and such breach or failure first arose after the date of such
takeover proposal or announcement of such intention, or the making of any inquiry or expression of potential interest with respect to a takeover proposal
to our board or any of our officers or directors.

Limitations on Remedies 

        The merger agreement provides that any claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of, or related to the Agreement may only be brought against persons that are
expressly named as parties to the merger agreement, and then only with respect to the specific obligations set forth therein. The merger agreement is specifically without recourse
to current or future direct or indirect equity holders, controlling persons, shareholders, representatives, affiliates, members, managers, general or limited partners and assignees of
the parties and their respective affiliates.

        If the merger agreement is terminated pursuant to the provisions described in the section entitled "—Termination" beginning on page 75, the transactions contemplated by
the merger agreement will be abandoned, the merger agreement will become void and of no effect without any liability of any party to another, except that (a) termination of the
merger agreement will not relieve any party from liability for any fraud or intentional breach of the merger agreement and (b) the provisions of the merger agreement relating to
termination, fees and expenses, amendment, waiver and general matters will survive termination.

        If the termination fee is paid, the termination fee will be the sole and exclusive remedy of Insight and Merger Sub against Datalink and its subsidiaries and affiliates their
respective representatives, partners, managers, members and shareholders in connection with the merger agreement and the transactions thereby, except in the case of fraud or a
willful breach of the merger agreement.

Expenses 

        In general, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with the merger and the merger agreement will be paid by the party incurring such fees and expenses, whether or not
the merger is consummated. Insight is responsible for all filing fees associated with the HSR Act and for any transfer taxes imposed with respect to the transactions contemplated
by the merger agreement.

Amendment and Modification 

        The merger agreement may be amended at any time by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of Datalink, Insight and Merger Sub and authorized by the
respective boards of directors of the parties, except that after the merger agreement has been adopted by our shareholders, no amendment that requires further shareholder
approval under applicable law shall be made without such further approval. At any time prior to the effective time, the parties may extend the time for performance of any
obligations, waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the parties, and waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions in the merger agreement.
Any waiver must be set forth in a written instrument signed by the applicable party.

Governing Law 

        The merger agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Minnesota.

Specific Enforcement 

        Insight, Merger Sub and Datalink are entitled to a decree or order of specific performance enforcing covenants and obligations contained in the merger agreement or
injunctions to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of the merger agreement in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity, subject to the
limitations described above.

THE VOTING AGREEMENT 

        The following is a summary of the material provisions of the voting agreement, a copy of which is attached to this document as Annex B and which is incorporated by
reference into this document. This summary does not purport to be complete and may not contain all of the information about the voting agreement that is important to you. We
encourage you to read carefully the voting agreement in its entirety, as the rights and obligations of the parties thereto are governed by the express terms of the voting agreement
and not by this summary or any other information contained in this document.

        Concurrently with the execution of the merger agreement, Datalink, Insight and each of the directors of Datalink entered into a voting agreement with respect to their shares
of our common stock (the "voting agreement"). As of the date of the voting agreement, the directors owned approximately 1,558,264 voting shares of our common stock, which
we refer to as the "existing shares" and, together with any shares or other voting capital stock of Datalink of which the directors acquire beneficial ownership on or after the date
of the voting agreement, the "covered shares." The existing shares represented approximately 7.0% of our shares outstanding as of the close of business on the record date and
entitled to vote at the special meeting.

Voting 

        Each director has agreed to vote (or cause to be voted), in person or by proxy, or deliver (or cause to be delivered) a written consent covering, all of his or her covered
shares:

• in favor of the approval of the merger agreement and any related proposal in furtherance thereof and/or in furtherance of effecting the merger and the other
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement; 

• against any action or agreement submitted for the vote or written consent of our shareholders that would result in a breach in any material respect of any covenant,
representation or warranty or other obligation or agreement of Datalink under the merger agreement or that is otherwise in opposition to the merger or any of the
other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement; 

• against any extraordinary corporate transaction (other than the merger), such as a merger, consolidation, business combination, tender or exchange offer,
reorganization, recapitalization, liquidation, sale or transfer of all or substantially all of the assets or securities of Datalink and any of its subsidiaries (other than
pursuant to the merger) or any other takeover proposal; and 

• against any other action, agreement or transaction submitted for the vote or written consent of our shareholders that is intended, or could reasonably be expected
to, impede, interfere with, delay, postpone, discourage, or adversely affect the consummation of the merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by the
merger agreement.

        We refer to the foregoing matters as the voting matters.

        Notwithstanding the foregoing, each director has entered into the voting agreement solely in his or her capacity as a shareholder and not in his or her capacity as a director or
officer of Datalink or any of its subsidiaries. Accordingly, the voting agreement does not restrict or limit any director or officer from taking or omitting to take any action in their
respective capacities as a director or officer of Datalink in order to fulfill his fiduciary obligations under applicable law or acting in such capacity or voting in such capacity in the
good faith exercise of his fiduciary duties under applicable law.

Table of Contents

Prohibition on Transfers 

        Each director has agreed not to, subject to customary exceptions for charitable and estate planning purposes or the cashless vesting, exercise or settlement of equity awards:

• directly or indirectly, transfer or encumber his or her covered shares or any shares of voting capital stock of Datalink that such director may have the right to
acquire (together with the covered shares, the "covered securities"), or enter into any contract, option or other arrangement or understanding with respect to the
foregoing; 

• enter into any swap or other arrangement that transfers to another, in whole or in part, any of the economic consequences of ownership; 

• enter into any contract, option or other arrangement or understanding with respect to the voting of the covered securities; 

• enter into any agreement, arrangement or understanding with any person (other than Insight or Merger Sub), or take any other action that would prevent or disable
such director from performing his or her obligations under the merger agreement; or 

• take any action that would result in such director not having the legal power, authority or right to comply with and perform his or her covenants under the voting
agreement.

No Solicitation 

        Each director agreed in the voting agreement to be subject to restrictions that are substantially similar to the no-shop restrictions applicable to Datalink under the merger
agreement, as described in the section entitled "The Merger Agreement—No Solicitation; Alternative Proposals" beginning on page 68, subject to substantially similar exceptions.

Waiver of Appraisal Rights 

        Each director has waived, and agreed not to exercise, assert or perfect, any rights of appraisal or any dissenters' rights that he may have or could potentially have or acquire
in connection with the merger. Each director, solely in his or her capacity as a shareholder, also agreed not to bring, commence, institute, maintain, prosecute, join in or
voluntarily aid certain types of legal proceedings challenging the merger.

Termination 

        The voting agreement will remain in effect until the earliest of (i) the effective time of the merger or (ii) the termination of the merger agreement in accordance with its
terms.

ADVISORY VOTE ON NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICER MERGER-RELATED COMPENSATION
(PROPOSAL 2) 

        As required by Section 14A of the Exchange Act and the applicable SEC rules issued thereunder, we are providing our shareholders with a separate advisory (non-binding)
vote to approve certain compensation that may be paid or become payable to our named executive officers in connection with the merger, as described in the table on page 55
entitled "Golden Parachute Compensation" under "The Merger (Proposal 1)—Interests of Datalink's Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger," including the footnotes to
the table and related narrative discussion.

        Our board unanimously recommends that our shareholders approve the following resolution:

"RESOLVED, that the compensation that may be paid or become payable to Datalink's named executive officers in connection with the merger, and the
agreements or understandings pursuant to which such compensation may be paid or become payable, in each case as disclosed pursuant to Item 402(t) of
Regulation S-K in the table in the section entitled "The Merger (Proposal 1)—Interests of Datalink's Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—
Quantification of Payments and Benefits to Datalink Executives," including the footnotes to the table and the related narrative discussion, is hereby APPROVED."

        The vote on the named executive officer merger-related compensation proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote on the proposal to approve and adopt the merger
agreement. Accordingly, you may vote to approve and adopt the merger agreement and vote not to approve the named executive officer merger-related compensation proposal
and vice versa. Because the vote on the named executive officer merger-related compensation proposal is advisory only, it will not be binding on either Datalink or Insight.
Accordingly, if the merger agreement is approved and the merger is completed, the compensation will be payable, subject only to the conditions applicable thereto under the
applicable compensation agreements and arrangements, regardless of the outcome of the non-binding, advisory vote of our shareholders.

        The above resolution approving the merger-related compensation of our named executive officers on an advisory basis requires that more shares are voted "FOR" the
proposal than "AGAINST."

        Our board unanimously recommends that the shareholders of Datalink vote "FOR" the named executive officer merger-related compensation proposal.

VOTE ON ADJOURNMENT (PROPOSAL 3) 

        Our shareholders are being asked to approve a proposal that will give our board authority to adjourn the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, including to solicit
additional proxies in favor of the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement, if there are insufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the proposal to
approve and adopt the merger agreement or in the absence of a quorum. If this adjournment proposal is approved, the special meeting could be adjourned by our board to any
date. In addition, our board could postpone the special meeting before it commences. If the special meeting is adjourned for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies,
shareholders who have already submitted their proxies will be able to revoke them at any time before the final vote.

        We do not anticipate calling a vote on this proposal if a quorum is present and the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement is approved by at least a majority of
the outstanding shares of our common stock as of the record date.

        The vote on the adjournment proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote on the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement. Accordingly, you may vote to
approve the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement and vote not to approve the adjournment proposal and vice versa.

        Approval of the adjournment proposal requires that more shares are voted "FOR" the proposal than "AGAINST."

        Our board unanimously recommends that the shareholders of Datalink vote "FOR" the adjournment proposal, if a vote on such proposal is called.

MARKET PRICE OF DATALINK'S COMMON STOCK 

        Our common stock is traded on Nasdaq under the symbol "DTLK."

        The following table sets forth during the periods indicated the high and low sales prices of our common stock as reported on Nasdaq for the periods indicated:

        The closing sale price of our common stock on November 4, 2016, which was the last trading day before the merger was publicly announced, was $9.43 per share. On
November 28, 2016 the most recent practicable date before the filing of this document, the closing price for our common stock was $11.16 per share. You are encouraged to
obtain current market quotations for our common stock in connection with voting your shares of our common stock.

        We have paid no dividends on our common stock since our initial public offering in 1999. Under our current dividend policy, we intend to retain future earnings for use in
our business, and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.

        If the merger is consummated, then our common stock will be delisted from Nasdaq, there will be no further public market for shares of our common stock and each share of
our common stock will be converted into the right to receive $11.25 in cash, without interest, less any required withholding taxes.

SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT 

        The following table provides information with respect to the beneficial ownership of our common stock as of November 23, 2016 by (i) each shareholder known to us to be
the beneficial owner of more than 5% of our outstanding our common stock, (ii) each of our directors, (iii) each of our named executive officers, and (iv) all of our current
executive officers and directors as a group.

        We have determined beneficial ownership in accordance with the rules of the SEC. Except as indicated by the footnotes to the tables below, we believe, based on the
information furnished to us, that the persons and entities named in the tables below have sole voting and investment power with respect to all shares of our common stock that
they beneficially own. Unless otherwise noted, the address of each beneficial owner listed on the tables below is c/o Datalink Corporation, 10050 Crosstown Circle, Suite 500,
Eden Prairie, MN 55344.

        This table is based upon information supplied by our officers, directors and the Schedules 13D and 13G that have been filed with the SEC, and the information is not
necessarily indicative of beneficial ownership for any other purpose. Under such rules, beneficial ownership includes any shares as to which the individual or entity has sole or
shared voting power or investment power and any shares as to which the individual or entity has the right to acquire beneficial ownership within 60 days of November 23, 2016,
including through the exercise of any stock option or the settlement of any equity award, and so we have deemed such shares to be outstanding for purposes of computing both
the number of shares of stock owned by and the percentage ownership of such shareholder. The inclusion of such shares, however, does not constitute an admission that the
named shareholder is a direct or indirect beneficial owner of, or receives the economic benefit from, such shares and we did not deem these shares outstanding for the purpose of
computing the percentage ownership of any other person.

DISSENTERS' RIGHTS 

        The following is a summary of the material provisions of Sections 302A.471 and 302A.473 of the Minnesota Business Corporation Act, copies of which are attached to this
document as Annex C and which is incorporated by reference into this document. This summary does not purport to be complete and may not contain all of the information
about these statutory provisions that is important to you. We encourage you to read carefully Sections 302A.471 and 302A.473 of the Minnesota Business Corporation Act in
their entirety, as the rights and obligations of the Company and its shareholders are governed by the express terms of these statutory provisions and other applicable law and not
by this summary or any other information contained in this document.

        Section 302A.471 of the Minnesota Business Corporation Act entitles any Datalink shareholder who is entitled to vote and who objects to a merger to dissent from such
action and obtain payment for the "fair value" of his or her shares of our common stock. Any Datalink shareholder contemplating an attempt to assert and exercise dissenters'
rights in connection with the merger should review carefully the provisions of Sections 302A.471 and 302A.473 of the Minnesota Business Corporation Act (copies of which are
attached to this document as Annex C), particularly the specific procedural steps required to perfect such rights. Dissenters' rights are lost if the procedural requirements of
Section 302A.473 are not fully and precisely satisfied.

        Under Section 302A.473, subdivision 3, a shareholder who wishes to exercise dissenters' rights, which we refer to as a dissenter, must file with us (at c/o Datalink
Corporation, 10050 Crosstown Circle, Suite 500, Eden Prairie, MN 55344), before the shareholder vote on the merger, a written notice of intent to demand the "fair value" of the
shares of our common stock owned by the shareholder. Under Section 302A.471, subdivision 2, beneficial owners of shares who desire to exercise statutory dissenters' rights
must obtain and submit the registered owner's written consent at or before the time the notice of intent to demand fair value is due. In addition, the shareholder must not vote his
or her shares in favor of the merger. A vote against the merger does not in itself constitute such a written notice and a failure to vote does not affect the validity of a timely written
notice. However, the submission of a properly signed blank proxy will constitute a vote in favor of approving the merger and a waiver of statutory dissenters' rights.

        If the merger is approved by our shareholders, then we must send to all dissenters who filed the necessary notice of intent to demand the fair value of their shares (and who
did not vote their shares in favor of such proposal) a notice containing certain information required by Section 302A.473, subdivision 4, including the address to which a
dissenter must send a demand for payment and certificates representing shares in order to obtain payment for such shares and the date by which they must be received. In order to
receive the fair value of the shares under Section 302A.473, a dissenter must demand payment and deposit certificates representing shares within 30 days after we give such
notice. Under Minnesota law, notice by mail is given by a corporation when deposited in the United States mail. A shareholder who fails to timely make demand for payment
and to deposit certificates as required by Section 302A.473, subdivision 4, loses the right to receive the fair value of his or her shares under such section
notwithstanding the timely filing of notice of intent to demand payment under Section 302A.473, subdivision 3.

        Except as provided below, if demand for payment and deposit of stock certificates is duly made by a dissenter as required by the notice, then after our receipt of such
demand or the effective date of the merger, whichever is later, we must pay the dissenter an amount which we estimate to be the fair value of the dissenter's shares of our
common stock, with interest, if any. For the purpose of a dissenter's rights under Sections 302A.471 and 302A.473, "fair value" means the value of the shares of stock
immediately before the effective date of such merger. It is possible that the fair value of shares of our common stock as determined pursuant to dissenters' rights
procedures may be determined to be less than the value of the merger consideration. Additionally, "interest" means interest commencing

five days after the effective date of such merger until the date of payment, calculated at the rate provided in Minnesota Statutes Section 549.09 Subd. 1, Paragraph (c), clause (1),
which is currently 4.0%. If a dissenter believes this payment is less than the fair value of the shares of our common stock, with interest, if any, such dissenter must give written
notice to us of his or her own estimate of the fair value of the shares of stock, with interest, if any, within 30 days after the date we mail the payment, and must demand payment
of the difference between his or her estimate and our payment. If such dissenter fails to give written notice of such estimate to us, or fails to demand payment of the difference,
within the 30-day time period, such dissenter is entitled only to the amount of our payment.

        We may withhold such payment with respect to shares of our common stock for which a dissenter demanding payment (or persons on whose behalf such dissenter acts) was
not the beneficial owner as of the first public announcement date of the merger, which is November 7, 2016. As to each such dissenter who has validly demanded payment,
following the effective date of such merger or the receipt of demand, whichever is later, we must mail our estimate of the fair value of such dissenter's shares of stock and offer to
pay this amount with interest, if any, to the dissenter upon receipt of such dissenter's agreement to accept this amount in full satisfaction. If such dissenter believes that our offer
is for less than the fair value of the shares of stock, with interest, if any, such dissenter must give written notice to us of his or her own estimate of the fair value of the shares of
stock, with interest, if any, and demand payment of this amount. This demand must be mailed to us within 30 days after the mailing of our offer. If the dissenter fails to make this
demand within the 30-day time period, such dissenter is entitled only to the amount we offered.

        If we and a dissenter (including both a dissenter who held shares of our common stock on or prior to November 7, 2016, which was the date the merger was first publicly
announced, and a dissenter who purchased shares of our common stock after such date who have complied with their respective demand requirements) do not settle the
dissenter's demand within 60 days after we receive the dissenter's estimate of the fair value of his or her shares of stock, then we must file a petition in a court of competent
jurisdiction in the county in which our registered office is located, requesting that the court determine the statutory fair value of stock with interest, if any. Our registered office is
currently located in Ramsey County, Minnesota, but is subject to change at any time. All dissenters whose demands are not settled within the applicable 60-day settlement period
must be made parties to this proceeding.

        The court will then determine whether each dissenter in question has fully complied with the provisions of Section 302A.473, and for all dissenters who have fully complied
and not forfeited statutory dissenters' rights, will determine the fair value of the shares, taking into account any and all factors the court finds relevant (including, without
limitation, the recommendation of any appraisers which may have been appointed by the court), computed by any method that the court, in its discretion, sees fit to use, whether
or not used by us or a dissenter. The fair value of the shares as determined by the court is binding on all dissenters. However, under the statute, dissenters are not liable to us for
the amount, if any, by which payments remitted to the dissenters exceed the fair value of such shares determined by a court, with interest. The costs and expenses of such a court
proceeding are assessed against us, except that the court may assess part or all of those costs and expenses against a dissenter whose action in demanding payment is found to be
arbitrary, vexatious or not in good faith.

        Under Section 302A.471, subdivision 2, a shareholder may not assert dissenters' rights with respect to less than all of the shares of our common stock registered in such
shareholder's name, unless the shareholder dissents with respect to all shares beneficially owned by another person and discloses the name and address of such other person.

        Under Section 302A.471, subdivision 4, a shareholder has no right at law or in equity to have the merger agreement set aside or rescinded, except if approval or
consummation of such merger agreement is fraudulent with respect to such shareholder or us.

        In view of the complexity of Section 302A.471 of the Minnesota Business Corporation Act, the Company's shareholders who may wish to pursue dissenters' rights should
consult their legal and financial advisors.

FUTURE SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS 

        Depending on if and when the merger is completed, we may not hold an annual meeting of shareholders in 2017. If the merger is completed, we will not hold an annual
meeting of shareholders in 2018. If the merger is not completed, you will continue to be entitled to attend and participate in our annual meetings of shareholders. If any such
annual meeting is held, shareholder proposals will be eligible for consideration for inclusion in the proxy statement and form of proxy for such annual meeting of shareholders in
accordance with Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act and our bylaws.

initial directors of the Surviving Corporation and shall serve until the earlier of their resignation or removal or their respective successors are elected or appointed and
qualified in accordance with applicable Law, as the case may be. The officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial officers of the

Shares) shall be converted automatically into the right to receive from Parent and the Surviving Corporation an amount in cash equal to $11.25, without interest
(the "Merger Consideration"). As of the Effective Time, all such Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to
exist, and each holder of a Certificate representing any such Shares or of any Book-Entry Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the
right to receive the Merger Consideration upon surrender of such Certificate or such Book-Entry Shares in accordance with Section 1.7, without interest and
subject to any withholding of Taxes required by applicable Law.

         (ii)  Each Share owned by Merger Sub, Parent or any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent or of the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be cancelled without any conversion thereof and no payment shall be made with respect thereto.

        Section 1.6    Dissenters' Rights.     

        (a)   Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held of record or beneficially by a
Person who has not voted in favor of approval of the Merger and adoption of the Plan of Merger and who is entitled to demand and properly demands dissenter's rights
with respect to such Shares ("Dissenting Shares") pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, Sections 302A.471 and 302A.473 of the MBCA (the "Dissenters'
Rights"), shall not be converted into or represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration for such Dissenting Shares but instead shall be entitled only to payment of
the fair value (including interest determined in accordance with Section 302A.473 of the MBCA) of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the Dissenters' Rights;
provided, however, that if any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to dissent under the Dissenters' Rights, then the right of
such holder to be paid the fair value of such holder's Dissenting Shares shall cease and such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective
Time into, and to have become exchangeable solely for the right to receive, the Merger Consideration, upon surrender of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with
Section 1.7, without interest and subject to any withholding of Taxes required by applicable Law.

        (b)   The Company shall provide prompt notice to Parent and its counsel of any demands, attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served
pursuant to applicable Law that are received by the Company for Dissenters' Rights with respect to any Shares, and Parent shall have the right to participate in all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, make any
payment with respect to, or settle or compromise or offer to settle or compromise, any such demand, or agree to do any of the foregoing.

        (c)   If the Surviving Corporation makes any payment with respect to the Dissenting Shares to the holders thereof pursuant to the Dissenters' Rights, then any portion
of the Merger Consideration relating to such Dissenting Shares held in the Exchange Fund shall be delivered by the Paying Agent to the Surviving Corporation upon
demand.

        Section 1.7    Exchange of Certificates.     

        (a)    Paying Agent.    A paying agent selected by Parent with the Company's prior approval (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall act as
agent (the "Paying Agent") for the payment of the aggregate Merger Consideration in accordance with the terms of this Section 1.7. Parent shall, or shall take all steps
necessary to enable and cause Merger Sub to, deposit with the Paying Agent at or promptly following (and in any event within the same day as) the Effective Time, the
cash necessary to pay for the Shares converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 1.5 (the "Exchange Fund"). The Exchange Fund
shall not be used for any other purpose. The Exchange Fund shall, pending its disbursement to such

holders, be held in cash or invested in Specified Securities by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent; provided that no gain or loss thereon shall affect the amounts
payable hereunder and Parent shall take all actions necessary to ensure that the Exchange Fund includes at all times cash sufficient to satisfy Parent's obligation under this
Agreement. Any net profit resulting from, or interest or income produced by, such amounts on deposit with the Paying Agent will be payable to Parent or as Parent
otherwise directs, and no part of such net profits shall accrue to the benefit of holders of the Shares.

        (b)    Exchange Procedures.    Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each Person who was a holder of record of Shares
immediately prior to the Effective Time, whose Shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 1.5, (i) a letter of transmittal
in customary form for use in effecting the surrender of stock certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented Shares (each, a "Certificate") or
uncertificated Shares represented by book-entry ("Book-Entry Shares") (which letter of transmittal shall include customary provisions with respect to the use of an
"agent's message" for Book-Entry Shares and shall also specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall pass,
only upon delivery of the Certificates or transfer of the Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent); and (ii) instructions for use in surrendering the Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate or a Book-Entry Share for cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with a
completed and duly executed letter of transmittal (or a valid "agent's message" agreeing to the terms of such letter of transmittal, sent in accordance with the applicable
procedures of The Depositary Trust Company) and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate or Book-
Entry Share shall be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration for each Share formerly represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share, net of applicable Taxes
withheld pursuant to Section 1.7(f), and the Certificate or Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall then be cancelled. If payment of any Merger Consideration is to be
made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate(s) formerly representing Shares are registered in the transfer records of the Company, it
shall be a condition of payment that such Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the Person requesting such
payment shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the
satisfaction of Parent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. Payment of the applicable Merger Consideration with respect to Book-Entry Shares shall be made
only to the Person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are registered. Until surrendered in accordance with this Section 1.7(b), subject to the Dissenters' Rights, each
Certificate and Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at all times from and after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger

Company's shareholders under the MBCA and the Company Charter Documents, to carry out its obligations hereunder. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by
the Company, the performance by the Company of its obligations hereunder and the consummation by the Company of the Transactions have been duly authorized and
approved by the Company Board and the Special Committee. No other corporate proceeding on the part of the Company is necessary to authorize the execution and
delivery of this Agreement, the performance by the Company of its obligations hereunder and the consummation by the Company of the Transactions, except for the
approval of the Merger and adoption of the Plan of Merger by the holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding Shares (the "Required Company Shareholder Vote").
This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company and constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the Company, assuming due and valid
authorization, execution and delivery thereof by Parent and Merger Sub, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency,
fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium or similar Laws of general application affecting or relating to the enforcement of creditors rights generally and equitable
principles of general applicability, whether considered in a proceeding at law or in equity (the "Bankruptcy and Equity Exception").

        (b)   Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company nor the performance or consummation by the Company of the Transactions will (i) result
in a violation or breach of or conflict with the Company Charter Documents; (ii) result in a modification, violation or breach of, increased or accelerated liability or
obligations under or conflict with any provisions of, or result in the loss of any benefit under or constitute a default (or an event that, with notice or lapse of time or both,

like) under, or accelerate the performance required by, or result in a right of termination or acceleration under, or result in the creation of any Lien upon, any of the
properties, rights or assets owned or operated by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any Contract to which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of them or their respective properties, rights or assets may be bound; or (iii) subject to receipt of the
Required Company Shareholder Vote and obtaining or making the Consents referred to in Section 2.3(c), violate any judgment, ruling, order, writ, injunction or decree of
any Governmental Authority ("Judgment") or any statute, code, decree, law, ordinance, rule, regulation or order of any Governmental Authority ("Law"), in each case
applicable to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective properties or assets, other than, with respect to events described in the foregoing clauses (ii) and
(iii), as would not reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, (A) prevent or materially impair or delay the ability of the Company to carry out its
obligations under this Agreement, and to consummate the Transactions; or (B) otherwise have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Section 2.3(b) of the Company
Disclosure Letter sets forth a correct and complete list of Company Material Contracts pursuant to the terms of which material consents or waivers are required prior to

Plan, in each case that represent less than one percent of the outstanding capital stock of the applicable company, the Company does not own or control, directly or indirectly, any

involved (except as otherwise noted therein) and present fairly in all material respects the financial position and the results of operations and cash flows of the Company
as of the dates or for the periods presented therein (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to normal and recurring year-end adjustments that will not be material in
amount or effect). Except as disclosed or reflected in the Company Financial Statements as of and for the period ended December 31, 2015 or otherwise disclosed in the
Company SEC Reports filed after that date and prior to the date of this Agreement, the Company does not have any liabilities or obligations (whether absolute, accrued,
contingent, fixed or otherwise) of any nature, whether or not required to be recorded or reflected on a balance sheet in accordance with GAAP, other than (i) liabilities or
obligations incurred in the Ordinary Course of Business since December 31, 2015; (ii) liabilities or obligations that have not had and would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect; or (iii) liabilities or obligations incurred in connection with the Transactions.

        (c)   Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, or has any commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet partnership or
any similar contract (including any contract or arrangement relating to any transaction or relationship between or among the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the
one hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate, including any structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or Person, on the other hand), or any "off-balance
sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC), where the intended result, purpose or effect of such contract is to avoid
disclosure of any material transaction involving, or material liabilities of, the Company in the Company SEC Reports.

        (d)   The Company is in compliance in all material respects with the applicable provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the "Sarbanes-Oxley Act"). Each
required form, report and document containing financial statements that has been filed with or submitted to the SEC was accompanied by (or if filed after the date hereof,
will be accompanied by) the certifications, if any, required to be filed or submitted by the Company's chief executive officer and chief financial officer pursuant to the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act and, at the time of filing or submission of each such certification, such certification complied (or if filed after the date hereof, will comply) in all
material respects with the applicable provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.

        (e)   The Company maintains a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 promulgated under the Exchange Act) that
provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in its filings with the SEC and other public disclosure documents is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management
as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The Company and its Subsidiaries have established and maintained a system of internal controls
over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15 under the 1934 Act). Such system of internal controls over financial reporting is sufficient to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of the Company's financial reporting and the preparation of Company financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
GAAP.

        (f)    There are no internal investigations, any SEC inquiries or investigations or other governmental inquiries or investigations pending or, to the Knowledge of the
Company, threatened, in each case regarding any accounting practices of the Company (excluding routine audits and reviews in connection with the preparation of
financial statements and not relating to any alleged errors or improprieties).

        (a)   Section 2.10(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a complete and accurate list, as of the date of this Agreement, of all material Employee Benefit
Plans. For purposes of this Agreement, "Employee Benefit Plan" means any benefit or bonus or incentive compensation plan, program, policy, practice, agreement,
contract, arrangement or other obligation, whether or not in writing and whether or not funded, in each case, which is sponsored or maintained by, or required to be
contributed to, or with respect to which any potential liability is borne by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. For the avoidance of doubt, Employee Benefit Plans
include any "employee benefit plan" within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA (each, an "ERISA Plan").

        (b)   With respect to each material Employee Benefit Plan, the Company has made available to Parent, to the extent applicable, accurate and complete copies of
(1) the Employee Benefit Plan document, including any amendments thereto, and all related trust documents, insurance contracts or other funding vehicles, (2) a written
description of such Employee Benefit Plan if such plan is not set forth in a written document, (3) the most recently prepared actuarial report, and (4) all material
correspondence to or from any Governmental Authority received in the last three years.

        (c)   With respect to each ERISA Plan, the Company has made available to Parent, to the extent applicable, accurate and complete copies of (1) the most recent
summary plan description together with any summaries of all material modifications thereto, (2) the most recent IRS determination or opinion letter, and (3) the most
recent annual report (Form 5500 or 990 series and all schedules and financial statements attached thereto).

        (d)   (i) Each Employee Benefit Plan (including any related trusts) has been established and administered in all material respects in accordance with its terms, and in
compliance in all material respects with the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code and other applicable Laws; (ii) all contributions or other amounts payable by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to each Employee Benefit Plan in respect of current or prior plan years have been paid or accrued in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles; and (iii) no actions, suits or claims (other than routine claims for benefits in the ordinary course) are pending or, to the Knowledge of the
Company, threatened with respect to any Employee Benefit Plan which could reasonably be expected to result in a material liability to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries.

        (e)   Each Employee Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code is so qualified and has received a determination or opinion letter
from the IRS to the effect that such Employee Benefit Plan is qualified and the plan and trust related thereto are exempt from federal income taxes under Sections 401(a)
and 501(a), respectively, of the Code and, to the Company's Knowledge, nothing has occurred that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect the qualification or
tax exemption of any such Employee Benefit Plan.

        (f)    None of the Company, any Subsidiary of the Company or any ERISA Affiliate has within the last six years (i) sponsored, maintained or been obligated to
contribute to an Employee Benefit Plan that is or was ever subject to Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 or Title IV of ERISA; or (ii) been obligated to contribute to a
"multiemployer plan" (as defined in Sections 4001(a)(3) and 3(37) of ERISA). For purposes of this Agreement, "ERISA Affiliate" means all employers (whether or not
incorporated) that would be treated together with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a "single employer" within the meaning of Section 414 of the Code.

        (g)   None of the Employee Benefit Plans promises or provides retiree medical or other retiree welfare benefits to any Person, except as required by applicable Law.

necessary to enable it to own, operate and lease its properties and to carry on its business as now conducted, and (iii) is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in good
standing (with respect to jurisdictions that recognize the concept of good standing) as a foreign corporation authorized to do business in each of the jurisdictions in which the
character of the properties owned or held under lease by it or the nature of the business transacted by it makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except in each case the
lack of which has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

        Section 3.2    Merger Sub.     Merger Sub is a wholly owned, direct subsidiary of Parent that was formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the Transactions. Since the

        (a)   Each of Parent and Merger Sub has the requisite corporate power and authority to enter into and deliver this Agreement and to carry out its obligations
hereunder. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub, the performance by Parent and Merger Sub of their respective obligations hereunder
and the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the Transactions have been duly authorized by the respective Boards of Directors of Parent and Merger Sub, and by
Parent as the sole shareholder of Merger Sub, and no other corporate proceedings on the part of Parent or Merger Sub are necessary to authorize the execution and
delivery of this Agreement, the performance by Parent and Merger Sub of their respective obligations hereunder and the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the
Transactions. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Parent and Merger Sub and constitutes a valid and binding obligation of each of Parent and
Merger Sub, assuming due and valid authorization, execution and delivery thereof by the Company, enforceable against each of Parent and Merger Sub in accordance
with its terms, subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception.

        (b)   The respective Board of Directors of each of Parent and Merger Sub has, by resolutions duly adopted, and not subsequently rescinded or modified in any way,
approved and declared the advisability of this Agreement, the Plan of Merger, the Merger and the other Transactions.

the Company or any Subsidiary, including any individual on an approved leave of absence (including without limitation short-term disability leave) immediately prior to
the Effective Time (the "Continuing Employees"), (i) the same salary or hourly wage rate provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time;
(ii) the same target short-term (annual or more frequent) bonus or commission opportunity provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective
Time; and (iii) other compensation and benefits (excluding defined benefit plans and equity and equity-based awards) that are no less favorable in the aggregate than
those provided to the Company Employees under the compensation and benefit plans, programs, policies, agreements and

arrangements of the Company and its Subsidiaries in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time. From the later of the Effective Time and December 31, 2016 through
the first anniversary of the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates to, provide to each individual who
was a Continuing Employee and continues to be employed by the Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates, including any such Continuing
Employee on an approved leave of absence (including without limitation short-term disability leave) immediately prior to December 31, 2016, compensation and benefits
opportunities (excluding defined benefit plans and equity and equity based-awards) that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to either (i) the compensation and
benefits opportunities (excluding defined benefit plans and equity and equity based-awards) provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective
Time, or (ii) the compensation and benefits opportunities (excluding defined benefit plans and equity and equity based-awards) currently provided by Parent or its
Affiliates to similarly-situated employees of Parent or its Affiliates. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, and subject to the conditions of
Section 5.2(b), after the Effective Time, nothing in this Section 5.2(a) shall preclude the Surviving Corporation from terminating the employment of any Company
Employee for any lawful reason.

        (b)   From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall honor and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to honor all Employee Benefit Plans of the Company
(excluding the Stock Plans to be terminated at or prior to the Effective Time in accordance herewith) and all employment, severance and termination plans and Contracts,
in each case in accordance with their terms as in effect immediately before the Effective Time; provided, that this Section 5.2(b) shall not prevent the amendment or
termination of any specific Employee Benefit Plan or Contract in accordance with the terms thereof.

        (c)   For purposes of vesting, eligibility to participate and level of benefits under the employee benefit plans of Parent providing benefits to any Company Employees
after the Effective Time (the "New Plans"), each Company Employee shall be credited with his or her years of service with the Company and its predecessors before the
Effective Time, to the same extent as such Company Employee was entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for such service under any similar Employee Benefit
Plan in which such Company Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time; provided, that the foregoing shall not apply to defined benefit plans (for the
sake of benefit accruals only) or to the extent that its application would result in a duplication of benefits. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
Parent shall (i) cause each Company Employee to be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting period, in any and all New Plans except to the extent any
waiting period in effect under the comparable Employee Benefit Plan in which such Company Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time would not
have been satisfied; and (ii) use reasonable best efforts to cause (A) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical, vision or disability benefits
to any Company Employee, all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such Company Employee and his
or her covered dependents; and (B) any eligible expenses incurred by such Company Employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of
the Employee Benefit Plan ending on the date such Company Employee's participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account under such New
Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such Company Employee and his or her covered
dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan.

        (d)   Prior to the Effective Time, if requested by Parent in writing at least 20 Business Days prior to Closing, to the extent permitted by applicable Law and the terms
of the applicable plan or arrangement, the Company shall cause the Datalink Corporation Employee Tax Savings Plan and

Trust (the "Company 401(k) Plan") to be terminated effective immediately prior to the Effective Time. In the event that Parent requests that the Company 401(k) Plan be
terminated, then (i) the Company shall provide Parent with evidence that the Company 401(k) Plan has been terminated to the extent permitted by applicable Law and the
terms of the applicable plan or arrangement (the form and substance of which evidence shall be subject to review and approval by Parent, not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed) not later than immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the Parent shall cause its 401(k) plan (or the plan of an Affiliate) to
accept rollovers of outstanding balances and participant loans under the Company 401(k) Plan on the Closing Date.

        (e)   Nothing in this Agreement shall (1) modify or amend any Employee Benefit Plan of the Company or other agreement, plan, program, or document unless this
Agreement explicitly states that the provision "amends" such Employee Benefit Plan of the Company or other agreement, plan, program, or document, (2) prevent Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates from amending or terminating any of their benefit plans or, after the Effective Time, any Employee Benefit Plan in
accordance with their terms, (3) prevent Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates, after the Effective Time, from terminating the employment of any
Company Employee, or (4) create any third-party beneficiary rights in any employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any beneficiary or dependent thereof,
with respect to the compensation, terms and conditions of employment and/or benefits that may be provided to any Company Employee by Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their Affiliates or under any benefit plan which Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates may maintain. Without limiting the
generality of Section 8.6, nothing in this Section 5.2 shall be construed as giving any Person (including any Company Employee or dependent or beneficiary thereof) any
right, remedy or claim under or in respect of this Section 5.2.

        (f)    Prior to making any written communications (within the meaning of Rule 14a-12 promulgated under the Exchange Act) to the directors, officers or employees
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pertaining to compensation or benefit matters that are affected by the Transactions (other than any communications which are
consistent in all material respects with prior communications made by Parent or by the Company in accordance with this Agreement), the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide Parent with a copy of the intended communication and to provide Parent with a reasonable period of
time to review and comment on the communication.

        Section 5.3    Public Statements.     Each of Parent and the Company agrees that no public release or announcement concerning the Transactions shall be issued by any party
without the prior written consent of the Company and Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), except as such release or announcement
may be required by applicable Law, court process or any listing rules of NASDAQ or other national securities exchanges or trading markets; provided, however, that these
restrictions shall not apply to (a) any Company communications regarding (or any Parent communications in response thereto) a Company Adverse Change Recommendation,
(b) releases or announcements to the extent that they are substantially similar to previous releases or announcements made by the Company or Parent in compliance herewith or
(c) the Pro Forma 8-K to be filed after the close of business of the Business Day prior to the Closing Date. The parties shall issue a joint press release, mutually acceptable to the
Company and Parent, promptly upon execution and delivery of this Agreement.

to this Agreement shall (i) use reasonable best efforts to make or obtain as soon as practicable all Consents (if any) required to be made with or given to any
Governmental Authority by such party in connection with the Merger and each of the other Transactions; and (ii) at Parent's request, use reasonable best efforts to make
or obtain as soon as practicable each other Consent (if any) of any third party (including any Governmental Authority) required, proper or advisable to be obtained
(pursuant to any applicable Law or Contract, or otherwise) by such party in connection with the Merger and each of the other Transactions; provided, that in no event will
the Company be obligated to pay prior to the Effective Time any material fee, penalty or other material consideration to any third party to obtain any consent pursuant to
this Section 5.4, and the Company shall not pay or become obligated with respect to any fee, penalty or other consideration to any third party (other than filing fees
payable pursuant to filings required under Antitrust Laws as set forth in Section 5.4(b)) to obtain any consent pursuant to this Section 5.4 without the prior consent of
Parent. The Company and Parent will consult and cooperate with one another, and will consider in good faith the views of one another, in connection with any actions
described in this Section 5.4.

        (b)   Without limiting the generality of Section 5.4(a), as promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement (but in no event later than the tenth Business Day
after the date hereof, or, in the case of filings pursuant to clause (ii), the fifteenth Business Day after the date hereof), each of Parent and the Company shall file and not
withdraw (i) any Notification and Report Forms and related material required to be filed by it with the Federal Trade Commission and the United States Department of
Justice, as applicable, pursuant to the HSR Act, together with a request for early termination of the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act, and (ii) any filings
required to be made by it with any Governmental Authority under any other applicable Laws that are designed or intended to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having
the purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of trade or significant impediments or lessening of competition or creation or strengthening of a dominant position
through merger or acquisition ("Other Antitrust Laws" and, together with the HSR Act, the "Antitrust Laws"), and shall promptly make any further filings pursuant thereto
that may be necessary.

        (c)   If Parent or the Company (or any of their respective Affiliates) receives a request for additional information from any Governmental Authority that is related to
the Transactions, then such party shall endeavor in good faith to make, or cause to be made, and after consultation with the other party, an appropriate response to such
request. No party shall participate in any meeting or engage in any material substantive conversation with any Governmental Authority relating to the Transactions
without giving the other party prior notice of the meeting or conversation and, unless prohibited by such Governmental Authority, the opportunity to attend or participate.
Parent shall advise the Company promptly of any understandings, undertakings or agreements (oral or written) which Parent proposes to make or enter into with any
Governmental Authority in connection with the Transactions. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to resolve
any objections that may be asserted with respect to the Transactions under any Antitrust Law as promptly as practicable. Parent and the Company shall have the right to
review in advance, and to the extent practicable each will consult with the other on and consider in good faith the views of the other in connection with, all of the
information relating to Parent or the Company, as the case may be, and any of their respective Subsidiaries, that appears in any filing made with, or written materials
submitted to, any third party and/or any Governmental Authority in connection with the Merger and the other Transactions. In exercising the foregoing rights, each of the
Company and Parent shall act reasonably and as promptly as practicable.

Transactions; (ii) any notice or other communication from any Governmental Authority in connection with the Transactions; (iii) any Actions commenced or, to its Knowledge,
threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting the Company or Parent and Merger Sub, as the case may be, that, if pending on the date of this Agreement,

Parent and Merger Sub or the Company, as the case may be, to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this
Agreement; provided, however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 5.5 shall not (i) cure any breach of, or non-compliance with, any other provision of this
Agreement; or (ii) limit the remedies available to the party receiving such notice; provided, further, that a party's good faith failure to comply with this Section 5.5 shall not
provide any other party the right not to effect the Transactions, except to the extent that any other provision of this Agreement independently provides such right.

        (a)   During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company shall afford, and shall cause the officers, directors and employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries to afford,
the officers, employees and agents of Parent and Merger Sub reasonable access during normal business hours, to the officers, employees, properties, facilities, books,
records, correspondence (in each case, whether in physical or electronic form), contracts and other assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries as Parent shall reasonably
request as long as such access does not interfere with the conduct of the Company's business, and shall promptly furnish Parent and Merger Sub (i) a copy of each report,
schedule and other document filed or submitted by it pursuant to the requirements of federal or state securities Laws and a copy of any communication received by the
Company from the SEC concerning compliance with securities laws with respect to matters unrelated to the Transactions; and (ii) all other information concerning its
business, properties and personnel, in each case (A) as Parent through its officers, employees or agents may reasonably request; (B) that are in the possession, custody or
control of the Company; and (C) the disclosure of which would not (x) violate any Law or Judgment or any confidentiality obligation of the Company if, in the case of
confidentiality obligations to third parties, the Company shall have used commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the consent of such party or (y) result in a waiver of
attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or similar privilege. Parent, Merger Sub and their respective officers, employees and agents will hold any such
information that is non-public in confidence in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement.

        (b)   The provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement dated June 14, 2016 between Parent and the Company (the "Confidentiality Agreement") shall remain in full
force and effect in accordance with its terms until the Effective Time, at which time the Confidentiality Agreement shall automatically terminate without further action,

that would reasonably be expected to lead to a Takeover Proposal; (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations with any Person with respect to any Takeover
Proposal or any inquiry, indication of interest or proposal that would reasonably be expected to lead to a Takeover Proposal; (iii) approve, endorse or recommend any
Takeover Proposal; (iv) enter into any letter of intent or similar document or any Contract contemplating or otherwise relating to any Takeover Proposal (other than an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement), or any Contract requiring the Company to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the Transactions; (v) submit any Takeover
Proposal to a vote of the shareholders of the Company; or (vi) resolve, agree or publicly propose to do any of the foregoing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing
contained in this Section 5.7(a) or elsewhere in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the Company's Board from stating and disclosing to the Company's
shareholders a position with respect to a tender or exchange offer by a third party pursuant to Rules 14a-9, 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A
promulgated under the Exchange Act; provided, however, that in no event shall the foregoing affect the obligations of the Company specified in Section 5.7(d)(i) (it being
understood that any "stop, look and listen" communication by or on behalf of the Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) shall not be considered a Company Adverse Change
Recommendation) or Article 7.

        (b)   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 5.7(a) or elsewhere in this Agreement, prior to the time, but not after, the Required Company Shareholder
Vote is obtained, following receipt by the Company from a third party of an unsolicited bona fide written Takeover Proposal made after the date hereof that has not been
withdrawn and that did not (nor did any precursor thereto) result from a breach of Section 5.7(a) by the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or its or their Representatives (as
if they were bound hereby), the Company and its Representatives shall be permitted to participate in discussions regarding such Takeover Proposal solely to clarify the
terms of such Takeover Proposal. In addition, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 5.7(a) or elsewhere in this Agreement, prior to the time, but not
after, the Required Company Shareholder Vote is obtained, the Company and its Representatives may enter into and participate in discussions or negotiations with such
third party and its Representatives in response to an unsolicited bona fide written Takeover Proposal made after the date hereof that has not been withdrawn and that did
not result (nor did any precursor thereto) from a breach of Section 5.7(a) by the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or its or their Representatives (as if they were bound
hereby), and may furnish access and nonpublic information to such third party if (A) the Company Board has determined in good faith, after consultation with outside
legal counsel and the Company Financial Advisor, that such Takeover Proposal is reasonably likely to constitute a Superior Proposal and failure to take such action would
be inconsistent with the Company Board's fiduciary duties under applicable Law; and (B) any nonpublic information furnished to such third party is (1) subject to an
executed confidentiality agreement in a customary form that is no less favorable to the Company with respect to confidentiality than the Confidentiality Agreement and
that does not contain any provision that would prevent the Company from complying with its obligation to provide disclosure to Parent required pursuant to this
Section 5.7 ("Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement") and (2) furnished to Parent substantially concurrently with (but not more than 24 hours after) such nonpublic
information is furnished to such Person (to the extent such nonpublic information has not been previously furnished or made available by the Company to Parent). During

expressly reaffirming the Board Actions within ten Business Days after Parent requests a reaffirmation of the Board Actions (or if the Company Shareholders Meeting is
to occur prior to the tenth Business Day, such period ending on the later of (x) the Business Day prior to the Company Shareholders Meeting and (y) the second Business
Day after such request); or (E) following the public announcement of a Takeover Proposal (or the public announcement of an intention to make a Takeover Proposal)
other than the commencement of a tender or exchange offer contemplated by clause (D), fail to issue a press release expressly reaffirming the Board Actions within ten
Business Days after Parent requests a reaffirmation thereof (or if the Company Shareholders Meeting is to occur prior to the tenth Business Day, such period ending on

after, the Required Company Shareholder Vote is obtained (x) may make a Company Adverse Change Recommendation and/or (y) in the case of a Superior
Proposal, may terminate this Agreement in accordance with Section 7.1(d) in order to enter into a definitive agreement providing for the implementation of such
Superior Proposal, in each case if at any time prior to the time, but not after, the Required Company Shareholder Vote is obtained the Company Board has
determined in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel and the Company Financial Advisor, that the failure to make such Company Adverse
Change Recommendation and/or the failure to terminate this Agreement would be inconsistent with the Company Board's fiduciary duties under applicable Law;
provided, however, that the Company shall not terminate this Agreement pursuant to the foregoing clause (y), and any purported termination pursuant to the
foregoing clause (y) shall be void and of no force or effect, unless concurrently with such termination the Company pays the Termination Fee and otherwise
complies with the provisions of Section 7.1 and Section 7.3; and provided, further, that (1) in the case of a Superior Proposal, the Company Board may not effect a
Company Adverse Change Recommendation pursuant to the foregoing clause (x) or terminate this Agreement pursuant to the foregoing clause (y) unless such
Takeover Proposal (and any precursor thereto) did not result from or arise in connection with a breach by the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of their
Representatives (as if they were bound hereby) of its obligations under Section 5.7(a), (2) the Company shall have provided prior written notice to Parent, at least
four Business Days in advance, of its intention to take such action, which notice shall include, as applicable, (a) the terms and conditions of such Superior
Proposal and attaching a copy of the most current draft of any written agreement relating to such Superior Proposal (it being understood and agreed that any
amendment to any material term or condition of such Superior Proposal shall require a new written notice to Parent and an additional two Business Day notice
period) or (b) the facts and circumstances in reasonable detail of the Intervening Event, (3) the Company shall have given Parent four or two, as applicable,
Business Days after Parent's receipt of the written notice of such Superior Proposal or Intervening Event to propose revisions to the terms of this Agreement or
make another proposal and shall have negotiated in good faith with Parent with respect to such proposed revisions or other proposal, if any, and (4) after
considering the results of such negotiations and giving effect to such proposed revisions or other proposal, if any, the Company Board shall have determined in
good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel and the Company Financial Advisor, that, as applicable, (a) such Superior Proposal continues to meet the
definition of "Superior Proposal" or (b) the Intervening Event continues to warrant a Company Adverse Change Recommendation and, after consultation with
outside legal counsel, that the failure to make such Company Adverse Change Recommendation and/or the failure to terminate this Agreement would be
inconsistent with the Company Board's fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

respect to (x) all acts or omissions by them in their capacities as such at any time at or prior to the Effective Time or (y) any costs or expenses (including attorneys' fees),
judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities, and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative, to the extent such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation arises out of or pertains to the Merger, this Agreement, and any
Transactions, in their capacities as such, in either case, to the fullest extent permitted by the Company Charter Documents, any other indemnification agreements in effect
on the date of this Agreement and set forth in Exhibits to the Company SEC Reports or on Section 5.8(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter, or applicable law. In the

advance all expenses as incurred by such director or officer in the defense of such Action upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such director or officer to
repay such amount if it is ultimately determined that such director or officer is not entitled to be indemnified; and (C) no person seeking to be indemnified will be liable
for any settlement of such Action effected without his or her consent, provided that the foregoing clauses (A), (B), and (C) shall not be deemed to limit or impose
additional conditions on the rights of any Indemnified Party under the Existing Indemnification Rights. The articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation shall contain, and Parent shall cause the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation to so contain, provisions no less favorable with
respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of each Indemnified Party than are set forth in the Company Charter Documents as in effect on the
date of this Agreement.

covered by the D&O Insurance as of the Effective Time, or (ii) obtain, in consultation with the Company, a prepaid (or "tail") directors' and officers' liability insurance
policy covering acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time for a period of six years after the Effective Time, with respect to those Persons who are
covered by the D&O Insurance as of the Effective Time on terms with respect to such coverage and amounts no less favorable to such indemnified Persons than those of
the D&O Insurance; provided, that (A) Parent may substitute one or more policies of a reputable and financially sound insurance company for the D&O Insurance, so
long as such substitute policies have at least the same coverage and amounts and contain terms and conditions which are no less advantageous to the Persons currently
covered by the D&O Insurance; (B) Parent shall not be required to pay any annual premium for the D&O Insurance or any substitutes with respect thereto in excess of
300% of the amount (the "Maximum Amount") paid by the Company for coverage for the period of twelve months most recently commenced prior to the date of this
Agreement; and (C) if the premium for the D&O Insurance or any substitutes therefor exceeds such amount, Parent shall purchase a substitute policy with the greatest
coverage available for 300% of the Maximum Amount. Parent shall provide a copy of such D&O Insurance to each director and officer of the Company.

        (c)   If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or Surviving Corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger; or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and
in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the
obligations set forth in this Section 5.8.

        (b)   The Company shall pay Parent a termination fee of $7.5 million (the "Termination Fee"), in the event that this Agreement is terminated:

          (i)  by Parent pursuant to Section 7.1(c);

         (ii)  by the Company pursuant to Section 7.1(d); or

        (iii)  by either Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 7.1(b)(i), Section 7.1(b)(iii) or Section 7.1(e), so long as, (A) before the date of such termination, a
Takeover Proposal shall have been made or publicly announced or otherwise become publicly known, or any Person shall have publicly announced (and not
publicly withdrawn without qualification at least ten days prior to the date of termination or, in the case of a termination pursuant to Section 7.1(b)(iii), at least ten
days prior to the Company Shareholder Meeting (and, if applicable, any adjournment or postponement thereof)) an intention to make a Takeover Proposal; and
(B) within twelve months after the date of termination, the Company shall have entered into a definitive agreement for a Takeover Proposal that is subsequently
consummated or a Takeover Proposal is consummated; provided, however, that, for purposes of this Section 7.3(b)(iii), all references to "20%" in the definition of
"Takeover Proposal" shall be deemed to be references to "50%"; and (C) in the case of any termination pursuant to Section 7.1(e), the circumstances underlying
such termination right first arose after the date of such Takeover Proposal or announcement of such intention or the making of any inquiry or expression of
potential interest to the Company Board or any officer or director of the Company with respect to any Takeover Proposal.

        (c)   Any fee due under Section 7.3(b)(i) shall be paid to Parent by wire transfer of same-day funds within three Business Days after the date of termination of this
Agreement. Any fee under Section 7.3(b)(ii) shall be paid to Parent by wire transfer of same-day funds concurrently with the termination. Any fee due under
Section 7.3(b)(iii) shall be paid to Parent by wire transfer of same-day funds within three Business Days after the date on which the last applicable event referenced
therein occurs. The parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this Section 7.3 are an integral part of the Transactions and that, without these agreements, the
parties would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails to promptly pay any amount due pursuant to this Section 7.3, and, in order to obtain such
payment, Parent or Merger Sub commences a suit that results in a judgment against the Company for any amount due pursuant to this Section 7.3, then the Company shall
pay Parent and Merger Sub its costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) in connection with such suit, together with interest on the amount
due pursuant to this Section 7.3 from the date such payment was required to be made until the date of payment at the prime lending rate as published in The Wall Street
Journal in effect on the date such payment was required to be made.

        (d)   No more than one Termination Fee may be payable under this Article 7. Parent (for itself and its affiliates) hereby agrees that, upon any termination of this
Agreement under circumstances in which Parent is entitled to the Termination Fee under Section 7.1(b), Parent and its Affiliates are precluded from any other remedy
against the Company, at law or in equity or otherwise, and neither Parent nor any of its affiliates may seek (and Parent will cause its Affiliates not to seek) to obtain any
recovery, Judgment, or damages of any kind, including consequential, indirect, or punitive damages, against the Company, its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, or any of their
respective Representatives, partners, managers, members, or shareholders in connection with this Agreement or the Transactions; provided that nothing herein shall
relieve any party from liability for any fraud or willful breach of this Agreement. "Willful breach" means a breach that is a consequence of an act deliberately taken by the
breaching party, or the deliberate failure by the breaching party to take an act it is required to take under this Agreement, in each case with actual knowledge that

the taking of, or the failure to take, such act would, or would be reasonably expected to, cause a material breach of this Agreement.

        Section 7.4    Amendment.     This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors, at any time before
or after adoption of this Agreement and the Transactions by the respective Boards of Directors or shareholders of the parties hereto; provided, however, that after any adoption of
the Plan of Merger by the holders of Shares, no amendment that requires further shareholder approval under applicable Law after shareholder approval hereof shall be made
without such required further approval. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto.

        Section 7.5    Waiver.     At any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties hereto may, to the extent legally allowed, (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or other acts of the other parties hereto; (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant
hereto; and (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be
valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such party. Such extension or waiver shall not apply to any time for performance, inaccuracy in any
representation or warranty, or noncompliance with any agreement or condition, as the case may be, other than that which is specified in the extension or waiver. The failure of
any party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such rights.

any pronouns used in this Agreement shall include the corresponding masculine, feminine or neuter forms, and the singular form of nouns and pronouns shall include the plural,
and vice versa. Any reference to any Law shall be deemed to refer to such Law as from time to time amended and also to all rules and regulations promulgated thereunder and

negotiation, drafting, preparation and execution of this Agreement and, therefore, waive the application of any Law or rule of construction providing that ambiguities in an
agreement or other document will be construed against the party drafting such agreement or document.

        Section 8.4    Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial.     

        (a)   This Agreement, and any dispute arising out of, relating to, or in connection with this Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
Laws of the State of Minnesota without giving effect to any choice or conflict of Law provision or rule that would cause the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction
other than the State of Minnesota.

        (b)   The parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement in any state or federal court located in Hennepin County, Minnesota, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.
In addition, each of the parties hereto (i) consents to submit itself to the personal jurisdiction of any such court with respect to any dispute arising out of, relating to or in
connection with this Agreement or any Transaction, including the Merger; (ii) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or
other request for leave from any such court; and (iii) agrees that it will not bring any action arising out of, relating to or in connection with this Agreement or any
Transaction, including the Merger, in any court other than any such court. The parties irrevocably and unconditionally waive any objection to the laying of venue of any
action, suit or proceeding arising out of this Agreement or the Transactions in any state or federal court located in Hennepin County, Minnesota, and hereby further
irrevocably and unconditionally waive and agree not to plead or claim in any such court that any such action, suit or proceeding brought in any such court has been
brought in an inconvenient forum. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub hereby agrees that service of any process, summons, notice or document by U.S.
registered mail to the respective addresses set forth in Section 8.1 shall be effective service of process for any proceeding arising out of, relating to or in connection with
this Agreement or the Transactions, including the Merger.

        (c)   Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law any right it may have to a trial by jury with respect to any
Action or liability directly or indirectly arising out of, under or in connection with this Agreement or the Transactions. Each of the parties hereto hereby (i) certifies that
no Representative of any other party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other party would not, in the event of any such action or liability, seek to enforce
the foregoing waiver; and (ii) acknowledges that it has been induced to enter into this agreement and the transactions, as applicable, by, among other things, the mutual
waivers and certifications in this Section 8.4(c).

        Section 8.5    Counterparts; Facsimile Transmission of Signatures.     This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts and by different parties hereto in

        Section 8.6    Assignment; No Third-Party Beneficiaries.     This Agreement and all of the provisions hereto shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of, and be
enforceable by, the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns, but neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations set forth herein
shall be assigned by any party hereto without the prior written consent of the other parties hereto and any purported assignment without such consent shall be void, except that
Parent may assign all or any of its rights and obligations hereunder to any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent without the Company's prior consent; provided,
however, that no assignment shall release Parent of its obligations hereunder. This Agreement is not intended to, and will not, confer upon any Person other than the parties
hereto any rights or remedies hereunder, except (a) as set forth in or contemplated by the terms and provisions of Section 5.8; (b) unless and until the Effective Time shall have
occurred, for the right of holders of Shares (including Restricted Stock), holders of Options, holders of Restricted Stock Units, and holders of Performance Stock Units, as
applicable, to pursue claims for damages and other relief, including equitable relief, for any breach of this Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub (including based on loss of the
economic benefits of the Transactions to the holders of Company Securities based on the consideration that would have otherwise been payable to such holders, the loss of
market value or decline in the stock price of Company Common Stock or otherwise); and (c) from and after the Effective Time, the rights of holders of Shares (including
Restricted Stock), holders of Options, holders of Restricted Stock Units, and holders of Performance Stock Units, as applicable, to receive the consideration set forth in Article 1;
provided, however, that the rights granted pursuant to clause (b) of this Section 8.6 will only be enforceable on behalf of holders of Company Common Stock (including
Restricted Stock), holders of Options, holders of Restricted Stock Units and holders of Performance Stock Units, as applicable, by the Company in its sole and absolute
discretion, it being understood and agreed that any and all interests in such claims will attach to such Shares and subsequently transfer therewith and, consequently, any damages,
settlements, or other amounts recovered or received by the Company with respect to such claims (net of expenses incurred by the Company in connection therewith) may, in the
Company's sole and absolute discretion, be (i) distributed, in whole or in part, by the Company to the holders of Shares of record as of any date determined by the Company; or
(ii) retained by the Company for the use and benefit of the Company on behalf of its shareholders in any manner the Company deems fit.

        Section 8.7    Severability.     If any provision of this Agreement shall be held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable under any applicable Law, then such contravention or
invalidity shall not invalidate the entire Agreement. Such provision shall be deemed to be modified to the extent necessary to render it legal, valid and enforceable, and if no such
modification shall render it legal, valid and enforceable, then this Agreement shall be construed as if not containing the provision held to be invalid, and the rights and obligations
of the parties shall be construed and enforced accordingly.

        Section 8.8    Entire Agreement.     This Agreement (including the Company Disclosure Letter and Exhibits hereto and the documents and instruments referred to herein that
are to be delivered at Closing) and the Confidentiality Agreement contain all of the terms of the understandings of the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and
supersede any prior understandings, agreements or representations by or among the parties hereto, or any of them, written or oral, with respect to the subject matter hereof, and
the parties hereto specifically disclaim reliance on any such prior understandings, agreements or representations to the extent not embodied in this Agreement.

        Section 8.9    Enforcement; Specific Performance.     Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed
cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy will not preclude the
exercise of any other remedy. The parties agree that irreparable

accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of
this Agreement without posting a bond or undertaking, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.

        Section 8.10    Disclosure Letter.     The inclusion of any information in the Company Disclosure Letter shall not be deemed to be an admission or acknowledgment, in and
of itself, that such information is required by the terms hereof to be disclosed, is material, has resulted in a Company Material Adverse Effect or is outside the Ordinary Course of
Business.

        Section 8.11    Non-Recourse.     Any claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of, or related to this Agreement may only be brought against Persons that are expressly
named as parties hereto, and then only with respect to the specific obligations set forth herein. No former, current or future direct or indirect equity holders, controlling Persons,
shareholders, Representatives, affiliates, members, managers, general or limited partners or assignees of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective affiliates
shall have any liability or obligation for any of the representations, warranties, covenants, agreements, obligations or liabilities of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub under this
Agreement or of or for any action, suit, arbitration, claim, litigation, investigation, or proceeding based on, in respect of, or by reason of, the Transactions (including the breach,
termination or failure to consummate such Transactions), in each case whether based on Contract, tort, strict liability, other Laws or otherwise and whether by piercing the
corporate veil, by a claim by or on behalf of a party hereto or another Person or otherwise.

Any such vote shall be cast (or consent shall be given) by such Shareholder in accordance with such procedures relating thereto as will ensure that he or she is duly
counted, including for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present. Neither this Section 2.1(b) nor anything else in this Agreement shall require such

        (b)   All fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions shall be paid by the party incurring such fees and expenses, whether or
not the Merger is consummated.

        5.9.    Enforcement; Specific Performance.     Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative
with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of
any other remedy. The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement without posting a bond or undertaking, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law
or in equity.

        5.10.    Severability.     If any provision of this Agreement shall be held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable under any applicable Law, then such contravention or
invalidity shall not invalidate the entire Agreement. Such provision shall be deemed to be modified to the extent necessary to render it legal, valid and enforceable, and if no such
modification shall render it legal, valid and enforceable, then this Agreement shall be construed as if not containing the provision held to be invalid, and the rights and obligations
of the parties shall be construed and enforced accordingly.

        5.11.    Assignment.    Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder may be assigned by any of the parties hereto, in whole or in part
(whether by operation of law or otherwise), without the prior written consent of the other parties hereto. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon,
inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns. Any purported assignment in violation of the provisions of this
Agreement shall be null and void ab initio.

        5.12.    Shareholder Capacity.     Each Shareholder is entering into this Agreement solely in his or her capacity as the Beneficial Owner of Shares, and not such Shareholder's
capacity as a director or, if applicable, officer of the Company or any of its subsidiaries. Accordingly, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
nothing herein shall in any way (a) restrict or limit such Shareholder from taking (or omitting to take) any action in his or her capacity as a director or officer of the Company
taken in order to fulfill his or her fiduciary obligations under applicable Law or (b) restrict or limit (or require such Shareholder to attempt to restrict or limit) such Shareholder
from acting in such capacity or voting in such capacity in the good faith exercise of his or her fiduciary duties under applicable Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties
hereto acknowledge that the directors and officers of the Company are restricted in the manner set forth in the Merger Agreement.

W I T N E S S E T H: 

        WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Parent, Reef Acquisition Co., a Minnesota corporation and a wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent ("Merger

Agreement, at the Company Shareholders Meeting and at any other meeting of the holders of Shares, however called, including any adjournment or postponement thereof, and in

other Transactions; (C) against any extraordinary corporate transaction (other than the Merger), such as a merger, consolidation, business combination, tender or exchange

to, impede, interfere with, delay, postpone, discourage, or adversely affect the consummation of the Merger and the other Transactions;

provided, that the foregoing covenants shall apply solely with respect to actions taken with respect to the Covered Shares.

Any such vote shall be cast (or consent shall be given) by such Shareholder in accordance with such procedures relating thereto as will ensure that he or she is duly
counted, including for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present. Neither this Section 2.1(b) nor anything else in this Agreement shall require such
Shareholder to exercise any warrants or options (if any) to acquire Shares or other capital stock of the Company. Such Shareholder shall provide Parent with at least five
Business Days' prior written notice prior to signing any action proposed to be taken by written consent with respect to any Covered Shares. The obligations of such
Shareholder under this Agreement, including this Article II, shall apply whether or not a Company Adverse Change Recommendation has occurred.

        (c)   Solely in the event of a failure by such Shareholder to act in accordance with such Shareholder's obligations as to voting pursuant to Sections 2.1(a) and 2.1(b),
such Shareholder hereby irrevocably grants to and appoints Parent (and any designee thereof) as such Shareholder's proxy and attorney-in-fact (with full power of
substitution), for and in the name, place and stead of such Shareholder, to represent, vote and otherwise act (by voting at any meeting of shareholders of the company or
otherwise) with respect to such Shareholder's Covered Shares solely as and to the extent set forth in this Section 2.1 until the termination of this Agreement in accordance
with Section 5.1, to the same extent and with the same effect as such Shareholder might or could do under applicable law, rules and regulations. The proxy granted
pursuant to this Section 2.1(c) is coupled with an interest and shall be irrevocable. Such Shareholder will take such further action and will execute such other instruments
as may be necessary to effectuate the grant of this proxy. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this proxy shall terminate upon termination of this agreement in accordance with
Section 5.1.

        2.2.    Cap.     For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the aggregate amount of Covered Shares subject to this Agreement exceed 19.9% of the issued and outstanding
Shares (as such percentage is calculated pursuant to Section 302A.011, Subd. 41 of the MBCA), and this Section 2.2 shall be deemed to release from the obligations under this
Agreement such number of Covered Shares as may be necessary to cause such aggregate amount to not exceed such percentage.

        2.3.    No Inconsistent Agreements.     Other than this Agreement, each Shareholder confirms and agrees, severally and not jointly, that such Shareholder (a) has not entered
into, and shall not enter into at any time while this Agreement is in effect, any voting arrangement, whether by proxy, consent, power of attorney, voting agreement, voting trust
or otherwise, with respect to the Covered Shares, (b) has not granted, and shall not grant at any time while this Agreement is in effect, a proxy, consent or power of attorney with
respect to the Covered Shares and (c) has not taken and shall not take any action that would have the effect of making any representation and warranty of such Shareholder
contained herein untrue or incorrect or preventing or disabling such Shareholder from performing any of his or her obligations under this Agreement.

ARTICLE III 

Representations and Warranties 

        3.1.    Representations and Warranties of the Shareholders.     Each Shareholder hereby represents and warrants, severally and not jointly, to Parent as follows:

Beneficially Owned by such Shareholder as of the date hereof.

        (c)    No Violation.    The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by such Shareholder do not and will not (whether with or without notice or lapse of
time, or both) (i) breach, violate, result in the loss of any benefit under, constitute a default under, result in the termination of or a right of termination or cancellation
under, or result in the creation, acceleration or change of any rights or obligations of any party or the creation of any lien upon any of the Covered Shares under, any

Shareholder to obtain any consent, approval, authorization or permit of, or to make any filing or registration with or declaration or notification to, any Governmental
Authority, except where the failure to obtain such consents, approvals, authorizations or permits, or to make such filings, registrations, declarations or notifications, would
not, individually or in the aggregate, materially impair the ability of such Shareholder to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

        (e)    Absence of Litigation.    As of the date hereof, there is no legal proceeding or Judgment in effect, pending or, to such Shareholder's knowledge, threatened

Covered Securities, Beneficial Ownership thereof or any other interest specifically therein (including by tendering into any tender or exchange offer by any Person other than

the Covered Securities by such Shareholder (A) upon the death of such Shareholder, (B) to any member of such Shareholder's immediate family, (C) as a result of the forfeiture to
the Company or cancellation of any equity award pursuant to the terms thereof, or (D) the sale of Shares issued pursuant to an equity award upon vesting, settlement or exercise

form and substance to Parent, to be bound by the terms of this Agreement. Any purported Transfer of the Covered Securities in violation of this Section 4.1 shall be null and void
ab initio. Promptly following the date hereof, (i) each Shareholder and Parent shall deliver joint written instructions to the Company and the Company's transfer agent stating that

        4.2.    No Solicitation.     Each Shareholder, solely in such Shareholder's capacity as a shareholder of the Company, agrees not to, directly or indirectly, take any action that
would violate Section 5.7 of the Merger Agreement if such Shareholder were deemed a "Representative" of the Company for purposes of such Section 5.7 of the Merger
Agreement; provided, the foregoing shall not serve to limit or restrict any actions taken by a Shareholder in any capacity other than as shareholder of the Company or to the
extent such actions are permitted or required under such Section 5.7 of the Merger Agreement.

relating to the Merger and the other Transactions that such Shareholder may have by virtue of any Covered Shares owned by such Shareholder, including, under
Section 302A.471 or 302A.473 of the MBCA. Each Shareholder agrees that he or she will not in his or her capacity as a Shareholder of the Company bring, commence, institute,
maintain, prosecute, join in or voluntarily aid, and shall take all actions necessary to opt out of any class in any class action with respect to, any legal proceeding, which
(a) challenges the validity of or seeks to enjoin the operation of any provision of this Agreement or the Merger Agreement, (b) alleges that the execution and delivery of this
Agreement by such Shareholder, either alone or together with the other agreements to be delivered in connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement, or the approval of
the Merger Agreement by the Company Board, breaches any fiduciary duty of the Company Board or any member thereof, or (c) makes any other claim against Parent, Merger
Sub or their respective Representatives with respect to the negotiation, execution or delivery of this Agreement or the Merger Agreement or the consummation of the Merger;
provided, that the foregoing covenants shall not be deemed a consent to or waiver of any rights of the Shareholder for any breach of this Agreement or the Merger Agreement by
Parent or its Affiliates.

assignments, endorsements, proxies, consents and other instruments and take all such further reasonable action as may be necessary to effectuate the intent of this Agreement.

        4.6.    Company Agreement.     The Company hereby acknowledges the restrictions on Transfers of Covered Securities contained in Section 4.1. The Company agrees (i) not
to register the Transfer of any certificated or uncertificated interest representing any Covered Securities without the prior written consent of Parent and (ii) to take all such other
actions reasonably necessary in furtherance of such Shareholder's commitments hereunder, including (to the extent reasonably within the Company's power) prohibiting or
refusing to give effect to any action in violation hereof.

effective execution and delivery of this Agreement by such party. Irrespective of negotiations among the parties or the exchanging of drafts of this Agreement, this Agreement
shall not constitute, or be deemed to evidence, a contract, agreement, arrangement or understanding between the parties hereto, unless (i) the Merger Agreement is executed and
delivered by all parties thereto and (ii) this Agreement is executed and delivered by all parties hereto.

        5.6.    Entire Agreement.     This Agreement (including the Schedule hereto and the documents and instruments referred to herein) contains all of the terms of the
understandings of the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes any prior understandings, agreements or representations by or among the parties
hereto, or any of them, written or oral, with respect to the subject matter hereof, and the parties hereto specifically disclaim reliance on any such prior understandings, agreements
or representations to the extent not embodied in this Agreement.

        5.7.  Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction; Waivers.

        (a)   This Agreement, and any dispute arising out of, relating to, or in connection with this Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
Laws of the State of Minnesota without giving effect to any choice or conflict of Law provision or rule that would cause the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction
other than the State of Minnesota.

        (b)   The parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement in any state or federal court located in Hennepin County, Minnesota, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.
In addition, each of the parties hereto (i) consents to submit itself to the personal jurisdiction of any such court with respect to any dispute arising out of, relating to or in
connection with this Agreement; (ii) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such court;
and (iii) agrees that it will not bring any action arising out of, relating to or in connection with this Agreement, in any court other than any such court. The parties
irrevocably and unconditionally waive any objection to the laying of venue of any action, suit or proceeding arising out of this Agreement in any state or federal court
located in Hennepin County, Minnesota, and hereby further irrevocably and unconditionally waive and agree not to plead or claim in any such court that any such action,
suit or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Each of the Company, Parent and each Shareholder hereby agrees that service of
any process, summons, notice or document by U.S. registered mail to the respective addresses set forth in Section 5.3 shall be effective service of process for any
proceeding arising out of, relating to or in connection with this Agreement.

        (c)   Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law any right it may have to a trial by jury with respect to any
Action or liability directly or indirectly arising out of, under or in connection with this Agreement. Each of the parties hereto hereby (i) certifies that no Representative of
any other party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other party would not, in the event of any such action or liability, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver;
and (ii) acknowledges that it has been induced to enter into this agreement and the transactions, as applicable, by, among other things, the mutual waivers and
certifications in this Section 5.7(c).

        5.8.    Amendment; Waiver; Expenses.     

        (a)   This Agreement may not be amended, except by an instrument in writing signed by each of the parties hereto. Each party hereto may waive any right of such

        (b)   All fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions shall be paid by the party incurring such fees and expenses, whether or
not the Merger is consummated.

        5.9.    Enforcement; Specific Performance.     Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative
with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of
any other remedy. The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement without posting a bond or undertaking, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law
or in equity.

        5.10.    Severability.     If any provision of this Agreement shall be held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable under any applicable Law, then such contravention or
invalidity shall not invalidate the entire Agreement. Such provision shall be deemed to be modified to the extent necessary to render it legal, valid and enforceable, and if no such
modification shall render it legal, valid and enforceable, then this Agreement shall be construed as if not containing the provision held to be invalid, and the rights and obligations
of the parties shall be construed and enforced accordingly.

        5.11.    Assignment.    Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder may be assigned by any of the parties hereto, in whole or in part
(whether by operation of law or otherwise), without the prior written consent of the other parties hereto. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon,
inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns. Any purported assignment in violation of the provisions of this
Agreement shall be null and void ab initio.

        5.12.    Shareholder Capacity.     Each Shareholder is entering into this Agreement solely in his or her capacity as the Beneficial Owner of Shares, and not such Shareholder's
capacity as a director or, if applicable, officer of the Company or any of its subsidiaries. Accordingly, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
nothing herein shall in any way (a) restrict or limit such Shareholder from taking (or omitting to take) any action in his or her capacity as a director or officer of the Company
taken in order to fulfill his or her fiduciary obligations under applicable Law or (b) restrict or limit (or require such Shareholder to attempt to restrict or limit) such Shareholder
from acting in such capacity or voting in such capacity in the good faith exercise of his or her fiduciary duties under applicable Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties
hereto acknowledge that the directors and officers of the Company are restricted in the manner set forth in the Merger Agreement.

Annex C 

DISSENTERS' RIGHTS UNDER THE MINNESOTA BUSINESS CORPORATION ACT 

302A.471. RIGHTS OF DISSENTING SHAREHOLDERS 

        Subdivision 1. Actions creating rights. A shareholder of a corporation may dissent from, and obtain payment for the fair value of the shareholder's shares in the event of, any
of the following corporate actions:

        (a)   unless otherwise provided in the articles, an amendment of the articles that materially and adversely affects the rights or preferences of the shares of the
dissenting shareholder in that it:

        (1)   alters or abolishes a preferential right of the shares;

        (2)   creates, alters, or abolishes a right in respect of the redemption of the shares, including a provision respecting a sinking fund for the redemption or
repurchase of the shares;

        (3)   alters or abolishes a preemptive right of the holder of the shares to acquire shares, securities other than shares, or rights to purchase shares or securities
other than shares;

        (4)   excludes or limits the right of a shareholder to vote on a matter, or to cumulate votes, except as the right may be excluded or limited through the
authorization or issuance of securities of an existing or new class or series with similar or different voting rights; except that an amendment to the articles of an
issuing public corporation that provides that section 302A.671 does not apply to a control share acquisition does not give rise to the right to obtain payment under
this section; or

        (5)   eliminates the right to obtain payment under this subdivision;

        (b)   a sale, lease, transfer, or other disposition of property and assets of the corporation that requires shareholder approval under section 302A.661, subdivision 2, but
not including a disposition in dissolution described in section 302A.725, subdivision 2, or a disposition pursuant to an order of a court, or a disposition for cash on terms
requiring that all or substantially all of the net proceeds of disposition be distributed to the shareholders in accordance with their respective interests within one year after
the date of disposition;

        (c)   a plan of merger, whether under this chapter or under chapter 322B or 322C, to which the corporation is a constituent organization, except as provided in
subdivision 3, and except for a plan of merger adopted under section 302A.626;

        (d)   a plan of exchange, whether under this chapter or under chapter 322B or 322C, to which the corporation is a party as the corporation whose shares will be
acquired by the acquiring organization, except as provided in subdivision 3;

        (e)   a plan of conversion is adopted by the corporation and becomes effective;

        (f)    an amendment of the articles in connection with a combination of a class or series under section 302A.402 that reduces the number of shares of the class or
series owned by the shareholder to a fraction of a share if the corporation exercises its right to repurchase the fractional share so created under section 302A.423; or

        (g)   any other corporate action taken pursuant to a shareholder vote with respect to which the articles, the bylaws, or a resolution approved by the board directs that
dissenting shareholders may obtain payment for their shares.

        Subd. 2. Beneficial owners. (a) A shareholder shall not assert dissenters' rights as to less than all of the shares registered in the name of the shareholder, unless the
shareholder dissents with respect to all the shares that are beneficially owned by another person but registered in the name of the

shareholder and discloses the name and address of each beneficial owner on whose behalf the shareholder dissents. In that event, the rights of the dissenter shall be determined as
if the shares as to which the shareholder has dissented and the other shares were registered in the names of different shareholders.

        (b)   A beneficial owner of shares who is not the shareholder may assert dissenters' rights with respect to shares held on behalf of the beneficial owner, and shall be
treated as a dissenting shareholder under the terms of this section and section 302A.473, if the beneficial owner submits to the corporation at the time of or before the
assertion of the rights a written consent of the shareholder.

        Subd. 3. Rights not to apply. (a) Unless the articles, the bylaws, or a resolution approved by the board otherwise provide, the right to obtain payment under this section does
not apply to a shareholder of (1) the surviving corporation in a merger with respect to shares of the shareholder that are not entitled to be voted on the merger and are not canceled
or exchanged in the merger or (2) the corporation whose shares will be acquired by the acquiring organization in a plan of exchange with respect to shares of the shareholder that
are not entitled to be voted on the plan of exchange and are not exchanged in the plan of exchange.

        (b)   If a date is fixed according to section 302A.445, subdivision 1, for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive notice of and to vote on an action
described in subdivision 1, only shareholders as of the date fixed, and beneficial owners as of the date fixed who hold through shareholders, as provided in subdivision 2,
may exercise dissenters' rights.

        (c)   Notwithstanding subdivision 1, the right to obtain payment under this section, other than in connection with a plan of merger adopted under section 302A.621, is
limited in accordance with the following provisions:

        (1)   The right to obtain payment under this section is not available for the holders of shares of any class or series of shares that is listed on the New York
Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange, the NASDAQ Global Market, or the NASDAQ Global Select Market.

        (2)   The applicability of clause (1) is determined as of:

          (i)  the record date fixed to determine the shareholders entitled to receive notice of, and to vote at, the meeting of shareholders to act upon the
corporate action described in subdivision 1; or

         (ii)  the day before the effective date of corporate action described in subdivision 1 if there is no meeting of shareholders.

        (3)   Clause (1) is not applicable, and the right to obtain payment under this section is available pursuant to subdivision 1, for the holders of any class or
series of shares who are required by the terms of the corporate action described in subdivision 1 to accept for such shares anything other than shares, or cash in
lieu of fractional shares, of any class or any series of shares of a domestic or foreign corporation, or any other ownership interest of any other organization, that
satisfies the standards set forth in clause (1) at the time the corporate action becomes effective.

        Subd. 4. Other rights. The shareholders of a corporation who have a right under this section to obtain payment for their shares, or who would have the right to obtain
payment for their shares absent the exception set forth in paragraph (c) of subdivision 3, do not have a right at law or in equity to have a corporate action described in subdivision
1 set aside or rescinded, except when the corporate action is fraudulent with regard to the complaining shareholder or the corporation.

meeting shall inform each shareholder of the right to dissent and shall include a copy of section 302A.471 and this section and a brief description of the procedure to be followed
under these sections.

        Subd. 3. Notice of dissent. If the proposed action must be approved by the shareholders and the corporation holds a shareholder meeting, a shareholder who is entitled to
dissent under section 302A.471 and who wishes to exercise dissenters' rights must file with the corporation before the vote on the proposed action a written notice of intent to
demand the fair value of the shares owned by the shareholder and must not vote the shares in favor of the proposed action.

        Subd. 4. Notice of procedure; deposit of shares. (a) After the proposed action has been approved by the board and, if necessary, the shareholders, the corporation shall send
to (i) all shareholders who have complied with subdivision 3, (ii) all shareholders who did not sign or consent to a written action that gave effect to the action creating the right to
obtain payment under section 302A.471, and (iii) all shareholders entitled to dissent if no shareholder vote was required, a notice that contains:

        (1)   the address to which a demand for payment and certificates of certificated shares must be sent in order to obtain payment and the date by which they must be
received;

        (2)   any restrictions on transfer of uncertificated shares that will apply after the demand for payment is received;

        (3)   a form to be used to certify the date on which the shareholder, or the beneficial owner on whose behalf the shareholder dissents, acquired the shares or an
interest in them and to demand payment; and

        (4)   a copy of section 302A.471 and this section and a brief description of the procedures to be followed under these sections.

        (b)   In order to receive the fair value of the shares, a dissenting shareholder must demand payment and deposit certificated shares or comply with any restrictions on
transfer of uncertificated shares within 30 days after the notice required by paragraph (a) was given, but the dissenter retains all other rights of a shareholder until the
proposed action takes effect.

        Subd. 5. Payment; return of shares. (a) After the corporate action takes effect, or after the corporation receives a valid demand for payment, whichever is later, the
corporation shall remit to each dissenting shareholder who has complied with subdivisions 3 and 4 the amount the corporation estimates to be the fair value of the shares, plus
interest, accompanied by:

        (2)   an estimate by the corporation of the fair value of the shares and a brief description of the method used to reach the estimate; and

        (3)   a copy of section 302A.471 and this section, and a brief description of the procedure to be followed in demanding supplemental payment.

        (b)   The corporation may withhold the remittance described in paragraph (a) from a person who was not a shareholder on the date the action dissented from was first
announced to the public or who is dissenting on behalf of a person who was not a beneficial owner on that date. If the dissenter has complied with subdivisions 3 and 4,
the corporation shall forward to the dissenter the materials described in paragraph (a), a statement of the reason for withholding the remittance, and an offer to pay to the
dissenter the amount listed in the materials if the dissenter agrees to accept that amount in full satisfaction. The dissenter may decline the offer and demand payment
under subdivision 6. Failure to do so entitles the dissenter only to the amount offered. If the dissenter makes demand, subdivisions 7 and 8 apply.

        (c)   If the corporation fails to remit payment within 60 days of the deposit of certificates or the imposition of transfer restrictions on uncertificated shares, it shall
return all deposited certificates and cancel all transfer restrictions. However, the corporation may again give notice under subdivision 4 and require deposit or restrict
transfer at a later time.

        Subd. 6. Supplemental payment; demand. If a dissenter believes that the amount remitted under subdivision 5 is less than the fair value of the shares plus interest, the
dissenter may give written notice to the corporation of the dissenter's own estimate of the fair value of the shares, plus interest, within 30 days after the corporation mails the
remittance under subdivision 5, and demand payment of the difference. Otherwise, a dissenter is entitled only to the amount remitted by the corporation.

        Subd. 7. Petition; determination. If the corporation receives a demand under subdivision 6, it shall, within 60 days after receiving the demand, either pay to the dissenter the
amount demanded or agreed to by the dissenter after discussion with the corporation or file in court a petition requesting that the court determine the fair value of the shares, plus
interest. The petition shall be filed in the county in which the registered office of the corporation is located, except that a surviving foreign corporation that receives a demand
relating to the shares of a constituent domestic corporation shall file the petition in the county in this state in which the last registered office of the constituent corporation was
located. The petition shall name as parties all dissenters who have demanded payment under subdivision 6 and who have not reached agreement with the corporation. The
corporation shall, after filing the petition, serve all parties with a summons and copy of the petition under the Rules of Civil Procedure. Nonresidents of this state may be served
by registered or certified mail or by publication as provided by law. Except as otherwise provided, the Rules of Civil Procedure apply to this proceeding. The jurisdiction of the
court is plenary and exclusive. The court may appoint appraisers, with powers and authorities the court deems proper, to receive evidence on and recommend the amount of the
fair value of the shares. The court shall determine whether the shareholder or shareholders in question have fully complied with the requirements of this section, and shall
determine the fair value of the shares, taking into account any and all factors the court finds relevant, computed by any method or combination of methods that the court, in its
discretion, sees fit to use, whether or not used by the corporation or by a dissenter. The fair value of the shares as determined by the court is binding on all shareholders, wherever
located. A dissenter is entitled to judgment in cash for the amount by which the fair value of the shares as determined by the court, plus interest, exceeds the amount, if any,
remitted under subdivision 5, but shall not be liable to the corporation for the amount, if any, by which the amount, if any, remitted to the dissenter under subdivision 5 exceeds
the fair value of the shares as determined by the court, plus interest.

        Subd. 8. Costs; fees; expenses. (a) The court shall determine the costs and expenses of a proceeding under subdivision 7, including the reasonable expenses and
compensation of any appraisers

appointed by the court, and shall assess those costs and expenses against the corporation, except that the court may assess part or all of those costs and expenses against a
dissenter whose action in demanding payment under subdivision 6 is found to be arbitrary, vexatious, or not in good faith.

        (b)   If the court finds that the corporation has failed to comply substantially with this section, the court may assess all fees and expenses of any experts or attorneys
as the court deems equitable. These fees and expenses may also be assessed against a person who has acted arbitrarily, vexatiously, or not in good faith in bringing the
proceeding, and may be awarded to a party injured by those actions.

        (c)   The court may award, in its discretion, fees and expenses to an attorney for the dissenters out of the amount awarded to the dissenters, if any.

Annex D 

3414 Peachtree Road NE, Suite 500, Atlanta, GA 30326 · (404) 442-5800

November 6th, 2016

Board of Directors
Datalink Corporation
10050 Crosstown Circle, Suite 500
Eden Prairie, MN 55344

Members of the Board of Directors:

        We understand that Insight Enterprises Inc. ("Insight") and Datalink Corporation (the "Company"), propose to enter into the Agreement (defined below) pursuant to which,
among other things, a newly formed subsidiary of Insight ("Merger Sub") will be merged with and into the Company with the separate existence of Merger Sub ceasing to exist
and the Company continuing as the surviving corporation (the "Transaction") and that, in connection with the Transaction, each outstanding share of common stock, par value
$0.001 per share, of the Company (the "Common Shares") held by anyone other than Insight, Merger-Sub or any direct or indirect subsidiary of Insight or the Company (the
"Holders") will be converted into the right to receive $11.25 per share in cash (the "Common Share Transaction Consideration"). The Board of Directors of the Company (the
"Board") has requested that Raymond James & Associates, Inc. ("Raymond James") provide an opinion (the "Opinion") to the Board as to whether, as of the date hereof, the
Common Share Transaction Consideration to be received by the Holders of the Common Shares in the Transaction pursuant to the Agreement is fair from a financial point of
view to such Holders.

        In connection with our review of the proposed Transaction and the preparation of this Opinion, we have, among other things:

1. reviewed the financial terms and conditions as stated in the draft of the Agreement dated as of November 6th, 2016 (the "Agreement"); 

2. reviewed certain information related to the historical, current and future operations, financial condition and prospects of the Company made available to us by the
Company, including, but not limited to, financial projections prepared by the management of the Company relating to the Company for the periods ending
December 31, 2019, as approved for our use by the Company (the "Projections"); 

3. reviewed the Company's recent public filings and certain other publicly available information regarding the Company; 

4. reviewed financial, operating and other information regarding the Company and the industry in which it operates; 

5. reviewed the financial and operating performance of the Company and those of other selected public companies that we deemed to be relevant; 

6. considered the publicly available financial terms, and terms available to us on a confidential basis, of certain transactions we deemed to be relevant; 

7. reviewed the current and historical market prices for the Common Shares, and the current market prices of the publicly traded securities of certain other
companies that we deemed to be relevant;

8. reviewed a certificate addressed to Raymond James from a member of senior management of the Company regarding, among other things, the accuracy of the
information, data, and other materials (financial or otherwise) provided to, or discussed with, Raymond James by or on behalf of the Company; 

9. conducted such other financial studies, analyses and inquiries and considered such other information and factors as we deemed appropriate; and 

10. discussed with members of the senior management of the Company certain information relating to the aforementioned and any other matters which we have
deemed relevant to our inquiry.

        With your consent, we have assumed and relied upon the accuracy and completeness of all information supplied by or on behalf of the Company or otherwise reviewed by
or discussed with us, and we have undertaken no duty or responsibility to, nor did we, independently verify any of such information. We have not made or obtained an
independent appraisal of the assets or liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of the Company. With respect to the Projections and any other information and data provided to or
otherwise reviewed by or discussed with us, we have, with your consent, assumed that the Projections and such other information and data have been reasonably prepared in
good faith on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of management of the Company, and we have relied upon the Company to advise us promptly
if any information previously provided became inaccurate or was required to be updated during the period of our review. We express no opinion with respect to the Projections or
the assumptions on which they are based. We have assumed that the final form of the Agreement will be substantially similar to the draft reviewed by us, and that the Transaction
will be consummated in accordance with the terms of the Agreement without waiver or amendment of any conditions thereto. Furthermore, we have assumed, in all respects
material to our analysis, that the representations and warranties of each party contained in the Agreement are true and correct and that each such party will perform all of the
covenants and agreements required to be performed by it under the Agreement without being waived. We have relied upon and assumed, without independent verification, that
(i) the Transaction will be consummated in a manner that complies in all respects with all applicable international, federal and state statutes, rules and regulations, and (ii) all
governmental, regulatory, and other consents and approvals necessary for the consummation of the Transaction will be obtained and that no delay, limitations, restrictions or
conditions will be imposed or amendments, modifications or waivers made that would have an effect on the Transaction or the Company that would be material to our analyses or
this Opinion.

        Our opinion is based upon market, economic, financial and other circumstances and conditions existing and disclosed to us as of November 6th, 2016 and any material
change in such circumstances and conditions would require a reevaluation of this Opinion, which we are under no obligation to undertake. We have relied upon and assumed,
without independent verification, that there has been no change in the business, assets, liabilities, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or prospects of the
Company since the respective dates of the most recent financial statements and other information, financial or otherwise, provided to us that would be material to our analyses or
this Opinion, and that there is no information or any facts that would make any of the information reviewed by us incomplete or misleading in any material respect.

        We express no opinion as to the underlying business decision to effect the Transaction, the structure or tax consequences of the Transaction or the availability or advisability
of any alternatives to the Transaction. We provided advice to the Board with respect to the proposed Transaction. We did not, however, recommend any specific amount of
consideration or that any specific consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration for the Transaction. Our opinion is limited to the fairness, from a financial point of
view, of the Common Share Transaction Consideration to be received by the holders of the Common Shares.

        We express no opinion with respect to any other reasons, legal, business, or otherwise, that may support the decision of the Board of Directors to approve or consummate the
Transaction. Furthermore, no opinion, counsel or interpretation is intended by Raymond James on matters that require legal, accounting or tax advice. It is assumed that such
opinions, counsel or interpretations have been or will be obtained from the appropriate professional sources. Furthermore, we have relied, with the consent of the Board, on the
fact that the Company has been assisted by legal, accounting and tax advisors and we have, with the consent of the Board, relied upon and assumed the accuracy and
completeness of the assessments by the Company and its advisors as to all legal, accounting and tax matters with respect to the Company and the Transaction.

        In formulating our opinion, we have considered only what we understand to be the consideration to be received by the holders of Common Shares as is described above and
we did not consider and we express no opinion on the fairness of the amount or nature of any compensation to be paid or payable to any of the Company's officers, directors or
employees, or class of such persons, whether relative to the compensation received by the holders of the Common Shares or otherwise. We have not been requested to opine as
to, and this Opinion does not express an opinion as to or otherwise address, among other things: (1) the fairness of the Transaction to the holders of any class of securities,
creditors, or other constituencies of the Company, or to any other party, except and only to the extent expressly set forth in the last sentence of this Opinion or (2) the fairness of
the Transaction to any one class or group of the Company's or any other party's security holders or other constituencies vis-à-vis any other class or group of the Company's or
such other party's security holders or other constituents (including, without limitation, the allocation of any consideration to be received in the Transaction amongst or within
such classes or groups of security holders or other constituents). We are not expressing any opinion as to the impact of the Transaction on the solvency or viability of the
Company or Insight or the ability of the Company or Insight to pay their respective obligations when they come due.

        The delivery of this opinion was approved by an opinion committee of Raymond James.

        Raymond James has been engaged to render financial advisory services to the Company in connection with the proposed Transaction and will receive a fee for such services,
a substantial portion of which is contingent upon consummation of the Transaction. Raymond James will also receive a fee upon the delivery of this Opinion, which is not
contingent upon the successful completion of the Transaction or on the conclusion reached herein. In addition, the Company has agreed to reimburse certain of our expenses and
to indemnify us against certain liabilities arising out of our engagement.

        In the ordinary course of our business, Raymond James may trade in the securities of the Company and/or Insight for our own account or for the accounts of our customers
and, accordingly, may at any time hold a long or short position in such securities. Furthermore, Raymond James may provide investment banking, financial advisory and other
financial services to the Company and/or Insight or other participants in the Transaction in the future, for which Raymond James may receive compensation.

        It is understood that this letter is for the information of the Board of Directors of the Company (solely in each directors capacity as such) in evaluating the proposed
Transaction and does not constitute a recommendation to any shareholder of the Company regarding how said shareholder should vote on the proposed Transaction. Furthermore,
this letter should not be construed as creating any fiduciary duty on the part of Raymond James to any such party. This Opinion may not be reproduced or used for any other
purpose without our prior written consent, except that this Opinion may be disclosed in and filed with a proxy statement used in connection with the Transaction that is required
to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, provided that this Opinion is quoted in full in such proxy statement.
