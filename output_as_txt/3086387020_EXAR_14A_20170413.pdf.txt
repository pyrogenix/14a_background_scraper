Tender Offer

This Schedule 14D-9 relates to a tender offer by Eagle Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware corporation (“Purchaser”) and a wholly-
owned subsidiary of MaxLinear, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“MaxLinear” or “Parent”), to purchase for cash all of the outstanding
Common Shares (each Common Share, a “Share” and collectively, the “Shares”) at a price of $13.00 per share (the “Offer Price”),
without interest thereon, net to the seller in cash, and subject to reduction for any applicable U.S. federal withholding, back-up
withholding or other applicable tax withholdings, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Offer to Purchase, dated
April 13, 2017 (as amended or supplemented from time to time, the “Offer to Purchase”), and in the related Letter of Transmittal (as
amended or supplemented from time to time, the “Letter of Transmittal,” which, together with the Offer to Purchase, constitute the
“Offer”). The Offer is described in a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO (as amended or supplemented from time to time, and
together with the exhibits thereto, the “Schedule TO”), filed by Purchaser and Parent with the Securities and Exchange Commission
(the “SEC”) on April 13, 2017. Copies of the Offer to Purchase and form of Letter of Transmittal being mailed to Exar’s stockholders
together with this Schedule 14D-9, are filed as Exhibits (a)(1)(A) and (a)(1)(B) hereto, respectively, and are incorporated herein by
reference.

The Offer is being made pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of March 28, 2017 (as it may be amended or

things, after the completion of the Offer and the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement,
Purchaser will merge with and into Exar, with Exar surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (the “Merger”). The closing of
the Merger will occur promptly after the consummation of the Offer (“Merger Closing”). At the effective time of the Merger (the
“Effective Time”), each Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Shares owned by MaxLinear,
any subsidiary of MaxLinear or Exar, or held in treasury by Exar, or Shares held by stockholders who have properly and validly
exercised their statutory rights of appraisal in respect of such Shares in accordance with Section 262 of the Delaware General
Corporation Law (“DGCL”) if certain other conditions and statutory requirements described herein are met (“Dissenting Shares”)) will
be cancelled and extinguished and automatically converted into the right to receive cash in an amount equal to the Offer Price, without
interest thereon, net to the seller in cash, and subject to reduction for any applicable U.S. federal withholding, back-up withholding or
other applicable tax withholdings, on the terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement. A copy of the Merger Agreement is
filed as Exhibit (e)(1) hereto and is incorporated herein by reference.

Purchaser’s obligation to accept for payment and to pay for all Shares validly tendered in the Offer is conditioned upon there being
validly tendered, in accordance with the terms of the Offer (after giving effect to any withdrawals of previously tendered Shares), a
number of Shares that, taken together with any Shares then owned by Parent and Purchaser, represent at least one more than 50% of the
sum of (i) all then outstanding Shares plus (ii) the number of shares underlying all then outstanding Vested Company Options (as
defined in the Merger Agreement) plus (iii) the number of shares issuable upon settlement of all then outstanding Company Restricted
Stock Units (as defined in the Merger Agreement) (and excluding Shares tendered pursuant to guaranteed delivery procedures that have
not yet been “received,” as such term is defined in Section 251(h) of the DGCL, by the depositary for the Offer pursuant to such
procedures) (the “Minimum Condition”).

In addition, Purchaser will not be required to accept any Shares for payment pursuant to the Offer if, immediately prior to the
expiration of the Offer, any of the following conditions have not been satisfied (or waived by Parent and Purchaser, if permissible
under applicable law): (i) the waiting period (and any extensions thereof) applicable to the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement (including the Offer and the Merger) under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the
“HSR Act”) has expired or been terminated; (ii) the Company has performed or complied with in all material respects all covenants
and obligations that the Company is required to comply with or perform under the Merger Agreement prior to the scheduled expiration
of the Offer; (iii) the representations and warranties made by Exar in the Merger Agreement have been true and correct on the dates and
pursuant to the standards described in Section 15 of the Offer to Purchase; (iv) since the date of the Merger Agreement, there has not
occurred any “Company Material Adverse Effect” (as defined in the Merger Agreement), that is continuing as of immediately prior to
the scheduled expiration of the Offer; (v) no governmental authority of competent jurisdiction has (A) enacted, issued, promulgated,
entered, enforced or deemed applicable to the Offer or the Merger (as defined below) any law that is in effect and has the effect of
making the consummation of the Offer or the Merger illegal, or which has the effect of prohibiting, preventing or otherwise restraining
the consummation of the Offer or the Merger, or (B) issued or granted any order that is in effect and has the effect of making the Offer
or the Merger illegal or which has the effect of prohibiting, preventing or otherwise restraining the Offer or the Merger; (vi) the
Marketing Period (as defined in Section 15 of the Offer to Purchase) has been completed; or (viii) the Merger Agreement has not been
terminated in accordance with its terms. The “Expiration Date” means midnight (Eastern time) on May 11, 2017, which is the date that
is twenty (20) business days after the date the Offer is first commenced, unless the Offer is extended in accordance with the terms of
the Merger Agreement.

The foregoing summary of the Offer, the Merger and the Merger Agreement is qualified in its entirety by the more detailed description
and explanation contained in the Offer to Purchase. Copies of the Offer to Purchase and form of Letter of Transmittal are being mailed

Item 3. Past Contacts, Transactions, Negotiations and Agreements

Except as set forth or incorporated by reference in this Schedule 14D-9, to the knowledge of Exar, as of the date hereof, there are no

Arrangements with Parent and Purchaser and their Affiliates

Merger Agreement

On March 28, 2017, Exar, Parent and Purchaser entered into the Merger Agreement. The summary of the material provisions of the
Merger Agreement contained in Section 11 of the Offer to Purchase and the

description of the conditions of the Offer contained in Section 15 of the Offer to Purchase are incorporated herein by reference.

The Merger Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit (e)(1) hereto and is incorporated herein by reference, has been provided solely to
inform investors of its terms. Except for its status as the contractual document that establishes and governs the legal relations among
the parties with respect to the Offer and the Merger, Exar and Parent do not intend for the Merger Agreement to be a source of factual,
business or operational information about the companies. The Merger Agreement contains representations and warranties of the parties
as of specific dates and may have been used for purposes of allocating risk between the parties rather than establishing matters as facts.
Those representations and warranties were made solely for the benefit of the other parties to the Merger Agreement, and Exar’s
stockholders are not third-party beneficiaries of the Merger Agreement. Those representations and warranties are qualified in several
important respects, which you should consider as you read them in the Merger Agreement. The representations and warranties are
qualified in their entirety by certain information filed by Exar with the SEC prior to the date of the Merger Agreement, as well as by
confidential disclosure schedules that Exar delivered to Parent in connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement, and are
qualified by contractual standards of materiality that may differ from what stockholders consider to be material. Information
concerning the subject matter of the representations and warranties may have changed since the date of the Merger Agreement. For the
foregoing reasons, stockholders and other investors should not rely on the representations and warranties contained in the Merger
Agreement as accurate statements as of the date of the Merger Agreement or any other date.

The above summary of certain provisions of the Merger Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Merger Agreement
itself, which is incorporated herein by reference and a copy of which is filed as Exhibit (e)(1) to this Schedule 14D-9.

Confidentiality Agreement

On November 21, 2016, Parent and Exar entered into a confidentiality agreement (the “Confidentiality Agreement”) in connection with
Parent’s consideration of a possible transaction with or involving Exar. Under the Confidentiality Agreement, Parent and Exar agreed,
subject to certain exceptions, to keep confidential certain non-public information relating to the other party for a period of two years
from the date of the Confidentiality Agreement. The Confidentiality Agreement includes a standstill provision which expires twelve
months from the date of the Confidentiality Agreement. The Confidentiality Agreement also contains a non-solicitation provision
prohibiting each party from, either directly or indirectly, soliciting for employment any employee of the other party for a period of
twelve months from the date of the Confidentiality Agreement, subject to certain exceptions.

The above summary of certain provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the
Confidentiality Agreement itself, which is incorporated herein by reference and a copy of which is filed as Exhibit (e)(2) to this
Schedule 14D-9.

Exclusivity Agreement

On February 19, 2017, Parent and Exar entered into an Exclusivity Agreement (the “Exclusivity Agreement”). Under the terms of the
Exclusivity Agreement, Exar agreed that, until 11:59 p.m. (San Francisco time) on March 21, 2017 (the “Expiration of Exclusivity”),
neither Exar nor its representatives would, directly or indirectly: (i) solicit, initiate, seek, knowingly encourage, promote or support any
inquiry, proposal or offer from, (ii) furnish any non-public information regarding Exar to, or (iii) participate in any discussions or
negotiations with, in each case any corporation, limited liability company, general or limited partnership, business trust, unincorporated
association or other entity, person or group of any of the foregoing (other than Parent and its representatives) (each, a “Third Party”)
regarding an acquisition of 5% or more of the outstanding capital stock of or other equity interests in Exar or any of its subsidiaries or
5% or more of the consolidated assets of Exar (including by way of any merger, consolidation, tender or exchange offer,
recapitalization, extraordinary

dividend or joint venture with or involving Exar or any of its subsidiaries or any acquisition, sale or transfer of any of the business,
properties, securities, or assets of Exar or any of its subsidiaries), or any other similar transaction involving Exar or any of its
subsidiaries that would reasonably be expected to prevent or materially impede, interfere with or delay the consummation of the
transaction. Exar agreed to immediately terminate any such discussions or negotiations in progress related to an alternative transaction
and agreed to not reinitiate or otherwise engage in any further discussions or negotiations with any Third Parties during this period.
The Exclusivity Agreement also requires Exar to notify the Parent of any communication, offer or proposal from a third party regarding
or relating to a potential alternative transaction. The Exclusivity Agreement was amended on March 17, 2017 to extend the Expiration
of Exclusivity through March 27, 2017 and again on March 26, 2017 to further extend the Expiration of Exclusivity through April 3,
2017.

The above summary of certain provisions of the Exclusivity Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Exclusivity
Agreement itself, which is incorporated herein by reference and a copy of which is filed as Exhibit (e)(3) to this Schedule 14D-9.

Support Agreements

Concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, Key Stockholders (as defined in the Merger Agreement and including
Exar’s directors and executive officers) of Exar, who together own approximately 20% of the total Shares outstanding on the date of
the Merger Agreement, entered into a Support Agreement with Parent (each a “Support Agreement”), pursuant to which such Key
Stockholders have agreed, among other things, to tender their shares in the Offer and, if required, vote their respective shares against
any alternative proposal and against any action or agreement that would reasonably be expected to impede, interfere with, delay,
discourage, adversely affect or inhibit the timely consummation of, the Offer, the Merger, or the other transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement. The Support Agreements will terminate upon certain specified events, including termination of the Merger
Agreement.

The above summary of certain provisions of the Support Agreements is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Support Agreement
themselves, which are incorporated herein by reference and a copy of which is filed as Exhibits (e)(4) and (e)(5) to this Schedule 14D-
9.

Debt Commitment Letter

In connection with the Merger Agreement, Parent entered into a debt commitment letter (the “Debt Commitment Letter”), dated as of
March 28, 2017, with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (“JPMCB”), Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch (“DBNY” and together with
JPMCB, the “Initial Lenders”) and Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. (“DBSI”), pursuant to which the Initial Lenders have committed to
provide a secured term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $425,000,000, subject to the satisfaction of certain
customary closing conditions (the “Debt Financing”). The net proceeds of the Debt Financing are available (i) to finance the Merger,
(ii) to refinance certain existing indebtedness of the Company, (iii) to pay fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Offer and
the Merger and (iv) for working capital and general corporate purposes. Under the terms of the Debt Commitment Letter, JPMCB and
DBSI will act as joint lead arrangers and joint bookrunners. The actual documentation governing the Facility has not been finalized,
and accordingly, the actual terms may differ from the description of such terms in the Debt Commitment Letter.

The above summary of certain provisions of the Debt Commitment Letter is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Debt
Commitment Letter itself, which is incorporated herein by reference and a copy of which is filed as Exhibit (e)(6) to this Schedule
14D-9.

Arrangements between Exar and its Executive Officers, Directors and Affiliates

The executive officers of Exar and the members of the board of directors of Exar (the “Board”, the “Company Board” or the “Exar
Board”) may be deemed to have interests in the transactions contemplated by the Merger

9/7/2019 SC 14D9

Agreement (the “Transactions”) that may be different from or in addition to those of Exar’s stockholders generally. These interests may
create potential conflicts of interest. The Board was aware of these interests and considered them, along with other matters described
below in “Item 4. The Solicitation or Recommendation —Reasons for Recommendation,” in reaching its decision to approve the Merger
Agreement and the Transactions and to recommend that Exar’s stockholders accept the Offer, and tender their Shares pursuant to the
Offer.

For additional information with respect to the arrangements between Exar and its executive officers, directors and affiliates described
in this Item 3, please also see disclosure in respect of Messrs. Benton, Lougheed and Wark in “Item 8. Additional Information —
Golden Parachute Compensation” below, which is incorporated herein by reference, and information disclosure in respect of Messrs.
Benton, Lougheed and Wark contained in the section entitled “Executive Compensation Matters” in Exar’s definitive proxy statement
filed with the SEC on July 21, 2016.

Cash Payable for Shares Tendered Pursuant to the Offer

The non-employee directors and executive officers Exar who tender their Shares for purchase pursuant to the Offer will be entitled to
receive the same cash consideration subject to the same terms and conditions as the other stockholders of Exar. As of April 7, 2017, the
non-employee directors and executive officers of Exar beneficially owned, in the aggregate, 334,943 Shares (or approximately 0.65%
of the outstanding Shares as of such date), excluding Shares issuable to such stockholders after the date of this Schedule 14D-9 and
prior to the Effective Time upon vesting of restricted stock units or performance stock units and upon exercise of options to purchase
common stock (whether or not vesting or exercisable within 60 days of April 7, 2017). If the non-employee directors and executive
officers of Exar were to tender all such Shares for purchase pursuant to the Offer, and such Shares were accepted for payment and
purchased by Purchaser, they would receive an aggregate of $4,354,260 in cash. For a description of the treatment of stock options,
performance stock options, restricted stock units and performance stock units held by the directors and executive officers of Exar, see
below under the heading “Effect of the Merger on Stock Options and Performance Stock Options” and “Effect of the Merger on
Restricted Stock Units and Performance Stock Units.”

The following table sets forth, as of April 7, 2017, the cash consideration that each executive officer and non-employee director would
be entitled to receive in respect of their outstanding Shares if such party were to tender all of its outstanding Shares pursuant to the
Offer and those Shares were accepted for purchase and purchased by Purchaser.

Effect of the Merger on Stock Options and Performance Stock Options

Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, at the Effective Time, each outstanding and unexercised option to purchase Shares
with a per-Share exercise price less than the Offer Price, to the extent vested as of the Effective Time (each, a “Vested Company
Option”) shall be cancelled in exchange for the right to receive a cash payment without interest thereon, net to the seller in cash, and
subject to reduction for any applicable U.S. federal withholding, back-up withholding or other applicable tax withholdings, equal to the
product of (x) the total number of Shares subject to such Vested Company Option, multiplied by (y) the amount by which the Offer
Price exceeds the exercise price per share of such Vested Company Option (such amount, the “Option Award Amount”). Non-
employee members of the Board are entitled to automatic 100% vesting acceleration of their outstanding options to purchase Shares
pursuant to the terms of the Company’s form of director award agreements under the Company’s 2006 Equity Incentive Plan (the
“2006 Stock Plan”) and the Company’s 2014 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2014 Stock Plan”). For a further description of the non-
employee directors’ vesting acceleration rights, see below under the heading “— Change of Control Arrangements.”

Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, at the Effective Time, each outstanding and unexercised option to purchase Shares, to the extent
unvested as of the Effective Time that is subject to time-based vesting (each, an “Unvested Company Option”) and each outstanding
and unexercised option to purchase Shares with a per-Share exercise price equal to or exceeding the Offer Price (each, an “Out-of-the-
Money Company Option”) will be assumed by Parent and converted into an award of stock options exercisable for that number of
shares of Parent Class A Common Stock (each, after such conversion, an “Assumed Option”) equal to the number of whole Shares then
underlying the applicable Unvested Company Option or Out-of-the-Money Company Options multiplied by the Option Exchange
Ratio (as defined below), rounded down to the nearest whole share, with a per-share exercise price equal to the exercise price of the
applicable option divided by the Option Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole cent. Assumed Options will be subject to the
same vesting terms and conditions as in effect prior to the Effective Time. The “Option Exchange Ratio” is equal to the quotient
(computed to the nearest four decimal places) of the Offer Price divided by the volume weighted average closing price per share of
Parent Class A Common Stock as reported on the NYSE over the 10 consecutive trading days ending on the second trading day
immediately preceding the Expiration Date. However, only Unvested Company Options and Out-of-the-Money Company Options held
by employees, directors or consultants of Exar who become employees, directors or consultants of Parent (or a subsidiary of Parent)
after the Effective Time (such individuals, “Continuing Service Providers”) shall be assumed by Parent and converted into Assumed
Options. By virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Exar or the holder thereof, any Unvested Company
Options and Out-of-the-Money Company Options held by non-Continuing Service Providers shall be cancelled and shall have no
further effect following the Effective Time. It is therefore expected that any Out-of-the-Money Company Options held by the
Company’s non-employee directors will be cancelled rather than converted into Assumed Options.

Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, at the Effective Time, each outstanding and unexercised option to purchase Shares with a
performance-based vesting condition that is not a Vested Company Option nor an Assumed Option (each, an “Unvested Company
Performance Option”) will be converted into an option exercisable for that number of shares of Parent Class A Common Stock (each,
after such conversion, a “Converted Performance Option”) equal to the number of whole Shares then underlying the applicable
Unvested Company Performance Option multiplied by the Option Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest share, with a per-share
exercise price equal to the exercise price of the applicable option divided by the Option Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest
whole cent. Converted Performance Options will be subject to the same vesting terms and conditions as in effect prior to the Effective
Time, except that all performance-based vesting criteria applicable to performance periods ending after the Company’s fiscal year 2017
are deemed to be achieved at target levels as of immediately prior to the Effective Time.

The table below sets forth (i) the number of Shares underlying the Vested Company Options that were held by the directors and
executive officers of Exar on April 7, 2017 including options eligible for “single-trigger” accelerated vesting upon occurrence of the
Transactions (and without occurrence of any other event such a termination of service), (ii) the total cash-out payments for the Vested
Company Options, after taking into account the difference between the Offer Price and the weighted average exercise price of such
Vested Company Options and without taking into account any applicable tax withholdings. (iii) the number of Shares underlying the
Unvested Company Options, Out-of-the-Money Company Options and Unvested Company Performance Options, (iv) the weighted-
average exercise price of such Unvested Company Options, Out-of-the-Money Company Options and Unvested Company Performance
Options that were held by the executive officers of Exar on April 7, 2017 that are eligible to become Assumed Options or Converted
Performance Options and (v) the estimated number of shares of Parent Class A Common Stock subject to the Assumed Options and
Converted Performance Options the executive officers of Exar are expected to receive in respect of such Unvested Company Options,
Out-of-the-Money Company Options and Unvested Company Performance Options.

Effect of the Merger on Restricted Stock Units and Performance Stock Units

Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, at the Effective Time, each outstanding stock unit of Shares (whether a restricted stock
unit vesting solely based on continued service or a performance stock unit vesting all or in part by achievement of performance-vesting
conditions), to the extent vested as of the Effective Time (each, a “Vested Company Unit”) shall be cancelled in exchange for the right
to receive a cash payment, without interest thereon, net to the seller in cash, and subject to reduction for any applicable U.S. federal
withholding, back-up withholding or other applicable tax withholdings, equal to the product of (x) the total number of Shares subject to
such Vested Company Unit, multiplied by (y) the Offer Price (the “Unit Award Amount”). In the ordinary course, the Company settles
restricted stock units and performance stock units in Shares shortly after

satisfying all vesting conditions. Accordingly, the Vested Company Units are expected to include only the number of restricted stock
units held by Exar’s non-employee directors that are subject to automatic 100% vesting acceleration in connection with the
Transactions. For a further description of the non-employee directors’ vesting acceleration rights, see below under the heading
“— Change of Control Arrangements.”

Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, at the Effective Time, each stock unit of Shares scheduled to vest solely based on
continued service that is not a Vested Company Unit and that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (an “Unvested
Company RSU”) shall be converted into an award (each, after such conversion, an “Assumed Unit”) to receive that number of shares
of Parent Class A Common Stock equal to the product obtained by multiplying (A) the number of Shares subject to such Unvested
Company RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time by (B) the Option Exchange Ratio, with the resulting number rounded down to
the nearest whole share of Parent Class A Common Stock. Each Assumed Unit shall otherwise be subject to the same terms and
conditions as were applicable under the respective Unvested Company RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time. However, only
Unvested Company RSUs that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that are held by a Person who is a Continuing
Service Provider shall be assumed by Parent and converted into an Assumed Unit. By virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of Parent, Exar or the holder thereof, any Unvested Company RSUs held by non-Continuing Service Providers shall be
cancelled and shall have no further effect following the Effective Time.

Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, at the Effective Time, each stock unit of Shares scheduled to vest all or in part by
achievement of performance-vesting conditions that is not a Vested Company Unit and that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (an “Unvested Company Performance Unit”), shall be converted into an unvested award representing the right to
receive a stock unit in Parent Class A Common Stock (each, after such conversion, a “Converted Performance Unit”) calculated by
multiplying (x) the number of Shares subject to such Unvested Company Performance Unit as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time by (y) the Option Exchange Ratio. Each Converted Performance Unit shall otherwise be subject to the same terms and conditions
as were applicable immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that all performance-vesting criteria applicable to performance
periods ending after Exar’s fiscal year 2017 are deemed to be achieved at target levels as of immediately prior to the Effective Time.

Treatment of Purchase Rights Under Employee Stock Purchase Plan

Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, Exar has suspended operation of the Employee Stock Participation Plan (the “ESPP”)
since after the purchase completed on March 31, 2017 so that no further offerings or purchases of Shares under the ESPP will occur.

Change of Control Arrangements

Each of James Lougheed, Keith Tainsky, and Hung Le is a party to a Change of Control Severance Letter Agreement with Exar that
provides for lump sum severance payments equal to six months’ salary, six months of COBRA coverage, and accelerated vesting of all
equity awards due to vest within twelve months of termination and, in Mr. Lougheed’s case, 100% accelerated vesting of all equity
awards, in the event of a termination without Cause or for Good Reason (each capitalized term as defined in the relevant agreement)
within twelve months

after a change of control. Daniel Wark is a party to a Change of Control Severance Letter Agreement with Exar that provides for lump
sum severance payments equal to six months’ salary, six months of COBRA coverage, and 100% accelerated vesting of equity awards
in the event of a termination without Cause or for Good Reason (each capitalized term as defined in the agreement) within 24 months
after a change of control. Both Parent’s acquisition of Shares via the Offer resulting in Parent possessing more than 50% of Exar
stockholder voting power and the consummation of the Merger would each independently constitute a change of control event for
purposes of the Change of Control Severance Letter Agreements. Each executive officer’s potential severance benefits are contingent
upon the execution of a standard settlement and release of claims agreement. The above summary of certain provisions of the Change
of Control Severance Letter Agreements is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Change of Control Severance Letter Agreements
themselves, which are incorporated herein by reference and a copy of which is filed as Exhibits (e)(25)-(28) to this Schedule 14D-9.

Pursuant to the Employment Agreement entered into by and between Exar and Ryan Benton dated as of September 27, 2013, in the
event of an Involuntary Termination (as defined in the Employment Agreement) within twelve months following a change of control,
subject to the execution of a standard settlement and release of claims agreement, Mr. Benton is entitled to payment in the amount of
one year annual base salary, 100% accelerated vesting of equity awards and a pro-rated portion of his target annual incentive bonus for
the year of termination. Both Parent’s acquisition of Shares via the Offer resulting in Parent possessing more than 50% of Exar
stockholder voting power and the consummation of the Merger would each independently constitute a change of control event for
purposes of the Employment Agreement. Mr. Benton’s Employment Agreement contains a “better after-tax” provision, which provides
that if any amounts payable pursuant to the agreement in connection with a change of control constitute parachute payments under
Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the “Code”), the payments will be either (i) reduced or (ii) provided in full to
Mr. Benton, whichever results in Mr. Benton receiving the greater amount after taking into consideration the payment of all taxes,
including the excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code. The above summary of certain provisions of the Employment Agreement is
qualified in its entirety by reference to the Employment Agreement itself, which is incorporated herein by reference and a copy of
which is filed as Exhibits (e)(24) to this Schedule 14D-9.

For an estimate of the value of the amounts that would be payable to Messrs. Lougheed and Wark under the Change of Control
Severance Letter Agreements and to Mr. Benton under his Employment Agreement, assuming that the Merger occurred on April 7,
2017 and each such executive officer experienced a termination without cause or resignation for good reason after the Transactions, see
the table included in Item 8 under the heading “— Additional Information to be Furnished — Golden Parachute Compensation,” which
is incorporated by reference into this Item 3. The table below presents estimates of the amounts that would be payable to Messrs.
Tainsky and Le under the Change of Control Severance Letter Agreements assuming that the closing of the Offer and the Merger both
occur on April 7, 2017, and Messrs. Tainsky and Le each experiences a termination without “cause” or resignation for “good reason”
immediately after consummation of the Transactions such that they are each entitled to all corresponding benefits under their Change
of Control Severance Letter Agreements.

Pursuant to Exar’s form of director restricted stock unit agreement and form of director nonqualified stock option agreement under the
2014 Stock Plan and 2006 Plan, the outstanding restricted stock unit and stock options awards granted to non-employee members of
the Board under the 2014 Stock Plan and 2006 Stock Plan become fully vested upon the occurrence of a “Change in Control Event” (as
such term is defined in the form director award agreements) during the optionee’s service on the Board. Both Parent’s acquisition of
Shares via the Offer resulting in Parent possessing at least 30% of Exar stockholder voting power and the consummation of the Merger
would each independently constitute a “Change in Control Event” for purposes of the form director award agreements under the 2014
Stock Plan and 2006 Stock Plan. The tables above under the headings “— Effect of the Merger on Stock Options and Performance
Stock Options” and “— Effect of the Merger on Restricted Stock Units and Performance Stock Units” reflect the value of this vesting
acceleration pursuant to the form of director award agreements. The above summary of certain provisions of the director stock option
and stock unit award agreements under the 2006 Plan and 2014 Plan is qualified in its entirety by reference to the form of award
agreements themselves, which are incorporated herein by reference and a copy of which is filed as Exhibits (e)(15)-(16) and (e)(22)-
(23) to this Schedule 14D-9.

2017 Management Incentive Program

All of Exar’s executive officers participate in the Fiscal Year 2017 Management Incentive Program (the “2017 MIP”), a copy of which
is filed as Exhibit (e)(29) to this Schedule 14D 9 and is incorporated herein by reference. Each participant’s target award under the
2017 MIP was approved by the Compensation Committee of the Company Board in April 2016 and, as in prior years, each target
award was denominated in and would be payable in Shares, subject to achievement of the performance factors described below and the
relevant participant remaining employed with Exar through the date incentives are paid under the program. The performance factors for
the 2017 MIP, which were approved by the Company Board in February 2016, are based on Exar’s financial performance as measured
against pre-established goals for net revenue, earnings before income tax (“EBIT”) for the fiscal year and net cash provided from cash
flow. For these purposes, “revenue” and “EBIT” were calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, except
that revenue is adjusted for deferred revenue write-down associated with acquisitions and EBIT is adjusted to exclude certain items
from EBIT such as all stock-based compensation expense, amortization of acquired intangible assets and technology licenses, fair
value adjustment of acquired inventories, acquisition-related costs, separation costs, provision for dispute resolution, impairment of
acquired intangible assets and restructuring charges and exit costs. Cash profit sharing costs were also excluded. The 2017 MIP
provides that performance goals may be adjusted in the event of a material corporate transaction and, accordingly, the Compensation
Committee of the Company Board determined the full year results based on an extrapolation of the partial year results of its Integrated
Memory Logic Limited (iML) subsidiary for the remainder of the 2017 fiscal year subsequent to the sale of iML.

Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the 2017 MIP awards will be paid prior to the Merger Closing, if possible based on timing of the
Merger Closing, in the form of fully vested Shares that will be issued under the 2014 Stock Plan, subject to attainment of the applicable
Exar performance factors and continued employment through the issuance date. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, in the event that
Exar’s attainment against the performance factors cannot be measured prior to the Merger Closing, the 2017 MIP awards will be
converted into an unvested award representing the right to receive a number of shares of Parent Class A Common Stock equal to the
product of (x) the target number of shares subject to the award multiplied by (y) the Option Exchange Ratio multiplied by (z) the
performance factor achieved based on actual performance during the Company’s fiscal year 2017 with respect to the individual and
performance goals applicable to the award.

Compensation and Benefits of Continuing Employees

Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Parent is not obligated to continue employment of any Exar employee for any period of time after
the Merger. However, after the Merger Closing, each Exar employee who does continue as an employee of Parent or any of its
respective subsidiaries, including Exar, following the consummation of the Merger (each a “Continuing Employee”) will, until the
earlier of the termination of such Continuing Employee’s employment with such entities or the first anniversary of the Effective Time,
be entitled to base salary of no less than the base salary provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective
Time, subject to an exception if salaries are reduced in connection with salary reductions for similarly situated Parent employees.

The Merger Agreement further provides that each Continuing Employee will be credited with his or her years of service with Exar,
Exar’s subsidiaries and their affiliates (and any additional service with a predecessor employer) before the Effective Time to the same
extent as such Continuing Employee was entitled, before the Merger Closing, to credit for such service under any similar Exar benefit
plan for purposes of vesting, eligibility to participate and levels of benefits under any benefit plans which the Continuing Employee
becomes eligible to participate in after the Effective Time (except with respect to benefit accruals, benefit amounts under any defined
benefit plan, or as would otherwise result in duplication of benefits).

Although it is possible that certain Exar employees will enter into arrangements with Parent or its affiliates regarding employment,
compensation or benefits prior to consummation of the Transactions, no such arrangements have been entered into by the Exar
executive officers or directors as of the date of this Solicitation/Recommendation Statement.

Director Compensation

Under Exar’s current compensation program for Non-Employee Directors, the annual retainer for each Non-Employee Director is
$40,000. The Chair of the Board receives an additional $40,000 annual retainer; the Chair of the Audit Committee receives an
additional $30,000 annual retainer; the Chair of the Compensation Committee receives an additional $20,000 annual retainer; and the
Chair of the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee receives an additional $10,000 annual retainer.

In addition, each member of the Audit Committee (other than the Chair) receives an additional annual retainer of $8,000; each member
of the Compensation Committee (other than the Chair) receives an additional annual retainer of $4,000; and each member of the
Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee (other than the Chair) receives an additional annual retainer of $3,000. All retainers
are payable quarterly. Partial quarters are paid on a prorated basis, including potentially with respect to the quarter in which the
Transactions occur.

Under the current compensation program for Non-Employee Directors, each Non-Employee Director continuing in office following an
annual meeting of stockholders will be granted upon the first trading day of the month following the annual meeting date, an option to
purchase 10,000 shares of Common Stock that will vest in full upon the earlier of the fourth anniversary of the grant date. Furthermore,
each Non-Employee Director continuing in office after an annual meeting of stockholders will receive 7,000 restricted stock units upon
the first trading day of the month following the annual meeting date. This restricted stock unit award will vest in full upon the earlier of
the fourth anniversary of the grant date or the annual meeting of stockholders that occurs in the fourth year following such grant date.
A Non-Employee Director serving as Chair of the Board of Directors as of an annual meeting date will receive an additional 2,500
restricted stock units upon the first trading day of the month following the annual meeting date. The Chair restricted stock unit award
will vest upon the earlier of the first anniversary of the grant date or the next annual meeting of stockholders following such grant date.
The options granted to Exar’s outside directors have a per share exercise price equal to 100% of the fair market value of the underlying
shares on the date of grant, have a term of 10 years and automatically become fully vested in the event of a change in control as is
described above under the heading “— Change of Control Arrangements”.

Non-employee directors are also reimbursed for reasonable out of pocket expenses incurred in connection with attending board and
committee meetings.

Director and Officer Indemnification and Insurance

Section 145 of the DGCL permits a Delaware corporation to include in its charter documents and in agreements between the
corporation and its directors and officers, provisions expanding the scope of indemnification beyond that specifically provided by
current law. Exar has included in its certificate of incorporation provisions to eliminate the personal liability of its directors for
monetary damages for breaches of fiduciary duty by such a director as a director, subject to specified limitations, and Exar is required
under its bylaws to indemnify its directors and executive officers to the fullest extent not prohibited by the DGCL, subject to specified
exceptions.

Exar also has entered into indemnification agreements with each of its directors and executive officers (the “Indemnification
Agreements”). These agreements generally require Exar to indemnify its directors and executive officers against all expenses,
judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such director or executive officer
because he is, or is threatened to be made, a party to any threatened, pending, or completed action, claim, suit, arbitration, alternate
dispute resolution mechanism, investigation, administrative hearing or any other proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative that is associated with the indemnitee’s being an agent of Exar. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Exar is not obligated to
indemnify such director or executive officer in certain circumstances, including, for any claim to the extent payment is actually made to
the indemnitee under any insurance policy or for an accounting of profits made from the purchase or sale by such director or executive
officer of securities of Exar within the meaning of Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange
Act”) or similar provisions of state statutory law or common law, on account of indemnitee’s conduct being finally adjudged to have
been knowingly fraudulent or deliberately dishonest or constitute willful misconduct, or to the extent it would be otherwise prohibited
by law. Under the Indemnification Agreements, all reasonable expenses incurred by or on behalf of an indemnitee in connection with a
proceeding shall be advanced from time to time by Exar to such indemnitee within ten (10) days after receipt by Exar of a written
request for an advance of expenses. The Indemnification Agreements also set forth certain procedures that will apply in the event any
of Exar’s directors or executive officers brings a claim for indemnification under the Indemnification Agreements. The above summary
of certain provisions of the Indemnification Agreements is qualified in its entirety by reference to the form of Indemnification
Agreement itself, which is incorporated herein by reference and a copy of which is filed as Exhibits (e)(30) to this Schedule 14D-9.

Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, for a period of six years following the Effective Time, Exar as the surviving corporation (the
“Surviving Corporation”) and its subsidiaries will, and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries to (i) honor and
fulfill in all respects the obligations of the Company and its subsidiaries under any and all indemnification agreements in effect as of
the date of the Merger Agreement that have been disclosed to Parent, between the Company or any of its subsidiaries and any of their
respective current or former directors and officers and any person who becomes a director or officer of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) cause their respective certificates of incorporation and bylaws (and other similar
organizational documents) to contain provisions with respect to indemnification and exculpation that are at least as favorable as the
indemnification and exculpation provisions contained in the certificate of incorporation and bylaws (or other similar organizational
documents) of the Company and its subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time, and during such six-year period, such
provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any respect except as and to the extent required by applicable law.

The Merger Agreement also provides that for a period of six years after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation will
maintain in effect the Company’s existing directors’ and officers’ liability insurance (the “D&O Insurance”) arising from facts or
circumstances that occurred at or prior to the Effective Time, covering each person covered by the D&O Insurance as of the Effective
Time, on terms with respect to the coverage and amounts no less favorable than those of the D&O Insurance in effect on the date of the
Merger Agreement. However, in no event shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to expend in any one year an amount in
excess of 250% of the current annual premium paid by the Company. Alternatively, prior to
 

13



9/7/2019 SC 14D9

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/753568/000119312517122031/d356341dsc14d9.htm 15/72

the Acceptance Time, Parent or the Company may purchase a six-year “tail” prepaid policy on the D&O Insurance on terms and
conditions no less advantageous, in the aggregate, than the D&O Insurance.

In the event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation consolidate or merge with any other person and shall not be the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger, or transfers at least fifty percent (50%) of its properties and assets to
any other person, then in each case proper provision shall be made so that the continuing or surviving corporation or entity, or
transferee of such assets, as the case may be, shall assume the insurance and indemnification obligations.

Section 16 Matters

Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board will take all such steps as may be required to cause any dispositions of Shares
(including derivative securities with respect to Shares) resulting from the Offer and Merger by each individual who is subject to the
reporting requirements of the Exchange Act to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

Rule 14d-10(d) Matters

Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the Compensation Committee of the Company Board or its “independent directors” within the
meaning of Rule 14d-10(d)(2) of the Exchange Act, will take all such steps as may be required to cause each agreement, arrangement
or understanding that has been or will be entered into by Exar or any Exar subsidiary with any of its officers, directors or employees
pursuant to which compensation, severance or other benefits is paid to such officer, director or employee to be approved as an
“employment compensation, severance or other employee benefit arrangement” within the meaning of Rule 14d-10(d)(1) under the
Exchange Act and to otherwise satisfy the requirements of the non-exclusive safe harbor set forth in Rule 14d-10(d) under the
Exchange Act.

Item 4. The Solicitation or Recommendation

Recommendation of the Board

On March 28, 2017, the Company Board unanimously:
 

 
•  determined that the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Offer and the Merger, and the other

transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, are at a price and on terms that are fair to, and in the best interests of
the Company and its stockholders (including the unaffiliated stockholders);

 

 
•  approved and declared advisable the Support Agreements, the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby,

including the Offer and the Merger; and
 

 
•  recommended that the stockholders accept the Offer and tender their Shares to Purchaser in the Offer and, to the extent

applicable, approve and adopt the Merger Agreement and the Merger.

Accordingly, and for other reasons described in more detail below, the Board unanimously recommends that Exar’s stockholders accept
the Offer and tender their Shares to Purchaser pursuant to the Offer. A joint press release, dated March 29, 2017, issued by Parent and
Exar announcing the Offer is included as Exhibit (a)(5)(A) hereto and is incorporated herein by reference.

Background of the Transactions

Exar operates in the analog semiconductor industry, and the broader semiconductor industry has been characterized by cyclicality,
rapid technological change and volatility. In recent years, the semiconductor industry has continued to consolidate at a rapid pace,
creating larger competitors with scale. The Exar Board and

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/753568/000119312517122031/d356341dsc14d9.htm 16/72

management have recognized that many of Exar’s competitors are larger or more diversified companies with substantially greater
financial resources and capacity to invest in the development and marketing of new products and technologies. In light of these market
and business dynamics, the Exar Board, together with management, periodically reviews and assesses Exar’s business plan and
potential strategic opportunities available to Exar with the goal of maximizing stockholder value. As part of this ongoing process, the
Exar Board and management have periodically evaluated whether the continued execution of Exar’s strategy as a standalone company
or the sale of Exar to, or a combination of Exar with, a third party offers the best avenue to maximize stockholder value. As described
below, the Exar Board retained a financial advisor, Cowen and Company, LLC (“Cowen”), in February 2015 to assist the Exar Board in
a review of strategic alternatives and to help execute a strategic process to increase stockholder value. In connection with such review,
Exar management, with assistance from Cowen and the oversight of the Exar Board, has met, from time to time, with various third
parties who expressed an interest in engaging in a strategic transaction with Exar. In addition, the Exar Board has from time to time
evaluated the possibility of acquiring synergistic companies or product lines, but in the past several years did not find businesses or
assets to acquire on terms that it deemed attractive. The Exar Board has also evaluated and executed the divestiture of certain
businesses and assets as a way to maximize stockholder value.

Since January 2015, primarily in connection with the above-mentioned review of strategic alternatives, a number of strategic and
financial acquirers, both domestic and foreign, engaged in discussions regarding a potential transaction with Exar or its business
divisions. With the assistance of Cowen, Exar made contact with 46 parties (including those that reached out directly to the Company),
had meetings with 13 parties, and received four offers for the consolidated business of Exar and one offer for the iML business division
of Exar. During this period, the Exar Board met 28 times (in addition to meetings where strategic alternatives were not discussed) and
the Special Committee of the Exar Board met approximately 18 times to discuss the strategic alternatives of the Company. These
discussions are described in more detail below.

In January and February of 2015, the then-Chairman of the Exar Board, Richard Leza, and then-current Exar Chief Executive Officer,
Louis DiNardo, had several discussions and meetings with Company A, during which Company A expressed preliminary interest in
acquiring the Company.

Also in January 2015, representatives from Cowen met with representatives from Beijing E-Town International Investment &
Development Co., Ltd. (“E-Town Beijing”) to discuss a number of potential acquisition opportunities across the general market,
including a potential transaction with Exar. In these discussions, Cowen was representing neither E-Town Beijing nor Exar. Shortly
following this meeting, representatives of Cowen informed Exar management of these discussions.

On January 8, 2015, the Special Committee met to discuss strategic matters and the preliminary interest received from Company A.
The Exar Board had previously established a committee (the “Special Committee”) to provide oversight of the Company’s discussions
with strategic parties. The Special Committee was not empowered to approve or authorize Exar to enter into any agreements, including
exclusivity agreements, unless a specific delegation of authority was provided by the Exar Board. The members of the Special
Committee were initially Mr. Leza, Mr. DiNardo and Brian Hilton, an independent director on the Exar Board.

On January 9, 2015, members of Exar management and representatives from Cowen met with a delegation of China-based investors,
which included representatives from E-Town Beijing. In this meeting, Cowen was representing neither E-Town Beijing nor Exar.

On February 5, 2015, the Exar Board held a meeting to discuss Exar’s business as well as the current status of strategic discussions
with Company A and E-Town Beijing.

In January and early February, Mr. Leza and members of Exar management met with various potential financial advisors to discuss a
potential engagement with Exar and to review the qualifications of these financial advisors.

Also, in January and early February, Exar had preliminary conversations with representatives from Company D to discuss a potential
acquisition of Exar. In December 2014, Exar executed a non-disclosure agreement with Company D. This non-disclosure agreement
included standstill provisions that, among other things, prohibited Company D from effecting, proposing, participating in, or
facilitating any acquisition of Exar securities, or any tender or exchange offer, merger, consolidation, acquisition, or other business
combination involving Exar, unless invited to do so by Exar (“standstill provisions”). These standstill provisions automatically
terminated in June 2016.

In February 2015, representatives of Cowen met with representatives of E-Town Beijing and had various follow-up conversations on
opportunities across the general market, during which E-Town Beijing reiterated potential interest in Exar and discussed with Cowen
the potential to partner on a transaction with Chipone Technology (Beijing) Co., Ltd. (“Chipone”, and with E-Town Beijing, “E-
Town”). In these discussions, Cowen was representing neither E-Town nor Exar. Representatives of Cowen informed Exar
management of these discussions shortly following their occurrence.

On February 18, 2015, Exar executed a non-disclosure agreement with Company A. This non-disclosure agreement did not include
standstill provisions.

On February 19, 2015, Exar management met in person with Company A to discuss Exar’s business and a potential transaction
between the parties.

On February 20, 2015, Company A made an initial nonbinding offer to acquire Exar for $11.05 per Share to be paid entirely in shares
of Company A common stock. Mr. Leza had a follow-up discussion with Company A’s chief executive officer to discuss and clarify the
terms of the offer. On February 20, 2015, the closing price of the Shares on The New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”) was $10.59
per share.

On February 21 and 23, 2015, the Special Committee met to discuss the nonbinding offer from Company A.

On February 23, 2015, the Exar Board met, with legal counsel in attendance, to discuss Company A’s interest in a potential acquisition
of Exar and the letter of intent that had been submitted by Company A. Legal counsel advised the Exar Board of its fiduciary duties in
the context of evaluating an acquisition proposal. The Exar Board, with input from legal counsel, discussed Company A’s proposal in
detail and discussed a process to further engage with Company A and to evaluate other potential strategic alternatives. The Exar Board
discussed retaining a financial advisor. The Exar Board reviewed its previous discussions with Cowen regarding the strategic landscape
in which the Company operated. The Board also reviewed the discussions it and members of Exar management had with other
investment banking firms and its prior engagements with other financial advisors. After this discussion, the Board decided to engage a
financial advisor to assist in the evaluation of strategic alternatives and in the discussions with Company A. Representatives from
Cowen joined the meeting and presented background information on Cowen and discussed Exar’s market and other strategic matters.
The representatives from Cowen also noted that Cowen was involved in discussions with E-Town concerning a separate transaction,
but was not engaged by E-Town. After the representatives from Cowen left the meeting, the Exar Board directed the Special
Committee to engage Cowen and negotiate the engagement terms with them. The Exar Board also directed Exar management on the
terms to be included in a counter-offer to Company A.

On February 25, 2015, upon the approval by the Special Committee, Exar entered into an engagement letter with Cowen to act as its
exclusive financial advisor in connection with the Exar Board’s review of strategic alternatives to maximize stockholder value,
including discussions with Company A. Exar engaged Cowen to serve as its financial advisor because of Cowen’s qualifications,
expertise, reputation and knowledge of Exar’s business and affairs, and because Cowen was experienced and knowledgeable about
Exar’s industry, strategic positioning, future prospects, and potential strategic and financial partners.

On February 25, 2015, Exar provided a counter-proposal to Company A, which retained an offer price of $11.05 per Share to be paid
entirely in shares of Company A common stock, but requested changes on other material

terms, such as deal protection provisions. Representatives of Cowen met with Mr. Leza and Exar management to discuss a process for
Exar to explore strategic alternatives, including its continued discussions with Company A and contacting additional parties who may
be interested in acquiring Exar.

On February 26, 2015, the Special Committee directed Cowen to contact 11 parties, in addition to Company A, to discuss a potential
acquisition of Exar. The parties were identified by the Special Committee, in consultation with management and with Cowen, as the
parties that were the most likely to be interested in, and have the financial capacity to enter into, a transaction with the Company at a
value that was at least equivalent to the value being discussed with Company A at that time.

In February and March of 2015, Exar management and representatives from Cowen held discussions with 11 parties, in addition to
Company A, regarding the potential acquisition of the Company.

On March 1 and 2, 2015, Exar management and representatives from Cowen met in person with senior executives from E-Town.

Company A, as well as additional discussions with other potential parties.

On March 2, 2015, Company A submitted a revised nonbinding letter of intent for the acquisition of Exar, which included certain
changes in response to Exar’s counter-proposal and recent negotiations. The letter of intent continued to include an all-stock purchase
price of $11.05 per Share.

On March 4, 2015, the Exar Board met, with legal counsel in attendance, to discuss the current status of discussions with Company A
and its most recent letter of intent. Legal counsel reviewed the Exar Board’s fiduciary duties in the business combination context.

On March 5, 2015, the Exar Board met again, with representatives from Cowen and legal counsel in attendance. The representatives
from Cowen described the strategic process undertaken by Exar and the feedback received from the parties contacted, noting that no
party other than Company A had indicated a meaningful desire to move forward in discussions with Exar and only Company A had
submitted a letter of intent. The Exar Board then discussed with the representatives from Cowen the financial terms of Company A’s
current offer of $11.05 per Share to be paid in Company A common stock. The Exar Board then continued its discussion of Company
A’s current proposal and authorized the Special Committee to continue to negotiate the terms set forth in Company A’s letter of intent
and to authorize Exar to enter into an exclusivity agreement with Company A.

On March 5, 2015, E-Town submitted a nonbinding letter of intent expressing an interest in pursuing a transaction with Exar. The letter
of intent did not include material terms of the proposed transaction, including the proposed purchase price and whether the proposal
applied to the acquisition of the entire company or a business division.

On March 6, 2015, Mr. Leza, Mr. DiNardo and representatives from Cowen met with senior executives from Company A in order to
further discuss Exar’s business, the status of Company A’s due diligence and to negotiate the terms contained in Company A’s
nonbinding letter of intent.

On March 6, 2015, Exar entered into an exclusivity agreement with Company A for a 60-day exclusivity period, based on the most
recent letter of intent from Company A, including its offer price of $11.05 per Share to be paid in shares of Company A common stock.
The exclusivity agreement provided that Exar could terminate the exclusivity period if it received an unsolicited proposal that the Exar
Board determined in good faith was more

favorable than the proposal from Company A. On this date, the Company’s closing price on the NYSE was $10.71 per share.

On March 7, 2015, E-Town submitted a nonbinding letter of intent to acquire the iML division of Exar for between $130 million and
$150 million in cash.

On March 10, 2015, Exar management and representatives from Cowen held an organizational call with Company A to commence the
due diligence process.

On March 11, 2015, the Exar Board met, with representatives from Cowen and legal counsel in attendance, to discuss the status of
Company A’s due diligence review and the offer from E-Town. The Exar Board discussed the proposal from E-Town at length, and
whether the Exar Board should exercise its rights under the exclusivity agreement with Company A to terminate the exclusivity period
in order to pursue the proposal from E-Town. The Exar Board received input from Cowen and legal counsel. The Exar Board noted that
the E-Town proposal was for less than all of Exar, there were significant regulatory approval risks associated with this transaction and
the financing of such a transaction was not certain. The Exar Board determined not to respond at this time to the E-Town proposal and
directed Exar management to continue its exclusive discussions with Company A.

In March and April of 2015, Company A conducted a due diligence review of the Company, which included meetings amongst the
management teams of both companies and their respective advisors, production of due diligence materials by Exar, including the
opening of an electronic data site by Exar to Company A containing extensive diligence materials, and the preparation and negotiation

agreement contained standstill provisions that automatically terminated if Exar entered into an agreement with another party providing
for the acquisition of Exar.

On January 8, 2016, Mr. Benton met with a representative of E-Town in person and discussed E-Town’s interest in acquiring the iML
business or all of Exar. The representative from E-Town indicated that they were only interested in acquiring the iML business.

On January 12, 2016, the Exar Board met, with representatives from Cowen and Pillsbury in attendance, to discuss the current status of
Exar’s review of strategic alternatives, including the progress made in discussions with potential transaction partners. The Exar Board
discussed, in detail, the current status of discussions with E-Town, Company A, Company B and Company C. At the Board meeting,
representatives from Cowen discussed with the Exar Board information concerning Cowen’s work serving as financial advisor to E-
Town in an unrelated acquisition by E-Town, which information had also been provided to the Exar Board in advance of the meeting.
Cowen confirmed to the Exar Board that it would not represent E-Town in any capacity on matters related to Exar. The Exar Board
considered the information that Cowen had provided and concluded that Cowen’s familiarity with Exar, the strategic discussions that
had taken place in the preceding months and with potential acquirers, particularly in China, would help Cowen serve effectively as
Exar’s financial advisor. The Exar Board then authorized Exar to re-engage Cowen to serve as its financial advisor.

On January 12, 2016, Exar re-engaged Cowen to serve as its financial advisor.

On January 12, 2016, E-Town submitted a nonbinding indication of interest to acquire the iML business plus other assets for a total
purchase price of $130 million.

On January 19, 2016, Exar management and representatives from Cowen met with representatives of another company to discuss a
potential acquisition of Exar. This company decided not to pursue discussions with Exar.

On January 20, 2016, at Exar management’s direction, representatives of Cowen met in person with Company C’s chief executive
officer to discuss Company C’s interest in an acquisition of Exar.

On January 25, 2016, Exar management and representatives from Cowen met with representatives of another company to discuss a
potential acquisition of Exar. This company decided not to pursue discussions with Exar.

On January 27, 2016, Exar management met telephonically with representatives from Company C to provide a corporate overview for
the purpose of enabling Company C to evaluate a potential acquisition of Exar. Throughout February and March of 2016, Exar
management continued to provide additional diligence information to Company C.

From time-to-time in January 2016, Exar management negotiated the terms of E-Town’s letter of intent and provided additional
information to E-Town with the objective of attempting to convince E-Town to improve its terms and to move forward with an
acquisition of Exar’s iML business. On January 31, 2016, E-Town submitted a revised letter of intent to purchase Exar’s iML business
for $140 million in cash.

On February 5, 2016, the Exar Board met with representatives of Cowen and Pillsbury present, to consider the current status of its
review of potential strategic alternatives and to consider whether to enter into exclusive discussions with E-Town on the basis of its
most recent letter of intent. Following discussion with representatives of Cowen and Pillsbury, the Exar Board approved and authorized
Exar to enter into a 45-day exclusivity period to explore the acquisition by E-Town of Exar’s iML business.

Also on February 5, 2016, Exar entered into an exclusivity agreement with E-Town for a 45-day period to explore the purchase of
Exar’s iML business based on a nonbinding all-cash purchase price of $140 million, subject to certain adjustments.

Between February 5, 2016 and March 19, 2016, Exar and E-Town and their respective representatives conducted due diligence in
furtherance of E-Town’s proposed purchase of the iML business from Exar. From February 16, 2016 to February 18, 2016, Exar
management met in person with representatives of E-Town to conduct due diligence sessions.

On March 4, 2016, E-Town delivered to Exar an initial draft of a share purchase agreement for the acquisition of iML. From March 4,
2016 to March 19, 2016, Exar and E-Town and their respective representatives negotiated the share purchase agreement and other
ancillary agreements.

On March 15, 2016, Exar management met with E-Town in person to discuss E-Town’s potential acquisition of the iML business from
Exar.

On March 19, 2016, E-Town informed Exar that it was reducing its offer price for the iML business. As a result, on March 19, 2016,
Exar informed E-Town that it was no longer willing to proceed in discussions for the sale of the iML business to E-Town and
terminated the exclusivity agreement in accordance with its terms.

On March 30, 2016, Exar management met with representatives of Company C to continue discussions about a potential acquisition of
Exar by Company C.

In late March 2016, from time-to-time, representatives of Exar and E-Town discussed the potential of re-starting discussions for the
acquisition by E-Town of the iML business. In early April 2016, Exar and E-Town agreed to continue discussions based on E-Town’s
confirmation that its offer price was increased from its most recent offer and was substantially in line with its original offer of $140
million. From time-to-time in April and May 2016, Exar management and representatives of Cowen continued discussions, on a non-
exclusive basis, with E-Town regarding the potential purchase of the iML business by E-Town from Exar.

On May 16, 2016, Exar management and representatives from Cowen met with representatives of another company to discuss a
potential acquisition of Exar. This company decided not to pursue discussions with Exar.

On May 20, 2016, Company C submitted a nonbinding letter of intent to acquire Exar for between $7.00 and $8.00 per Share. On this
date, the closing price of the Shares on the NYSE was $6.39 per share. Mr. Leza informed the Exar Board of the letter of intent and
confirmed that Exar would engage with Company C in an attempt to improve the offer terms and obtain more information about
regulatory approval requirements and financing of the transaction.

On May 22, 2016, Company C submitted an updated nonbinding letter of intent to acquire Exar, and increased their offer price to a
range of $7.50 and $8.50 per Share. Mr. Leza informed the Exar Board of the letter of intent and confirmed that Exar would continue to
engage with Company C in an attempt to improve offer terms and obtain more information about regulatory approval requirements and
financing of the transaction.

Between May 20, 2016 and May 27, 2016, strategic discussions continued between Exar and Company C for the acquisition of Exar
and between Exar and E-Town for the purchase by E-Town of the iML business.

On May 27, 2016, the Exar Board met, with representatives from Cowen and Pillsbury in attendance, to discuss the current status of
the Board’s review of strategic alternatives and, in particular, to discuss the current nonbinding offer from E-Town to purchase the iML
business and the current nonbinding offer from Company C to acquire Exar. The representative from Pillsbury discussed the Board’s
fiduciary duties in this context and reviewed in detail the current terms of the proposed definitive share purchase agreement to sell iML
to E-Town. The Exar Board discussed with the representatives from Cowen the financial terms of the current nonbinding offer from E-
Town and the current nonbinding offer from Company C. The Exar Board instructed Exar management to continue to discuss and
negotiate a definitive sale agreement with E-Town pursuant to which Exar would sell its iML business to E-Town. At the same time,
the Exar Board instructed Exar management to negotiate with Company C to see if Company C would increase its offer price.

On May 27, 2016, Mr. Leza met with Company C’s chief executive officer to continue discussions about a potential acquisition of Exar
by Company C and to negotiate terms of Company’s C offer to acquire Exar.

On May 31, 2016, the Exar Board appointed Mr. Leza as the Executive Chairman and Technology Advisor. Concurrently, the Exar
Board appointed Mr. Benton as Exar’s Chief Executive Officer and a member of the Exar Board.

On May 31, 2016, the Exar Board met, with representatives of Cowen and Pillsbury in attendance, to discuss a proposed definitive
agreement with E-Town pursuant to which E-Town would purchase the iML business from Exar for $136 million in cash, subject to
certain adjustments. The Exar Board discussed the current status of discussions with Company C, which had refused to increase its
most recent offer price of between $7.50 and $8.50 per Share. The Exar Board provided direction on the remaining open issues in the
iML transaction.

On June 1, 2016, the Exar Board met, with representatives from Cowen and Pillsbury in attendance, to discuss the proposed transaction
with E-Town. The representatives from Pillsbury reported on the key terms of the proposed definitive agreement with E-Town,
including the purchase price adjustment mechanisms as well as the indemnification and escrow provisions, and discussed the Exar
Board’s fiduciary duties in this context. The Exar Board then discussed with the representatives of Cowen the financial terms of the
proposed transaction with E-Town. The Exar Board discussed the relative positive and negative aspects of divesting the iML business.
After discussion, the Exar Board approved the sale of the iML business to E-Town and authorized the Company to enter into the
definitive share purchase agreement with E-Town and directed Mr. Leza to continue to negotiate with Company C.

On June 1, 2016, Exar entered into the Share Purchase Agreement (the “iML Agreement”) with Beijing E-Town Chipone Technology
Co., Ltd., a limited liability company of the People’s Republic of China formed by E-Town Beijing and Chipone, for the sale of Exar’s
iML business to E-Town for $136 million in cash, as adjusted for iML’s cash and debt at closing and other adjustments related to iML’s
working capital balance as of the closing of the transaction. Under the terms of the iML Agreement, Exar was allowed to discuss,
negotiate, enter a definitive agreement for and consummate a sale of the entire company; provided that any of the assets being sold and
transferred under the iML Agreement were excluded from such discussions and from any such transaction, and if such a transaction
was consummated prior to the closing of the sale of iML to E-Town, as a condition to the consummation of any such other transaction,
the iML Agreement and the obligations of Exar under the iML Agreement was required to be expressly assumed in their entirety by the
other party to the other transaction.

On June 10, 2016, Mr. Leza notified the Exar Board that he had decided not to stand for re-election to the Board at Exar’s annual
meeting of stockholders for 2016 and to resign as a director, Executive Chairman and the Chairman of the Board, effective June 30,
2016.

On June 13, 2016, Company C submitted a nonbinding letter of intent to acquire Exar for $450 million, which implied a price per
Share of approximately $9.04. The transaction was not subject to a financing condition, but Company C would be required to obtain
financing in order to fund the full purchase price, and was subject to several regulatory approvals. On June 13, 2016, the closing price
of the Shares on the NYSE was $7.99 per share. It was not clear whether Company C intended to include certain assets associated with
the iML business in this offer. Exar management subsequently informed Company C that such a transaction must necessarily exclude
all the assets being conveyed to E-Town under the iML Agreement.

On June 15, 2016, Mr. Benton spoke with a representative of Company C to discuss the potential acquisition of Exar by Company C.

On June 16, 2016, a representative from Company C emailed Behrooz Abdi, an independent director on the Exar Board, re-enforcing
Company C’s desire to acquire Exar.

On June 16, 2016, the Exar Board met, with a representative from Pillsbury in attendance, to discuss among other items, the current
status of strategic discussions with various parties. The Exar Board determined to reconstitute the Special Committee of the Board to
provide more active oversight of these strategic discussions. As reconstituted, the members of the Special Committee were Mr. Meyers,
Mr. Benton and Mr. Abdi. The Exar Board also discussed the standalone operations of Exar and, with input from Mr. Benton and in
light of the pending divestiture of iML, initiatives to focus Exar’s business on higher-margin advanced products for tier-1 customer
engagements and to shift Exar’s supply chain to lower cost regions with the objective of improving the operating results of the
business. The Exar Board believed these initiatives could lead to increased stockholder value either through sustained standalone
operations or ultimately as a result of the recognition of these initiatives in an increased purchase price in a sale of the Company.

On June 18, 2016, Mr. Benton spoke with a representative of Company C to discuss the potential acquisition of Exar by Company C.
Mr. Benton informed Company C that the Exar Board had not approved moving forward in discussions with Company C based on its
most recent nonbinding letter of intent and that more information about Company C’s financing plans needed to be provided to Exar.

On June 23, 2016, representatives from Cowen, at the direction of Exar management, met with Company C’s chief executive officer to
discuss Company C’s letter of intent and to further understand how Company C intended to finance the transaction.

On June 29, 2016, Exar management met with Company C to further discuss a potential acquisition of Exar by Company C.

On July 1, 2016, Exar management met with Company C’s chief executive officer to continue Company C’s due diligence and to
further discuss a potential acquisition of Exar, excluding the iML business, by Company C.

On July 9, 2016, Mr. Benton met with Company C’s chief executive officer to continue Company C’s due diligence and to further
discuss a potential acquisition of Exar, excluding the iML business, by Company C. During this meeting, Company C’s chief executive
officer indicated that Company C intended to submit a revised letter of intent.

On July 12, 2016, Mr. Benton sent Company C’s chief executive officer a form of letter of intent inviting Company C to make an offer
to purchase Exar.

Company C, ultimately, did not submit an updated letter of intent.

On September 8, 2016, the Exar Board appointed Gary Meyers to serve as the Chairman of the Exar Board.

On November 9, 2016, Exar completed its sale to E-Town of the iML business for cash paid at closing of $144.5 million, which
included $15.0 million for iML’s cash transferred at closing, was net of $1.5 million for fluctuations in iML working capital, and
excluded $5.0 million which was placed in escrow subject to customary adjustments after the closing.

On November 10, 2016, MaxLinear’s chief executive officer, Kishore Seendripu emailed Mr. Benton indicating an interest in exploring
a potential acquisition of Exar. Later that day, Dr. Seendripu and Mr. Benton spoke to discuss a potential acquisition of Exar.

On November 21, 2016, Exar executed a non-disclosure agreement with MaxLinear. This non-disclosure agreement contained
standstill provisions that automatically terminated if Exar entered into an agreement with another party providing for the acquisition of
Exar.

On November 21, 2016, Exar’s management and its Chairman of the Board, Mr. Meyers, met with Dr. Seendripu and other members of
MaxLinear’s management team to discuss a potential acquisition of Exar.

On November 22, 2016, Simcoe, Jeffrey Jacobowitz, its Managing Member, and certain other affiliates filed a Schedule 13D reporting
ownership of 5.2% of the outstanding Shares. In its Schedule 13D, Simcoe reported that it had engaged and expected to continue to
engage in communications with Exar management and the Exar Board regarding voluntarily adding an independent stockholder
representative to the Exar Board. Simcoe also noted that depending on various factors including, without limitation, Exar’s financial
position and investment strategy, the price levels of the Shares, conditions in the securities markets and general economic and industry
conditions, it may in the future take such actions with respect to its investment in Exar as it deemed appropriate including, without
limitation continuing to engage in communications with Exar management and the Exar Board, engaging in discussions with
stockholders of Exar or other third parties about Exar and Simcoe’s investment, including potential business combinations or
dispositions involving Exar or certain of its businesses, making recommendations or proposals to Exar concerning changes to the
capitalization, ownership structure, board structure, potential business combinations or dispositions involving Exar or certain of its
businesses, or making suggestions for improving Exar’s financial and/or operational performance, purchasing additional Shares, selling
some or all of Simcoe’s Shares, or engaging in short selling of or any hedging or similar transaction with respect to Shares, including
swaps and other derivative instruments.

From December 2016 to February 5, 2017, from time-to-time, the Exar Board engaged in discussions with Mr. Jacobowitz regarding
his potential appointment to serve on the Exar Board.

On December 2, 2016, Mr. Benton spoke with representatives of MaxLinear to discuss a potential acquisition of Exar by MaxLinear,
including the process and timing for MaxLinear’s evaluation of the potential transaction.

On December 8, 2016, Mr. Benton met in person with Company D’s chief executive officer and discussed the respective businesses of
Exar and Company D.

From November 2016 to early February 2017, representatives from Exar and MaxLinear held follow-up meetings to discuss Exar’s
business and a potential acquisition of Exar, and Exar provided diligence materials to MaxLinear.

On January 23, 2017, Exar and MaxLinear management teams met in person to discuss Exar’s business.

On February 1, 2017, Mr. Benton spoke with Dr. Seendripu to discuss moving forward with a transaction between Exar and
MaxLinear. Dr. Seendripu indicated that MaxLinear intended to engage a financial advisor to assist it with its evaluation of an
acquisition of Exar. Mr. Benton and Dr. Seendripu spoke again on February 2, 2017 to discuss timing and a process to move forward in
discussions.

On February 7, 2017, representatives from Exar and MaxLinear and each of their financial advisors met to discuss a process for the
parties to continue to explore a potential acquisition of Exar.

On February 7, 2017, the Exar Board met, with a representative of Pillsbury in attendance, to discuss, among other items, the
appointment of Mr. Jacobowitz to serve on the Exar Board. The Exar Board then met in executive session outside the presence of
Mr. Benton and other members of management to discuss management as well as the appointment of Mr. Jacobowitz. After Mr. Benton
rejoined the meeting, the Exar Board discussed the re-engagement of Cowen to serve as Exar’s financial advisor, because the prior
engagement term with Cowen had expired. Prior to approving the re-engagement of Cowen, the Exar Board reviewed information
received from Cowen regarding Cowen’s relationships with the eight potential transaction counterparties that had been identified by the
Exar Board as being the parties that Exar would most likely approach in a strategic process, including MaxLinear, and confirmed that
Cowen had no conflicts of interest that would preclude Cowen from serving as Exar’s financial advisor. The Exar Board approved the
re-engagement of Cowen, and following the meeting on February 7, 2017, Exar re-engaged Cowen to serve as its financial advisor.

On February 7, 2017, the Exar Board appointed Mr. Jacobowitz to the Exar Board, which appointment became effective immediately
following the execution of a board appointment letter agreement, which provided among other terms, certain voting agreements and
additional covenants by and among Exar, Mr. Jacobowitz and Simcoe. These agreements and covenants were unrelated to a potential
sale of Exar. On February 8, 2017, the letter agreement was executed, and Mr. Jacobowitz became a member of the Exar Board.
Mr. Jacobowitz participated in the Exar Board meeting on February 8, 2017.

On February 8, 2017, the Exar Board met, with representatives of Pillsbury in attendance for portions of the meeting, to discuss, among
other items, the current status of discussions with MaxLinear and the current status of Exar’s business, operations and financial
condition. The Exar Board discussed the status of Exar’s execution of its objectives to focus on advanced products and to shift its
supply chain to lower cost regions. The Exar Board also considered various alternatives in deploying Exar’s cash resources to increase
stockholder value, such as the execution of a stock repurchase program, an issuer self-tender and other programs designed to increase
stockholder value.

On February 10, 2017, MaxLinear submitted a nonbinding letter of intent to acquire Exar in an all-cash transaction at $12.50 per Share.
The transaction was not subject to a financing condition, but it was noted that MaxLinear would be required to seek financing in order
to partially fund the purchase price. The closing price of the Shares on February 10, 2017 on the NYSE was $10.92 per share.

On February 11, 2017, Cowen and MaxLinear’s financial advisor, Stifel, Nicolaus, & Company, Inc. (“Stifel”), met telephonically to
discuss MaxLinear’s nonbinding letter of intent.

On February 12, 2017, the Exar Board met, with representatives of Cowen and Pillsbury in attendance, to discuss MaxLinear’s letter of
intent and a potential response. Exar management reviewed a five-year financial forecast for Exar, a copy of which had been previously
provided to the Exar Board, and discussed the significant assumptions underlying the forecasts. The Exar Board discussed the five-year
forecast, including a discussion of the potential impact to the forecasts if Exar executed a significant stock repurchase program, and the
resulting leverage on Exar’s earnings per share following such a repurchase program. After this discussion, the Exar Board adopted the
five-year forecast, which Exar management later provided to Cowen and to MaxLinear. This five-year financial forecast is discussed in
more detail below in Item 4 — The Solicitation or Recommendation —Certain Prospective Financial Information. Representatives
from Cowen reviewed with the Exar Board a preliminary financial analysis of MaxLinear’s proposed purchase price of $12.50 per
Share. Representatives from Pillsbury provided advice on the Board’s fiduciary duties in evaluating the offer from MaxLinear and in
further exploring other strategic alternatives. The Exar Board directed Cowen to contact eight additional parties, all of which had been
previously contacted in regards to a potential acquisition of Exar, including Company A, Company B, and Company D. In determining
these additional parties, the Exar Board considered all the parties previously contacted by Exar and the prior feedback from these
parties, as well as potential new parties that could be contacted. These eight parties were selected by the Exar Board as the parties most
likely to be interested in, and have the financial capacity to enter into, a transaction with Exar at a value that was at least equivalent to
the value offered by MaxLinear and with an ability to consummate a transaction on a timeline and with regulatory risk substantially
comparable to MaxLinear. The Exar Board further directed Exar management, with the assistance of Cowen, to negotiate the letter of
intent with MaxLinear and seek a higher offer price. The Exar Board then met in executive session outside the presence of Mr. Benton
and other members of management to discuss, among other items, the strategic discussions with MaxLinear and management’s role in
these discussions.

On February 12, 2017, Mr. Benton spoke with Dr. Seendripu and informed him that the Exar Board was interested in moving forward
in discussions with MaxLinear, but at a higher price per share. Mr. Benton and Dr. Seendripu agreed to an in-person meeting to discuss
a potential transaction.

Between February 12, 2017 and February 18, 2017, representatives from Cowen contacted the eight parties identified by the Exar
Board to determine if any of these parties were interested in re-engaging with Exar about a potential acquisition.

On February 15, 2017, Exar sent a counter-proposal to MaxLinear making certain changes to the letter of intent, including increasing
the proposed purchase price to $13.56 per Share.

On February 15, 2017, representatives of Exar (including its Chairman, Mr. Meyers) and Cowen met with representatives of
MaxLinear and MaxLinear’s financial advisor, Stifel, in person to discuss Exar’s counter-proposal. At that time, Exar and MaxLinear
reached preliminary agreement on moving forward in discussions based upon a nonbinding all-cash offer of $13.00 per Share. In
exchange for an increase in the proposed nonbinding offer price per Share, Exar and MaxLinear also reached preliminary agreement on
moving forward in discussions based on a transaction that would include a break-up fee equal to 3.5% of the equity value of Exar, plus
reimbursement of MaxLinear’s out-of-pocket and documented expenses of up to $3.0 million.

On February 16, 2017, the Exar Board met, with representatives of Cowen and Pillsbury in attendance, to discuss the status of
discussions with MaxLinear, the market outreach conducted by Exar management and Cowen, and Cowen’s preliminary financial
analysis of MaxLinear’s proposed purchase price of $13.00 per Share. The Exar Board directed management to move forward in
discussions with MaxLinear and to agree, subject to further approval by the Exar Board, to a limited period of exclusivity with
MaxLinear to allow MaxLinear to conduct due diligence and to negotiate definitive documentation. The Exar Board then met in
executive session outside the presence of Mr. Benton and other members of management to discuss, among other items, the process
with MaxLinear.

From February 16, 2017 to February 18, 2017, Exar management, with assistance from Cowen and Pillsbury, exchanged drafts of a
nonbinding letter of intent and exclusivity agreement with MaxLinear.

On February 18, 2017, the Exar Board met, with representatives of Cowen and Pillsbury in attendance, to discuss the status of
discussions with MaxLinear and the market outreach conducted by Cowen. Representatives from Cowen confirmed that none of the
other eight parties that had been contacted since the February 8, 2017 meeting of the Exar Board were interested in moving forward in
discussions to acquire Exar at this time, except for one party who indicated they may be interested at a price per Share that was lower
than that currently being offered by MaxLinear and another party who had not yet responded. Representatives from Pillsbury advised
the Exar Board on its fiduciary duties in determining whether to enter into an exclusivity arrangement with MaxLinear to continue to
discuss a potential sale of Exar to MaxLinear. The Exar Board then discussed, among other factors, the risks and benefits of Exar
continuing to execute a standalone strategy by looking at current performance, the outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year and
long-term trends in Exar’s industry. The Exar Board also considered various alternatives in deploying Exar’s cash resources to increase
stockholder value, such as execution of a stock repurchase program, an issuer self-tender and other programs designed to increase
stockholder value. The Exar Board considered the progress made to date on its strategy to focus its business on advanced products and
to shift its supply chain to lower cost regions, and the potential continued increase in stockholder value, particularly when combined
with the deployment of the Company’s cash resources through a stock repurchase program or similar transaction. The Exar Board also
considered the risks associated with continuing to operate as a standalone company, including increased competition from large
competitors with greater scale and resources, the risks that Exar’s product and sales strategies would not be successful and result in
increased revenue and other risks associated with the business. The Board also considered the potential to negotiate a higher price from
MaxLinear or seek a better offer from an alternative party. The Exar Board then met in executive session outside the presence of
Mr. Benton and other members of management to discuss, among other items, management and the status of discussions with
MaxLinear. After Mr. Benton re-joined the meeting and further discussion, the Exar Board authorized management to enter into an
exclusivity agreement with MaxLinear providing for a 30-day period in which Exar would negotiate exclusively with MaxLinear on
the basis of a $13.00 per Share all-cash offer.

On February 19, 2017, Exar executed an exclusivity agreement with MaxLinear for a 30-day period and the parties finalized a
nonbinding letter of intent which the parties would use as the basis for negotiating definitive agreements for the acquisition of Exar at
an all-cash purchase price of $13.00 per Share.

Commencing on February 21, 2017, MaxLinear commenced a due diligence review of Exar. Exar provided extensive documentation
and information by way of an electronic data room (the “Data Room”), several in-person management meetings and the exchange of
correspondence providing diligence materials and responding to questions from MaxLinear.

price of $13.00 per Share. The Special Committee provided a report to the Exar Board about its deliberations and review of the Merger
Agreement with Exar’s financial and legal advisors. The Exar Board then discussed the standalone prospects of Exar, the potential uses

Board its fiduciary duties in the context of a potential sale transaction. Representatives from Cowen reviewed with the Board its
financial analysis of MaxLinear’s proposed all-cash offer of $13.00 per Share and responded to questions from members of the Board
regarding its financial analysis. Cowen then delivered its opinion to the Exar Board to the effect that, as of March 28, 2017, and subject
to the various assumptions and limitations set forth in its opinion, the consideration of $13.00 per Share to be received by the
stockholders of Exar in the Offer and the Merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to such stockholders. Representatives from
Pillsbury reviewed with the Board changes to the Merger Agreement from the version sent to the Board in advance of the prior meeting
and responded to questions. The Board then discussed its reasons for the approval of the transaction with MaxLinear. The non-
employee directors then held an executive session outside the presence of management to discuss, among other items, the proposed
transaction with MaxLinear. After this discussion, management rejoined the meeting. Pillsbury then reviewed and discussed with the
Board the proposed resolutions approving the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Offer and
the Merger. After further discussion, for the reasons more fully described below in Item 4. The Solicitation or
Recommendation — Reasons for Recommendation,” the Board unanimously (i) determined that the transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement, including the Offer and the Merger, and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, are at a
price and on terms that are fair to, and in the best interests of Exar and its stockholders (including the unaffiliated stockholders),
(ii) approved and declared advisable the Support Agreements, the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby,
including the Offer and the Merger and (iii) recommended that the stockholders accept the Offer and tender their Shares to Purchaser in
the Offer and, to the extent applicable, approve and adopt the Merger Agreement and the Merger.

On March 28, 2017, the parties executed the Merger Agreement and Simcoe, Alonim, each director and certain officers of Exar entered
into Support Agreements.

On March 29, 2017, Exar and MaxLinear issued a joint press release announcing the execution of the Merger Agreement and the
Support Agreements.

Reasons for Recommendation

The Offer and the Merger are expected to result in benefits to all stockholders. In evaluating the Offer, the Merger and the Merger
Agreement, the Company Board consulted with Exar’s management and its legal and financial advisors. In reaching its decision that
the Offer and the Merger are advisable, and in reaching its recommendation that the stockholders tender their Shares in the Offer, the
Company Board considered a number of factors, including the following material factors, which the Company Board viewed as
supporting its recommendation:
 

 

•  the fact that the Offer Price of $13.00 per Share in cash represented a significant premium over current market prices.
Specifically, the Board noted that the $13.00 price to be paid for each Share represented 24% premium over the closing price
of the Shares on March 27, 2017, the last full trading day before the Offer and the Merger were approved by the Company
Board, a 43% premium over the implied enterprise value of Exar based on the closing price of the Shares on March 27,
2017, a 20% premium over the spot price of the Shares on February 27, 2017, a 16% and 152% premium over the 52-week
high and low trading price of the Shares during the 52-week period ending on March 27, 2017, respectively, and a 47%
premium over the average closing price of the Shares of $8.83 per Share during the 52-week period ending on March 27,
2017;

 

 

•  the consideration of the potential benefits, after a thorough, independent review of strategic alternatives, including the
feedback from alternative potential acquirers contacted in the Company Board’s most recent market outreach following the
initial interest from Parent, of further exploring business combination transactions with alternative potential acquirers and
the likelihood that any such parties would engage in a business combination transaction with the Company on the same or
similar time frame as Parent, and with a value and contractual terms and conditions superior to those contained in the
Merger Agreement; and based on the value, timing, risk allocation and other terms and conditions negotiated with Parent,
the determination that the Transactions are more favorable to the Company’s stockholders than any other strategic
transaction reasonably available to the Company;

 

 

•  the anticipated timing of the consummation of the Offer and the Merger, and the structure of the Transactions as a tender
offer for the Shares, which, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the applicable conditions set forth in the Merger
Agreement, should allow stockholders to receive the consideration for their Shares in a relatively short time frame, followed
by the Merger in which stockholders who do not validly exercise appraisal rights will receive the same consideration as
received by those stockholders who tender their Shares in the Offer;

 

 

•  the Board’s assessment, after discussions with Exar management and advisors, of the risks of remaining an independent
company and pursuing Exar’s business objectives, including its initiatives to focus Exar’s business on higher-margin
advanced products for tier-1 customer engagements and to shift Exar’s supply chain to lower cost regions with the objective
of improving the operating results of the business, including the risks (such risks are not intended to be exhaustive) relating
to:

 

 
○  competing against larger or more diversified companies with substantially greater financial resources and capacity to

invest in the development and marketing of new products and technologies;
 

 
○  continuing uncertainty in macro-economic conditions in the United States and around the world, and the potential

impact of these conditions on the Company’s business and prospects as an independent company; and
 

 
○  the risks and uncertainties with respect to the ability to remain competitive in the consolidating semiconductor

industry, and the “risk factors” set forth in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
March 27, 2016.

 •  the attractiveness and strategic fit of Parent as a potential merger partner;
 

 
•  the conditions to the Offer and the Merger, which are limited in number and scope, and that, in the case of the condition

related to the accuracy of the Company’s representations and warranties, are generally subject to a “material adverse effect”
qualification, except in the case of certain specific representations;

 

 •  the likelihood of obtaining required regulatory approval for the Transactions with Parent;
 

 
•  the fact that Parent is required to extend the Offer, subject to certain exceptions, until the time that the conditions to the Offer

have been satisfied;
 

 

•  the financial analyses presented to the Company Board by Cowen with respect to the Offer and the Merger and the opinion
of Cowen to the Company Board, to the effect that, as of March 28, 2017, and subject to the various assumptions and
limitations set forth therein, the consideration of $13.00 per Share to be received by the stockholders of the Company in the
Offer and the Merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to such stockholders. See “— Opinion of Cowen and
Company, LLC”;

 

 

•  the ability of the Company, under certain circumstances, to consider and respond to a superior proposal for an acquisition
transaction from a third party prior to the acceptance of the Shares by Purchaser, and the Company Board’s right, after
complying with the terms of the Merger Agreement, to terminate the Merger Agreement in order to enter into an agreement
with respect to a superior proposal, upon payment of a termination fee of $24.8 million to Parent, in addition to up to $3.0
million for documented out-of-pocket expenses of Parent; and

 

 
•  the availability of appraisal rights under the DGCL to Company stockholders who do not tender their Shares in the Offer and

comply with all of the required procedures for perfecting appraisal rights under the DGCL.

The Company Board also considered potentially negative factors concerning the Offer, the Merger and the Merger Agreement,
including the following:
 

 

•  the stockholders of the Company will receive the Offer Price in cash and will no longer have the opportunity to participate in
any future earnings or growth of the Company or the combined company or benefit from any potential future appreciation in
the value of the Shares, including any value that could be achieved if the Company engages in future strategic or other
transactions;

 

 •  the all-cash consideration in the Offer and the Merger generally would be taxable to the holders of Shares;
 

 

•  there will be risks and costs to the Company if the Offer does not close, including the diversion of management and
employee attention away from the day-to-day operations of the Company, employee attrition, the effect on the Company’s
relationships with customers, partners and others that do business with the Company and the operational restrictions
imposed on the Company pursuant to the Merger Agreement between signing and the Merger Closing, among other
potential negative effects on the Company if the Offer is not completed;

 

 
•  as a result of the terms of their employment agreements and equity awards, certain of the Company’s executive officers may

receive other payments in connection with or following the Transactions;
 

 
•  the Merger Agreement provides for a termination fee of $24.8 million that would become payable by the Company under

certain circumstances, including if the Company terminates the Merger Agreement to accept a superior proposal, in addition
to up to $3.0 million for documented out-of-pocket expenses of Parent; and

 

 
•  the Merger Agreement restricts the Company’s ability to solicit competing proposals, subject to certain exceptions to allow

the Company Board to exercise its fiduciary duties.

The foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by the Company Board is intended to be illustrative and not
exhaustive, but includes the material reasons and factors considered. In view of the wide variety of reasons and factors considered, the
Company Board did not find it practical to, and did not, quantify or otherwise assign relative weights to the specified factors
considered in reaching its determinations or the reasons for such determinations. Individual directors may have given differing weights
to different factors or may have had different reasons for their ultimate determination. In addition, the Company Board did not reach
any specific conclusion with respect to any of the factors or reasons considered. Instead, the Company Board conducted an overall
analysis of the factors and reasons described above and determined that, in the aggregate, the potential benefits considered outweighed
the potential risks or possible negative consequences of the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement.

Intent to Tender

To Exar’s knowledge, after making reasonable inquiry, all of its executive officers and directors currently intend to tender or cause to
be tendered pursuant to the Offer all Shares held of record or beneficially owned by such persons or entity immediately prior to the
expiration of the Offer, as it may be extended (other than Shares for which such holder does not have discretionary authority). The
foregoing does not include any Shares over which, or with respect to which, any such executive officer or director acts in a fiduciary or
representative capacity or is subject to the instructions of a third party with respect to such tender. In addition, the directors and the
executive officers of the Company have entered into Support Agreement, as further described in “Item 3. Past Contracts, Transactions,
Negotiations and Agreements — Arrangements with Parent and Purchaser and thier Affiliates” and is incorporated herein by reference.

Certain Prospective Financial Information

Exar’s management does not, as a matter of course, make detailed or long term public forecasts or projections as to its future financial
performance due to the unpredictability of the underlying assumptions and estimates. However, Exar’s management regularly prepared
internal forecasts and projections for use by the Company Board and management for planning and decision-making purposes. In
addition, in connection with the strategic process, including, without limitation, the due diligence process and evaluation of the Offer,
the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger, as described in this
Schedule 14D-9, Exar’s management prepared financial projections for fiscal years 2017 through 2022, including one set with certain
Non-GAAP gross profit, net income and earnings per share (the “Non-GAAP Projections”) and a second set of financial projections for
fiscal years 2017 through 2022 (the “GAAP Projections” and collectively with the Non-GAAP Projections, the “Projections”). Exar’s
fiscal year ends on a Sunday between March 27 and April 3. Exar’s fiscal years typically consist of 52 weeks, however, every fifth year
has 53 weeks. In a 52-week year, each fiscal quarter consists of 13 weeks. Fiscal years 2017 and 2016 consisted of 53 and 52 weeks,
respectively. In fiscal year 2017, the first fiscal quarter consists of 14 weeks and the remaining three fiscal quarters consist of 13 weeks.

The Projections were developed from historical financial statements and a series of assumptions and estimates of management related
to future trends and did not give effect to any changes or expenses as a result of the Offer, the Merger Agreement or the Merger or any
other effects of such terms. Projections were prepared by Exar’s management for internal use and were not prepared with a view
toward public disclosure, except to the parties identified above, nor were they prepared with a view toward compliance with published
guidelines of the SEC, the guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation and
presentation of financial forecasts or, in the case of the Non-GAAP Projections, generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”).
The Non-GAAP Projections do not comply with GAAP. No independent registered public accounting firm, has examined, compiled,
nor performed any procedures with respect to any of the accompanying projected financial information.

9/7/2019 SC 14D9

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/753568/000119312517122031/d356341dsc14d9.htm 38/72

The Company Board and management instructed Cowen to use and rely on the Non-GAAP Projections as the basis for its analyses in
rendering its opinion described in more detail below in “— Opinion of Cowen and Company, LLC”. The Non-GAAP Projections were
also provided to the Company Board, Stifel, and Parent in preparation for their respective analyses and evaluations of Exar and its
businesses. In the due diligence process, Company management provided Cowen, Stifel and the Parent the GAAP Projections. To give
Exar stockholders access to certain nonpublic information that was available to Parent and the Company Board at the time of the
evaluation of the Offer, the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger,
Exar’s management has included these projections below, as well as a reconciliation of the Non-GAAP Projections with the GAAP
Projections, where applicable.

Exar’s future financial results may materially differ from those expressed in the Projections due to factors that are beyond
management’s ability to control or predict. Exar cannot guarantee that any of these Projections will be realized or that its future
financial results will not materially vary from the Projections. Important factors may affect actual results and results of Exar’s
operations, or could lead to the Projections not being achieved including those factors that are described in the “Risk Factors” section
of Exar’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 27, 2016, and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the fiscal
quarter ended July 3, 2016 and January 1, 2017, as filed with the SEC. The assumptions upon which the Projections were based
necessarily involve judgments with respect to, among other things, future economic, competitive and regulatory conditions, financial
market conditions and conditions in the industries in which Exar operates, all of which are difficult or impossible to predict accurately
and many of which are beyond the control of Exar and its management. The Projections also reflect assumptions as to certain business
decisions that are subject to change. In addition, the Projections do not take into account any circumstances or events occurring after
the date they were prepared, including the March 29, 2017 announcement of the parties’ entry into the Merger Agreement or
subsequent integration planning activities or any effect of any failure of the Merger to occur. The Projections should not be used as
public guidance and will not be provided in the ordinary course of Exar’s business in the future.

The Projections are not being included in this Schedule 14D-9 to influence the decision of any Exar stockholder whether to tender
Shares in the Offer. The information from the Projections should be evaluated, if at all, in conjunction with the historical financial
statements and other information regarding Exar contained in Exar’s filings with the SEC. In light of the foregoing factors and the
uncertainties inherent in the Projections, stockholders are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the Projections included in this
Schedule 14D-9, including in making a decision as to whether to tender their Shares in the Offer, should not be regarded as a
representation or guarantee that the targets will be achieved or have been achieved and that they should not rely on the Projections.

The Projections are forward-looking statements and are qualified in their entirety by risks and uncertainties that could result in the
Projections not being achieved, including, but not limited to, the risks and uncertainties contained in Exar’s filings with the SEC,
including its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 27, 2016 and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters
ended July 3, 2016 and January 1, 2017 or otherwise described herein. Neither Exar nor Parent, or any of their respective affiliates,
advisors, officers, directors or representatives, has made or makes any representation to any Exar stockholder or other person, including
Parent or Purchaser, regarding the ultimate performance of Exar compared to the information contained in the Projections or that the
Projections will be achieved. Please refer to the section entitled “Forward-Looking Statements” under “Item 8 —Additional
Information.”

Notes:
 

(1) All results presented are continuing operations, and thus exclude the financial results from discontinued operations of the iML
Display business (including the gain recognized from the sale), which the Company has divested.

(2) Other adjustments include gain upon closing sale-leaseback of our corporate headquarters, impairment charges, merger and
acquisition and related integration costs, restructuring charges and exit costs which include costs for personnel whose positions
have been eliminated as part of a restructuring or are in the process of being eliminated as part of the discontinued operations,
certain income tax benefits and credits, and related income tax effects on certain excluded items.

(3) Unlevered free cash flow as used in these Projections represents Adjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP), less cash paid for taxes, less
capital expenditures, less increases in net working capital. Cash paid for taxes assumes sufficient United States federal (estimated
by Exar at more than $250 million as of December 31, 2016) and California state (estimated by Exar at more than $50 million as
of March 31, 2017) net operating losses and tax credits available after the impact of IRS Section 382 limitations (but before
giving effect to the Offer and the Merger).

Opinion of Cowen and Company, LLC

The Company retained Cowen to act its financial advisor in connection with its review of strategic alternatives, including a possible
sale of, or other business combination involving, the Company, such as the Offer and the Merger, and to render an opinion to the
Company Board as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the consideration of $13.00 per Share to be received by the holders
of the Shares in the Offer and the Merger.

On March 28, 2017, Cowen delivered its opinion to the Company Board, to the effect that, as of that date, and subject to the various
assumptions and limitations set forth therein, the consideration of $13.00 per Share to be received by the stockholders of the Company
in the Offer and the Merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to such stockholders. The full text of the written opinion of
Cowen, dated March 28, 2017, is attached as Annex I hereto and is incorporated by reference. The Company encourages
holders of the Shares to read the opinion in its entirety for the assumptions made, procedures followed, other matters
considered and limits of the review by Cowen. The summary of the written opinion of Cowen set forth herein is qualified in its
entirety by reference to the full text of such opinion. Cowen’s analyses and opinion were prepared for and addressed to the
Company Board and are directed only to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the consideration of $13.00 per Share to
be received by the stockholders of the Company in the Offer and the Merger. Cowen’s opinion is not a recommendation to any
stockholder or any other person as to whether such stockholder or such person should tender Shares in the Offer or take any
other action in connection with the Offer and the Merger or otherwise.

In arriving at its opinion, Cowen reviewed and considered such financial and other matters as it deemed relevant, including, among
other things:
 

 •  a draft of the Merger Agreement dated March 28, 2017;
 

 
•  certain publicly available financial and other information for the Company and certain other relevant financial and operating

data furnished to Cowen by the management of the Company, including certain unaudited pro forma historical financial
information concerning the Company;

 

 
•  certain internal financial analyses, financial forecasts, reports and other information concerning the Company prepared by

the management of the Company (referred to in this section as the “Company Forecasts”);
 

 
•  discussions Cowen had with certain members of the management of the Company concerning the historical and current

business operations, financial condition and prospects of the Company and such other matters Cowen deemed relevant;
 

 
•  certain operating results of the Company as compared to the operating results of certain publicly traded companies Cowen

deemed relevant;
 

 
•  the reported price and trading history of the Shares as compared to the reported price and trading histories of certain publicly

traded companies Cowen deemed relevant;
 

 
•  certain financial terms of the Offer and the Merger as compared to the financial terms of certain selected business

combinations Cowen deemed relevant; and
 

 
•  such other information, financial studies, analyses and investigations and such other factors that Cowen deemed relevant for

the purposes of its opinion.

In conducting its review and arriving at its opinion, Cowen, with the consent of the Company Board, assumed and relied, without
independent investigation, upon the accuracy and completeness of all financial and other information provided to it by the Company or
which was publicly available or was otherwise reviewed by Cowen. Cowen did not undertake any responsibility for the accuracy,
completeness or reasonableness of, or independent verification of, such information. Cowen relied upon, without independent
verification, the assessment of the management of the Company as to the existing products and services of the Company and the
 

39



9/7/2019 SC 14D9

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/753568/000119312517122031/d356341dsc14d9.htm 41/72

viability of, and risks associated with, the future products and services of the Company. In addition, Cowen did not conduct, or assume
any obligation to conduct, any physical inspection of the properties or facilities of the Company. Cowen further relied upon the
Company’s representation that all information provided to it by the Company was accurate and complete in all material respects.
Cowen, with the consent of the Company Board, assumed that the Company Forecasts were reasonably prepared by the management of
the Company on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and good faith judgments of such management as to the future
performance of the Company, and that such forecasts provided a reasonable basis for its opinion. Cowen expressed no opinion as to the
Company Forecasts or the assumptions on which they were made. Cowen expressly disclaimed any undertaking or obligation to advise
any person of any change in any fact or matter affecting its opinion of which Cowen became aware after the date of its opinion.

Cowen assumed that there were no material changes in the assets, liabilities, financial condition, results of operations, business or
prospects of the Company since the date of the last financial statements made available to Cowen. Cowen did not make or obtain any
independent evaluations, valuations or appraisals of the assets or liabilities of the Company, nor was Cowen furnished with such
materials. In addition, Cowen did not evaluate the solvency or fair value of the Company, MaxLinear or Purchaser under any state or
federal laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. Cowen’s opinion does not address any legal, tax or accounting
matters related to the Merger Agreement or the Offer and the Merger, as to which it assumed that the Company and the Company
Board have received such advice from legal, tax and accounting advisors as each has determined appropriate. Cowen’s opinion
addressed only the fairness of the consideration of $13.00 per Share, from a financial point of view, to the stockholders of the
Company. Cowen expressed no view as to any other aspect or implication of the Offer and the Merger or any other agreement,
arrangement or understanding entered into in connection with the Offer and the Merger or otherwise. Cowen’s opinion was necessarily
based upon economic and market conditions and other circumstances as they existed and could be evaluated by Cowen on the date of
its opinion. It should be understood that although subsequent developments may affect Cowen’s opinion, Cowen does not have any
obligation to update, revise or reaffirm its opinion and expressly disclaims any responsibility to do so. Cowen did not consider any
potential legislative or regulatory changes currently being considered or recently enacted by the United States or any foreign
government, or any domestic or foreign regulatory body, or any changes in accounting methods or generally accepted accounting
principles that may be adopted by the SEC, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or any similar foreign regulatory body or board.

For purposes of rendering its opinion, Cowen assumed, in all respects material to its analysis, that the representations and warranties of
each party contained in the Merger Agreement are true and correct, that each party will perform all of the covenants and agreements
required to be performed by it under the Merger Agreement and that all conditions to the consummation of the Offer and the Merger
will be satisfied without waiver thereof. Cowen assumed that the final form of the Merger Agreement would be substantially similar to
the last draft reviewed by Cowen. Cowen also assumed that all governmental, regulatory and other consents and approvals
contemplated by the Merger Agreement would be obtained and that in the course of obtaining any of those consents no restrictions
would be imposed or waivers made that would have an adverse effect on the contemplated benefits of the Offer and the Merger. Cowen
assumed that the Offer and the Merger will be consummated in a manner that complies with the applicable provisions of the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and all other applicable state or federal statutes, rules and
regulations.

Cowen’s opinion was intended for the benefit and use of the Company Board in its consideration of the financial terms of the Offer and
the Merger and may not be disclosed, referred to, or communicated (in whole or in part) to any third party for any purpose whatsoever
except with Cowen’s prior written approval. However, Cowen’s opinion may be reproduced in full in disclosure documents relating to
the Offer and the Merger which the Company is required to file under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, including this
Schedule 14D-9. Cowen’s opinion is not a recommendation to any stockholder of the Company or any other person as to whether such
person should tender his or her Shares in the Offer or to take any other action in connection with the Offer and the Merger or otherwise.
Cowen was not requested to opine as to, and its opinion does not in any

manner address, the Company’s underlying business decision to effect the Offer and the Merger or the relative merits of the Offer and
the Merger as compared to other business strategies or transactions that might be available to the Company. In addition, Cowen was not
asked to opine as to, and its opinion does not in any manner address, the fairness of the amount or nature of the compensation to any of
the Company’s officers, directors or employees, or class of such persons, relative to the compensation to the public stockholders of the
Company or whether MaxLinear has sufficient cash, available lines of credit or other sources of funds to enable it to pay the
consideration of $13.00 per Share.

Summary of Material Financial Analyses

The following is a summary of the material financial analyses performed by Cowen to arrive at its opinion. Some of the summaries of
financial analyses include information presented in tabular format. In order to fully understand the financial analyses, the tables must
be read together with the text of each summary. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the financial analyses.
Considering the data set forth in the tables without considering the full narrative description of the financial analyses, including the
methodologies and assumptions underlying the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the financial analyses.
Cowen performed certain procedures, including each of the financial analyses described below, and reviewed with the Company Board
and the management of the Company the assumptions on which such analyses were based and other factors, including the historical
and projected financial results of the Company. The Company’s historical financial results that were utilized in the financial analyses
summarized below were prepared on a pro forma basis for the Company’s divestiture of its iML subsidiary in November 2016.

Cowen also noted that the aggregate consideration to be received by the holders of the Shares in the Offer and the Merger based upon
the Offer Price of $13.00 per Share implied a premium of 43.4% to the Company’s Implied Enterprise Value (as defined below) on
March 27, 2017.

For informational purposes only, Cowen also reviewed four recently published, publicly available research analyst reports, including a
report published by Cowen. These research analyst reports set a mean 12-month undiscounted price target for the Company of $13.00
per Share, with a high of $14.00 per Share and a low of $12.00 per Share.

Analysis of Selected Publicly Traded Companies. To provide contextual data and comparative market information, Cowen compared
selected operating and financial data and multiples for the Company to the corresponding data and multiples of two sets of certain other
companies in the semiconductor industry (referred to in this section as the “Selected Large Cap Semiconductor Companies” and the
“Selected Small/Mid Cap Semiconductor Companies,” and collectively, the “Consolidated Selected Companies”) whose securities are
publicly traded and that Cowen believes in the exercise of its professional judgment to have one or more business or operating
characteristics, market valuations and trading valuations similar to what might be expected of the Company. The Selected Large Cap
Semiconductor Companies had market capitalizations greater than $5 billion and the Selected Small/Mid Cap Semiconductor
Companies had market capitalizations less than $5 billion. These companies were:

each of the Consolidated Selected Companies, as a multiple of revenue and as a multiple of earnings before interest expense,
income taxes, depreciation and amortization and excluding stock-based compensation and exceptional gains or charges from
unusual, discontinued or non-recurring activities (referred to in this section as “Adjusted EBITDA”), and

 

 
•  the current price per share of each of the Consolidated Selected Companies as a multiple of earnings per share excluding

stock-based compensation and exceptional gains or charges from unusual, discontinued or non-recurring activities (“Non-
GAAP EPS”),

in each case, calculated on a pro forma basis to exclude recent divestitures and/or acquisitions, on a historical basis where available, or
otherwise estimated for the Consolidated Selected Companies for calendar year 2016 (“CY2016”) and calendar year 2017 (“CY2017”)
from Capital IQ and Bloomberg where available, or otherwise from research analyst reports.

Based upon the information presented above, Cowen’s experience in the semiconductor industry and its professional judgment, Cowen
selected implied reference multiple ranges. The following table presents the implied value per Share based on the selected multiple
ranges and using the Company’s historical revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and Non-GAAP EPS for calendar year 2016 (“CY2016A”) and
the Company’s forecasted revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and Non-GAAP EPS for calendar year 2017 (“CY2017E”), in each case,
compared to the consideration in the Offer and the Merger of $13.00 per Share.

CY2017E Revenue    2.5x - 3.5x     $10.04 - $12.22 
CY2016A Adjusted EBITDA    12.0x - 14.0x    $8.05 - $8.64  
CY2017E Adjusted EBITDA    10.5x - 12.5x    $8.55 - $9.33  

Price per share as a multiple of:     
CY2016A Non-GAAP EPS    22.5x - 27.5x    $5.59 - $6.83  
CY2017E Non-GAAP EPS    17.5x - 22.5x    $6.62 - $8.51  

Although the Consolidated Selected Companies were used for comparison purposes, none of those companies is directly comparable to
the Company. Accordingly, an analysis of the results of such a comparison is not purely mathematical, but instead involves complex
considerations and judgments concerning differences in historical and projected financial and operating characteristics of the
Consolidated Selected Companies and other factors that could affect the public trading value of the Consolidated Selected Companies
and the Company to which they are being compared.

Based upon the information presented above, Cowen’s experience in the semiconductor industry and its professional judgment, Cowen
selected implied reference multiple ranges. The following table presents the implied value per Share based on the selected multiple
ranges using the Company’s historical LTM revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and Non-GAAP EPS (LTM period ending December 31,
2016) and the Company’s forecasted NTM revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and Non-GAAP EPS (NTM period ending December 31,
2017), in each case, compared to the consideration in the Offer and the Merger of $13.00 per Share.

Although the Selected Transactions were used for comparison purposes, none of those transactions is directly comparable to the Offer
and the Merger, and none of the target companies in those transactions is directly comparable to the Company. Accordingly, an analysis
of the results of such a comparison is not purely mathematical, but instead involves complex considerations and judgments concerning
differences in historical and projected financial and operating characteristics of the companies involved and other factors that could
affect the acquisition value of such companies to which they are being compared.

Discounted Cash Flow Analysis. Cowen estimated a range of values for the Shares based upon the discounted present value of the
Company’s projected unlevered free cash flow for the fiscal years ending in 2018 through 2021 and the terminal value of the Company
based on multiples of the Company’s forecasted Adjusted EBITDA for the Company’s fiscal year ending in 2022, and assuming a
transaction closing date of March 31, 2017. This analysis was based upon certain assumptions described by, projections supplied by
and discussions held with the management of the Company. In performing this analysis, Cowen utilized discount rates ranging from
12.0% to 14.0%, which were selected based on the estimated weighted average cost of capital of the Company. Cowen utilized terminal
multiples of Adjusted EBITDA ranging from 10.5x to 12.5x, which range was selected by Cowen in its professional judgment and
based on the multiples for the Consolidated Selected Companies. In performing this analysis, Cowen also calculated the present value
of the Company’s estimated United States federal and California state net operating loss carry forwards, as provided by Company
management, discounted to present value at discount rates ranging from 12.0% to 14.0%, which were selected based on the Company’s
estimated cost of equity.

Utilizing this methodology, the implied value per Share ranged from $10.87 to $12.17, compared to the consideration in the Offer and
the Merger of $13.00 per Share.

The summary set forth above does not purport to be a complete description of all the analyses performed by Cowen. The preparation of
a fairness opinion involves various determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant methods of financial analysis and the
application of these methods to the particular circumstances and, therefore, such an opinion is not readily susceptible to partial analysis
or summary description. Cowen did not attribute any particular weight to any analysis or factor considered by it, but rather made
qualitative judgments as to the significance and relevance of each analysis and factor. Accordingly, notwithstanding the separate factors
summarized above, Cowen believes, and has advised the Company Board, that its analyses must be considered as a whole and that
selecting portions of its analyses and the factors considered by it, without considering all analyses and factors, could create an
incomplete view of the process underlying its opinion. In performing its analyses, Cowen made numerous assumptions with respect to
industry performance, business and economic conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the control of the Company.
These analyses performed by Cowen are not necessarily indicative of actual values or future results, which may be significantly more
or less favorable than suggested by such analyses. In addition, analyses relating to the value of businesses do not purport to be
appraisals or to reflect the prices at which businesses or securities may actually be sold. Accordingly, such analyses and estimates are
inherently subject to uncertainty, being based upon numerous factors or events beyond the control of the parties or their respective
advisors. None of the Company, Cowen or any other person assumes responsibility if future results are materially different from those
projected. The analyses supplied by Cowen and its opinion were among several factors taken into consideration by the Company Board
in making its decision to enter into the Merger Agreement and should not be considered as determinative of such decision.

Cowen was selected by the Company to render an opinion to the Company Board because Cowen is a nationally recognized investment
banking firm and because, as part of its investment banking business, Cowen is continually engaged in the valuation of businesses and
their securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions, negotiated underwritings, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted
securities, private placements and valuations for corporate and other purposes. In addition, in the ordinary course of its business,
Cowen and its affiliates may actively trade or hold the securities of the Company for their own account and for the accounts of their
customers, and, accordingly, may at any time hold a long or short position in such securities. In the two years preceding the date of
Cowen’s opinion, Cowen has served as a financial advisor to the Company and has received fees for the rendering of such services of
$2.0 million, and has not had a material relationship with, or received any compensation from, MaxLinear or any other party to the
Merger Agreement. Cowen and its affiliates may in the future provide commercial and investment banking services to the Company
and MaxLinear and may receive fees for the rendering of such services. The issuance of Cowen’s opinion was approved by Cowen’s
Fairness Opinion Review Committee.

Pursuant to the engagement letter between Cowen and the Company, Cowen will be entitled to receive a transaction fee in the gross
amount of approximately $8.5 million and, after giving effect to certain amounts credited against such transaction fee, in the net
amount of approximately $6.25 million, $650,000 of which became payable upon Cowen rendering its opinion and the balance of
which is contingent upon the consummation of the Offer. Additionally, the Company has agreed to reimburse Cowen for certain of its
out-of-pocket expenses, including attorneys’ fees, and has agreed to indemnify Cowen against certain liabilities, including liabilities
under the federal securities laws. The terms of the fee arrangement with Cowen were negotiated at arm’s length between the Company
and Cowen, and the Company Board was aware of the arrangement, including the fact that a significant portion of the fee payable to
Cowen is contingent upon the consummation of the Offer.

Item 5. Persons/Assets Retained, Employed, Compensated or Used

Exar has retained Cowen as its financial advisor in connection with the Offer and the Merger. Information pertaining to the retention of
Cowen by Exar is set forth in “Item 4. The Solicitation or Recommendation —Opinion of Cowen and Company, LLC” and is hereby
incorporated by reference in this Item 5.

Neither Exar nor any person acting on its behalf has employed, retained or compensated any person to make solicitations or
recommendations to Exar’s stockholders on its behalf concerning the Offer or the Merger, except that such solicitations or
recommendations may be made by directors, officers or employees of Exar, for which services no additional compensation will be
paid.

Item 6. Interest In Securities of the Subject Company

Other than as set forth below and other than the vesting of stock units in accordance with their terms, no transactions with respect to
Shares have been effected by Exar or, to the knowledge of Exar after making reasonable inquiry, by any of its executive officers,
directors, affiliates or subsidiaries during the 60 days prior to the date of this Schedule 14D-9.

Item 7. Purposes of the Transaction and Plans or Proposals

Except as set forth in this Schedule 14D-9 (including in the exhibits and annexes hereto) or as incorporated in this Schedule 14D-9 by
reference, no negotiations are being undertaken or are underway by Exar in response to the Offer which relate to a tender offer or other
acquisition of Company securities by Exar, any subsidiary of Exar or any other person.

Except as set forth in this Schedule 14D-9 (including in the exhibits and annexes hereto) or as incorporated in this Schedule 14D-9 by
reference, no negotiations are being undertaken or are underway by Exar in response to the Offer which relate to, or would result in
(i) any extraordinary transaction, such as a merger, reorganization or liquidation, involving Exar or any subsidiary of Exar, (ii) any
purchase, sale or transfer of a material amount of assets of Exar or any subsidiary of Exar, or (iii) any material change in the present
dividend rate or policy, or indebtedness or capitalization of Exar.

Exar has agreed that from the date of the Merger Agreement to the Effective Time or the date, if any, on which the Merger Agreement
is terminated, Exar will not, among other matters, solicit alternative acquisition offers. In addition, Exar has agreed to certain
procedures that it must follow in the event Exar receives an unsolicited acquisition proposal. The information set forth in Section 11 of
the Offer to Purchase, entitled The Merger Agreement; Other Agreements is incorporated herein by reference.

Except as set forth in this Schedule 14D-9 (including in the exhibits and annexes hereto) or as incorporated in this Schedule 14D-9 by
reference, there are no transactions, resolutions of the Company Board, agreements in principle or signed contracts in response to the
Offer that relate to or would result in one or more of the matters referred to in this Item 7.

Item 8. Additional Information

Vote Required to Approve the Merger

The Board has in accordance with the DGCL unanimously (i) determined that the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement,
including the Offer and the Merger, and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, are at a price and on terms that
are fair to, and in the best interests of Exar and its stockholders (including the unaffiliated stockholders), (ii) approved and declared
advisable the Support Agreements, the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Offer and the
Merger and (iii) recommended that the Company’s stockholders accept the Offer and tender their Shares to the Purchaser in the Offer
and, to the extent applicable, approve and adopt the Merger Agreement and the Merger.

If the Offer is consummated, Exar does not anticipate seeking the approval of its remaining public stockholders before effecting the
Merger. Section 251(h) of the DGCL provides that following consummation of a successful tender offer for a public corporation, and
subject to certain statutory provisions, if the acquirer holds at least the amount of shares of each class of stock of the target corporation
that would otherwise be required to approve a merger for the target corporation, and the other stockholders receive the same
consideration for their stock in the merger as was payable in the tender offer, the acquirer can effect a merger without the action of the
other stockholders of the target corporation. Accordingly, if the Offer is consummated, Exar, Parent and Purchaser intend to effect the
Merger Closing without a vote of the stockholders of Exar in accordance with Section 251(h) of the DGCL.

Anti-Takeover Statutes

Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law

Exar is incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware. In general, Section 203 of the DGCL prevents an “interested stockholder”
(including a person who owns or has the right to acquire 15% or more of a corporation’s
 

50



9/7/2019 SC 14D9

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/753568/000119312517122031/d356341dsc14d9.htm 52/72

outstanding voting stock) from engaging in a “business combination” (defined to include mergers and certain other actions) with a
Delaware corporation whose stock is publicly traded or held of record by more than 2,000 stockholders for a period of three years
following the date such person became an interested stockholder unless:
 

 
•  the transaction in which the stockholder became an interested stockholder or the business combination was approved by

board of directors of the corporation before the other party to the business combination became an interested stockholder;
 

 

•  upon completion of the transaction that made it an interested stockholder, the interested stockholder owned at least 85% of
the voting stock of the corporation outstanding at the commencement of the transaction (excluding for purposes of
determining the voting stock outstanding (but not the outstanding voting stock owned by the interested stockholder) the
voting stock owned by directors who are also officers or held in employee benefit plans in which the employees do not have
a confidential right to tender or vote stock held by the plan); or

 

 
•  the business combination was approved by the board of directors of the corporation and ratified by 66 2/3% of the

outstanding voting stock which the interested stockholder did not own.

Neither Parent nor Purchaser is, nor at any time for the past three years has been, an “interested stockholder” of Exar as defined in
Section 203 of the DGCL. In addition, in accordance with the provisions of Section 203, the Company Board has approved the Merger
Agreement and the Transactions contemplated thereby, including the Offer and the Merger, as described in “Item 4. The Solicitation or
Recommendation” above and, therefore, the restrictions of Section 203 are inapplicable to the Offer and the Merger and the
Transactions.

Appraisal Rights

No appraisal rights are available in connection with the Offer and stockholders who tender their Shares in the Offer will not have
appraisal rights in connection with the Merger. However, if Purchaser purchases Shares in the Offer and the Merger is consummated,
holders of Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time who have not validly tendered such Shares in the Offer and who otherwise
comply with the applicable requirements and procedures of Section 262 of the DGCL (including with respect to certain aggregate
ownership requirements) will, subject to the conditions thereof, be entitled to appraisal of their Shares and the right to receive in cash
the “fair value” of their Shares, as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL. Such
appraised value may be greater than, the same as, or less than the Offer Price or the consideration payable in the merger (which is
equivalent to the Offer Price). Any stockholder contemplating the exercise of such appraisal rights should review carefully the
provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL, particularly the procedural steps required to properly demand and perfect such rights.
Stockholders should note that opinions of investment banking firms as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the
consideration payable in a sale transaction, such as the Offer and the Merger, are not opinions as to, and may not otherwise address, fair
value under Section 262 of the DGCL.

THE FOLLOWING SUMMARY IS QUALIFIED IN ITS ENTIRETY BY THE FULL TEXT OF SECTION 262 OF THE
DGCL, WHICH IS ATTACHED TO THIS SOLICITATION AND RECOMMENDATION STATEMENT AS ANNEX II. ALL
REFERENCES IN SECTION 262 OF THE DGCL AND IN THIS SUMMARY TO A “STOCKHOLDER” OR A “HOLDER
OF SHARES” ARE TO THE RECORD HOLDER OF SHARES IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO THE EFFECTIVE TIME AS
TO WHICH APPRAISAL RIGHTS ARE ASSERTED.

Under the DGCL, if the Merger is completed, holders of Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time who (i) did not tender their
Shares in the Offer; (ii) follow the procedures set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL and (iii) do not thereafter withdraw their demand
for appraisal of such Shares or otherwise lose their appraisal rights, in each case in accordance with the DGCL, may be entitled to have
their Shares appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive payment of the “fair value” of such shares, exclusive of any
element of value arising
 

51



9/7/2019 SC 14D9

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/753568/000119312517122031/d356341dsc14d9.htm 53/72

from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with a fair rate of interest, if any, as determined by such court.
However, after an appraisal petition has been filed, the Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings as to all holders
of Shares who asserted appraisal rights unless (a) the total number of shares for which appraisal rights have been pursued and perfected
exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock as measured in accordance with subsection (g) of Section 262
or (b) the value of the merger consideration in respect of such shares exceeds $1 million. We refer to these conditions as the
“ownership thresholds.” Unless the Delaware Court of Chancery, in its discretion, determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest
on an appraisal award will accrue and compound quarterly from the effective time of the merger through the date the judgment is paid
at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during such period; provided,
however, that if at any time before the Delaware Court of Chancery enters judgment in the appraisal proceeding, the surviving
corporation may pay to each stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which case any such interest will accrue after the
time of such payment only on the amount that equals the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the “fair
value” of the shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery and (2) any interest accrued prior to the time of such voluntary
payment, unless paid at such time. The surviving corporation is under no obligation to make such voluntary cash payment prior to such
entry of judgment.

Under Section 262 of the DGCL, where a merger is approved under Section 251(h) of the DGCL, either a constituent corporation
before the effective date of the merger, or the surviving corporation within ten days thereafter, shall notify each of the holders of any
class or series of stock of such constituent corporation who are entitled to appraisal rights of the approval of the Merger and that
appraisal rights are available for any or all shares of such class or series of stock of such constituent corporation, and shall include in
such notice a copy of Section 262 of the DGCL. THIS SCHEDULE 14D-9 CONSTITUTES THE FORMAL NOTICE OF
APPRAISAL RIGHTS UNDER SECTION 262 OF THE DGCL.

Under Delaware law, the procedures to properly demand and perfect appraisal rights must be carried out by and in the name of those
registered as the holders of record of Shares. Stockholders who are the beneficial owners but not the holders of record of Shares, and
who wish to demand such appraisal rights, are advised to consult promptly with the holders of record as to the timely exercise of such
rights and to cause such holders of record to make the appropriate demand and to otherwise comply with the requirements of
Section 262 of the DGCL.

FAILURE TO FOLLOW THE PROCEDURES SET FORTH IN SECTION 262 OF THE DGCL MAY RESULT IN A
TERMINATION OR LOSS OF APPRAISAL RIGHTS.

Any Exar stockholder wishing to exercise appraisal rights is urged to consult legal counsel before attempting to exercise such rights.

If an Exar stockholder elects to exercise appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL, such stockholder must do all of the
following:
 

 

(i) within the later of the consummation of the Offer (which will occur at the date and time of the acceptance for payment of
Shares pursuant to and subject to the conditions of the Offer) and 20 days after the date of this Schedule 14D-9, deliver to
Exar at Exar Corporation, 48720 Kato Road, Fremont, CA 94538, Attention: Chief Executive Officer, a written demand for
appraisal of the Shares held, which demand must reasonably inform Exar of the identity of the stockholder and that the
stockholder is demanding appraisal;

 

 (ii) not tender his, her or its Shares in the Offer;
 

 
(iii) continuously hold of record the Shares from the date on which the written demand for appraisal is made through the

Effective Time; and
 

 (iv) comply with the procedures of Section 262 of the DGCL for perfecting appraisal rights thereafter.
 

52



9/7/2019 SC 14D9

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/753568/000119312517122031/d356341dsc14d9.htm 54/72

In addition, one of the ownership thresholds must be met and a stockholder (or any person who is the beneficial owner of shares of
common stock held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person) or the Surviving Corporation must file a petition
in the Delaware Court of Chancery demanding a determination of the value of the stock of all such stockholders within 120 days after
the Effective Time.

If the Merger is consummated pursuant to Section 251(h) of the DGCL, the Surviving Corporation will deliver an additional notice of
the effective date of the Merger on or within 10 days after the Effective Time to those holders of Shares who made a written demand
for appraisal in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL, as required by Section 262(d)(2) of the DGCL. Only stockholders who have
submitted a written demand for appraisal in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL and are entitled to appraisal rights will be
entitled to receive such notice of the effective date of the Merger.

Appraisal Procedures

The right to appraisal will be lost unless it is perfected by satisfaction of the requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL, the text of
which is set forth in full in Annex II hereto. Mere failure to execute and return a Letter of Transmittal to the Paying Agent, or failure to
deliver share certificates to the Paying Agent, as the case may be, does NOT satisfy the requirements of Section 262. Rather, a separate
written demand for appraisal must be properly executed and timely delivered to Exar as described herein.

As provided under Section 262 of the DGCL, failure of a stockholder to make a written demand for appraisal (or failure of a beneficial
owner of Shares to cause the record holder of such Shares to demand an appraisal of such Shares) within the time limits provided in
Section 262 will result in the loss of such stockholder’s appraisal rights. The written demand for appraisal must be executed by or for
the stockholder of record. The demand should set forth, fully and correctly, the stockholder’s name as it appears on the share certificate
or certificates that represent such stockholder’s Shares or in the book entry that represents such stockholder’s Shares, as the case may
be. If the Shares are owned of record in a fiduciary or representative capacity, such as by a trustee, executor, administrator, guardian, or
attorney-in-fact, execution of the demand must be made in such capacity, and if the Shares are owned of record by more than one
person, such as in a joint tenancy or tenancy in common, the demand must be executed by or for all joint owners. An authorized agent,
including one of two or more joint owners, may execute the demand for appraisal for a stockholder of record; provided, however, that
the agent must identify the record owner(s) and expressly disclose the fact that, in executing the demand, the agent is acting as agent
for the record owner(s).

A record holder, such as a broker, fiduciary, depositary or other nominee, who holds Shares as a nominee for others, may exercise
appraisal rights with respect to the Shares held for all or less than all beneficial owners of Shares as to which such person is the record
owner. In such case, the written demand must set forth the number of Shares covered by such demand. Where the number of Shares is
not expressly stated, the demand will be presumed to cover all Shares held in the name of such record owner.

A beneficial owner of Shares held in “street name” who wishes to exercise appraisal rights should take such actions as may be
necessary to ensure that a timely and proper demand for appraisal is made by the record holder of such Shares. Securities held through
brokerage firms, banks and other financial institutions are frequently deposited with and held of record in the name of a nominee of a
central security deposit, such as The Depository Trust Company. In the case of Shares held through such a central securities depository
nominee, a demand for appraisal of such Shares must be made by or on behalf of the depository nominee and must identify the
depository nominee as the record holder. Any beneficial holder desiring appraisal who holds Shares through a nominee holder such as a
brokerage firm, bank or other financial institution is responsible for ensuring that the demand for appraisal is made by the record holder
of such Shares. The beneficial holder of such Shares who desires appraisal should instruct the nominee holder that the demand for
appraisal must be made by the record holder of such Shares, which may be the nominee of a central security depository if the Shares
have been so deposited. As required by Section 262, a demand for appraisal must reasonably inform Exar of the identity of the

holder(s) of record (which may be a nominee as described above) and that such stockholder intends thereby to demand appraisal of
such Shares.

Within 120 days after the Effective Time, but not thereafter, the surviving corporation or any holder of Shares who has complied with
the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL and is entitled to appraisal rights thereunder may commence an appraisal proceeding by
filing a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery demanding a determination of the fair value of the Shares held by all such holders
who did not tender in the Offer and demand appraisal. If no such petition is filed within the 120-day period, appraisal rights will be lost
for all holders of Shares who had previously demanded appraisal of their Shares. Exar as the surviving corporation is under no
obligation, and has no present intention, to file such a petition and holders should not assume that Exar will file a petition or that it will
initiate any negotiations with respect to the fair value of the Shares. Accordingly, any stockholder who wishes to perfect such
stockholder’s appraisal rights will be required to initiate all necessary action to perfect their appraisal rights in respect of the Shares
within the time prescribed in Section 262. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time within 60 days after the Effective Time, any
stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party shall have the right to
withdraw such stockholder’s demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the Merger. Notwithstanding that a demand for
appraisal must be executed by or for a stockholder of record, a beneficial owner of Shares held either in a voting trust or by a nominee
on behalf of such beneficial owner may, in such beneficial owner’s own name, file a petition for appraisal with respect to Shares
beneficially owned by such person and as to which appraisal rights have properly been perfected.

Within 120 days after the Effective Time, any holder of Shares who has complied with the requirements for demanding appraisal rights
will be entitled, upon written request, to receive from the surviving corporation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of
Shares not tendered into the Offer and with respect to which demands for appraisal have been received and the aggregate number of
holders of such Shares. Such statement must be mailed (i) within ten days after a written request therefor has been received by the
surviving corporation or (ii) within ten days after the expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal, whichever is later.
A beneficial owner of Shares held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such beneficial owner may, in such beneficial
owner’s own name, make such a request.

If a petition for an appraisal is timely filed with the Delaware Court of Chancery by a stockholder, service of a copy thereof must be
made upon the surviving corporation, which will then be obligated within 20 days after such service to provide the Delaware Register
in Chancery a duly verified list (the “Verified List”) containing the names and addresses of all stockholders who have demanded
payment for their Shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their Shares has not been reached. The Delaware Register in
Chancery, if so ordered by the Delaware Court of Chancery, shall give notice of the time and place fixed for the hearing of such
petition by mail to the surviving corporation and the Exar stockholders shown on the Verified List at the address stated therein in
accordance with Section 262. Such notice will also be published at least one week before the day of the hearing in a newspaper of
general circulation published in the City of Wilmington, Delaware, or in another publication determined by the Delaware Court of
Chancery. The costs of these notices are borne by the surviving corporation.

After notice to the stockholders as required by the Delaware Court of Chancery, the Delaware Court of Chancery is empowered to
conduct a hearing on such petition to determine those stockholders who have complied with Section 262 and who have become entitled
to appraisal rights. The Delaware Court of Chancery may require the stockholders who have demanded an appraisal for their Shares
and who hold stock represented by certificates to submit their Share certificates to the Delaware Register in Chancery for notation
thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceeding and, if any such stockholder fails to comply with such direction, the Delaware
Court of Chancery may dismiss the proceedings as to such stockholder. The Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal
proceedings as to all Exar stockholders who assert appraisal rights unless (a) the total number of shares for which appraisal rights have
been pursued and perfected exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of Exar’s common stock as measured in accordance with subsection
(g) of Section 262 or (b) the value of the merger
 

54



9/7/2019 SC 14D9

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/753568/000119312517122031/d356341dsc14d9.htm 56/72

consideration in respect of the shares for which appraisal rights have been pursued and perfected exceeds $1 million.

After the Delaware Court of Chancery determines which stockholders are entitled to appraisal, and that at least one of the ownership
thresholds above has been satisfied in respect of the Exar stockholders seeking appraisal rights, the appraisal proceeding will be
conducted in accordance with the rules of the Delaware Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically governing appraisal
proceedings. Through the appraisal proceeding, the Delaware Court of Chancery will determine the “fair value” of the Shares subject
to appraisal, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest, if
any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value.

Unless the Delaware Court of Chancery in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest on the amount
determined to be the fair value shall accrue from the Effective Time through the date of the payment of the judgment, will be
compounded quarterly, and will accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time
to time during the period between the Effective Time and the date of payment of the judgment. However, the surviving corporation has
the right, at any point prior to the Delaware Court of Chancery’s entry of judgment in the proceedings, to make a voluntary cash
payment to each stockholder seeking appraisal. If the surviving corporation makes a voluntary cash payment pursuant to subsection
(h) of Section 262, interest will accrue thereafter only on the sum of (i) the difference, if any, between the amount paid by the surviving
corporation in such voluntary cash payment and the fair value of the shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery and
(ii) interest accrued before such voluntary cash payment, unless paid at that time.

Stockholders considering the exercise of appraisal rights should be aware that the fair value of their Shares as determined under
Section 262 of the DGCL could be greater than, the same as, or less than the value of the Offer Price or the consideration payable in the
Merger (which is equivalent to the Offer Price). Although Exar believes that the Offer Price or the consideration payable in the Merger
(which is equivalent to the Offer Price) is fair, no representation is made as to the outcome of the appraisal of fair value as determined
by the Delaware Court of Chancery. Neither Exar nor Parent anticipates offering more than the Merger Consideration to any
stockholder exercising appraisal rights, and each of Exar and Parent reserves the right to make a voluntary cash payment pursuant to
subsection (h) of Section 262 and to assert, in any appraisal proceeding, that for purposes of Section 262, the “fair value” of a share of
common stock is less than the Offer Price or the consideration payable in the Merger (which is equivalent to the Offer Price). In
Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court discussed the factors that could be considered in determining fair value in an
appraisal proceeding, stating that “proof of value by any techniques or methods which are generally considered acceptable in the
financial community and otherwise admissible in court” should be considered and that “[f]air price obviously requires consideration of
all relevant factors involving the value of a company.” The Delaware Supreme Court has stated that in making this determination of
fair value the court must consider market value, asset value, dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the enterprise and any other
facts which could be ascertained as of the date of the merger which throw any light on future prospects of the merged corporation.
Section 262 provides that fair value is to be “exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the
merger[.]” In Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court stated that such exclusion is a “narrow exclusion [that]
does not encompass known elements of value,” but which rather applies only to the speculative elements of value arising from such
accomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger, the Delaware Supreme Court construed Section 262 to mean that “elements of future
value, including the nature of the enterprise, which are known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the merger and not the product
of speculation, may be considered.”

Upon application by the surviving corporation or by any holder of Shares entitled to participate in the appraisal proceeding, so long as
one of the ownership thresholds are met, the Delaware Court of Chancery may, in its discretion, proceed to trial upon the appraisal
prior to the final determination of the stockholders entitled to an appraisal. Any holder of Shares whose name appears on the Verified
List and, if such Shares are represented by
 

55



9/7/2019 SC 14D9

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/753568/000119312517122031/d356341dsc14d9.htm 57/72

certificates and if so required, who has submitted such stockholder’s certificates of stock to the Delaware Register in Chancery, may
participate fully in all proceedings until it is finally determined that such stockholder is not entitled to appraisal rights or that neither of
the ownership thresholds is met. The Delaware Court of Chancery will direct the payment of the fair value of the Shares, together with
interest, if any, by the surviving corporation to the stockholders entitled thereto. Payment will be so made to each such stockholder, in
the case of holders of uncertificated stock, forthwith, and in the case of holders of Shares represented by certificates, upon the surrender
to the surviving corporation of the certificate(s) representing such stock. The Delaware Court of Chancery’s decree may be enforced as
other decrees in such court may be enforced.

The costs of the appraisal proceeding (which do not include attorneys’ fees or the fees and expenses of expert witnesses) may be
determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery and taxed upon the parties as the Court deems equitable in the circumstances. Upon
application of a stockholder, the Court may also order that all or a portion of the expenses incurred by any stockholder in connection
with an appraisal, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees and the fees and expenses of experts utilized in the appraisal
proceeding, be charged pro rata against the value of all the Shares entitled to be appraised. Absent such an order, each party is
responsible for his, her or its own expenses.

From and after the Effective Time, no stockholder who has demanded an appraisal in compliance with Section 262 of the DGCL is
entitled to vote any Shares for any purpose or is entitled to the payment of dividends or other distributions on any Shares (except
dividends or other distributions, if any, payable to stockholders of record as of a record date prior to the Effective Time).

If any stockholder who demands appraisal of such stockholder’s Shares under Section 262 of the DGCL fails to perfect, or effectively
withdraws or loses, such stockholder’s right to appraisal, as provided in the DGCL, the Shares of such stockholder will be deemed to
have been converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive the consideration payable in connection with the Merger, which is
equal to the Offer Price, without interest.

At any time within 60 days after the Effective Time, any stockholder who has demanded appraisal and who has not commenced an
appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party has the right to withdraw the demand and accept the consideration
offered in the Merger. After that period, a stockholder may withdraw a demand for appraisal only with the written consent of the
surviving corporation. No appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery will be dismissed as to any stockholder, however,
without the approval of the Delaware Court of Chancery, which may be conditioned on such terms as the Delaware Court of Chancery
deems just; provided, however, that this provision shall not affect the right of any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal
proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such stockholder’s demand for appraisal and to accept the terms
offered upon the Merger within 60 days of the Effective Time.

FAILURE TO FOLLOW THE PROCEDURES SET FORTH IN SECTION 262 OF THE DGCL MAY RESULT IN A
TERMINATION OR LOSS OF APPRAISAL RIGHTS UNDER SECTION 262 OF THE DGCL.

U.S. Antitrust Compliance

Under the HSR Act, and the related rules and regulations that have been issued by the Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”), certain
proposed acquisitions may not be consummated until required information and documentary material has been furnished for review by
the FTC and the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the “Antitrust Division”) and the applicable waiting period
requirements have been satisfied. These requirements apply to Purchaser’s proposed acquisition of the Shares in the Offer and the
Merger.

Under the HSR Act, the purchase of Shares in the Offer may not be completed until the expiration of a 15 calendar day waiting period
following the filing by Parent of a Premerger Notification and Report Form concerning the Offer with the FTC and the Antitrust
Division, unless the waiting period is earlier terminated by

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/753568/000119312517122031/d356341dsc14d9.htm 58/72

the FTC and the Antitrust Division. If the end of the 15 calendar day waiting period is set to fall on a federal holiday or weekend day,
the waiting period is automatically extended until 11:59 p.m., New York City time, the next business day. Each of Parent and Exar filed
on April 10, 2017 a Premerger Notification and Report Form with the FTC and the Antitrust Division in connection with the purchase
of Shares in the Offer.

The Company is not aware of any other filings, approvals or other actions by or with any governmental authority or administrative or
regulatory agency other than the forgoing filings under the HSR Act that would be required for Parent’s or Purchaser’s acquisition or
ownership of the Shares.

Annual and Quarterly Reports

For additional information regarding the business and the financial results of Exar, please see Exar’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the year ended March 27, 2016 and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended July 3, 2016, October 2, 2016 and
January 1, 2017, which have been filed with the SEC.

Golden Parachute Compensation

Pursuant to Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K, Exar is required to provide information about compensation for each of its named executive
officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the Transactions. Such compensation is referred to as “golden parachute” compensation
by the applicable SEC disclosure rules. The named executive officers for purposes of this disclosure obligation include Richard Leza,
Exar’s former interim Chief Executive Officer, Louis DiNardo, Exar’s former Chief Executive Officer, and Dimitry Goder, Exar’s
former Senior Vice President of Research and Development. However, since neither the Offer nor the Merger will result in any
compensatory income becoming payable to Messrs. Leza, DiNardo or Goder, they are excluded from the following table.

The terms and conditions related to all compensation that is based on or otherwise related to the Transactions are described in “Item 3.
Past Contracts, Transactions, Negotiations and Agreements — Arrangements between Exar and its Executive Officers, Directors and
Affiliates” and is incorporated herein by reference.

The amounts reported below are estimates based on multiple assumptions that may or may not actually occur. As a result, the golden
parachute compensation, if any, to be received by Exar’s named executive officers may materially differ from the amounts set forth
below. Notably, pursuant to SEC disclosure rules, the table below assumes that the closing of the Offer and the Merger both occur on
April 7, 2017, which is the last practicable date prior to the filing of this Solicitation/Recommendation Statement. In addition, the table
reflects the assumption that each named executive officer experiences a termination without “cause” or resignation for “good reason”
immediately after consummation of the Transactions and receives all corresponding benefits under the officer’s agreement described
above in Item 3 under the heading “— Change of Control Arrangements”.

Management Incentive Program bonus of $187,500, prorated for a partial fiscal year of service from April 1, 2017 through
April 7, 2017 and payable in a lump sum in the event of a termination without “cause” or resignation for “good reason” prior to
the expiration of his term of employment in September, 2017 and within twelve months after the Transactions, in each case
pursuant to Mr. Benton’s Employment Agreement. All amounts are subject to the individual executing a release of claims in favor
of Exar.

(2) For Messrs. Benton, Lougheed and Wark represents the estimated value of the “double trigger” right to 100% accelerated vesting
in their Unvested Company Options, Unvested Company Performance Options, Unvested Company RSUs and Unvested
Company Performance Units in the event of a termination without “cause” or resignation for “good reason” within twelve months
after the Transactions (within twenty-four months after the Transactions for Mr. Wark). No amounts have been included with
respect to Out-of-the-Money Company Options. No amounts have been included with respect to any Vested Company Options or
any Vested Company Units as of April 7, 2017 because these awards vested prior to, and not in connection with, the Offer or
Merger. For these calculations, the value per Share is assumed to be the Offer Price. Any acceleration is contingent on the
individual executing a release of claims in favor of Exar.

(3) For Messrs. Lougheed and Wark represents the “double-trigger” right to Exar-paid COBRA continuation coverage for six months
pursuant to each such officer’s Change of Control Severance Letter Agreement in the event of a termination without “cause” or
resignation for “good reason” within twelve months after the Transactions (within twenty-four months after the Transactions for
Mr. Wark). For Mr. Benton, represents the right to Exar-paid COBRA continuation coverage for twelve months in the event of a
termination without “cause” or resignation for “good reason” prior to the expiration of his term of employment in September,
2017 pursuant to Mr. Benton’s Employment Agreement. All amounts are subject to the individual executing a release of claims in
favor of Exar.

Forward-Looking Statements

This Schedule 14D-9 may contain forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements in this communication include, without
limitation, statements regarding prospective performance and opportunities and the outlook of our business, performance and
opportunities, the anticipated timing of filings and approvals relating to the Transactions; the expected timing of the completion of the
Transactions; the ability to complete the Transactions considering the various closing conditions; and any assumptions underlying any
of the foregoing. These forward-looking statements generally include statements that are predictive in nature and depend upon or refer
to future events or conditions, and include words such as “believe,” “may,” “estimate,” “continue,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “could,”
“will,” “would,” “should,” “plan,” “expect,” “predict,” “potential,” “possible,” “likelihood,” “future,” “target,” “project,” or the
negative of these terms or similar expressions. The forward-looking statements contained herein are based on current expectations and
assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties which may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking
statements. The actual results of the Transactions could vary materially as a result of a number of factors, including: uncertainties as to
the timing of the Offer and the Merger; uncertainties as to how many of our stockholders will tender their Shares in the Offer; the
failure of the Parent to obtain the necessary financing pursuant to the arrangements set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter or
otherwise; the possibility that competing offers will be made; the possibility that various closing conditions for the Transactions may
not be satisfied or waived; the possibility that the Transactions may not be timely completed, if at all; and that, prior to the completion
of the Transactions, if at all, our business may experience significant disruptions due to Transactions-related uncertainty. Other factors
that may cause actual results to differ materially include those set forth in the reports that we file from time to time with the SEC,
including those set forth in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of Exar’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 27, 2016 and
Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended July 3, 2016 and January 1, 2017 and in other periodic reports and filings with
the SEC from time to time, as well as the Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO and other tender offer documents filed by Purchaser
and Parent. All of these materials related to the Transactions (and all other transaction documents filed with the SEC) will be available

Board of Directors
Exar Corporation
48720 Kato Road
Fremont, CA 94538

 
Members of the Board:
 
In your capacity as members of the Board of Directors (the “Board of Directors”) of Exar
Corporation (the “Company”), you have requested our opinion (the “Opinion”), as investment
bankers, as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of the common stock,
par value $0.0001 per share, of the Company of the Consideration (as defined below) to be
received by the stockholders of the Company pursuant to the terms of that certain Agreement
and Plan of Merger (the “Agreement”), by and among MaxLinear, Inc. (“Acquirer”), Eagle
Acquisition Corporation (“Merger Sub”) and the Company.
 
As more specifically set forth in the Agreement, and subject to the terms, conditions and
adjustments set forth in the Agreement, (i) Merger Sub will commence a tender offer (the
“Offer”) to purchase any and all of the outstanding shares of common stock of the Company at
a price of $13.00 per share in cash (the “Consideration”), and (ii) following the consummation
of the Offer, Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company (the “Merger”, and
together with the Offer, the “Transaction”) and each issued and outstanding share of common
stock of the Company not tendered in the Offer, other than those shares of common stock of
the Company which are not being converted into the right to receive the Consideration under
the Agreement, will be converted into the right to receive the Consideration.
 
Cowen and Company, LLC (“we” or “Cowen”), as part of its investment banking business, is
continually engaged in the valuation of businesses and their securities in connection with
mergers and acquisitions, negotiated underwritings, secondary distributions of listed and
unlisted securities, private placements and valuations for corporate and other purposes. In the
ordinary course of our business, we and our affiliates may actively trade the securities of the
Company and Acquirer and/or their respective affiliates for our own account and for the
accounts of our customers and, accordingly, may at any time hold a long or short position in
such securities.
 
We are acting as exclusive financial advisor to the Board of Directors of the Company in
connection with the Transaction and will receive a fee from the Company for our services, a
significant portion of which is contingent upon the consummation of the Transaction. We will
also receive a fee for providing this Opinion. In addition, the Company has agreed to
reimburse our expenses and indemnify us for certain liabilities that may arise out of our
engagement. In the two years preceding the date of this Opinion, Cowen has served as a
financial advisor to the Company and has received fees for the rendering of such services,
and has not had a material relationship with any other party to the Transaction. Cowen and its
affiliates may in the future provide commercial and investment banking services to the
Company and Acquirer and may receive fees for the rendering of such services.

In connection with our Opinion, we have reviewed and considered such financial and
other matters as we have deemed relevant, including, among other things:
 

•    a draft of the Agreement dated March 28, 2017;
 

•    certain publicly available financial and other information for the Company and
certain other relevant financial and operating data furnished to Cowen by the
management of the Company, including certain unaudited pro forma historical
financial information concerning the Company;

 
•    certain internal financial analyses, financial forecasts, reports and other

information concerning the Company prepared by the management of the
Company (the “Company Forecasts”);

 
•    discussions we have had with certain members of the management of the

Company concerning the historical and current business operations, financial
condition and prospects of the Company and such other matters we deemed
relevant;

 
•    certain operating results of the Company as compared to the operating results of

certain publicly traded companies we deemed relevant;
 

•    the reported price and trading history of the shares of the common stock of the
Company as compared to the reported price and trading histories of certain
publicly traded companies we deemed relevant;

 
•    certain financial terms of the Transaction as compared to the financial terms of

certain selected business combinations we deemed relevant; and
 

•    such other information, financial studies, analyses and investigations and such
other factors that we deemed relevant for the purposes of this Opinion.

 
In conducting our review and arriving at our Opinion, we have, with your consent,
assumed and relied, without independent investigation, upon the accuracy and
completeness of all financial and other information provided to us by the Company or
which is publicly available or was otherwise reviewed by us. We have not undertaken any
responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or reasonableness of, or independent
verification of, such information. We have relied upon, without independent verifications,
the assessment of the management of the Company as to the existing products and
services of the Company and the viability of, and risks associated with, the future
products and services of the Company. In addition, we have not conducted nor have
assumed any obligation to conduct any physical inspection of the properties or facilities of
the Company. We have further relied upon the Company’s representation that all
information provided to us by the Company is accurate and complete in all material
respects. We have, with your consent, assumed that the Company Forecasts were
reasonably prepared by the management of the Company on bases reflecting the best
currently available estimates and good faith judgments of such management as to the
future performance of the Company, and such Company Forecasts provide a reasonable
basis for our Opinion. We express no opinion as to the Company Forecasts or the
assumptions on which they were

made. We expressly disclaim any undertaking or obligation to advise any person of any
change in any fact or matter affecting our Opinion of which we become aware after the
date hereof.
 
We assumed that there were no material changes in the assets, liabilities, financial
condition, results of operations, business or prospects of the Company since the date of
the last financial statements made available to us. We have not made or obtained any
independent evaluations, valuations or appraisals of the assets or liabilities of the
Company, nor have we been furnished with such materials. In addition, we have not
evaluated the solvency or fair value of the Company, Acquirer or Merger Sub under any
state or federal laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. Our Opinion
does not address any legal, tax or accounting matters related to the Agreement or the
Transaction, as to which we have assumed that the Company and the Board of Directors
of the Company have received such advice from legal, tax and accounting advisors as
each has determined appropriate. Our Opinion addresses only the fairness of the
Consideration, from a financial point of view, to the stockholders of the Company. We
express no view as to any other aspect or implication of the Transaction or any other
agreement, arrangement or understanding entered into in connection with the
Transaction or otherwise. Our Opinion is necessarily based upon economic and market
conditions and other circumstances as they exist and can be evaluated by us on the date
hereof. It should be understood that although subsequent developments may affect our
Opinion, we do not have any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm our Opinion and we
expressly disclaim any responsibility to do so.
 
We have not considered any potential legislative or regulatory changes currently being
considered or recently enacted by the United States or any foreign government, or any
domestic or foreign regulatory body, or any changes in accounting methods or generally
accepted accounting principles that may be adopted by the Securities and Exchange
Commission, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or any similar foreign regulatory
body or board.
 
For purposes of rendering our Opinion we have assumed in all respects material to our
analysis, that the representations and warranties of each party contained in the
Agreement are true and correct, that each party will perform all of the covenants and
agreements required to be performed by it under the Agreement and that all conditions to
the consummation of the Transaction will be satisfied without waiver thereof. We have
assumed that the final form of the Agreement will be substantially similar to the last draft
reviewed by us. We have also assumed that all governmental, regulatory and other
consents and approvals contemplated by the Agreement will be obtained and that in the
course of obtaining any of those consents no restrictions will be imposed or waivers
made that would have an adverse effect on the contemplated benefits of the Transaction.
We have assumed that the Transaction will be consummated in a manner that complies
with the applicable provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and all other applicable state or federal statutes,
rules and regulations.
 
It is understood that our Opinion is intended for the benefit and use of the Board of
Directors of the Company in its consideration of the financial terms of the Transaction.
Our Opinion should not be disclosed, referred to, or communicated (in whole or in part) to
any third party for any purpose whatsoever except with our prior written approval.
However, our Opinion may be reproduced in full in

disclosure documents relating to the Transaction which the Company is required to file
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Our Opinion does not constitute
a recommendation to any stockholder of the Company or any other person as to whether
such person should tender his or her shares of the common stock of the Company in the
Offer or to take any other action in connection with the Transaction or otherwise. We
have not been requested to opine as to, and our Opinion does not in any manner
address, the Company’s underlying business decision to effect the Transaction or the
relative merits of the Transaction as compared to other business strategies or
transactions that might be available to the Company. In addition, we have not been
requested to opine as to, and our Opinion does not in any manner address, (i) the
fairness of the amount or nature of the compensation to any of the Company’s officers,
directors or employees, or class of such persons, relative to the compensation to the
public stockholders of the Company or (ii) whether Acquirer has sufficient cash, available
lines of credit or other sources of funds to enable it to pay the Consideration.
 
This Opinion was reviewed and approved by Cowen’s Fairness Opinion Review
Committee.
 
Based upon and subject to the foregoing, including the various assumptions and
limitations set forth herein, it is our opinion that, as of the date hereof, the Consideration
to be received by the stockholders of the Company in the Transaction is fair, from a
financial point of view, to the stockholders of the Company.
 

  Very truly yours,

Annex II

Section 262 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.

§ 262 Appraisal Rights.

(a) Any stockholder of a corporation of this State who holds shares of stock on the date of the making of a demand pursuant to
subsection (d) of this section with respect to such shares, who continuously holds such shares through the effective date of the merger
or consolidation, who has otherwise complied with subsection (d) of this section and who has neither voted in favor of the merger or
consolidation nor consented thereto in writing pursuant to § 228 of this title shall be entitled to an appraisal by the Court of Chancery
of the fair value of the stockholder’s shares of stock under the circumstances described in subsections (b) and (c) of this section. As
used in this section, the word “stockholder” means a holder of record of stock in a corporation; the words “stock” and “share” mean
and include what is ordinarily meant by those words; and the words “depository receipt” mean a receipt or other instrument issued by a
depository representing an interest in 1 or more shares, or fractions thereof, solely of stock of a corporation, which stock is deposited
with the depository.

(b) Appraisal rights shall be available for the shares of any class or series of stock of a constituent corporation in a merger or
consolidation to be effected pursuant to § 251 (other than a merger effected pursuant to § 251(g) of this title and, subject to paragraph
(b)(3) of this section, § 251(h) of this title), § 252, § 254, § 255, § 256, § 257, § 258, § 263 or § 264 of this title:

(1) Provided, however, that, except as expressly provided in § 363(b) of this title, no appraisal rights under this section shall be
available for the shares of any class or series of stock, which stock, or depository receipts in respect thereof, at the record date
fixed to determine the stockholders entitled to receive notice of the meeting of stockholders to act upon the agreement of merger
or consolidation, were either: (i) listed on a national securities exchange or (ii) held of record by more than 2,000 holders; and
further provided that no appraisal rights shall be available for any shares of stock of the constituent corporation surviving a
merger if the merger did not require for its approval the vote of the stockholders of the surviving corporation as provided in §
251(f) of this title.

(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1) of this section, appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the shares of any
class or series of stock of a constituent corporation if the holders thereof are required by the terms of an agreement of merger or
consolidation pursuant to §§ 251, 252, 254, 255, 256, 257, 258, 263 and 264 of this title to accept for such stock anything except:

a. Shares of stock of the corporation surviving or resulting from such merger or consolidation, or depository receipts in
respect thereof;

b. Shares of stock of any other corporation, or depository receipts in respect thereof, which shares of stock (or depository
receipts in respect thereof) or depository receipts at the effective date of the merger or consolidation will be either listed on a
national securities exchange or held of record by more than 2,000 holders;

c. Cash in lieu of fractional shares or fractional depository receipts described in the foregoing paragraphs (b)(2)a. and b. of
this section; or

d. Any combination of the shares of stock, depository receipts and cash in lieu of fractional shares or fractional depository
receipts described in the foregoing paragraphs (b)(2)a., b. and c. of this section.

(3) In the event all of the stock of a subsidiary Delaware corporation party to a merger effected under § 251(h), § 253 or § 267 of
this title is not owned by the parent immediately prior to the merger, appraisal rights shall be available for the shares of the
subsidiary Delaware corporation.

(4) In the event of an amendment to a corporation’s certificate of incorporation contemplated by § 363(a) of this title, appraisal
rights shall be available as contemplated by § 363(b) of this title, and the procedures of

this section, including those set forth in subsections (d) and (e) of this section, shall apply as nearly as practicable, with the word
“amendment” substituted for the words “merger or consolidation,” and the word “corporation” substituted for the words
“constituent corporation” and/or “surviving or resulting corporation.”

(c) Any corporation may provide in its certificate of incorporation that appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the
shares of any class or series of its stock as a result of an amendment to its certificate of incorporation, any merger or consolidation in
which the corporation is a constituent corporation or the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the corporation. If the certificate
of incorporation contains such a provision, the provisions of this section, including those set forth in subsections (d), (e), and (g) of this
section, shall apply as nearly as is practicable.

(d) Appraisal rights shall be perfected as follows:

(1) If a proposed merger or consolidation for which appraisal rights are provided under this section is to be submitted for approval
at a meeting of stockholders, the corporation, not less than 20 days prior to the meeting, shall notify each of its stockholders who
was such on the record date for notice of such meeting (or such members who received notice in accordance with § 255(c) of this
title) with respect to shares for which appraisal rights are available pursuant to subsection (b) or (c) of this section that appraisal
rights are available for any or all of the shares of the constituent corporations, and shall include in such notice a copy of this
section and, if 1 of the constituent corporations is a nonstock corporation, a copy of § 114 of this title. Each stockholder electing
to demand the appraisal of such stockholder’s shares shall deliver to the corporation, before the taking of the vote on the merger
or consolidation, a written demand for appraisal of such stockholder’s shares. Such demand will be sufficient if it reasonably
informs the corporation of the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to demand the appraisal of such
stockholder’s shares. A proxy or vote against the merger or consolidation shall not constitute such a demand. A stockholder
electing to take such action must do so by a separate written demand as herein provided. Within 10 days after the effective date of
such merger or consolidation, the surviving or resulting corporation shall notify each stockholder of each constituent corporation
who has complied with this subsection and has not voted in favor of or consented to the merger or consolidation of the date that
the merger or consolidation has become effective; or

(2) If the merger or consolidation was approved pursuant to § 228, § 251(h), § 253, or § 267 of this title, then either a constituent
corporation before the effective date of the merger or consolidation or the surviving or resulting corporation within 10 days
thereafter shall notify each of the holders of any class or series of stock of such constituent corporation who are entitled to
appraisal rights of the approval of the merger or consolidation and that appraisal rights are available for any or all shares of such
class or series of stock of such constituent corporation, and shall include in such notice a copy of this section and, if 1 of the
constituent corporations is a nonstock corporation, a copy of § 114 of this title. Such notice may, and, if given on or after the
effective date of the merger or consolidation, shall, also notify such stockholders of the effective date of the merger or
consolidation. Any stockholder entitled to appraisal rights may, within 20 days after the date of mailing of such notice or, in the
case of a merger approved pursuant to § 251(h) of this title, within the later of the consummation of the offer contemplated by §
251(h) of this title and 20 days after the date of mailing of such notice, demand in writing from the surviving or resulting
corporation the appraisal of such holder’s shares. Such demand will be sufficient if it reasonably informs the corporation of the
identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to demand the appraisal of such holder’s shares. If such notice
did not notify stockholders of the effective date of the merger or consolidation, either (i) each such constituent corporation shall
send a second notice before the effective date of the merger or consolidation notifying each of the holders of any class or series of
stock of such constituent corporation that are entitled to appraisal rights of the effective date of the merger or consolidation or
(ii) the surviving or resulting corporation shall send such a second notice to all such holders on or within 10 days after such
effective date; provided, however, that if such second notice is sent more than 20 days following the sending of the first notice or,
in the case of a merger approved pursuant to § 251(h) of this title, later than the later of the consummation of the offer
contemplated by § 251(h) of this

 
II-2



9/7/2019 SC 14D9

title and 20 days following the sending of the first notice, such second notice need only be sent to each stockholder who is entitled
to appraisal rights and who has demanded appraisal of such holder’s shares in accordance with this subsection. An affidavit of the
secretary or assistant secretary or of the transfer agent of the corporation that is required to give either notice that such notice has
been given shall, in the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein. For purposes of determining the
stockholders entitled to receive either notice, each constituent corporation may fix, in advance, a record date that shall be not
more than 10 days prior to the date the notice is given, provided, that if the notice is given on or after the effective date of the
merger or consolidation, the record date shall be such effective date. If no record date is fixed and the notice is given prior to the
effective date, the record date shall be the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the notice is given.

(e) Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, the surviving or resulting corporation or any stockholder
who has complied with subsections (a) and (d) of this section hereof and who is otherwise entitled to appraisal rights, may commence
an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Court of Chancery demanding a determination of the value of the stock of all such
stockholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, any
stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party shall have the right to
withdraw such stockholder’s demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the merger or consolidation. Within 120 days
after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, any stockholder who has complied with the requirements of subsections (a) and
(d) of this section hereof, upon written request, shall be entitled to receive from the corporation surviving the merger or resulting from
the consolidation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the merger or consolidation and with
respect to which demands for appraisal have been received and the aggregate number of holders of such shares. Such written statement
shall be mailed to the stockholder within 10 days after such stockholder’s written request for such a statement is received by the
surviving or resulting corporation or within 10 days after expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal under
subsection (d) of this section hereof, whichever is later. Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, a person who is the beneficial
owner of shares of such stock held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person may, in such person’s own name,
file a petition or request from the corporation the statement described in this subsection.

(f) Upon the filing of any such petition by a stockholder, service of a copy thereof shall be made upon the surviving or resulting
corporation, which shall within 20 days after such service file in the office of the Register in Chancery in which the petition was filed a
duly verified list containing the names and addresses of all stockholders who have demanded payment for their shares and with whom
agreements as to the value of their shares have not been reached by the surviving or resulting corporation. If the petition shall be filed
by the surviving or resulting corporation, the petition shall be accompanied by such a duly verified list. The Register in Chancery, if so
ordered by the Court, shall give notice of the time and place fixed for the hearing of such petition by registered or certified mail to the
surviving or resulting corporation and to the stockholders shown on the list at the addresses therein stated. Such notice shall also be
given by 1 or more publications at least 1 week before the day of the hearing, in a newspaper of general circulation published in the
City of Wilmington, Delaware or such publication as the Court deems advisable. The forms of the notices by mail and by publication
shall be approved by the Court, and the costs thereof shall be borne by the surviving or resulting corporation.

(g) At the hearing on such petition, the Court shall determine the stockholders who have complied with this section and who have
become entitled to appraisal rights. The Court may require the stockholders who have demanded an appraisal for their shares and who
hold stock represented by certificates to submit their certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the
pendency of the appraisal proceedings; and if any stockholder fails to comply with such direction, the Court may dismiss the
proceedings as to such stockholder. If immediately before the merger or consolidation the shares of the class or series of stock of the
constituent corporation as to which appraisal rights are available were listed on a national securities exchange, the Court shall dismiss
the proceedings as to all holders of such shares who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless (1) the total number of shares
entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of the class or series eligible for appraisal, (2) the value of the consideration
provided in the merger or consolidation for such total number of shares exceeds $1 million, or (3) the merger was approved pursuant to
§ 253 or § 267 of this title.

(h) After the Court determines the stockholders entitled to an appraisal, the appraisal proceeding shall be conducted in accordance with
the rules of the Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings. Through such proceeding the
Court shall determine the fair value of the shares exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of
the merger or consolidation, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. In determining
such fair value, the Court shall take into account all relevant factors. Unless the Court in its discretion determines otherwise for good
cause shown, and except as provided in this subsection, interest from the effective date of the merger through the date of payment of
the judgment shall be compounded quarterly and shall accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as
established from time to time during the period between the effective date of the merger and the date of payment of the judgment. At
any time before the entry of judgment in the proceedings, the surviving corporation may pay to each stockholder entitled to appraisal
an amount in cash, in which case interest shall accrue thereafter as provided herein only upon the sum of (1) the difference, if any,
between the amount so paid and the fair value of the shares as determined by the Court, and (2) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid
at that time. Upon application by the surviving or resulting corporation or by any stockholder entitled to participate in the appraisal
proceeding, the Court may, in its discretion, proceed to trial upon the appraisal prior to the final determination of the stockholders
entitled to an appraisal. Any stockholder whose name appears on the list filed by the surviving or resulting corporation pursuant to
subsection (f) of this section and who has submitted such stockholder’s certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery, if such is
required, may participate fully in all proceedings until it is finally determined that such stockholder is not entitled to appraisal rights
under this section.

(i) The Court shall direct the payment of the fair value of the shares, together with interest, if any, by the surviving or resulting
corporation to the stockholders entitled thereto. Payment shall be so made to each such stockholder, in the case of holders of
uncertificated stock forthwith, and the case of holders of shares represented by certificates upon the surrender to the corporation of the
certificates representing such stock. The Court’s decree may be enforced as other decrees in the Court of Chancery may be enforced,
whether such surviving or resulting corporation be a corporation of this State or of any state.

(j) The costs of the proceeding may be determined by the Court and taxed upon the parties as the Court deems equitable in the
circumstances. Upon application of a stockholder, the Court may order all or a portion of the expenses incurred by any stockholder in
connection with the appraisal proceeding, including, without limitation, reasonable attorney’s fees and the fees and expenses of experts,
to be charged pro rata against the value of all the shares entitled to an appraisal.

(k) From and after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, no stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights as provided in
subsection (d) of this section shall be entitled to vote such stock for any purpose or to receive payment of dividends or other
distributions on the stock (except dividends or other distributions payable to stockholders of record at a date which is prior to the
effective date of the merger or consolidation); provided, however, that if no petition for an appraisal shall be filed within the time
provided in subsection (e) of this section, or if such stockholder shall deliver to the surviving or resulting corporation a written
withdrawal of such stockholder’s demand for an appraisal and an acceptance of the merger or consolidation, either within 60 days after
the effective date of the merger or consolidation as provided in subsection (e) of this section or thereafter with the written approval of
the corporation, then the right of such stockholder to an appraisal shall cease. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no appraisal proceeding
in the Court of Chancery shall be dismissed as to any stockholder without the approval of the Court, and such approval may be
conditioned upon such terms as the Court deems just; provided, however that this provision shall not affect the right of any stockholder
who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such stockholder’s demand
for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the merger or consolidation within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or
consolidation, as set forth in subsection (e) of this section.

(l) The shares of the surviving or resulting corporation to which the shares of such objecting stockholders would have been converted
had they assented to the merger or consolidation shall have the status of authorized and unissued shares of the surviving or resulting
corporation.
