JOINT PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS

MERGER PROPOSED — YOUR VOTE IS VERY IMPORTANT

Dear Shareholder:

On October 17, 2017, we will hold a special meeting of the shareholders of Southwest Bancorp, Inc., or
OKSB, to vote on a proposal to merge with Simmons First National Corporation, or Simmons. On December 14,
2016, Simmons and OKSB entered into an agreement and plan of merger, as amended, which we refer to as the
OKSB merger agreement, that provides for the merger of OKSB with and into Simmons, with Simmons as the
surviving corporation, which we refer to as the OKSB merger.

In the OKSB merger, each share of OKSB common stock (except for shares of OKSB common stock held
by OKSB or Simmons and any dissenting shares) will be converted into the right to receive, subject to possible
adjustment, (1) 0.3903 shares of Simmons common stock, which we refer to as the OKSB stock consideration,
and (2) $5.11 in cash, which we refer to as the OKSB cash consideration, and together with the OKSB stock
consideration, the OKSB merger consideration. In the aggregate, Simmons expects to issue approximately
7,250,000 shares of common stock and pay approximately $95 million to OKSB shareholders upon completion of
the OKSB merger. Although the number of shares of Simmons common stock that OKSB shareholders will
receive is fixed, the market value of the OKSB merger consideration will fluctuate with the market price of
Simmons common stock and will not be known at the time OKSB shareholders vote on the OKSB merger. Based
on the closing sales price of Simmons common stock on December 13, 2016, the last trading day prior to the
announcement of the OKSB merger, and September 8, 2017, the last practicable trading day before the date of
this joint proxy statement/prospectus, the implied aggregate value of the OKSB merger consideration is
approximately $564.3 million, or $30.38 per share of OKSB common stock, and $466.1 million, or $25.09 per
share of OKSB common stock, respectively. We urge you to obtain current market quotations for Simmons
common stock, which is traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “SFNC.”

In addition to the merger with OKSB, Simmons and First Texas BHC, Inc., or First Texas, have also entered
into an agreement and plan of merger, as amended, which we refer to as the First Texas merger agreement, that
provides for the combination of First Texas with Simmons, with Simmons as the surviving corporation, which we
refer to as the First Texas merger. First Texas is headquartered in Fort Worth, Texas, operates 15 banking centers
and three loan production offices in north Texas, and has assets of approximately $2.2 billion. The shareholders
of First Texas will receive, subject to possible adjustment and based on certain assumptions as described
elsewhere in this joint proxy statement/prospectus, (1) 0.8264 shares of Simmons common stock for each of their
shares of First Texas common stock, which we refer to as the First Texas stock consideration, and (2) $6.93 in
cash, which we refer to as the First Texas cash consideration, and together with the First Texas stock
consideration, the First Texas merger consideration. In the aggregate, Simmons will issue 6,500,000 shares of
common stock and pay $70 million to First Texas shareholders upon completion of the First Texas merger.

In addition, the OKSB board of directors and the First Texas board of directors may terminate their
respective merger agreement if the average closing price of Simmons common stock is below the threshold
specified in the applicable merger agreement and below a threshold relative to an index of banking stocks. If
either the OKSB board of directors or the First Texas board of directors terminates their respective merger
agreement, Simmons may prevent the applicable merger agreement from being terminated by electing to pay
additional cash consideration for each share of OKSB common stock or First Texas common stock, as applicable.
See “The Merger Agreements — Termination of the Merger Agreements.”

TABLE OF CONTENTS

While the shareholders of Simmons and First Texas will need to approve the First Texas merger for it to be
consummated, the shareholders of OKSB will not. Information included in this joint proxy statement/ prospectus
with respect to First Texas and the First Texas merger is provided as information for OKSB shareholders to
consider when voting upon the OKSB merger and for ease of reference for Simmons shareholders as they are
required to consider and vote upon both the OKSB merger and the First Texas merger.

If the OKSB merger and First Texas merger are both completed, existing Simmons shareholders would own
approximately 70.0% of Simmons common stock immediately following completion of the mergers, while
former OKSB shareholders would own approximately 15.8% and former First Texas shareholders would own
approximately 14.2%. If the OKSB merger is completed, but the First Texas merger is not completed, existing
Simmons and OKSB shareholders would own approximately 81.6% and 18.4%, respectively, of Simmons
common stock upon completion of the OKSB merger.

Neither the closing of the OKSB merger nor the closing of the First Texas merger is conditioned upon
closing of the other merger.

Simmons and OKSB will each hold a special meeting of their respective shareholders in connection with the
OKSB merger. At such special meetings, Simmons and OKSB shareholders will be asked to vote to approve the
OKSB merger agreement and related matters as described in the attached joint proxy statement/prospectus.
Approval of the OKSB merger agreement by Simmons shareholders requires the affirmative vote of the holders
of a majority of votes entitled to be cast, and approval of the OKSB merger agreement by OKSB shareholders
requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the votes entitled to be cast.

At the Simmons special meeting, the Simmons shareholders also will be asked to vote to approve the First
Texas merger agreement and related matters as described in the attached joint proxy statement/ prospectus. First
Texas will also hold a special meeting of its shareholders in connection with the First Texas merger. At such
special meeting, First Texas shareholders will be asked to vote to approve the First Texas merger agreement and
related matters as described in the attached joint proxy statement/prospectus.

The special meeting of OKSB shareholders will be held on October 17, 2017, at 6301 Waterford Blvd., Suite
400, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma 73118, at 10:00 a.m., local time. The special meeting of Simmons shareholders
will be held on October 18, 2017, in the Ryburn Community Room of Simmons’ Pine Bluff, Arkansas,
headquarters (501 Main St., Pine Bluff, Arkansas, 71601), at 11:00 a.m., local time.

OKSB’s board of directors unanimously recommends that OKSB shareholders vote “FOR” the
approval of the OKSB merger agreement, “FOR” the approval, on a non-binding advisory basis, of
compensation that may be paid or become payable to OKSB’s named executive officers in connection with
the completion of the OKSB merger and, if necessary or appropriate, “FOR” the proposal to adjourn the
OKSB special meeting for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies in favor of adoption of the OKSB
merger agreement.

This joint proxy statement/prospectus describes the special meeting of Simmons, the special meeting of
OKSB, the special meeting of First Texas, the OKSB merger, the First Texas merger, the documents related to the
mergers and other related matters. Please carefully read this entire joint proxy statement/prospectus,
including “Risk Factors,” beginning on page 48, for a discussion of the risks relating to the proposed
OKSB merger. You also can obtain information about Simmons from documents that it has filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission.

Unless the context otherwise requires, references in this joint proxy statement/prospectus to
“Simmons” refer to Simmons First National Corporation, an Arkansas corporation, and its subsidiaries,
references to “OKSB” refer to Southwest Bancorp, Inc., an Oklahoma corporation, and its subsidiaries,
and references to “First Texas” refer to First Texas BHC, Inc., a Texas corporation, and its subsidiaries.

It is important to note that the amount of First Texas merger consideration may increase or decrease
due to changes in the price of Simmons common stock or the number of  (i) shares of First Texas common
stock outstanding, (ii) shares of First Texas common stock subject to First Texas options, and (iii) shares of
First Texas common stock subject to stock appreciation rights granted by First Texas under a First Texas
stock plan, outstanding after the date hereof. The price of Simmons common stock or the number of  (i)
shares of First Texas common stock outstanding, (ii) shares of First Texas common stock subject to First
Texas options, and (iii) shares of First Texas common stock subject to stock appreciation rights granted by
First Texas under a First Texas stock plan, for purposes of calculating the First Texas merger
consideration will not be known until immediately prior to the effective time of the First Texas merger. As
a result, the First Texas merger consideration shown throughout this joint proxy statement/prospectus is
for illustrative purposes only based on the assumptions described herein.

The mergers cannot be completed unless, among other things, the Simmons shareholders, OKSB
shareholders and First Texas shareholders approve their respective proposals to approve the merger
agreements.

In order to approve the mergers and related matters, Simmons, OKSB and First Texas have each called a
special meeting of their shareholders, which we refer to as the Simmons special meeting, the OKSB special
meeting and the First Texas special meeting, respectively. This document serves as a proxy statement for the
Simmons special meeting, the OKSB special meeting and the First Texas special meeting and describes the
proposals to be presented at the meetings.

the OKSB stock consideration, and (2) $5.11 in cash, which we refer to as the OKSB cash

TABLE OF CONTENTS

This document is also a prospectus that is being delivered to OKSB shareholders and First Texas
shareholders because Simmons is offering shares of its common stock to OKSB shareholders and First Texas
shareholders as partial consideration for the OKSB merger and First Texas merger, respectively.

This joint proxy statement/prospectus contains important information about the mergers and the other
proposals being voted on at the meetings. You should read it carefully and in its entirety. The enclosed
materials allow you to have your shares voted by proxy without attending your meeting. Your vote is
important. We encourage you to submit your proxy as soon as possible.

Completion of the OKSB merger and the First Texas merger are not conditioned upon approval of any of the
Simmons director proposal, Simmons/OKSB adjournment proposal or the Simmons/First Texas
adjournment proposal. Simmons expects that the Simmons/OKSB adjournment proposal and the
Simmons/First Texas adjournment proposal will not be brought before the Simmons special meeting if there
are sufficient votes to approve the OKSB merger proposal and the First Texas merger proposal, respectively.

Completion of the OKSB merger is not conditioned upon approval of the OKSB compensation proposal or
the OKSB adjournment proposal. OKSB expects that the OKSB adjournment proposal will not be brought

Q: What will First Texas shareholders receive in the merger?
A: If the First Texas merger is completed, each share of First Texas common stock will be converted into the

right to receive, subject to possible adjustment and based on certain assumptions described below, (1)
0.8264 shares of Simmons common stock, which we refer to as the First Texas stock consideration, and (2)
$6.93 in cash, which we refer to as the First Texas cash consideration, and together with the First Texas
stock consideration, the First Texas merger consideration, for each share of First Texas common stock held
immediately prior to the First Texas merger. The amount of the First Texas merger consideration described
above is based on the following assumptions derived from amounts that were applicable on September 8,
2017: (1) immediately prior to the effective time of the First Texas merger, there are (a) 7,884,553 shares of
First Texas common stock outstanding, (b) 644,191 shares of First Texas common stock subject to First
Texas options outstanding with a weighted average exercise price of  $27.76 per share, (c) 13,000 shares of
First Texas common stock subject to First Texas SARs outstanding with a weighted average initial value of 
$19.76 per First Texas SAR, (d) 5,710 shares of First Texas common stock subject to First Texas restricted
stock units and (e), 25,648 the total number of shares of First Texas common stock held in the First Texas
and subsidiaries Employees Stock Ownership Plan, which we refer to as the First Texas ESOP, that are not
allocated to participants as of the effective time of the merger, which we refer to as the First Texas
Unallocated ESOP shares, and (2) the average closing price per share of Simmons common stock at the
closing of the First Texas merger is $51.20, which was the closing sales price of Simmons common stock on
September 8, 2017, the last practicable trading day before the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus.
Since we will not know the actual amounts reflected in these assumptions until immediately prior to the
effective time of the First Texas merger, the amount of First Texas stock consideration and First Texas cash
consideration actually received by First Texas shareholders may be different than the amounts described
herein. We refer to the OKSB merger consideration and the First Texas merger consideration collectively as
the merger consideration. Simmons will not issue any fractional shares of Simmons common stock in the
First Texas merger. First Texas shareholders who would otherwise be entitled to a fractional share of
Simmons common stock upon the completion of the merger will instead receive an amount in cash equal to
the product of the average closing price of Simmons common stock as reported on the Nasdaq Global Select
Market for the 20 consecutive trading days ending on the 10th day before the date on which the First Texas
merger is completed, times the fraction of a share of Simmons common stock to which the First Texas
shareholder otherwise would be entitled.

consideration, and together with the OKSB stock consideration, the OKSB merger consideration, for each
share of OKSB common stock held immediately prior to the OKSB merger. Simmons will not issue any
fractional shares of Simmons common stock in the OKSB merger. OKSB shareholders who would otherwise
be entitled to a fractional share of Simmons common stock upon the completion of the OKSB merger will
instead receive an amount in cash equal to the product of the average closing price of Simmons common
stock as reported on the Nasdaq Global Select Market for the 20 consecutive trading days ending on the 10th
day before the date on which the OKSB merger is completed, times the fraction of a share of Simmons
common stock to which the OKSB shareholder otherwise would be entitled.

If the number of shares of OKSB common stock outstanding (including shares of OKSB restricted stock)
increases or decreases prior to the effective time of the OKSB merger, then the OKSB merger consideration
will be equitably and proportionately adjusted, if necessary and without duplication, to fully effect such
change. We refer to the number of shares of Simmons common stock to be issued for each share of OKSB
common stock, as adjusted, as the OKSB exchange ratio. In addition, if the OKSB board of directors
exercises its right to terminate the OKSB merger agreement due to the decrease in the average closing price
of Simmons common stock below $39.66 and relative to an index of banking stocks, Simmons may prevent
the OKSB merger agreement from being terminated by electing to pay additional cash consideration for each
share of OKSB common stock and no termination will occur. See “The Merger Agreements — Termination
of the Merger Agreements.”

If the number of shares of First Texas common stock outstanding (including shares of First Texas common
stock subject to First Texas equity award agreements) increases or decreases prior to the effective time of the
First Texas merger other than as permitted under the terms of the First Texas

Q: What will Simmons shareholders receive in the mergers?

A: If either or both of the mergers are completed, Simmons shareholders will not receive any merger
consideration and will continue to hold the number of shares of Simmons common stock that they currently
hold. Following the mergers, shares of Simmons common stock will continue to be traded on the Nasdaq
Global Select Market under the symbol “SFNC.”

merger agreement, then the First Texas merger consideration will be equitably and proportionately adjusted,
if necessary and without duplication, to fully effect such change, but in no event will Simmons issue more
than 6,500,000 shares of Simmons common stock or pay aggregate cash consideration in excess of  $70
million in the First Texas merger. We refer to the number of shares of Simmons common stock to be issued
for each of share of First Texas common stock, as adjusted, as the First Texas exchange ratio. In addition, if
the First Texas board of directors exercises its right to terminate the First Texas merger agreement due to the
decrease in the average closing price of Simmons common stock below $39.98 and relative to an index of
banking stocks, Simmons may prevent the First Texas merger agreement from being terminated by electing
to pay additional cash consideration for each share of First Texas common stock. See “The Merger
Agreements — Termination of the Merger Agreements.”

Each outstanding share of OKSB restricted stock will vest at the effective time of the OKSB merger and will
be converted automatically into the right to receive the OKSB merger consideration in the same manner as
unrestricted shares of OKSB common stock. Simmons will be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the
exchange agent to deduct and withhold, all amounts payable with respect to OKSB restricted stock as it is
required to deduct and withhold under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, which we refer to as
the Code, or any provisions of federal, state, local or foreign tax law.

OKSB Employee Stock Purchase Plan

Each outstanding share of OKSB common stock held in the OKSB Employee Stock Purchase Plan will be
converted into the right to receive the OKSB merger consideration in the same manner as other shares of
OKSB common stock.

Each option, whether vested or unvested, to purchase shares of First Texas common stock outstanding
immediately prior to the effective time of the First Texas merger will be cancelled and converted into the
right to receive a cash payment equal to the difference between (1) the First Texas cash consideration plus
the cash equivalent of the First Texas stock consideration and (2) the exercise price of such option. Any such
option with an exercise price per share that equals or exceeds the amount set forth in (1) will be cancelled at
the effective time of the merger with no consideration paid to the option holder. Simmons will be entitled to
deduct and withhold, or cause the exchange agent to deduct and withhold, all amounts payable with respect
to First Texas stock options as it is required to deduct and withhold under the Code or any provisions of
federal, state, local or foreign tax law.

First Texas Restricted Stock Units

Each outstanding unit in respect of First Texas common stock that is subject to vesting, repurchase or lapse
restriction, which we refer to as First Texas RSUs, will fully vest at the effective time of the First Texas
merger and will be cancelled and converted automatically into the right to receive the First Texas merger
consideration on the same basis as all other shares of First Texas common stock and treating the First Texas
RSUs as if they were shares of First Texas common stock for such purposes. Simmons

Q: Will the value of the merger consideration change between the date of this joint proxy statement/ 
prospectus and the time the mergers are completed?

A: Because the number of shares of Simmons common stock that both OKSB and First Texas shareholders will
receive for each share of OKSB common stock and First Texas common stock, respectively, is fixed
(subject, in each case, to possible adjustment), the value of the merger consideration in each merger will
fluctuate between the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus and the completion of the mergers based
upon the market value for Simmons common stock. Any fluctuation in the market price of Simmons
common stock after the date of this joint proxy statement/ prospectus will change the value of the shares of
Simmons common stock that both OKSB and First Texas shareholders will receive, subject to any additional
cash payment made by Simmons in connection with the exercise of its right to pay additional cash
consideration in the event the trading price of its common stock falls below the amount referenced in the
applicable merger agreement and underperforms an index of banking companies by more than 20% over a
designated measurement period. In addition, the market price of Simmons common stock will impact the
amounts paid for the First Texas stock options, the First Texas SARs and the First Texas unallocated ESOP
shares, which will then affect the amount of First Texas merger consideration.

Q: How does Simmons’ board of directors recommend that Simmons shareholders vote at the Simmons
special meeting?

A: Simmons’ board of directors unanimously recommends that Simmons shareholders vote “FOR” the OKSB
merger proposal, “FOR” the First Texas merger proposal, “FOR” the Simmons director proposal, “FOR”
the Simmons/OKSB adjournment proposal, if necessary or appropriate, and “FOR” the Simmons/First
Texas adjournment proposal, if necessary or appropriate.

Q: How does OKSB’s board of directors recommend that OKSB shareholders vote at the OKSB special
meeting?

A: OKSB’s board of directors unanimously recommends that OKSB shareholders vote “FOR” the OKSB
merger proposal, “FOR” the OKSB compensation proposal and “FOR” the OKSB adjournment proposal, if
necessary or appropriate.

Q: How does First Texas’ board of directors recommend that First Texas shareholders vote at the First
Texas special meeting?

A: First Texas’ board of directors unanimously recommends that First Texas shareholders vote “FOR” the First
Texas merger proposal and “FOR” the First Texas adjournment proposal, if necessary or appropriate.

will be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the exchange agent to deduct and withhold, all amounts
payable with respect to First Texas RSUs as it is required to deduct and withhold under the Code or any
provisions of federal, state, local or foreign tax law.

First Texas Stock Appreciation Rights

Each outstanding stock appreciation right granted by First Texas under a First Texas stock plan, which we
refer to as First Texas SARs, will fully vest and be cancelled and converted automatically into the right to
receive from Simmons a cash payment equal to the difference between (1) the First Texas cash consideration
plus the cash equivalent of the First Texas stock consideration and (2) the initial value of the First Texas
SAR as of the grant date set forth in the applicable award agreement.

First Texas Employee Stock Ownership Plan

The First Texas Unallocated ESOP shares will be cancelled and Simmons will pay to the trustee of the First
Texas ESOP an aggregate cash payment equal to the sum of  (1) the cash equivalent of the First Texas stock
consideration and (2) the product of the First Texas Unallocated ESOP shares and First Texas cash
consideration. The shares of First Texas common stock that are allocated in the First Texas ESOP will be
converted automatically into the right to receive the First Texas merger consideration and the First Texas
merger consideration will be distributed by the trustee to participants in accordance with their allocations.

Q: Why is my vote important?

A: If you do not vote, it will be more difficult for Simmons, OKSB or First Texas to obtain the necessary
quorum to hold their special meetings. In addition, your failure to submit a proxy or vote in person, failure
to vote by telephone or the internet for Simmons or OKSB shareholders, or failure to instruct your bank or
broker how to vote if you hold your shares in “street name,” or abstention will have the same effect as a vote
“AGAINST” approval of the merger agreements. The merger agreements must be approved by the
affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote by Simmons shareholders on both
merger agreements, the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote by OKSB
shareholders on the OKSB merger agreement and the affirmative vote of holders of at least two-thirds of the
shares entitled to vote by First Texas shareholders on the First Texas merger agreement. The Simmons board
of directors unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” both merger proposals, and the OKSB board of
directors and the First Texas board of directors each unanimously recommend that you vote “FOR” the
OKSB merger proposal and “FOR” the First Texas merger proposal, respectively.

Q: If my shares of common stock are held in “street name” by my bank or broker, will my bank or
broker automatically vote my shares for me?

A: No. Your bank or broker cannot vote your shares without instructions from you, and if you fail to provide
instructions to your bank or broker it will have the effect of a vote against the OKSB merger proposal and
the First Texas merger proposal, as applicable. You should instruct your bank or broker how to vote your
shares in accordance with the instructions provided to you. Please check the voting form used by your bank
or broker.

Q: How do I vote if I own shares through the Simmons First National Corporation 401(k) Plan, or the
Simmons 401(k) Plan?

A: You will be given the opportunity to instruct the trustee of the Simmons 401(k) Plan how to vote the shares
that you hold in your account. To the extent that you do not timely give such instructions, your shares will
not be voted.

Q: How do I vote if I own shares through the First Texas ESOP?

A: You will be given the opportunity to instruct the independent trustee of the First Texas ESOP how to vote
the shares that you hold in your account. To the extent that you do not timely give such instructions, your
shares will not be voted.

Q: Can I attend the special meeting and vote my shares in person?

A: Yes. All shareholders of Simmons, OKSB and First Texas, including shareholders of record and
shareholders who hold their shares through banks, brokers, nominees or any other holder of record, are
invited to attend their respective meetings. Holders of record of Simmons, OKSB and First Texas common
stock can vote in person at the Simmons special meeting, OKSB special meeting and First Texas special
meeting, respectively. Holders of record of Simmons common stock and OKSB common stock can also vote
by telephone or the internet. If you are not a shareholder of record, you must obtain a proxy card, executed
in your favor, from the record holder of your shares, such as a broker, bank or other nominee, to be able to
vote in person at the meetings. If you plan to attend your meeting, you must hold your shares in your own
name or bring a letter from the record holder of your shares confirming your ownership and a valid photo
identification with you in order to be admitted. A copy or printout of a brokerage statement will not be
sufficient without a signed letter from the bank, broker or other nominee through which you
beneficially own shares. Simmons, OKSB and First Texas reserve the right to refuse admittance to anyone
without proper proof of share ownership or without proper photo identification.

Q: Can I change my vote?

A: Simmons shareholders:   Yes. If you are a holder of record of Simmons common stock, you may revoke any
proxy at any time before it is voted by (1) signing and returning a proxy card with a later date, (2) delivering
a written revocation letter to Simmons’ corporate secretary, (3) attending the special

Q: What are the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the mergers to OKSB shareholders and First
Texas shareholders?

A: The respective obligations of Simmons, OKSB and First Texas to complete the mergers are conditioned
upon, each of Simmons, OKSB and First Texas receiving a legal opinion from Covington & Burling LLP to
the effect that the OKSB merger and the First Texas merger, as applicable, will qualify as a “reorganization”
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and that each of Simmons, OKSB and First Texas will be
treated as a party to the reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(b) of the Code. Neither Simmons,
OKSB nor First Texas currently intends to waive this condition to the consummation of the OKSB merger or
the First Texas merger, as applicable. If any party waives this condition after this registration statement is
declared effective by the SEC, and if the tax consequences of the merger to OKSB shareholders or First
Texas shareholders have materially changed, Simmons and OKSB or First Texas, as applicable, will
recirculate appropriate soliciting materials to resolicit the votes of OKSB shareholders or First Texas
shareholders. As a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, for U.S. federal
income tax purposes, holders of OKSB common stock and First Texas common stock will not generally
recognize any loss, but will generally recognize gain, if any, equal to the lesser of  (1) the excess, if any, of
the sum of the cash received and the fair market value of the Simmons common stock received pursuant to
the merger over that holder’s adjusted tax basis in his or her shares of OKSB or First Texas common stock
surrendered, and (2) the amount of cash consideration received by that holder pursuant to the OKSB merger
or First Texas merger, respectively.

In the Mergers, both OKSB Shareholders and First Texas Shareholders Will Receive Shares of Simmons

Simmons and OKSB, and Simmons and First Texas are respectively proposing strategic mergers. If the

immediately prior to the merger. If the First Texas merger is completed, First Texas shareholders will receive,
subject to possible adjustment, 0.8264 shares of Simmons common stock plus $6.93 in cash for each share of
First Texas they hold immediately prior to the merger, subject to an aggregate consideration limit of 6,500,000
shares of Simmons common stock and $70 million in cash and based on the following assumptions derived from
amounts that were applicable on September 8, 2017: (1) immediately prior to the effective time of the First Texas
merger, there are (a) 7,884,553 shares of First Texas common stock outstanding, (b) 644,191 shares of First Texas
common stock subject to First Texas options outstanding, with a weighted average exercise price of  $27.76 per
option (c) 13,000 shares of First Texas common stock subject to First Texas SARs outstanding with a weighted
average initial value of  $19.76 per First Texas SAR, (d) 5,710 shares of First Texas common stock subject to
First Texas restricted stock units and (e) 25,648 First Texas Unallocated ESOP Shares outstanding, and (2) the
average closing price per share of Simmons common stock at the closing of the First Texas merger is $51.20,
which was the closing sales price of Simmons common stock on September 8, 2017, the last practicable trading
day before the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus. Since we will not know the actual amounts reflected
in these assumptions until immediately prior to the effective time of the First Texas merger, the amount of First
Texas stock consideration and First Texas cash consideration actually received by First Texas shareholders may
be different than the amounts described herein. Simmons will not issue any fractional shares of Simmons
common stock in the mergers. Instead, OKSB shareholders and First Texas shareholders who would otherwise be
entitled to a fraction of a share of Simmons common stock upon the completion of the applicable merger will
instead receive, for the fraction of a share, an amount in cash based on the average recent trading prices of
Simmons common stock as further discussed in this joint proxy statement/ prospectus.

Simmons common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “SFNC.” The
following tables show the closing sale prices of Simmons common stock as reported on the Nasdaq Global Select
Market on December 13, 2016, the last full trading day before the public announcement of the OKSB merger
agreement, January 20, 2017, the last full trading day before the public announcement of the First Texas merger
agreement, and on September 8, 2017, the last practicable trading day before the date of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus. These tables also show (1) the implied value of the OKSB stock consideration payable for
each share of OKSB common stock, which we calculated by multiplying the closing price of Simmons common
stock on those dates by the exchange ratio of 0.3903, (2) the implied value of the First Texas stock consideration
payable for each share of First Texas common stock, which we calculated by multiplying the closing price of
Simmons common stock on those dates by the exchange ratio of 0.8264, which will fluctuate due to changes in
the number of shares of First Texas common stock outstanding and the number of shares of First Texas common
stock subject to First Texas options and First Texas SARs as further discussed in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus, (3) the OKSB cash consideration payable for each share of OKSB common stock, which
will remain a fixed amount regardless of any change in the market value of the OKSB stock consideration, (4) the
First Texas cash consideration payable for each share of First Texas common stock, which will fluctuate due to
changes in the market price of Simmons common stock and changes in the number of shares of First Texas
common stock outstanding and the number of shares of First Texas common stock subject to First Texas options
and First Texas SARs as further discussed in this joint proxy statement/prospectus, and (5) the implied value of
the OKSB merger consideration and the First Texas merger consideration for each share of OKSB common stock
and First Texas common stock on those dates.

OKSB common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “OKSB.” On
December 13, 2016, the last full trading day before the public announcement of the OKSB merger agreement, the
closing sales price of OKSB common stock as reported on the Nasdaq Global Select Market was $24.30. On
September 8, 2017, the last practicable trading day before the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, the
closing sales price of OKSB common stock as reported on the Nasdaq Global Select Market was $24.90.

There is no established public trading market for First Texas common stock. In addition, because there have
been no recent private sales of First Texas common stock of which Simmons or First Texas are aware, no recent
price data regarding First Texas common stock is available.

Material United States Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Mergers (page 167)

As a condition to the respective obligations of Simmons, OKSB and First Texas, each of Simmons, OKSB
and First Texas shall receive an opinion from Covington & Burling LLP to the effect that the respective merger
will qualify as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. Neither Simmons, OKSB
nor First Texas currently intends to waive this condition to the consummation of the OKSB merger or the First
Texas merger, as applicable. If any party waives this condition after this registration statement is declared
effective by the SEC, and if the tax consequences of the merger to OKSB shareholders or First Texas
shareholders have materially changed, Simmons and OKSB or First Texas, as applicable, will recirculate
appropriate soliciting materials to resolicit the votes of OKSB shareholders or First Texas shareholders. As a
“reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, holders
of OKSB common stock and First Texas common stock will not generally recognize any loss, but will generally
recognize gain, if any, equal to the lesser of  (1) the excess, if any, of the sum of the cash received and the fair
market value of the Simmons common stock received pursuant to the merger over that holder’s adjusted tax basis
in his or her shares of OKSB or First Texas common stock surrendered, and (2) the amount of cash consideration
received by that holder pursuant to the OKSB merger or First Texas merger, respectively.

The U.S. federal income tax consequences described above may not apply to all holders of OKSB
common stock and First Texas common stock. Your tax consequences will depend on your individual
situation. Accordingly, we strongly urge you to consult your independent tax advisor for a full
understanding of the particular tax consequences of the mergers to you.

Interests of OKSB’s Directors and Executive Officers in the OKSB Merger (page 106)

OKSB shareholders should be aware that some of OKSB’s directors and executive officers have interests in
the OKSB merger and have arrangements that are different from, or in addition to, those of OKSB shareholders
generally. OKSB’s board of directors was aware of these interests and considered these interests, among other
matters, when making its decision to adopt the OKSB merger agreement, and in recommending that OKSB
shareholders vote in favor of approving the OKSB merger agreement.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OKSB has entered into employment agreements with Mark Funke and Joe Shockley, its president and chief
executive officer and chief financial officer, respectively, and change of control agreements with its other
executive officers, which obligate OKSB to pay certain severance benefits to such OKSB executive officers in
the event of termination without cause or resignation under certain circumstances constituting an effective
termination within 24 months following a change of control, such as the OKSB merger. Furthermore, pursuant to
the terms of the restricted stock award agreements between OKSB and the OKSB executive officers, all unvested
shares of OKSB restricted stock granted to the OKSB executive officers will vest immediately upon a change of
control, such as the OKSB merger.

It is expected that following the completion of the OKSB merger, Mark W. Funke, currently the president
and chief executive officer of OKSB and OKSB Bank, will become an officer of Simmons Bank after
consummation of the merger of OKSB Bank with and into Simmons Bank. It is a condition to Simmons’
obligation to consummate the OKSB merger that Simmons and Mr. Funke enter into a new employment
arrangement that is satisfactory to Simmons, and that Mr. Funke and OKSB terminate his existing employment
agreement. It is also expected that Russell W. Teubner, currently a member of the OKSB board of directors, will
join the Simmons board of directors after consummation of the OKSB merger if the Simmons director proposal is
approved. While there are no other employment or other agreements being offered to employees or directors of
OKSB, most of the officers and other employees of OKSB expect to be retained after the OKSB merger, and such
employees will then participate in the employee benefit plans of Simmons and receive credit for prior service.

Finally, Simmons has agreed to maintain a policy of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance coverage for
the benefit of OKSB’s directors and officers for six years following completion of the OKSB merger as long as
the premium to be paid is not more than 200% of the current annual premium paid by OKSB for such insurance.

For a more complete description of these interests, see “The OKSB Merger — Interests of OKSB’s Directors
and Executive Officers in the OKSB Merger.”

Interests of First Texas’ Directors and Executive Officers in the First Texas Merger (page 133)

First Texas shareholders should be aware that some of First Texas’ directors and executive officers have
interests in the First Texas merger and have arrangements that are different from, or in addition to, those of First
Texas shareholders generally. First Texas’ board of directors was aware of these interests and considered these
interests, among other matters, when making its decision to adopt the First Texas merger agreement, and in
recommending that First Texas shareholders vote in favor of approving the First Texas merger agreement.

It is expected that Tom Purvis, currently a member of the First Texas board of directors, will join the
Simmons board of directors after consummation of the First Texas merger if the Simmons director proposal is
approved. While there are no employment or other agreements being offered to employees or directors of First
Texas, most of the officers and other employees of First Texas expect to be retained after the First Texas merger,
and such employees will then participate in the employee benefit plans of Simmons and receive credit for prior
service.

Charles Cox, as Chief Financial Officer, Terry Smith, as Chief Lending Officer, and Randy Talley, as Chief
Credit Officer, have each entered into separate severance and change in control agreements with First Texas. The
payment for Mr. Cox amounts to two times his annual base salary at the time of the change of control event. Mr.
Smith will also receive a payment of two times his base salary upon a change of control event. Mr. Talley’s
arrangement provides for a payment of one times his annual salary at the time of a change of control event, but
only if his position is eliminated within 12 months after the change of control becomes effective.

Finally, Simmons has agreed to maintain a policy of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance coverage for
the benefit of First Texas’ directors and officers for six years following completion of the First Texas merger as
long as the premium to be paid is not more than 200% of the current annual premium paid by First Texas for such
insurance.

Conditions that Must Be Satisfied or Waived for the Mergers To Occur (page 160)

Currently, we expect to consummate the mergers no earlier than the fourth quarter of 2017. As more fully
described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus and in the merger agreements, consummation of the mergers
depends on a number of conditions being satisfied or, where legally permissible, waived. The conditions to each

Termination Fee for the OKSB Merger (page 164)

If the OKSB merger agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, and/or OKSB enters into a
definitive agreement with respect to or consummate another acquisition proposal, OKSB may be required to pay
to Simmons a termination fee equal to $20 million. This termination fee could discourage other companies from

TABLE OF CONTENTS

joint proxy statement/prospectus, Simmons and First Texas have received approval from the Federal Reserve
Board to consummate the First Texas merger and have filed applications and notifications to obtain the required
regulatory approval from the Texas Department of Banking.

Although neither Simmons nor First Texas knows of any reason why these regulatory approvals cannot be
obtained in a timely manner, Simmons and First Texas cannot be certain when or if they will be obtained.
Accordingly, no assurance can be given that the necessary regulatory approvals will be received in time to effect
the mergers in the fourth quarter of 2017.

Board of Directors and Executive Officers of Simmons and Simmons Bank Following the Effective Time of
the Mergers (page 138)

The directors and officers of Simmons immediately prior to the effective time of the mergers will continue
as the directors and officers of the surviving corporation of the mergers, except that, if the Simmons director
proposal is approved, the number of directors constituting the Simmons board of directors will be increased by
two and following the effective time of the First Texas merger, Tom Purvis will be appointed to the Simmons
board of directors and following the effective time of the OKSB merger, Russell W. Teubner will be appointed to
the Simmons board of directors, subject in each case to approval of the Simmons director proposal. Following the
consummation of the mergers, each of OKSB Bank and First Texas Bank will operate as a separate bank
subsidiary of Simmons until it is merged with and into Simmons Bank.

The Rights of OKSB and First Texas Shareholders Will Change as a Result of the Mergers (pages 173 and
184)

The rights of OKSB and First Texas shareholders will change as a result of the mergers due to differences in
the governing documents and states of incorporation for Simmons, OKSB and First Texas. The rights of OKSB
shareholders are governed by Oklahoma law and by OKSB’s certificate of incorporation and bylaws, each as
amended to date, and the rights of First Texas shareholders are governed by Texas law and by First Texas’
certificate of formation and bylaws, each as amended to date. Upon the completion of the mergers, OKSB and
First Texas shareholders will become shareholders of Simmons, as the continuing legal entity in the mergers, and
the rights of OKSB and First Texas shareholders will therefore be governed by Arkansas law and Simmons’
articles of incorporation and bylaws.

See “Comparison of Shareholders’ Rights of Simmons and OKSB” and “Comparison of Shareholders’
Rights of Simmons and First Texas” for a description of the material differences in shareholders’ rights between
Simmons and OKSB and Simmons and First Texas.

SELECTED CONSOLIDATED HISTORICAL FINANCIAL DATA OF SIMMONS

The following table sets forth highlights from Simmons’ consolidated financial data as of and for the six
months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 and as of and for each of the five years ended December 31, 2016. Results
from past periods are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for any future period. The results
of operations for the six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results of
operations for the full year or any other interim period. Simmons’ management prepared the unaudited
information on the same basis as it prepared Simmons’ audited consolidated financial statements. In the opinion
of Simmons’ management, this information reflects all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of this data
for those dates. You should read this information in conjunction with Simmons’ consolidated financial statements
and related notes included in Simmons’ Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 and
its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2017, each of which is incorporated by

(1) Diluted core earnings per share is a non-GAAP financial measure. Diluted core earnings per share excludes
from net income certain non-core items and then is divided by average diluted common shares outstanding.
See “GAAP Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for a GAAP reconciliation of this
non-GAAP financial measure.

(2) Because of Simmons’ significant level of intangible assets, total goodwill and core deposit premiums,
management of Simmons believes a useful calculation for investors in their analysis of Simmons is tangible
book value per share, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Tangible book value per share is calculated
by subtracting goodwill and intangible assets from total common shareholders’ equity, and dividing the
resulting number by the common stock outstanding at period end. See “GAAP Reconciliation of Non-
GAAP Financial Measures” below for a GAAP reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure.

(3) Allowance for loan losses at June 30, 2017 includes $391,000 allowance for loans acquired (not shown in
the table above). The total allowance for loan losses at June 30, 2017 was $41,770,000. June 30, 2016,
December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 includes $954,000 allowance for loans acquired (not shown in the table
above). The total allowance for loan losses at June 30, 2106, December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 was
$34,477,000, $37,240,000, $32,305,000 and $29,982,000, respectively.

(4) Tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio is a non-GAAP financial measure. The tangible common
equity to tangible assets ratio is calculated by dividing total common shareholders’ equity less goodwill and
other intangible assets (resulting in tangible common equity) by total assets less goodwill and other
intangible assets as and for the periods ended presented above. See “GAAP Reconciliation of Non-GAAP
Financial Measures” below for a GAAP reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure.

(5) Return on average tangible equity is a non-GAAP financial measure that removes the effect of goodwill and
intangible assets, as well as the amortization of intangibles, from the return on average equity. This non-
GAAP financial measure is calculated as net income, adjusted for the tax-effected effect of intangibles,
divided by average tangible equity which is calculated as average shareholders’ equity for the period
presented less goodwill and other intangible assets. See “GAAP Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial
Measures” below for a GAAP reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure.

(6) Fully taxable equivalent (assuming an income tax rate of 39.225%).

(7) The efficiency ratio is noninterest expense before foreclosed property expense and amortization of
intangibles as a percent of net interest income (fully taxable equivalent) and noninterest revenues, excluding
gains and losses from securities transactions and non-core items. See “GAAP Reconciliation of Non-GAAP
Financial Measures” below for a GAAP reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure.

(8) Excludes all loans acquired and excludes foreclosed assets acquired, covered by FDIC loss share
agreements, except for their inclusion in total assets.

UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED 
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The following unaudited pro forma combined condensed consolidated financial statements and explanatory
notes show the impact on the historical financial positions and results of operations of Simmons, OKSB and First
Texas and have been prepared to illustrate the effects of the OKSB merger and First Texas merger under the
acquisition method of accounting with Simmons treated as the acquirer. The following unaudited pro forma
combined condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared using the acquisition method of
accounting, giving effect to our completed acquisition of Hardeman County Investment Company, Inc., or HCIC,
which closed on May 15, 2017, and our announced acquisitions of OKSB and First Texas. The unaudited pro
forma combined condensed consolidated balance sheets combine the historical financial information of Simmons
and HCIC, OKSB and First Texas as of June 30, 2017, and assume that the acquisitions were completed on that
date. The unaudited pro forma combined condensed consolidated statements of income for the six-month period
ended June 30, 2017 and the 12-month period ended December 31, 2016 give effect to the acquisitions as if the
transactions had been completed on January 1, 2016.

The unaudited pro forma combined condensed consolidated financial statements are presented for
illustrative purposes only and does not indicate the financial results of the combined company had the companies
actually been combined on the dates described above, nor is it necessarily indicative of the results of operations
in future periods or the future financial position of the combined entities. The unaudited pro forma combined
condensed consolidated financial statements also do not consider any potential impacts of current market
conditions on revenues, expense efficiencies, asset dispositions and share repurchases, among other factors.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Notes to Pro Forma Combined Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements

Note 1.   Basis of Presentation

The unaudited pro forma combined condensed consolidated financial statements and explanatory notes show
the impact on the historical financial condition and results of operations of Simmons resulting from the HCIC,
OKSB and First Texas acquisitions under the acquisition method of accounting. Under the acquisition method of
accounting, the assets and liabilities of HCIC, OKSB and First Texas are recorded by Simmons at their respective
fair values as of the date the transaction is completed. The unaudited pro forma combined condensed
consolidated balance sheets combine the historical financial information of Simmons (which includes HCIC),
OKSB and First Texas as of June 30, 2017, and assume that the OKSB and First Texas acquisitions were
completed on that date. The unaudited pro forma combined condensed consolidated statements of income for the
six-month period ended June 30, 2017, and for the year ended December 31, 2016, give effect to the HCIC,
OKSB and First Texas acquisitions as if the transactions had been completed on January 1, 2016.

Since the transactions are recorded using the acquisition method of accounting, all loans are recorded at fair
value, including adjustments for credit quality, and no allowance for credit losses is carried over to Simmons’
balance sheet. In addition, certain anticipated nonrecurring costs associated with the HCIC, OKSB and First
Texas acquisitions such as potential severance, professional fees, legal fees and conversion-related expenditures
are not reflected in the pro forma statements of income and will be expensed as incurred.

While the recording of the acquired loans at their fair value will impact the prospective determination of the
provision for loan losses and the allowance for loan losses, for purposes of the unaudited pro forma combined
condensed consolidated statement of income for the six-month period ended June 30, 2017 and for the year ended
December 31, 2016, Simmons assumed no adjustments to the historical amount of HCIC’s, OKSB’s, and First
Texas’s provision for loan losses. If such adjustments were estimated, there could be a significant change to the
historical amounts of provision for loan losses presented.

The HCIC transaction closed effective May 15, 2017 and is not a significant acquisition under SEC rules
and regulations and, while not required to be presented, is provided for information purposes only. The unaudited
pro forma combined condensed consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2016, are
presented in two stages. The first stage presents the results of HCIC as combined with the historical results of
Simmons and reflecting pro forma adjustments for the year ended December 31, 2016. The second stage presents
the combined results of Simmons with HCIC, with the historical results and pro forma adjustments for OKSB and
First Texas for the year ended December 31, 2016. These transactions combined are significant and subject to
shareholder approval. The unaudited pro forma combined condensed consolidated statements of income for the
six months ended June 30, 2017 include the results of HCIC from May 16, 2017 to June 30, 2017.

Note 2.   Merger and Acquisition Integration Costs

The retail branch operations, commercial lending activities, mortgage banking operations, trust and
investment services, along with all other operations of HCIC, OKSB and First Texas will be integrated into
Simmons Bank. The operation integration and the system conversion for HCIC are scheduled for
September 2017. The operation integration and the system conversion for First Texas are scheduled for the first
quarter of 2018. The operation integration and the system conversion for OKSB are scheduled for the second
quarter of 2018.

The specific details of the plan to integrate the operations of HCIC, OKSB and First Texas will continue to
be refined over the next several months, and will include assessing personnel, benefit plans, premises, equipment
and service contracts to determine where we may take advantage of redundancies. Certain decisions arising from
these assessments may involve involuntary termination of employees, vacating leased premises, changing
information systems, canceling contracts with certain service providers, and selling or otherwise disposing of
certain premises, furniture and equipment. Simmons also expects to incur merger-related costs including
professional fees, legal fees, system conversion costs and costs related to communications with customers and
others. To the extent there are costs associated with these actions, the costs will be recorded based on the nature
of the cost and the timing of these integration actions.

(1) Adjustment reflects the merger consideration expected to be paid for each acquisition. The merger
consideration expected to be paid for OKSB is $478.5 million, consisting of  $383.5 million in
Simmons common stock and $94.9 million in cash (based on Simmons’ closing common stock price of 
$52.90 per share on June 30, 2017, OKSB shares of common stock outstanding of 18,686,273 as of
June 30, 2017, and the right to receive $5.08 and 0.3880 shares of Simmons common stock for each
share of OKSB common stock, pursuant to the OKSB merger agreement). The merger consideration
expected to be paid for First Texas is $413.9 million, consisting of  $343.9 million in Simmons
common stock and $70 million in cash (based on Simmons’ closing common stock price of  $52.90 per
share on June 30, 2017 and the right to receive 6,500,000 shares of Simmons common stock and $70
million, pursuant to the First Texas merger agreement).

(2) Adjustment represents the estimated seller-incurred merger expenses, which are expected to be paid
immediately prior to the merger closing date, and the related tax benefit. Estimated seller-incurred
merger expenses are $9.7 million for OKSB and the related tax benefit is $3.8 million. Estimated seller-
incurred merger expenses are $9.8 million for First Texas and the related tax benefit is $3.8 million.

(3) Purchase accounting adjustment to eliminate each target’s allowance for loan losses, which cannot be
carried over in accordance with GAAP.

(4) Adjustment reflects the necessary write down of the acquired loan portfolios, allocated to each target as
described below, based on Simmons’ evaluation of the loan portfolio during due diligence, which
included review of approximately 45% of the portfolios.

(5) Adjustment made to reflect the estimated fair value of acquired premises and equipment, including all
branches, based on Simmons’ evaluation during due diligence. Adjustment is ($1.2) million for OKSB
and $13 million for First Texas.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Note 3.   Estimated Annual Cost Savings

Simmons expects to realize cost savings and to generate revenue enhancements from the OKSB and First
Texas acquisitions. Revenue enhancements are expected from an expansion of trust services, SBA lending
activities, consumer finance products and credit card services to the larger footprint of Simmons. Cost savings for
First Texas are estimated at 32% of non-interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2016, and cost savings
for OKSB are estimated at 35% of non-interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2016. These cost
savings and revenue enhancements are not reflected in the pro forma combined condensed consolidated financial
statements and there can be no assurance they will be achieved in the amount or manner currently contemplated.

Note 4.   Pro Forma Adjustments

The following pro forma adjustments have been reflected in the unaudited pro forma combined condensed
consolidated financial statements presented for OKSB and First Texas. All adjustments are based on current
assumptions and valuations, which are subject to change. Unless otherwise noted, all adjustments are based on
assumptions and valuations as of the merger agreement dates for the respective pending acquisitions and are
subject to change.

Estimated Simmons’-incurred merger expenses primarily including severance, professional, legal and
conversion related expenditures, are not reflected in the pro forma combined condensed consolidated
balance sheet as these integrated costs will be expensed by Simmons as required by U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles, or GAAP.

OKSB: The total adjustment of  $33.4 million is comprised of approximately $7.0 million of non-
accretable credit adjustments and approximately $26.4 million of accretable yield adjustments.

First Texas: The total adjustment of  $24.2 million is comprised of approximately $125,000 of non-
accretable credit adjustments and approximately $24.1 million of accretable yield adjustments.

(6) Adjustment represents the excess of the consideration paid over the fair value of net assets acquired,
net of the reversal of OKSB’s and First Texas’ previously recorded goodwill of  $13.5 million and
$37.2 million, respectively. See Note (1) for additional information regarding how the pro forma
purchase price was calculated. The reconciliation of the pro forma purchase price to goodwill recorded
can be summarized as follows:

(7) Preliminary purchase accounting adjustment to establish a core deposit intangible in recognition of the
fair value of core deposits acquired, which is approximately 1.9% of core deposit liabilities for OKSB
and First Texas. This intangible asset represents the value of the relationships that OKSB and First
Texas had with their deposit customers as of the date of acquisition. The preliminary fair value was
estimated based on a discounted cash flow methodology that gave consideration to expected customers
attrition rates, cost of the deposit base and the net maintenance cost attributable to customer deposits. A
core deposit intangible asset of  $23.7 million was estimated for OKSB and $30.3 million for First
Texas.

(8) Adjustment represents the estimated current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities recorded to
reflect the differences in the carrying values of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities for financial
reporting purposes and the cost basis for federal and state income tax purposes at Simmons’ combined
federal and state income tax rate of 39.225%. OKSB is estimated to have a net deferred tax asset
adjustment of  $3.6 million. First Texas is estimated to have a net deferred tax asset adjustment of 
$12.5 million.

(9) Adjustment reflects the estimated fair value discount of OKSB’s and First Texas’ time deposits of
$800,000 and $232,000, respectively, based on Simmons’ evaluation during due diligence. The fair
value was estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology based on current market rates for
similar remaining maturities.

(10) Adjustment made to reflect the Company’s estimate of the fair value of FHLB advances during due
diligence, of which $592,000 is attributable to OKSB and ($693,000) is attributable to First Texas.

(11) Adjustment reflects the Company’s estimated fair value discount of the trust preferred securities during
due diligence, of which $4.5 million is attributable to OKSB and $825,000 is attributable to First Texas.

(12) Adjustment made to reflect the Company’s estimate of the fair value of a reserve for unfunded
commitments not previously recorded by First Texas. No adjustment was necessary for OKSB as the
Company determined the existence of an adequate reserve during due diligence.

(13) Purchase accounting adjustment to eliminate OKSB’s and First Texas’ previously existing equity
accounts.

(14) Upon completion of the mergers, Simmons will evaluate each acquired loan portfolio to finalize the
necessary credit and interest rate fair value adjustments. Subsequently, the accretable portion of the fair
value adjustment will be accreted into earnings using the level yield method over the remaining
maturity of the underlying loans. This adjustment represents the Company’s best estimate of the
expected accretion that would have been recorded in 2016 and the first six months of 2017 assuming
the mergers closed on January 1, 2016. Subsequent to the closing of the transactions, the amount and
timing of the estimated accretion of this purchase accounting adjustment could be revised significantly.

(15) The pro forma adjustment to reflect the estimated fair value of time deposits of OKSB and First Texas
based on current interest rates for comparable deposits will be amortized as an addition to the cost of
such time deposits over an estimated life of one year.

(16) The core deposit intangible will be amortized over Fifteen years on a straight-line basis. The annual
amortization expense will be approximately $1.6 million and $2.0 million for OKSB and First Texas,
respectively.

(17) Reflects the tax impact of the pro forma acquisition adjustments at Simmons’ combined federal and
state income tax rate of 39.225%.

(18) Pro forma weighted average common shares outstanding assumes 7,250,274 common shares issued for
OKSB and 6,500,000 common shares issued for First Texas.

(a) Simmons has evaluated the acquired portfolio to estimate the necessary credit and interest rate fair
value adjustments. Subsequently, the accretable portion of the fair value adjustment will be accreted
into earnings using the level yield method over the remaining maturity of the underlying loans. For
purposes of the pro forma impact on the year ended December 31, 2016, the net discount accretion was
calculated by summing monthly estimates of accretion/amortization on each loan portfolio, which was
calculated based on the remaining maturity of each loan pool. The overall weighted average maturity of
the loan portfolio is approximately 4.6 years. The 2016 pro forma accretion income projected for
Hardeman is $1.4 million. The estimated non-accretable yield portion of the net discount of
approximately $956,000 will not be accreted into earnings.

(b) The core deposit intangible will be amortized over 15 years on a straight-line basis. The annual
amortization expense will be approximately $523,000.

(c) Reflects the tax impact of the pro forma acquisition adjustments at Simmons’ combined federal and
state income tax rate of 39.225%.

(d) Pro forma weighted average common shares outstanding assumes the actual stock issued at the close of
the HCIC merger on May 15, 2017 of 799,970 shares of common stock was outstanding for the full
period presented.

The unaudited pro forma adjustments are based upon available information and certain assumptions that
Simmons, OKSB and First Texas management believe are reasonable. The unaudited pro forma data, while
helpful in illustrating the financial characteristics of the combined company under one set of assumptions, does
not reflect the impact of factors that may result as a consequence of the mergers, or the recently completed HCIC
acquisition or consider any potential impacts of current market conditions or the mergers or the HCIC acquisition
on revenues, expense efficiencies, asset dispositions, among other factors, nor the impact of possible business
model changes. As a result, unaudited pro forma data is presented for illustrative purposes only and does not
represent an attempt to predict or suggest future results. Upon completion of the mergers, the operating results of
both OKSB and First Texas will be reflected in the consolidated financial statements of Simmons on a
prospective basis.

RISK FACTORS
In addition to general investment risks and the other information contained in or incorporated by reference

into this joint proxy statement/prospectus, including the matters addressed under the section “Cautionary
Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,” you should carefully consider the following risk factors in
deciding how to vote on the proposals presented in this joint proxy statement/prospectus. You should also
consider the other information in this joint proxy statement/prospectus and the other documents incorporated by
reference herein. See “Where You Can Find More Information.”

Risks Relating to the Mergers

Because the market price of Simmons common stock will fluctuate, the value of the merger consideration to be
received by OKSB and First Texas shareholders is uncertain.

Upon completion of the mergers, each share of OKSB common stock (except for shares of OKSB common
stock held directly or indirectly by OKSB or Simmons and any dissenting shares) will be converted into the right
to receive the OKSB merger consideration, and each share of First Texas common stock (except for shares of
First Texas common stock held directly or indirectly by First Texas or Simmons and any dissenting shares) will
be converted into the right to receive the First Texas merger consideration. In each case, cash will be paid in lieu
of any remaining fractional shares. Any change in the market price of Simmons common stock prior to the
completion of each merger will affect the market value of the OKSB stock consideration and the First Texas stock
consideration that OKSB and First Texas shareholders, respectively, will receive upon completion of the
applicable merger. In addition, any change in the market price of Simmons common stock prior to the completion
of the merger will affect the amount of First Texas cash consideration to be received in the First Texas merger.
Stock price changes may result from a variety of factors that are beyond the control of Simmons, OKSB and First
Texas, including, but not limited to, general market and economic conditions, changes in our respective
businesses, operations and prospects and regulatory considerations. Therefore, at the time of the Simmons, OKSB
and First Texas special meetings you will not know the precise market value of the consideration OKSB and First
Texas shareholders will receive at the effective time of the merger. You should obtain current market quotations
for shares of Simmons common stock before you vote.

The mergers and related transactions are subject to approval by Simmons, OKSB and First Texas
shareholders.

The OKSB merger cannot be completed unless (1) the OKSB shareholders approve the OKSB merger by the
affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of OKSB common stock that are outstanding and
entitled to vote and (2) the Simmons shareholders approve the OKSB merger by the affirmative vote of the
holders of a majority of the shares of Simmons common stock that are outstanding and entitled to vote. The
OKSB merger is also subject to the consent of the Federal Reserve Board.

The First Texas merger cannot be completed unless (1) the First Texas shareholders approve the First Texas
merger by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the shares of First Texas common stock that
are outstanding and entitled to vote and (2) the Simmons shareholders approve the First Texas merger by the
affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of Simmons common stock that are outstanding and
entitled to vote. The First Texas merger is also subject to the consent of the Federal Reserve Board and the TDB,
among others.

Each merger is subject to a number of closing conditions which, if not satisfied or waived in a timely manner,
would delay such merger or adversely impact the companies’ ability to complete the transactions.

The completion of each merger is subject to certain conditions, including, among others, the (1) receipt of
the requisite shareholder approvals, (2) termination or expiration of all statutory waiting periods and receipt of all
required regulatory approvals for such merger, without the imposition of any burdensome conditions or
restrictions, and (3) other customary closing conditions set forth in the applicable merger agreements. See “The
Merger Agreements — Conditions to Consummate the Mergers.” While it is currently anticipated that the
mergers will be completed during the fourth quarter of 2017, there can be no assurance that such conditions will
be satisfied in a timely manner or at all, or that an effect, event, development or change will not transpire that
could delay or prevent these conditions from being satisfied. Accordingly, there can be no guarantee with respect
to the timing of the closing of either merger or whether either merger will be completed at all.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Some of the conditions to the merger may be waived by Simmons, OKSB or First Texas without resoliciting
shareholder approval of the merger agreement.

Some of the conditions set forth in the OKSB merger agreement and the First Texas merger agreement may
be waived by OKSB or First Texas, respectively, or Simmons, subject to the agreement of the other party in
specific cases. See “The Merger Agreements — Conditions to Consummate the Mergers.” If any conditions are
waived, OKSB or First Texas, as applicable, and Simmons will evaluate whether an amendment of this joint
proxy statement/prospectus and resolicitation of proxies is warranted. In the event that the OKSB board of
directors or First Texas board of directors, as applicable, determines that resolicitation of shareholders is not
warranted, OKSB or First Texas, as applicable, and Simmons will have the discretion to complete the merger
without seeking further shareholder approval.

Regulatory approvals may not be received, may take longer than expected or may impose conditions that are
not presently anticipated or that could have an adverse effect on the combined company following the mergers.

Before either merger may be completed, various approvals and consents must be obtained from the Federal
Reserve Board, the TDB in the case of First Texas, and various other securities, antitrust and other regulatory
authorities. In determining whether to grant these approvals the regulators consider a variety of factors, including
the regulatory standing of each party and the factors described under “The Mergers — Regulatory Approvals
Required for the Mergers.” An adverse development in any party’s regulatory standing or these factors could
result in an inability to obtain approval or delay its receipt. These regulators may impose conditions on the
completion of either merger or require changes to the terms of either merger. Such conditions or changes could
have the effect of delaying or preventing completion of either merger or imposing additional costs on or limiting
the revenues of the combined company following either merger, any of which might have an adverse effect on the
combined company following either merger. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that the necessary
regulatory approvals will be received in time to effect the mergers in the fourth quarter of 2017. As of the date of
this joint proxy statement/prospectus, Simmons, OKSB and First Texas have received the approval from the
Federal Reserve to consummate each of the mergers, but Simmons and First Texas have not yet received approval
from TDB for the First Texas merger. See “The Mergers — Regulatory Approvals Required for the Mergers.”

The opinions of the respective financial advisors to Simmons, OKSB and First Texas delivered to the parties’
respective boards of directors prior to the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus do not reflect changes
in circumstances since the respective dates of the opinions.

The Simmons board of directors has obtained fairness opinions dated December 14, 2016 and January 23,
2017 for the transactions with OKSB and First Texas, respectively, from Mercer. The OKSB board of directors
received a fairness opinion from KBW on December 14, 2016. The First Texas board of directors received a
fairness opinion from Stephens on January 23, 2017. Such opinions have not been updated as of the date of this
joint proxy statement/prospectus and will not be updated at, or prior to, the time of the completion of the mergers.
Changes in the operations and prospects of Simmons, OKSB or First Texas, general market and economic
conditions and other factors that may be beyond the control of Simmons, OKSB and First Texas may alter the
value of Simmons, OKSB or First Texas or the prices of shares of Simmons common stock, OKSB common
stock or First Texas common stock by the time the mergers are completed. The opinions do not speak as of the
time the mergers are completed or as of any other date than the date of the opinions. Further, the Mercer and
KBW opinions regarding the OKSB merger do not take the First Texas merger into consideration. The opinions
that the Simmons, OKSB and First Texas boards of directors received from their respective financial advisors are
attached as Annex C, Annex D, Annex E and Annex F to this joint proxy statement/prospectus. For a description
of the opinions, see “The OKSB Merger — Opinion of OKSB’s Financial Advisor,” “The OKSB Merger — 
Opinion of Simmons’ Financial Advisor,” “The First Texas Merger — Opinion of First Texas’ Financial
Advisor,” and “The First Texas Merger — Opinion of Simmons’ Financial Advisor.” For a description of the
other factors considered by Simmons’ board of directors in determining to approve the mergers, see “The OKSB
Merger — Simmons’ Reasons for the OKSB Merger; Recommendation of Simmons’ Board of Directors” and

Merger; Recommendation of OKSB’s Board of Directors.” For a description of the other factors considered by
First Texas’ board of directors in determining to approve the First Texas merger, see “The First Texas Merger — 
First Texas’ Reasons for the First Texas Merger; Recommendation of First Texas’ Board of Directors.”

The merger agreements limit OKSB’s and First Texas’ ability to pursue alternative transactions by requiring
OKSB and First Texas to pay termination fees under certain circumstances relating to alternative acquisition
proposals.

The merger agreements generally prohibit OKSB and First Texas, as applicable, from soliciting any
acquisition proposal or offer for a merger or business combination with any other party, including a business
proposal that may be advantageous to OKSB shareholders or First Texas shareholders, as applicable, when
compared to the terms and conditions of the mergers described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus. Under the
merger agreements, if the board of directors of OKSB or First Texas at any time prior to obtaining shareholder
approval for the applicable merger determines in good faith that, in light of a competing acquisition proposal or
other circumstances, termination of the merger agreement is required in order for the applicable board of directors
to comply with its fiduciary duties, then, as applicable, OKSB must pay a termination fee of  $20 million or First
Texas must pay a termination fee of $18 million to Simmons. See “The Merger Agreements — Termination
Fees.” These provisions could discourage a potential competing acquirer that might have an interest in acquiring
OKSB or First Texas from considering or making a competing acquisition proposal, even if the potential
competing acquirer was prepared to pay consideration with a higher per share cash value than that market value
proposed to be received or realized in the applicable merger with Simmons, or might result in a potential
competing acquirer proposing to pay a lower price than it might otherwise have proposed to pay because of the
added expense of the termination fee that may become payable in certain circumstances under the applicable
merger agreement.

If either or both of the mergers are not completed, Simmons, OKSB and First Texas will have incurred
substantial expenses without realizing the expected benefits of the mergers.

Each of Simmons, OKSB and First Texas has incurred and will incur substantial non-recurring expenses in
connection with the negotiation and completion of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreements, as
well as the costs and expenses of filing, printing and mailing this joint proxy statement/prospectus and all filing
and other fees paid to the SEC and other regulatory agencies in connection with the mergers. While each of
Simmons, OKSB and First Texas have assumed that a certain level of expenses would be incurred in connection
with the mergers, there are many factors beyond their control that could affect the total amount or the timing of
the integration and implementation expenses. If either or both of the mergers are not completed, Simmons, OKSB
and/or First Texas will have to recognize these expenses without realizing the expected benefits of the mergers.

Simmons, OKSB and First Texas will be subject to business uncertainties and OKSB and First Texas will be
subject to contractual restrictions on their respective operations while the mergers are pending.

Simmons, OKSB and First Texas will be subject to business uncertainties and OKSB and First Texas will be
subject to contractual restrictions on their respective operations while the mergers are pending. For instance,
uncertainty about the effect of the mergers on employees and customers may have an adverse effect on Simmons,
OKSB or First Texas. These uncertainties may impair Simmons’, OKSB’s or First Texas’ ability to attract, retain
and motivate key personnel until the mergers are completed, and could cause customers and others that deal with
Simmons, OKSB or First Texas to seek to change existing business relationships with Simmons, OKSB or First
Texas. Retention of certain employees by Simmons, OKSB or First Texas may be challenging while the mergers
are pending, as certain employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined
company. If key employees depart because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a
desire not to remain with the combined company, Simmons’ business, OKSB’s business or First Texas’ business
could be harmed. The pursuit of the mergers and the preparation for the integration may place a significant
burden on management and internal resources of Simmons, OKSB and First Texas. Any significant diversion of
management attention away from ongoing business and any difficulties encountered in the transition and
integration process could

• All unvested restricted stock awards with respect to OKSB shares and First Texas shares which remain
outstanding immediately prior to completion of each merger will immediately vest upon the effective
time of each merger and will be converted automatically into the right to receive the OKSB merger
consideration or the First Texas merger consideration, as applicable. Based on the OKSB merger
consideration being $466.1 million, and assuming the merger is completed in the fourth quarter of
2017, the value of all unvested shares of restricted stock that are held by OKSB’s directors and
executive officers as a group would be approximately $5.9 million. Based on the First Texas merger
consideration being $402.8 million, and assuming the merger is completed in the fourth quarter of
2017, the value of all shares subject to unvested First Texas restricted stock units, stock options and
SARs that are held by First Texas’ directors and executive officers as a group would be approximately
$3.1 million.

• OKSB has entered into employment agreements or change of control agreements with its executive
officers, which obligate OKSB to pay certain severance benefits to such OKSB executive officers in the
event of termination without cause or resignation under certain circumstances constituting an effective
termination within 24 months following a change of control, such as the OKSB merger.

• It is expected that following the completion of the OKSB merger, Mark W. Funke, currently the
president and chief executive officer of OKSB and OKSB Bank, will become an officer of Simmons
Bank after consummation of the merger of OKSB Bank with and into Simmons Bank. Similarly, it is
expected that following the completion of the First Texas merger, Vernon Bryant, currently the chief
executive officer of First Texas and Chairman and chief executive officer of First Texas Bank, will
become an officer of Simmons Bank after the consummation of the merger of First Texas Bank with
and into Simmons Bank.

• It is expected that Russell W. Teubner and Tom Purvis, currently members of the OKSB board of
directors and the First Texas board of directors, respectively, will be appointed to the Simmons board of
directors.

• While there are no other employment or other agreements being offered to employees or directors of
OKSB or First Texas, Simmons expects to retain most of the officers and other employees of OKSB
and First Texas after the mergers, and such employees will then participate in the employee benefit
plans of Simmons and receive credit for prior service.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

affect Simmons’, OKSB’s or First Texas’ financial results. In addition, subject to certain exceptions, each of
OKSB and First Texas has agreed to operate its business in the ordinary course, and to comply with certain other
operational restrictions, prior to closing of their respective mergers. See “The Merger Agreements — Covenants
and Agreements” for a description of the restrictive covenants applicable to Simmons, OKSB and First Texas.

Termination of either of the merger agreements could negatively impact Simmons, OKSB or First Texas.

If either or both of the merger agreements are terminated, there may be various negative consequences. For
example, Simmons’, OKSB’s or First Texas’ businesses may have been impacted adversely by the failure to
pursue other beneficial opportunities due to the focus of management on the mergers, without realizing any of the
anticipated benefits of completing the mergers. Additionally, if either or both of the merger agreements are
terminated, the market price of Simmons common stock or OKSB common stock could decline to the extent that
the current market price reflects a market assumption that the mergers will be completed.

Certain of OKSB’s and First Texas’ directors and executive officers have interests in the mergers that may
differ from the interests of OKSB’s and First Texas’ shareholders.

OKSB and First Texas shareholders should be aware that some of OKSB’s and First Texas’ directors and
executive officers have interests in the applicable merger and have arrangements that are different from, or in
addition to, those of OKSB and First Texas shareholders generally. These interests include the following:

51

• Simmons agreed in each of the merger agreements to indemnify the OKSB and First Texas directors
and officers for any claims or actions related to their respective mergers or merger agreements and to
provide liability insurance to OKSB and First Texas officers and directors for a six-year period
following the completion of each merger as long as the respective premiums to be paid are not more
than 200% of the current annual premium paid by OKSB or First Texas, respectively, for such
insurance.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

These interests and arrangements may create conflicts of interest and may cause some of these persons to
view the proposed transaction differently than you view it. The OKSB board of directors and First Texas board of
directors were aware of these interests and considered these interests, among other matters, when making their
respective decisions to approve their respective merger agreements, and in recommending that OKSB and First
Texas shareholders vote in favor of approving their applicable mergers agreements. For a more complete
description of these interests, see “The OKSB Merger — Interests of OKSB’s Directors and Executive Officers in
the OKSB Merger” and “The First Texas Merger — Interests of First Texas’ Directors and Executive Officers in
the First Texas Merger.”

In connection with the announcement of the OKSB merger agreement, a lawsuit has been filed and is
pending, seeking, among other things, to enjoin the OKSB shareholder meeting and the OKSB merger, and an
adverse judgment in this lawsuit may prevent the OKSB merger from becoming effective within the expected
time frame (if at all).

A putative shareholder class action complaint relating to the OKSB merger has been filed. This action,
Bergman v. Southwest Bancorp Inc. et al. was filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of
Oklahoma on August 9, 2017. The complaint names as defendants OKSB, its directors and certain of its officers.
The complaint alleges that the members of the OKSB board of directors violated Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the
Exchange Act and Rule 14a-9 by filing a preliminary proxy statement that allegedly contains materially
incomplete and misleading information. The plaintiffs seek to enjoin the defendants from holding the OKSB
special meeting and taking any steps to consummate the OKSB merger, or, in the event the OKSB merger is
consummated, damages, attorneys’ fees and costs, and other and further relief. At this time, it is not possible to
predict the outcome of this proceeding or any other legal proceedings that are initiated by putative shareholders
of Simmons, OKSB or First Texas, but such proceedings may prevent the completion of the OKSB merger or
First Texas merger and result in significant legal expenses and diversion of management time for one or more of
Simmons, OKSB or First Texas. See “The Mergers — Litigation Relating to the OKSB Merger” beginning on
page 143.

Risks Related to the Combined Company Following the Mergers

Combining OKSB and First Texas with Simmons may be more difficult, costly or time consuming than
expected and the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the mergers may not be realized.

Simmons, OKSB and First Texas have operated and, until the completion of the mergers, will continue to
operate, independently. The success of the mergers, including anticipated benefits and cost savings, will depend,
in part, on Simmons’ ability to successfully combine and integrate the businesses of OKSB and First Texas with
Simmons in a manner that permits growth opportunities and does not materially disrupt existing customer
relations nor result in decreased revenues due to loss of customers. It is possible that the integration process could
result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of the companies’ ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in
standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect the combined company’s ability to maintain
relationships with clients, customers, depositors and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits and cost
savings of the mergers. The loss of key employees could adversely affect Simmons’ ability to successfully
conduct its business, which could have an adverse effect on Simmons’ financial results and the value of Simmons
common stock. If Simmons experiences difficulties with the integration process, the anticipated benefits of the
mergers may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. As with any merger of
financial institutions, there also may be business disruptions that cause Simmons, OKSB and/or First Texas to
lose customers or cause customers to remove their accounts from Simmons, OKSB and/or First Texas and move
their business to competing financial institutions. In addition, integration efforts will divert management attention
and resources. These

TABLE OF CONTENTS

integration matters could have an adverse effect on the combined company during this transition period and for
an undetermined period after completion of the mergers on the combined company. In addition, the actual cost
savings of the mergers could be less than anticipated.

Simmons may fail to realize the cost savings estimated for the mergers.

Simmons estimates that it will achieve cost savings from the mergers when the three companies have been
fully integrated. However, it is possible that the estimates of the potential cost savings could turn out to be
incorrect. The integration of OKSB and First Texas’ businesses with Simmons may result in additional and
unforeseen expenses, and the anticipated benefits of the integration plan may not be realized. In addition, growth
and cost savings, if achieved, may be lower than what Simmons expects and may take longer to achieve than
anticipated. If Simmons is unable to adequately address integration challenges, Simmons may be unable to
successfully integrate OKSB’s and/or First Texas’ operations, or to realize the anticipated benefits of the
integration of the three companies.

The shares of Simmons common stock to be received by OKSB and First Texas shareholders as a result of the
mergers will have different rights from the shares of OKSB common stock and First Texas common stock.

Upon completion of the mergers, OKSB and First Texas shareholders will become Simmons shareholders
and their rights as shareholders will be governed by Arkansas law and Simmons’ articles of incorporation and
bylaws. The rights associated with OKSB and First Texas common stock are different from the rights associated
with Simmons common stock. See “Comparison of Shareholders’ Rights of Simmons and OKSB” and
“Comparison of Shareholders’ Rights of Simmons and First Texas” for a further discussion of the different rights
associated with Simmons common stock.

Holders of Simmons, OKSB and First Texas common stock will have a reduced ownership and voting interest
after the mergers and will exercise less influence over management.

Holders of Simmons, OKSB and First Texas common stock currently have the right to vote for the election
the directors and on other matters affecting Simmons, OKSB and First Texas, respectively. Upon the completion
of the mergers, each OKSB and First Texas shareholder who receives shares of Simmons common stock will
become a shareholder of Simmons with a percentage ownership of Simmons that is smaller than such
shareholder’s percentage ownership of OKSB or First Texas, as applicable. Following completion of both
mergers, OKSB shareholders will own approximately 15.8% of the combined company, First Texas shareholders
will own approximately 14.2% of the combined company and existing Simmons shareholders will own
approximately 70.0% of the combined company. Because of this, OKSB and First Texas shareholders will have
less influence on the management and policies of Simmons than they now have on the management and policies
of OKSB and First Texas, respectively, and existing Simmons shareholders may have less influence than they
now have on the management and policies of Simmons.

Risks Related to an Investment in Simmons Common Stock

The market price of Simmons common stock after the merger may be affected by factors different from those
affecting its shares currently.

Upon completion of the mergers, holders of OKSB and First Texas common stock will become holders of
Simmons common stock. Simmons’ business differs in important respects from that of OKSB and First Texas,
and, accordingly, the results of operations of the combined company and the market price of Simmons common
stock after the completion of the mergers may be affected by factors different from those currently affecting the
independent results of operations of each of Simmons, OKSB and First Texas. For a discussion of the businesses
of Simmons, OKSB and First Texas and of some important factors to consider in connection with those
businesses, see “Information About Simmons,” “Information About OKSB,” “Information About First Texas”
and “Where You Can Find More Information.”

The market price of Simmons common stock may decline as a result of the mergers.

The market price of Simmons common stock may decline as a result of the mergers if Simmons does not
achieve the perceived benefits of the mergers or the effect of the mergers on Simmons’ financial results is not
consistent with the expectations of financial or industry analysts. In addition, upon completion of the

TABLE OF CONTENTS

mergers, Simmons, OKSB and First Texas shareholders will own interests in a combined company operating an
expanded business with a different mix of assets, risks and liabilities. Existing Simmons, OKSB and First Texas
shareholders may not wish to continue to invest in the combined company, or for other reasons may wish to
dispose of some or all of their shares of the combined company.

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements included in this document are preliminary
and the actual financial condition and results of operations after the mergers may differ materially.

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements in this joint proxy statement/ prospectus
are presented for illustrative purposes only and are not necessarily indicative of what Simmons’ actual financial
condition or results of operations would have been had the mergers been completed on the dates indicated. The
unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements reflect adjustments, which are based upon
assumptions and preliminary estimates, to record the OKSB and First Texas identifiable assets acquired and
liabilities assumed at fair value and the resulting goodwill recognized. The purchase price allocation reflected in
this joint proxy statement/prospectus with respect to OKSB and First Texas is preliminary, and final allocation of
the purchase price for each transaction will be based upon the actual purchase price and the fair value of the
assets and liabilities of OKSB and First Texas as of the date of the completion of the applicable merger.
Accordingly, the final acquisition accounting adjustments may differ materially from the pro forma adjustments
reflected in this joint proxy statement/prospectus. For more information, see “Unaudited Pro Forma Combined
Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.”

Simmons’ management will have broad discretion as to the use of assets acquired from these mergers, and
Simmons may not use these assets effectively.

Simmons’ management will have broad discretion in the application of the assets from these mergers and
could utilize the assets in ways that do not improve Simmons’ results of operations or enhance the value of its
common stock. OKSB and First Texas shareholders will not have the opportunity, as part of their investment
decision, to assess whether these acquired assets are being used appropriately. Simmons’ failure to utilize these
assets effectively could have a material adverse effect on the combined company, delay the development of
products and cause the price of Simmons common stock to decline.

The holders of Simmons’ subordinated debentures have rights that are senior to those of Simmons
shareholders. If Simmons defers payments of interest on Simmons’ outstanding subordinated debentures or if
certain defaults relating to those debentures occur, Simmons will be prohibited from declaring or paying
dividends or distributions on, and from making liquidation payments with respect to, Simmons common stock.

Simmons has $67.3 million of subordinated debentures issued in connection with trust preferred securities,
and Simmons will assume approximately $46.4 million of subordinated debentures if Simmons completes the
OKSB merger and approximately $30.3 million of subordinated debentures and promissory notes if Simmons
completes the First Texas merger. Payments of the principal and interest on the trust preferred securities are
unconditionally guaranteed by Simmons. The subordinated debentures are senior to shares of Simmons common
stock. As a result, Simmons must make payments on the subordinated debentures (and the related trust preferred
securities) before any dividends can be paid on Simmons common stock and, in the event of Simmons’
bankruptcy, dissolution or liquidation, the holders of the debentures must be satisfied before any distributions can
be made to the holders of Simmons common stock. Simmons has the right to defer distributions on the
subordinated debentures (and the related trust preferred securities) for up to five years, during which time no
dividends may be paid to holders of Simmons capital stock. If Simmons elects to defer or if we default with
respect to its obligations to make payments on these subordinated debentures, this would likely have a material
adverse effect on the market value of Simmons common stock. Moreover, without notice to or consent from the
holders of Simmons common stock, Simmons may issue additional series of subordinated debt securities in the
future with terms similar to those of the existing subordinated debt securities or enter into other financing
agreements that limit its ability to purchase or to pay dividends or distributions on Simmons capital stock.

Simmons may be unable to, or choose not to, pay dividends on Simmons common stock.

Simmons cannot assure you of its ability to continue to pay dividends. Simmons’ ability to pay dividends
depends on the following factors, among others:

54



9/1/2019 t1702529-defm14a - none - 28.2726045s

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/914374/000157104917007845/t1702529-defm14a.htm 66/163

• Simmons may not have sufficient earnings as its primary source of income, the payment of dividends to
Simmons by its subsidiary banks, is subject to federal and state laws that limit the ability of those banks
to pay dividends;

• Federal Reserve Board policy requires bank holding companies to pay cash dividends on common
stock only out of net income available over the past year and only if prospective earnings retention is
consistent with the organization’s expected future needs and financial condition; and

• Simmons’ board of directors may determine that, even though funds are available for dividend
payments, retaining the funds for internal uses, such as expansion of Simmons’ operations, is a better
strategy.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

If Simmons fails to pay dividends, capital appreciation, if any, of Simmons common stock may be the sole
opportunity for gains on an investment in Simmons common stock. In addition, in the event Simmons’ subsidiary
banks become unable to pay dividends to Simmons, Simmons may not be able to service Simmons’ debt or pay
Simmons’ other obligations or pay dividends on Simmons common stock. Accordingly, Simmons’ inability to
receive dividends from Simmons’ subsidiary banks could also have a material adverse effect on Simmons’
business, financial condition and results of operations and the value of your investment in Simmons common
stock.

There may be future sales of additional common stock or preferred stock or other dilution of Simmons’ equity,
which may adversely affect the value of Simmons common stock.

Simmons is not restricted from issuing additional common stock or preferred stock, including any securities
that are convertible into or exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, common stock or preferred
stock or any substantially similar securities. The value of Simmons common stock could decline as a result of
sales by Simmons of a large number of shares of common stock or preferred stock or similar securities in the
market or the perception that such sales could occur.

Anti-takeover provisions could negatively impact Simmons shareholders.

Provisions of Simmons’ articles of incorporation and bylaws and federal banking laws, including regulatory
approval requirements, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire Simmons, even if doing so would
be perceived to be beneficial to Simmons shareholders. The combination of these provisions effectively inhibits a
non-negotiated merger or other business combination, which, in turn, could adversely affect the market price of
Simmons common stock. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for
holders of Simmons common stock to elect directors other than the candidates nominated by Simmons’ board of
directors.

Simmons’ rights and the rights of Simmons shareholders to take action against Simmons’ directors and
officers are limited.

Simmons’ articles of incorporation eliminate Simmons’ directors’ liability to Simmons and its shareholders
for money damages for breach of fiduciary duties as a director to the fullest extent permitted by Arkansas law.
Arkansas law provides that an officer has no liability in that capacity if he or she performs his or her duties in
good faith, in a manner he or she reasonably believes to be in Simmons’ best interests and with the care that an
ordinarily prudent person in a like position would use under similar circumstances.

Simmons’ articles of incorporation and bylaws also require Simmons to indemnify Simmons’ directors and
officers for liability resulting from actions taken by them in those capacities to the maximum extent permitted by
Arkansas law. As a result, Simmons shareholders and Simmons may have more limited rights against Simmons’
directors and officers than might otherwise exist under common law. In addition, Simmons may be obligated to
fund the defense costs incurred by Simmons’ directors and officers.

An investment in Simmons common stock is not an insured deposit.

An investment in Simmons common stock is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the
FDIC, the Deposit Insurance Fund, or any other government agency. Accordingly, you should be capable of
affording the loss of any investment in Simmons common stock.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE SIMMONS SPECIAL MEETING

This section contains information for Simmons shareholders about the special meeting that Simmons has
called to allow its shareholders to consider and vote on the merger agreements and other related matters.
Simmons is mailing this joint proxy statement/prospectus to Simmons shareholders, on or about September 13,
2017. This joint proxy statement/prospectus is accompanied by a notice of the Simmons special meeting of
Simmons shareholders and a proxy card that Simmons’ board of directors is soliciting for use at the Simmons
special meeting and at any adjournments or postponements of the Simmons special meeting. Reference to “you”
and “your” in this section are to Simmons shareholders.

Date, Time and Place of Simmons Special Meeting

The special meeting of Simmons shareholders will be held on October 18, 2017 in the Ryburn Community
Room of Simmons’ Pine Bluff, Arkansas, headquarters (501 Main St., Pine Bluff, Arkansas, 71601), at 11:00
a.m. local time.

Matters to Be Considered

At the special meeting of shareholders, you will be asked to consider and vote upon the following matters:

Recommendation of Simmons’ Board of Directors

Simmons’ board of directors has determined that the merger agreements and the transactions contemplated
thereby, including the mergers, are in the best interests of Simmons and its shareholders, has unanimously
approved and adopted the merger agreements and unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” the OKSB
merger proposal, “FOR” the First Texas merger proposal, “FOR” the Simmons director proposal, “FOR” the
Simmons/OKSB adjournment proposal, if necessary or appropriate, and “FOR” the Simmons/First Texas
adjournment proposal, if necessary or appropriate. See “The OKSB Merger — Simmons’ Reasons for the OKSB
Merger; Recommendation of Simmons’ Board of Directors”; and “The First Texas Merger — Simmons’ Reasons
for the First Texas Merger; Recommendation of Simmons’ Board of Directors.”

Record Date and Quorum

The Simmons board of directors has fixed the close of business on September 8, 2017 as the record date for
determining the holders of Simmons common stock entitled to receive notice of and to vote at the Simmons
special meeting, which we refer to as the Simmons record date. Only Simmons shareholders at the close of
business on the Simmons record date will be entitled to vote at the Simmons special meeting.

As of the Simmons record date, there were 32,144,419 shares of Simmons common stock outstanding and
entitled to vote at the Simmons special meeting held by approximately 1,599 holders of record. Each share of
Simmons common stock entitles the holder to one vote at the Simmons special meeting on each proposal to be
considered at the Simmons special meeting.

The representation (in person or by proxy) of a majority of the shares of Simmons common stock entitled to
vote at the special meeting will constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. All shares of Simmons
common stock present in person or represented by proxy, including abstentions, if any, will be treated as present
for purposes of determining the presence or absence of a quorum for all matters voted on at the Simmons special
meeting.

encouraged to vote through the internet.

no additional postage if mailed in the United States.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Required Vote; Treatment of Abstentions and Failure to Vote

To approve the OKSB merger proposal and the First Texas merger proposal, a majority of the shares of
Simmons common stock outstanding and entitled to vote thereon must be voted in favor of each proposal. To
approve each of the Simmons director proposal, the Simmons/OKSB adjournment proposal and the
Simmons/First Texas adjournment proposal, a majority of the shares of Simmons common stock cast on each
such proposal must be voted in favor of the proposal. A quorum required for the vote on the Simmons director
proposal, but is not required for the Simmons/OKSB adjournment proposal or the Simmons/First Texas
adjournment proposal.

If you mark “ABSTAIN” on your proxy card, fail to either submit a proxy card or vote by telephone or the
internet or in person at the Simmons special meeting, or you are a “street name holder” and fail to instruct your
bank or broker how to vote with respect to either of the merger proposals, it will have the same effect as a vote
“AGAINST” the applicable merger proposal. If you mark “ABSTAIN” on your proxy card, fail to either submit a
proxy card or vote by telephone or the internet or in person at the Simmons special meeting, or are a “street
name” holder and fail to instruct your bank or broker how to vote with respect to the Simmons director proposal,
Simmons/OKSB adjournment proposal or the Simmons/First Texas adjournment proposal, it will have no effect
on such proposals.

Shares Held by Officers and Directors

As of the record date, there were 32,144,419 shares of Simmons common stock entitled to vote at the
Simmons special meeting. Also as of the record date, the directors and executive officers of Simmons and their
affiliates beneficially owned and were entitled to vote approximately 1,354,718 shares of Simmons common
stock representing approximately 4.21% of the shares of Simmons common stock outstanding on that date.
Simmons currently expects that Simmons’ directors and executive officers will vote their shares in favor of each
of the proposals to be considered and voted upon at the Simmons special meeting, although none of them has
entered into any agreements obligating them to do so.

Voting on Proxies; Incomplete Proxies

A Simmons shareholder may vote by proxy or in person at the Simmons special meeting. If you hold your
shares of Simmons common stock in your name as a shareholder of record, to submit a proxy, you, as a Simmons
shareholder, may use one of the following methods:

Simmons requests that Simmons shareholders vote through the internet, by telephone or by completing the
accompanying proxy card and returning it to Simmons as soon as possible in the enclosed postage-paid envelope.
When the accompanying proxy card is returned properly executed, the shares of Simmons common stock
represented by it will be voted at the Simmons special meeting in accordance with the instructions contained on
the proxy card. If any proxy card is returned without indication as to how to vote, the shares of Simmons
common stock represented by the proxy card will be voted as recommended by the Simmons board of directors.

If a Simmons shareholder’s shares are held in “street name” by a broker, bank or other nominee, the
shareholder should check the voting form used by that firm to determine how to vote, including whether it may
vote by the internet or telephone.

Every Simmons shareholder’s vote is important. Accordingly, each Simmons shareholder should sign, date
and return the enclosed proxy card, or vote via the internet or by telephone, whether or not the Simmons
shareholder plans to attend the Simmons special meeting in person. Sending in your proxy card or voting by the
internet or telephone will not prevent you from voting your shares personally at the meeting, since you may
revoke your proxy at any time before it is voted.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Shares Held in “Street Name”; Broker Non-Votes

Under stock exchange rules, banks, brokers and other nominees who hold shares of Simmons common stock
in “street name” for a beneficial owner of those shares typically have the authority to vote in their discretion on
“routine” proposals when they have not received instructions from beneficial owners. However, banks, brokers
and other nominees are not allowed to exercise voting discretion with respect to the approval of matters
determined to be “non-routine,” without specific instructions from the beneficial owner. Simmons expects that all
proposals to be voted on at the Simmons special meeting will be “non-routine” matters. Broker non-votes are
shares held by a broker, bank or other nominee that are represented at the Simmons special meeting, but with
respect to which the broker or nominee is not instructed by the beneficial owner of such shares to vote on the
particular proposal and the broker does not have discretionary voting power on such proposal. If your broker,
bank or other nominee holds your shares of Simmons common stock in “street name,” your broker, bank or other
nominee will vote your shares of Simmons common stock only if you provide instructions on how to vote by
complying with the voter instruction form sent to you by your broker, bank or other nominee with this joint proxy
statement/ prospectus.

Revocability of Proxies and Changes to a Simmons Shareholder’s Vote

If you hold stock in your name as a shareholder of record, you may revoke any proxy at any time before it is
voted by (1) signing and returning a proxy card with a later date, (2) delivering a written revocation letter to
Simmons’ corporate secretary, (3) attending the special meeting in person, notifying the corporate secretary and
voting by ballot at the special meeting, or (4) voting by telephone or the internet at a later time.

Any Simmons shareholder entitled to vote in person at the special meeting may vote in person regardless of
whether a proxy has been previously given, but the mere presence (without notifying Simmons’ corporate
secretary) of a shareholder at the special meeting will not constitute revocation of a previously given proxy.

Written notices of revocation and other communications about revoking your proxy card should be
addressed to:

Simmons First National Corporation 
501 Main Street 
P.O. Box 7009 

Pine Bluff, Arkansas 71611 
Attention: Patrick A. Burrow

If your shares are held in “street name” by a bank or broker, you should follow the instructions of your bank
or broker regarding the revocation of proxies.

Participants in the Simmons 401(k) Plan

You will be given the opportunity to instruct the trustee of the Simmons 401(k) Plan how to vote the shares
that you hold in your account. To the extent that you do not timely give such instructions, although the trustee has
the power to vote any unvoted shares, the trustee will not vote any shares held in the Simmons 401(k) Plan that
are not voted by a participant.

Solicitation of Proxies

Simmons is soliciting proxies from its shareholders in conjunction with the OKSB merger and First Texas
merger. Simmons will bear the entire cost of soliciting proxies from its shareholders. In addition to solicitation of
proxies by mail, Simmons will request that banks, brokers and other record holders send proxies and proxy
material to the beneficial owners of Simmons common stock and secure their voting instructions. Simmons will
reimburse the record holders for their reasonable expenses in taking those actions. If necessary, Simmons may
use its directors and several of its regular employees, who will not be

proxy is recorded immediately. If you attend the meeting, you may also submit your vote in person. Any votes
that you previously submitted — whether through the internet, by telephone or by mail — will be superseded by
any vote that you cast at the Simmons special meeting.

bank or nominee and you wish to attend the Simmons special meeting, you need to bring a letter from the record

First Texas is mailing this joint proxy statement/prospectus to First Texas shareholders, on or about September
13, 2017. This joint proxy statement/prospectus is accompanied by a notice of the special meeting of First Texas
shareholders and a proxy card that First Texas’ board of directors is soliciting for use at the First Texas special
meeting and at any adjournments or postponements of the special meeting. References to “you” and “your” in
this section are to First Texas shareholders.

Date, Time and Place of Meeting

The special meeting of First Texas shareholders will be held on October 17, 2017, at Shady Oaks Country
Club located at 320 Roaring Springs Road, Fort Worth, Texas 76114, at 4:00 p.m., local time.

Matters to Be Considered

At the First Texas special meeting, First Texas shareholders will be asked to consider and vote upon the
following matters:

Recommendation of First Texas’ Board of Directors

First Texas’ board of directors has determined that the First Texas merger proposal and the transactions
contemplated thereby, including the First Texas merger, are in the best interests of First Texas and its
shareholders, has unanimously approved and adopted the First Texas merger agreement and unanimously
recommends that you vote “FOR” the First Texas merger proposal and “FOR” the First Texas adjournment
proposal, if necessary or appropriate. See “The First Texas Merger — First Texas’ Reasons for the Merger;
Recommendation of First Texas’ Board of Directors” for a more detailed discussion of First Texas’ board of
directors’ recommendations.

Record Date and Quorum

The First Texas board of directors has fixed the close of business on September 8, 2017, as the record date
for determining the holders First Texas common stock entitled to receive notice of and to vote at the First Texas
special meeting. Only shareholders at the close of business on the First Texas record date will be entitled to vote
at the First Texas special meeting.

As of the First Texas record date, there were 7,884,553 shares of First Texas common stock outstanding and
entitled to vote at the First Texas special meeting held by approximately 569 holders of record. Each share of
First Texas common stock entitles the holder to one vote at the First Texas special meeting on each proposal to be
considered at the First Texas special meeting.

The presence (in person or by proxy) of First Texas shareholders entitled to cast a majority of votes at the
First Texas special meeting will constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. All shares of First Texas
common stock present in person or represented by proxy, including abstentions, if any, will be treated as present
for purposes of determining the presence or absence of a quorum for all matters voted on at the First Texas
special meeting.

Required Vote; Treatment of Abstentions and Failure to Vote

To approve the First Texas merger proposal, at least two-thirds of the shares of First Texas common stock
outstanding and entitled to vote thereon must be voted in favor of such proposal. To approve the First Texas
adjournment proposal, a majority of the shares of First Texas common stock present or represented and entitled to
vote at the First Texas special meeting must be voted in favor of the proposal. A quorum is not required for the
OKSB adjournment proposal.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

If you mark “ABSTAIN” on your proxy card, fail to either submit a proxy card or vote in person at the First
Texas special meeting, or you are a “street name” holder and fail to instruct your bank or broker how to vote with
respect to the First Texas merger proposal, it will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the First Texas
merger proposal. If you mark “ABSTAIN” on your proxy card, it will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST”
the First Texas adjournment proposal. If you fail to either submit a proxy card or vote in person, or if you are a
“street name” holder and fail to instruct your bank or broker how to vote with respect to the First Texas
adjournment proposal, it will have no effect on the proposal.

Shares Held by Officers and Directors

As of the record date, there were 7,884,553 shares of First Texas common stock entitled to vote at the First
Texas special meeting. Also as of the record date, the directors and executive officers of First Texas and their
affiliates beneficially owned and were entitled to vote approximately 1,246,671 shares of First Texas common
stock, representing approximately 15.81% of the shares of First Texas common stock outstanding on that date.
First Texas currently expects that First Texas’ directors and executive officers will vote their shares in favor of the
First Texas merger proposal and the First Texas adjournment proposal, although none of them has entered into
any agreements obligating them to do so except in their capacity capacities as shareholders, as set forth below. As
of the record date, Simmons and its directors and executive officers beneficially held no shares of First Texas
common stock. Concurrently with execution of the merger agreement, certain of First Texas’ directors and
officers have entered into First Texas support agreements, solely in his or her capacity as a shareholder to vote his
or her shares in favor of the First Texas merger proposal, and against certain competing acquisition proposals or
other actions that would frustrate the purposes of, prevent or materially delay completion of the First Texas
merger, as well as certain other restrictions with respect to the voting and transfer of such person’s shares of First
Texas common stock. As of the record date, the First Texas directors and officers party to these support
agreements owned and were entitled to vote approximately 1,198,897 shares of First Texas common stock,
representing approximately 15.21% of the total shares of First Texas common stock outstanding on that date.

Voting on Proxies; Incomplete Proxies

A First Texas shareholder may vote by proxy or in person at the First Texas special meeting. If you hold
your shares of First Texas common stock in your name as a shareholder of record, to submit a proxy, you, as a
First Texas shareholder, may vote by completing and returning the proxy card in the enclosed envelope. The
envelope requires no additional postage if mailed in the United States.

First Texas requests that First Texas shareholders vote by completing and signing the accompanying proxy
card and returning it to First Texas as soon as possible in the enclosed postage-paid envelope. When the
accompanying proxy card is returned properly executed, the shares of First Texas common stock represented by it
will be voted at the First Texas special meeting in accordance with the instructions contained on the proxy card. If
any proxy card is returned without indication as to how to vote, the shares of First Texas common stock
represented by the proxy card will be voted as recommended by the First Texas board of directors.

If a First Texas shareholder’s shares are held in “street name” by a broker, bank or other nominee, the
shareholder should check the voting form used by that firm to determine how to vote.

Every First Texas shareholder’s vote is important. Accordingly, each First Texas shareholder should sign,
date and return the enclosed proxy card, whether or not the First Texas shareholder plans to attend the First Texas
special meeting in person. Sending in your proxy card will not prevent you from voting your shares personally at
the meeting, since you may revoke your proxy at any time before it is voted.

Shares Held in “Street Name”; Broker Non-Votes

Under stock exchange rules, banks, brokers and other nominees who hold shares of First Texas common
stock in “street name” for a beneficial owner of those shares typically have the authority to vote in their
discretion on “routine” proposals when they have not received instructions from beneficial owners. However,
banks, brokers and other nominees are not allowed to exercise voting discretion with respect to the approval of
matters determined to be “non-routine,” without specific instructions from the beneficial

TABLE OF CONTENTS

owner. First Texas expects that all proposals to be voted on at the First Texas special meeting will be “non-
routine” matters. Broker non-votes are shares held by a broker, bank or other nominee that are represented at the
First Texas special meeting, but with respect to which the broker or nominee is not instructed by the beneficial
owner of such shares to vote on the particular proposal and the broker does not have discretionary voting power
on such proposal. If your broker, bank or other nominee holds your shares of First Texas common stock in “street
name,” your broker, bank or other nominee will vote your shares of First Texas common stock only if you
provide instructions on how to vote by complying with the voter instruction form sent to you by your broker,
bank or other nominee with this joint proxy statement/ prospectus.

Revocability of Proxies and Changes to a First Texas Shareholder’s Vote

If you hold stock in your name as a shareholder of record, you may revoke any proxy at any time before it is
voted by (1) signing and returning a proxy card with a later date, (2) delivering a written revocation letter to First
Texas’ corporate secretary, or (3) attending the special meeting in person, notifying the corporate secretary and
voting by ballot at the special meeting.

Any First Texas shareholder entitled to vote in person at the special meeting may vote in person regardless
of whether a proxy has been previously given, but the mere presence (without notifying First Texas’ corporate
secretary) of a shareholder at the special meeting will not constitute revocation of a previously given proxy.

Written notices of revocation and other communications about revoking your proxy card should be
addressed to:

First Texas BHC, Inc. 
2200 West 7th Street, Suite 104 

Fort Worth, Texas 76107 (overnight delivery) 
or 

P.O. Box 962020 
Fort Worth, Texas 76162-2020 (regular mail) 

Attention: Lisanne Davidson

If your shares are held in “street name” by a bank or broker, you should follow the instructions of your bank
or broker regarding the revocation of proxies.

Solicitation of Proxies

First Texas is soliciting proxies from its shareholders in conjunction with the First Texas merger. First Texas
will bear the entire cost of soliciting proxies from its shareholders. In addition to solicitation of proxies by mail,
First Texas will request that banks, brokers and other record holders send proxies and proxy material to the
beneficial owners of First Texas common stock and secure their voting instructions. First Texas will reimburse
the record holders for their reasonable expenses in taking those actions. If necessary, First Texas may use its
directors and several of its regular employees, who will not be specially compensated, to solicit proxies from the
First Texas shareholders, either personally or by telephone, facsimile, letter or electronic means.

Attending the Meeting

All First Texas shareholders as of the record date, or their duly appointed proxies, may attend the First Texas
special meeting. Registration and seating will begin at 3:45 p.m., local time.

If you hold your shares of First Texas common stock in your name as a shareholder of record and you wish
to attend the First Texas special meeting, please bring your proxy card to the First Texas special meeting. You
should also bring valid picture identification. If you attend the meeting, you may also submit your vote in person.
Any votes that you previously submitted will be superseded by any vote that you cast at the First Texas special
meeting.

THE OKSB MERGER

The following discussion contains material information about the OKSB merger. This discussion is subject,
and qualified in its entirety by reference, to the OKSB merger agreement attached as Annex A to this joint proxy
statement/prospectus and incorporated herein by reference. We urge you to read carefully this entire joint proxy
statement/prospectus, including the OKSB merger agreement attached as Annex A, for a more complete
understanding of the OKSB merger.

The OKSB merger proposal will be considered and voted upon by the Simmons shareholders at the Simmons
special meeting and by the OKSB shareholders at the OKSB special meeting.

Terms of the OKSB Merger

Each of Simmons’ and OKSB’s respective boards of directors has unanimously approved and adopted the
OKSB merger agreement. The OKSB merger agreement provides for the merger of OKSB with and into
Simmons, with Simmons continuing as the surviving corporation. Following completion of the OKSB merger,
OKSB Bank will operate as a separate bank subsidiary of Simmons until it is merged with and into Simmons
Bank.

In the OKSB merger, each share of OKSB common stock, $1.00 par value per share, issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the effective time of the OKSB merger, except for shares of any OKSB common stock held
directly or indirectly by OKSB or Simmons and any dissenting shares, will be converted into the right to receive
the OKSB merger consideration. No fractional shares of Simmons common stock will be issued in connection
with the OKSB merger, and holders of OKSB common stock who would otherwise receive a fractional share will
be entitled to receive cash in lieu thereof. OKSB shareholders and Simmons shareholders are being asked to
approve the OKSB merger agreement. See “The Merger Agreements” for additional and more detailed
information regarding the legal documents that govern the OKSB merger and the First Texas merger, including
information about the conditions to the completion of the OKSB merger and the provisions for terminating or
amending the OKSB merger agreement.

Background of the OKSB Merger

Through its wholly owned banking subsidiary, OKSB Bank, OKSB has been providing financial services
since 1894. Over the years the board of directors and management of OKSB have been focused on continuing
OKSB’s growth, improving OKSB’s financial strength, and creating value for OKSB’s shareholders. Historically,
OKSB’s board of directors and management has met these goals by focusing on organic growth through the
opening of new branches in existing markets and new markets and a continued push for improvement of its
existing operations by emphasizing customer service and meeting all of its customers banking needs.
Additionally, OKSB has grown through strategic branch and bank acquisitions, such as its acquisition of First
Commercial Bancshares, Inc. in the fourth quarter of 2015.

At a June 21, 2016 board meeting, the OKSB board of directors began a discussion of OKSB’s results of
operation and financial condition, the current economic conditions in OKSB’s markets and the opportunities to
effectively create additional shareholder value given these factors and in light of the fact that following the
significant increase in OKSB’s stock price from the fourth quarter of 2011 to the fourth quarter of 2013, the stock
price had been relatively flat for nine quarters.

As a result of that discussion, the OKSB board of directors formed a Special Projects Committee for the
purpose of engaging an investment banker and evaluating strategic opportunities and alternatives available to
OKSB in order to create shareholder value, including potential mergers, acquisitions, divestitures, potentially
significant cost saving measures, and other key strategic transactions outside of OKSB’s ordinary course of
business. The Special Projects Committee was made up of OKSB’s Chairman, Russell Teubner, its President,
Chief Executive Officer and director, Mark Funke, and other directors Steven C. Davis, Larry J. Lanie, and James
M. Morris II.

As part of its overall review of OKSB’s strategic options and consistent with their historical practice of
shareholder engagement, management of OKSB continued to solicit the views of certain of its largest
shareholders, including Clover Partners L.P., with respect to the performance and the strategic direction of
OKSB.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

The Simmons board of directors has from time to time engaged with senior management of Simmons in
strategic reviews, and has considered ways to enhance its performance and prospects in light of competitive and
other relevant developments. These strategic reviews by the Simmons board of directors have focused on, among
other things, the business environment facing financial institutions generally, the business environments in the
markets that Simmons serves and markets that Simmons is targeting for entry into as desirable banking markets,
as well as conditions and ongoing consolidation in the financial services industry. As part of its growth strategy,
the management of Simmons and the Simmons board of directors have, from time to time, explored acquisition
opportunities with banks that have a similar conservative, community banking philosophy to that of Simmons and
that are headquartered in certain states including Arkansas, Texas, Tennessee, Missouri, Kansas and Oklahoma.

On June 23, 2016, Mr. Funke met with George Makris, Jr., CEO and Chairman of Simmons, and other
representatives of Simmons in Simmons’ offices in Little Rock, Arkansas. At the June 23, 2016 meeting, Mr.
Funke introduced the idea of a potential transaction between OKSB and Simmons.

On June 29, 2016, the Special Projects Committee held its first meeting. At this meeting, Mr. Funke
informed the Special Projects Committee of his June 23, 2016 meeting with Mr. Makris of Simmons and of his
upcoming meeting scheduled for July 13, 2016 with the CEO and Chairman of a large Texas-based bank, or the
Other Potential Acquirer. Among other actions, the Special Projects Committee exercised its authority to retain a
financial advisor for OKSB to assist OKSB and the Special Projects Committee with soliciting and evaluating
any expressions of interest and to assist OKSB and the Special Projects Committee in assessing the financial
aspects of any proposed transaction or strategic alternative. The Special Projects Committee directed Mr. Funke,
Chief Financial Officer Joe Shockley and General Counsel Rusty LaForge to contact KBW, an investment
banking firm, regarding its potential engagement by OKSB.

On June 30, 2016, Messrs. Funke, Shockley and LaForge had a telephone discussion with a representative of
KBW, to discuss OKSB’s engagement of KBW as OKSB’s financial advisor to assist the Special Projects
Committee and the OKSB board of directors in their evaluation of strategic alternatives for OKSB. During the
summer of 2016, OKSB and KBW agreed to KBW’s engagement by OKSB.

On July 12, 2016, the Special Projects Committee held its second meeting, which was attended by
representatives of KBW. Among the discussion items, KBW discussed information regarding OKSB’s
performance, current capital position and capital optimization, reviewed the performance of selected publicly
traded financial institutions, and discussed financial considerations of potential alternatives that might be
available to OKSB such as remaining independent, engaging in a potential upstream merger, or seeking a
potential merger of equals, all based on publicly available information.

On July 13, 2016, Mr. Funke met with the Chairman and CEO of the Other Potential Acquirer and
introduced the possibility of a merger between the companies as an idea for consideration.

On July 15, 2016, Clover Partners L.P. filed a Schedule 13D with the SEC stating that it acquired
approximately 5.1% of OKSB’s total shares outstanding.

On July 19, 2016, OKSB had a regularly scheduled board meeting where the Special Projects Committee
reported to the full OKSB board of directors with respect to the engagement of KBW and Mr. Funke’s meetings
with Simmons and the Other Potential Acquirer. The OKSB board of directors also approved certain expense
reduction initiatives proposed by management and reviewed by the Special Projects Committee as part of its
review of strategic alternatives available to improve OKSB’s performance

On July 28, 2016, the Special Projects Committee had its third meeting. At this meeting the Special Projects
Committee continued its discussion of strategic alternatives available to create additional shareholder value for
OKSB’s shareholders. In particular, the Special Projects Committee discussed an acquisition target based in
Texas and approved the submission of a letter of interest to the target proposing terms upon which OKSB would
acquire the target.

On August 1, 2016, Messrs. Funke, Shockley, LaForge and Teubner met with representatives of the Other
Potential Acquirer in New York City, while in town for an investor conference, to discuss the possibility of a
merger between the parties.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

On August 2, 2016, Messrs. Funke, Shockley, LaForge and Teubner met with Simmons representatives
Makris, Chief Financial Officer Bob Fehlman, Senior Executive Vice President Marty Casteel, and Simmons
Bank Chief Banking Officer Barry Ledbetter at breakfast in New York City, while in town for an investor
conference, to discuss the possibility of a merger between the parties.

On August 5, 2016, the Special Projects Committee held its fourth meeting. At this meeting, the Special
Projects Committee discussed that the Texas acquisition target had declined OKSB’s letter of interest. The
Special Projects Committee determined to not pursue the acquisition opportunity further. Additionally, Messrs.
Funke, Shockley, LaForge and Teubner updated the Special Projects Committee regarding their recent meetings
with representatives of both Simmons and the Other Potential Acquirer.

On August 15, 2016, Messrs. Funke and Shockley met with the Chairman and CEO of a Texas-based bank
of approximately the same size as OKSB, or the Potential MOE Party, to discuss a potential merger of equals
between the two companies. OKSB and the Potential MOE Party had held previous discussions in 2015 regarding
a potential merger of equals and the CEO and Chairman of the Potential MOE Party indicated a desire to restart
those discussions at this point.

From June through September 2016, the senior management of Simmons kept the Simmons board of
directors apprised of a number of acquisition opportunities including with OKSB. Senior management of
Simmons also continued to evaluate the financial considerations of a merger with OKSB and the strategic
opportunities that a merger with OKSB offered to Simmons, including the banking markets that OKSB operates
in and its market share and brand within certain of those markets

On August 19, 2016, the Special Projects Committee held its fifth meeting. Mr. Funke informed the Special
Projects Committee about the meeting with the Potential MOE Party and summarized the potential benefits and
risks of such a transaction. The Special Projects Committee and representatives of KBW discussed the potential
benefits and risks of attempting to consummate a merger of equals with the Potential MOE Party, as well as the
potential benefits and risks of such a transaction.

Following the discussion of the potential merger of equals, KBW discussed information regarding potential
partners with which OKSB might consider engaging, including Simmons, the Other Potential Acquirer and the
Potential MOE Party. KBW discussed precedent bank M&A transactions and the performance of selected
publicly traded financial institutions. The Special Projects Committee then discussed the potential strategic
alternatives available to OKSB, including a merger with Simmons, the Other Potential Acquirer, and the Potential
MOE Party, and the possibility of remaining independent. Following this discussion, the Special Projects
Committee authorized management to continue discussions with the Potential MOE Party. The Special Projects
Committee also agreed that it was in the best interests of OKSB and its shareholders to delay making any
recommendation to the OKSB board of directors.

On August 23, 2016, the OKSB board of directors had a regularly scheduled meeting. At this meeting, Mr.
Teubner updated the full OKSB board of directors as to the Special Projects Committee’s activities to date. Mr.
Teubner reported that the Special Projects Committee continued to review strategic alternatives available to
increase OKSB shareholder value, including (i) a potential transaction with an upstream purchaser, (ii) a potential
acquisition of another bank, (iii) a potential merger of equals and (iv) implementation of certain cost-saving
initiatives aimed at improving OKSB’s performance as a stand-alone entity.

On August 30, 2016, the Special Projects Committee held its sixth meeting. At this meeting, KBW again
discussed the potential strategic alternatives of remaining independent, entering into a merger of equals with the
Potential MOE Party, or seeking an upstream merger. The Special Projects Committee authorized KBW to solicit
indications of interest from Simmons, the Other Potential Acquirer, and any other interested parties. The Special
Projects Committee also authorized entry into confidentiality agreements with Simmons, the Other Potential
Acquirer, and any other interested parties. OKSB and the Potential MOE Party remained subject to a
confidentiality agreement entered into with the Potential MOE Party in 2015 when they were previously
discussing a potential merger of equals.

Immediately following the August 30, 2016 meeting of the Special Projects Committee and in the following
days, KBW contacted representatives of Simmons, the Other Potential Acquirer and several other banks to solicit
indications of interest from them and request that they execute a confidentiality agreement if they were interested
in receiving financial and other due diligence information from OKSB. None of the other parties contacted by
KBW executed a confidentiality agreement.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

On September 8, 2016, OKSB received a signed confidentiality agreement from the Other Potential
Acquirer. On September 12, 2016, OKSB received a signed confidentiality agreement from Simmons. Thereafter,
OKSB with the assistance of KBW shared confidential OKSB information with Simmons and the Other Potential
Acquirer to allow each company to consider the submission of a non-binding letter of interest.

Between September 9, 2016 and September 14, 2016, Simmons’ management team conducted preliminary
due diligence on OKSB and worked with Stephens Inc., or Stephens, its financial advisor at that time, to prepare
a non-binding indication of interest to acquire OKSB. KBW communicated, on behalf of OKSB, a deadline of
September 15, 2016, for any interested parties to present indications of interest.

On September 15, 2016, OKSB received letters of interest in acquiring OKSB by merger from both
Simmons and the Other Potential Acquirer. This is the first date upon which pricing and terms were discussed
with Simmons and the Other Potential Acquirer. KBW approached Simmons and the Other Potential Acquirer
with an opportunity to submit a new, higher bid. Simmons indicated that it was willing to consider submitting a
revised, higher bid. The Other Potential Acquirer was not willing to increase its bid.

On September 16, 2016, the Special Projects Committee held a seventh meeting. At this meeting, the Special
Projects Committee discussed the two letters of interest submitted by Simmons and the Other Potential Acquirer
at length with KBW. KBW informed the Special Projects Committee regarding Simmons’ indication that it was
willing to consider submitting a revised, higher bid. After consultation regarding the financial terms of the
proposal with KBW and consideration of multiple options, including remaining independent or further exploring
the merger of equals with the Potential MOE Party, the Special Projects Committee unanimously approved a
motion to recommend to the full OKSB board of directors that OKSB accept Simmons’ letter of interest on terms
no less favorable to OKSB than those contained in the Simmons letter of interest.

On September 20 – 21, 2016, the OKSB board of directors held a regularly scheduled meeting that included
an annual board retreat. Representatives of KBW also attended the meeting. The Special Projects Committee
provided the OKSB board of directors with an update of the status of the process to date and a summary of the
letters of interest that the Special Projects Committee had received from Simmons and the Other Potential
Acquirer. KBW also discussed the process undertaken to date with KBW’s assistance. The OKSB board of
directors then discussed the two submitted letters of interest at length with KBW and management. KBW
informed the OKSB board of directors regarding Simmons’ indication that it was willing to consider submitting a
revised, higher bid.

The directors discussed the strategic alternatives available to OKSB at length, reviewed KBW’s prior
discussions with the Special Projects Committee, and discussed the competing letters of interest in further detail.
After investigation and analysis of the available information concerning the option of remaining independent, the
merger of equals with the Potential MOE Party, and the two letters of interest, the OKSB board of directors
determined that the merger with Simmons, on terms no less favorable than contained in the letter of interest
submitted by Simmons, was the best reasonably available method of increasing shareholders’ returns over both
the near and long term. The OKSB board of directors approved a resolution authorizing Mr. Funke to execute a
letter of interest with Simmons on terms no less favorable to OKSB than those contained in the letter of interest
previously submitted by Simmons.

Following the OKSB board of directors meeting, KBW communicated to Simmons, in accordance with the
OKSB board of directors’ directives, that, while the OKSB board of directors was favorably inclined towards
Simmons’ non-binding offer, if Simmons could reconsider and possibly increase the financial terms of its offer it
was likely that the OKSB board of directors would accept the Simmons offer. Simmons management updated the
Simmons board of directors on the developments of the discussions with OKSB and, together with Mercer
Capital, proceeded to re-evaluate the OKSB financial information and the potential strategic opportunities that
Simmons may have in acquiring OKSB, to determine whether it could increase the financial terms of its non-
binding indication of interest.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

On September 23, 2016, in response to a the request made by KBW at the direction of the OKSB board of
directors, Simmons submitted a revised, higher bid to acquire OKSB for a total of  $95.0 million in cash and
7,250,000 shares of Simmons common stock, representing an aggregate acquisition consideration of
approximately $457.4 million (based on the closing price of Simmons common stock on September 22, 2016 of 
$49.99 per share).

On September 26, 2016, OKSB signed the revised letter of interest including exclusivity with Simmons.
Simmons and OKSB commenced mutual due diligence on each other beginning September 26, 2016 and ending
approximately November 28, 2016. Due diligence included the exchange of documents and the exchange of
questions and answers by both parties both verbally and electronically. During this time, several representatives
of Simmons visited OKSB’s Oklahoma City offices on various days in late October and early November 2016 to
conduct in person diligence interviews and representatives of OKSB visited Simmons’ Little Rock, Arkansas
offices on November 9, 2016 to conduct in person diligence interviews.

On December 1, 2016, Simmons sent the first draft of the OKSB merger agreement to OKSB. Between
December 1, 2016 and December 14, 2016, the specific terms of the OKSB merger agreement were negotiated
between representatives of Simmons and its outside counsel, Covington & Burling LLP, or Covington, and
OKSB and its outside counsel, McAfee & Taft. During this period Covington and McAfee & Taft also negotiated
the terms of the OKSB support agreements.

On December 2, 2016, the OKSB board of directors held a special meeting to discuss the terms of the draft
OKSB merger agreement with its legal counsel, McAfee & Taft, and KBW. The meeting included a presentation
by management with respect to the terms of the OKSB merger agreement and the result of OKSB’s diligence of
Simmons.

On December 13, 2016, the Special Projects Committee held its eighth and final meeting to review the
revised merger agreement in advance of the meeting of the OKSB board of directors. At this meeting, KBW
preliminarily reviewed the financial aspects of the proposed merger. The Special Projects Committee
unanimously approved the OKSB merger agreement and recommended its approval to the OKSB board of
directors.

On December 14, 2016, the OKSB board of directors held a special meeting to review the final version of
the OKSB merger agreement. At this meeting, KBW reviewed the financial aspects of the proposed merger and
rendered to the OKSB board of directors an opinion to the effect that, as of that date and subject to the procedures
followed, assumptions made, matters considered, and qualifications and limitations on the review undertaken by
KBW as set forth in such opinion, the OKSB merger consideration in the proposed merger was fair, from a
financial point of view, to the holders of OKSB common stock. Directors asked management and KBW questions
about the OKSB merger agreement and KBW’s fairness opinion. After this discussion and considering various
factors, including the interests of the OKSB shareholders, customers, employees and communities served by
OKSB, as well as the factors described under “— OKSB’s Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of OKSB’s
Board of Directors,” the OKSB board of directors unanimously approved the OKSB merger agreement and
recommended its approval to the OKSB shareholders.

On December 14, 2016, the Simmons board of directors held a meeting to consider the terms of the
proposed OKSB merger. Prior to the meeting, the directors received copies of the draft OKSB merger agreement,
the draft OKSB support agreement and of the other draft transaction documents, as well as a presentation
prepared by its financial advisor, Mercer Capital. At the meeting, members of Simmons’ management reported on
the status of due diligence and negotiations with OKSB. Representatives of Mercer Capital reviewed Mercer
Capital’s financial analysis of the proposed OKSB merger, including discussing the various financial
methodologies used in its analysis. Representatives of Mercer Capital then delivered its oral opinion (which was
subsequently confirmed in writing by delivery of Mercer Capital’s written opinion dated December 14, 2016)
that, as of the date of the Simmons board of directors meeting and based upon and subject to the various factors,
assumptions and limitations set forth in its written opinion, the OKSB merger consideration to be paid by
Simmons in connection with the OKSB merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to Simmons. The full text
of the written opinion of Mercer Capital dated December 14, 2016, which sets forth the assumptions made,
procedures followed, matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken in connection with the opinion,
is attached as Annex C to this

from approximately $347.9 million on September 20, 2016 to approximately $454.0 million on
December 13, 2016 and the aggregate implied consideration payable in the OKSB merger increasing

• the OKSB board of directors’ view that the limited geographic overlap between the OKSB and
Simmons will minimize the impact of the OKSB merger on OKSB’s employees and Simmons’ stated
intent to attempt to minimize the number of terminated positions;

• Simmons’ offer to make OKSB employees eligible to participate in Simmons’ benefit plans following
completion of the OKSB merger, with credit given for prior years of service to OKSB;

• the fact that OKSB has the right to terminate the OKSB merger agreement if, subject to Simmons’
ability to increase the cash portion of the OKSB merger consideration, (i) the average closing price per
share of Simmons common stock for the 20 consecutive trading days ending on and including the 10th
day preceding the closing, or the OKSB Average Closing Price, is less than $39.66; and (ii) the
difference between (A) the quotient obtained by dividing (1) the average closing price of the
PowerShares KBW Regional Banking Portfolio, or KBWR, for the 20 consecutive trading days ending
on and including the 10th trading day preceding the closing by (2) $43.71 and (B) the quotient obtained
by dividing (1) the OKSB Average Closing Price by (2) $49.55 is greater than 0.20 (or 20%);

• the OKSB board of directors’ analysis of  (i) Simmons’ announcement on November 17, 2016, that it
had entered into a merger agreement with HCIC, pursuant to which it would acquire HCIC for
approximately $72.2 million, (ii) the current state of Simmons’ negotiations to acquire First Texas, and
(iii) certain financial and branch location information with respect to both HCIC and First Texas,
including pro forma financial information with respect to Simmons following the acquisition of HCIC,
OKSB and First Texas;

• the likelihood that the OKSB merger would be completed, including the likelihood that the regulatory
and shareholder approvals needed to complete the OKSB merger would be obtained in a timely fashion
considering the compressed time frame in which Simmons would be acquiring HCIC, OKSB and First
Texas; and

• the opinion, dated December 14, 2016, of KBW to the OKSB board of directors as to the fairness, from
a financial point of view and as of the date of the opinion, to the holders of OKSB common stock of the
OKSB merger consideration in the proposed merger, as more fully described below under “Opinion of
OKSB’s Financial Advisor.” A copy of the KBW written opinion that was delivered to the OKSB
board of directors is included as Annex E to this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

• the potential negative impact of the announcement of the OKSB merger on OKSB’s business and
relations with customers, service providers and other stakeholders, whether or not the OKSB merger is
completed;

• the risk that the potential benefits and synergies sought in the OKSB merger may never be realized or
may not be realized within the expected time period as a result of difficulties with integration, including
additional difficulties resulting from the necessity for Simmons to integrate the operations of HCIC,
OKSB and First Texas in a relatively short time frame;

• the fact that, because the stock consideration in the merger is a fixed exchange ratio of shares of
Simmons common stock to OKSB common stock, OKSB shareholders could be adversely affected by a
decrease in the trading price of Simmons common stock during the pendency of the OKSB merger with
only the limited protection of OKSB having the right to terminate the OKSB merger agreement if the
Simmons Average Closing Price drops below a certain level and also drops below a certain level as
compared against the KBWR;

• the fact that the OKSB merger agreement prohibits OKSB from soliciting, and limits its ability to
respond to, proposals for alternative transactions;

The OKSB board of directors also considered potential risks relating to the OKSB merger, including the
following:

• the fact that the OKSB merger agreement entitles Simmons to terminate the OKSB merger agreement
and obligates OKSB to pay to Simmons a termination fee of  $20 million if the OKSB board of
directors recommends or accepts an alternative acquisition proposal within a certain period of time,
which may deter others from proposing an alternative transaction that may be more advantageous to
OKSB shareholders;

• the requirement that OKSB submit the OKSB merger agreement to its shareholders for approval even if
the OKSB board of directors withdraws its recommendation to approve the OKSB merger agreement;

• the fact that OKSB is not entitled to a termination fee in the event that Simmons elects to terminate the
OKSB merger agreement for any reason;

• the potential that Simmons may terminate the OKSB merger agreement if certain conditions to closing,
including the maintenance of certain financial ratios, are not met by OKSB;

• the potential negative impact on the likelihood of obtaining regulatory approvals in a timely manner
resulting from Simmons’ acquisition of HCIC, OKSB and First Texas in a relatively short period of
time;

• the potential for diversion of management and employee attention, and for employee attrition, during
the period prior to the completion of the OKSB merger;

• the restrictions on the conduct of OKSB’s business prior to completion of the OKSB merger, which
will adversely affect OKSB’s ability to make certain decisions quickly and independently and may
delay or prevent OKSB from undertaking business opportunities that may arise pending completion of
the OKSB merger;

• the costs that will be incurred by OKSB in connection with the OKSB merger in the event that the
OKSB merger is not consummated; and

• the risks described in the section entitled “Risk Factors” beginning on page 48.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

This discussion of the information and factors considered by the OKSB board of directors is not exhaustive
but includes all material factors considered by the OKSB board of directors. In view of the wide variety of factors
considered by the OKSB board of directors in connection with its evaluation of the OKSB merger and the
complexity of these matters, the OKSB board of directors did not consider it practical to, nor did it attempt to,
quantify, rank or otherwise assign relative weights to the specific factors that it considered in reaching its
decision. The OKSB board of directors evaluated the factors described above and reached the unanimous
decision that the OKSB merger was in the best interests of OKSB and its shareholders.

In considering the factors described above, individual members of the OKSB board of directors may have
given different weights to different factors. The OKSB board of directors realized there can be no assurance about
future results, including results expected or considered in the factors listed above. However, the OKSB board of
directors concluded the potential positive factors outweighed the potential risks of completing the OKSB merger.
It should be noted that this explanation of the OKSB board of directors’ reasoning and all other information
presented in this section is forward-looking in nature and, therefore, should be read in light of the factors
discussed under the heading “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” beginning on page
56.

During its consideration of the OKSB merger described above, the OKSB board of directors was also aware
that some of its directors and executive officers may have interests in the OKSB merger that are different from or
in addition to those of its shareholders generally, as described in the section entitled “Interests of OKSB’s
Directors and Executive Officers in the OKSB Merger” beginning on page 106.

The OKSB board of directors determined that the OKSB merger, the OKSB merger agreement and the
transactions contemplated thereby are advisable, fair to, and in the best interests of, OKSB and its shareholders.

Accordingly, the OKSB board of directors unanimously approved the OKSB merger agreement and
the transactions contemplated thereby.

THE OKSB BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT OKSB
SHAREHOLDERS VOTE “FOR” THE ADOPTION OF THE OKSB MERGER AGREEMENT.

Opinion of OKSB’s Financial Advisor

OKSB engaged KBW to render financial advisory and investment banking services to OKSB, including an
opinion to the OKSB board of directors as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of OKSB
common stock of the OKSB merger consideration to be received by such shareholders in the proposed OKSB
merger. OKSB selected KBW because KBW is a nationally recognized investment banking firm with substantial
experience in transactions similar to the OKSB merger. As part of its investment banking business, KBW is
continually engaged in the valuation of financial services businesses and their securities in connection with
mergers and acquisitions.

As part of its engagement, representatives of KBW attended the meeting of the OKSB board of directors
held on December 14, 2016, at which the OKSB board of directors evaluated the proposed OKSB merger. At this
meeting, KBW reviewed the financial aspects of the proposed OKSB merger and rendered to the OKSB board of
directors an opinion to the effect that, as of such date and subject to the procedures followed, assumptions made,
matters considered, and qualifications and limitations on the review undertaken by KBW as set forth in its
opinion, the OKSB merger consideration in the proposed OKSB merger was fair, from a financial point of view,
to the holders of OKSB common stock. The OKSB board of directors approved the OKSB merger agreement at
this meeting.

The description of the opinion set forth herein is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the
opinion, which is attached as Annex E to this document and is incorporated herein by reference, and describes the
procedures followed, assumptions made, matters considered, and qualifications and limitations on the review
undertaken by KBW in preparing the opinion.

KBW’s opinion speaks only as of the date of the opinion. The opinion was for the information of, and
was directed to, the OKSB board of directors (in its capacity as such) in connection with its consideration
of the financial terms of the OKSB merger. The opinion addressed only the fairness, from a financial point
of view, of the OKSB merger consideration to the holders of OKSB common stock. It did not address the
underlying business decision of OKSB to engage in the OKSB merger or enter into the OKSB merger
agreement or constitute a recommendation to the OKSB board of directors in connection with the OKSB
merger, and it does not constitute a recommendation to any holder of OKSB common stock or any
shareholder of any other entity as to how to vote in connection with the OKSB merger or any other matter,
nor does it constitute a recommendation regarding whether or not any such shareholder should enter into
a voting, shareholders’ or affiliates’ agreement with respect to the OKSB merger or exercise any
dissenters’ or appraisal rights that may be available to such shareholder.

KBW’s opinion was reviewed and approved by KBW’s Fairness Opinion Committee in conformity with its
policies and procedures established under the requirements of Rule 5150 of the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority.

In connection with the opinion, KBW reviewed, analyzed and relied upon material bearing upon the
financial and operating condition of OKSB and Simmons and bearing upon the OKSB merger, including, among
other things:

Simmons Bank (a wholly owned subsidiary of Simmons), including (as applicable) quarterly reports on
Form FR Y-9C and quarterly call reports required to be filed with respect to each quarter during the
three-year period ended December 31, 2015, the quarter ended March 31, 2016, quarter ended June 30,
2016 and the quarter ended September 30, 2016;

• certain other interim reports and other communications of OKSB and Simmons to their respective
shareholders; and

• other financial information concerning the businesses and operations of OKSB and Simmons that was
furnished to KBW by OKSB and Simmons or which KBW was otherwise directed to use for purposes
of KBW’s analyses.

• the historical and current financial position and results of operations of OKSB and Simmons;

• the assets and liabilities of OKSB and Simmons;

• the nature and terms of certain other merger transactions and business combinations in the banking
industry;

• a comparison of certain financial and stock market information for OKSB and Simmons with similar
information for certain other companies the securities of which were publicly traded;

• financial and operating forecasts and projections of OKSB that were prepared by OKSB management
and that were provided to KBW and used and relied upon by KBW at the direction of such
management and with the consent of the OKSB board of directors;

• publicly available consensus “street estimates” of Simmons for 2016 through 2018 (which estimates
were adjusted to reflect the pro forma impact of Simmons’ then pending acquisition of HCIC, or the
HCIC Acquisition, which was publicly announced on November 17, 2016), as well as an assumed
long-term Simmons growth rate provided to KBW by Simmons management, all of which information
was discussed with KBW by such management and used and relied upon by KBW based on such
discussions, at the direction of OKSB management and with the consent of the OKSB board of
directors; and

• estimates regarding certain pro forma financial effects of the OKSB merger on Simmons (including,
without limitation, the cost savings and related expenses expected to result or be derived from the
OKSB merger) that were prepared by the management of Simmons, and provided to KBW and used
and relied upon by KBW based on such discussions at the direction of OKSB management and with the
consent of the OKSB board of directors.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

KBW’s consideration of financial information and other factors that it deemed appropriate under the
circumstances or relevant to its analyses included, among others, the following:

KBW also performed such other studies and analyses as it considered appropriate and took into account its
assessment of general economic, market and financial conditions and its experience in other transactions, as well
as its experience in securities valuation and knowledge of the banking industry generally. KBW also participated
in discussions that were held with the respective managements of OKSB and Simmons regarding the past and
current business operations, regulatory relations, financial condition and future prospects of their respective
companies and such other matters as KBW deemed relevant to its inquiry. In addition, KBW considered the
results of the efforts undertaken by or on behalf of OKSB, with KBW’s assistance, to solicit indications of
interest from third parties regarding a potential transaction with OKSB.

In conducting its review and arriving at its opinion, KBW relied upon and assumed the accuracy and
completeness of all of the financial and other information that was provided to it or that was publicly available
and did not independently verify the accuracy or completeness of any such information or assume any
responsibility or liability for such verification, accuracy or completeness. KBW relied upon the

TABLE OF CONTENTS

management of OKSB as to the reasonableness and achievability of the financial and operating forecasts and
projections of OKSB (and the assumptions and bases therefor) that were prepared by, and provided to KBW and
discussed with KBW by, such management and KBW assumed that such forecasts and projections were
reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of such management
and that such forecasts and projections would be realized in the amounts and in the time periods estimated by
such management. KBW further relied, with the consent of OKSB, upon Simmons management as to the
reasonableness and achievability of the publicly available consensus “street estimates” of Simmons (as adjusted
to reflect the pro forma of the HCIC Acquisition as directed by Simmons management), the assumed Simmons
long-term growth rates provided to KBW by such management, and the estimates regarding certain pro forma
financial effects of the OKSB merger on Simmons (including, without limitation, the cost savings and related
expenses expected to result or be derived from the OKSB merger) referred to above (and the assumptions and
bases therefor), and KBW assumed that all such information was reasonably prepared on bases reflecting, or in
the case of the Simmons “street estimates” referred to above that such estimates (as adjusted) were consistent
with, the best currently available estimates and judgments of Simmons management and that the forecasts,
projections and estimates reflected in such information would be realized in the amounts and in the time periods
estimated. KBW expressed no view or opinion as to the HCIC Acquisition (or any terms, aspects or implications
thereof) and assumed, with the consent of OKSB, that the HCIC Acquisition would be consummated as described
to KBW by Simmons management in the first quarter of 2017.

It is understood that the portion of the foregoing financial information of OKSB and Simmons that was
provided to KBW was not prepared with the expectation of public disclosure, that all of the foregoing financial
information, including the publicly available consensus “street estimates” of Simmons referred to above that
KBW was directed to use, was based on numerous variables and assumptions that are inherently uncertain,
including, without limitation, factors related to general economic and competitive conditions and that,
accordingly, actual results could vary significantly from those set forth in such information. KBW assumed,
based on discussions with the respective managements of OKSB and Simmons and with the consent of the OKSB
board of directors, that all such information provided a reasonable basis upon which KBW could form its opinion
and KBW expressed no view as to any such information or the assumptions or bases therefor. KBW relied on all
such information without independent verification or analysis and did not in any respect assume any
responsibility or liability for the accuracy or completeness thereof.

KBW also assumed that there were no material changes in the assets, liabilities, financial condition, results
of operations, business or prospects of either OKSB or Simmons since the date of the last financial statements of
each such entity that were made available to KBW. KBW is not an expert in the independent verification of the
adequacy of allowances for loan and lease losses and KBW assumed, without independent verification and with
OKSB’s consent, that the aggregate allowances for loan and lease losses for OKSB and Simmons are adequate to
cover such losses. In rendering its opinion, KBW did not make or obtain any evaluations or appraisals or physical
inspection of the property, assets or liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of OKSB or Simmons, the collateral
securing any of such assets or liabilities, or the collectability of any such assets, nor did KBW examine any
individual loan or credit files, nor did it evaluate the solvency, financial capability or fair value of OKSB or
Simmons under any state or federal laws, including those relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or other matters.
Estimates of values of companies and assets do not purport to be appraisals or necessarily reflect the prices at
which companies or assets may actually be sold. Because such estimates are inherently subject to uncertainty,
KBW assumed no responsibility or liability for their accuracy.

• that the OKSB merger and any related transactions would be completed substantially in accordance
with the terms set forth in the OKSB merger agreement (the final terms of which KBW assumed would
not differ in any respect material to KBW’s analyses from the draft reviewed by KBW referred to
above) with no adjustments to the OKSB merger consideration and no additional payments in respect
of the OKSB common stock;

• that the representations and warranties of each party in the OKSB merger agreement and in all related

covenants and agreements required to be performed by such party under such documents;

without any waivers or modifications to the OKSB merger agreement or any of the related documents;
and

• that in the course of obtaining the necessary regulatory, contractual, or other consents or approvals for
the OKSB merger and any related transaction, no restrictions, including any divestiture requirements,
termination or other payments or amendments or modifications, would be imposed that would have a
material adverse effect on the future results of operations or financial condition of OKSB, Simmons or
the pro forma entity, or the contemplated benefits of the OKSB merger, including the cost savings and
related expenses expected to result or be derived from the OKSB merger.

merger agreement;

TABLE OF CONTENTS

KBW assumed, in all respects material to its analyses:

KBW assumed that the OKSB merger would be consummated in a manner that complies with the applicable
provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended, or the Exchange Act, and all other applicable federal and state statutes, rules and regulations. KBW
was further advised by representatives of OKSB that OKSB relied upon advice from its advisors (other than
KBW) or other appropriate sources as to all legal, financial reporting, tax, accounting and regulatory matters with
respect to OKSB, Simmons, the OKSB merger and any related transaction, the OKSB merger agreement and the
HCIC Acquisition. KBW did not provide advice with respect to any such matters.

KBW’s opinion addressed only the fairness, from a financial point of view, as of the date of the opinion, to
the holders of OKSB common stock of the OKSB merger consideration to be received by such holders in the
OKSB merger. KBW expressed no view or opinion as to any other terms or aspects of the OKSB merger or any
term or aspect of any related transaction, including without limitation, the form or structure of the OKSB merger
(including the form of the OKSB merger consideration or the allocation thereof between cash and stock) or any
related transaction, any consequences of the OKSB merger or any related transaction to OKSB, its shareholders,
creditors or otherwise, or any terms, aspects, merits or implications of any employment, consulting, voting,
support, shareholder or other agreements, arrangements or understandings contemplated or entered into in
connection with the OKSB merger or otherwise. KBW’s opinion was necessarily based upon conditions as they
existed and could be evaluated on the date of such opinion and the information made available to KBW through
such date. Developments subsequent to the date of KBW’s opinion may have affected, and may affect, the
conclusion reached in KBW’s opinion and KBW did not and does not have an obligation to update, revise or
reaffirm its opinion. KBW’s opinion did not address, and KBW expressed no view or opinion with respect to:

• the fairness of the amount or nature of any compensation to any of OKSB’s officers, directors or
employees, or any class of such persons, relative to the compensation to the holders of OKSB common
stock;

• the effect of the OKSB merger or any related transaction on, or the fairness of the consideration to be
received by, holders of any class of securities of OKSB (other than the holders of OKSB common
stock, solely with respect to the OKSB merger consideration as described in KBW’s opinion and not
relative to the consideration to be received by holders of any other class of securities) or holders of any
class of securities of Simmons or any other party to any transaction contemplated by the OKSB merger
agreement;

• whether Simmons has sufficient cash, available lines of credit or other sources of funds to enable it to
pay the aggregate amount of the cash consideration to the holders of OKSB common stock at the
closing of the OKSB merger;

• any adjustment (as provided in the OKSB merger agreement) to the OKSB merger consideration (or
any component thereof) assumed for purposes of KBW’s opinion;

• the actual value of Simmons common stock to be issued in the OKSB merger;

• the prices, trading range or volume at which OKSB common stock or Simmons common stock would
trade following the public announcement of the OKSB merger or the prices, trading range or volume at
which Simmons common stock would trade following the consummation of the OKSB merger;

• any advice or opinions provided by any other advisor to any of the parties to the OKSB merger or any
other transaction contemplated by the OKSB merger agreement; or

• any legal, regulatory, accounting, tax or similar matters relating to OKSB, Simmons, their respective
shareholders, or relating to or arising out of or as a consequence of the OKSB merger or any related
transaction, or the HCIC Acquisition, including whether or not the OKSB merger would qualify as a
tax-free reorganization for United States federal income tax purposes.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

In performing its analyses, KBW made numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance, general
business, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, which are beyond the control of KBW,
OKSB and Simmons. Any estimates contained in the analyses performed by KBW are not necessarily indicative
of actual values or future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by these
analyses. Additionally, estimates of the value of businesses or securities do not purport to be appraisals or to
reflect the prices at which such businesses or securities might actually be sold. Accordingly, these analyses and
estimates are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty. In addition, the KBW opinion was among several
factors taken into consideration by the OKSB board of directors in making its determination to approve the
OKSB merger agreement and the OKSB merger. Consequently, the analyses described below should not be
viewed as determinative of the decision of the OKSB board of directors with respect to the fairness of the OKSB
merger consideration. The type and amount of consideration payable in the OKSB merger were determined
through negotiation between OKSB and Simmons and the decision of OKSB to enter into the OKSB merger
agreement was solely that of the OKSB board of directors.

The following is a summary of the material financial analyses presented by KBW to the OKSB board of
directors in connection with its opinion. The summary is not a complete description of the financial analyses
underlying the opinion or the presentation made by KBW to the OKSB board of directors, but summarizes the
material analyses performed and presented in connection with such opinion. The financial analyses summarized
below includes information presented in tabular format. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description
of the financial analyses. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex analytic process involving various
determinations as to appropriate and relevant methods of financial analysis and the application of those methods
to the particular circumstances. Therefore, a fairness opinion is not readily susceptible to partial analysis or
summary description. In arriving at its opinion, KBW did not attribute any particular weight to any analysis or
factor that it considered, but rather made qualitative judgments as to the significance and relevance of each
analysis and factor. Accordingly,

TABLE OF CONTENTS

KBW believes that its analyses and the summary of its analyses must be considered as a whole and that selecting
portions of its analyses and factors or focusing on the information presented below in tabular format, without
considering all analyses and factors or the full narrative description of the financial analyses, including the
methodologies and assumptions underlying the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the
process underlying its analyses and opinion.

For purposes of the financial analyses described below, KBW utilized an implied value of the OKSB merger
consideration of  $30.17 per share of OKSB common stock, consisting of the sum of  (i) the implied value of the
stock portion of the OKSB merger consideration of 0.3903 of a share of Simmons common stock based on the
closing price of Simmons common stock on December 12, 2016 and (ii) the cash portion of the OKSB merger
consideration of  $5.11. In addition to the financial analyses described below, KBW reviewed with the OKSB
board of directors for informational purposes, among other things, implied transaction multiples for the proposed
OKSB merger based on the implied value of the OKSB merger consideration of  $30.17 per share of OKSB
common stock of 33.0x OKSB’s estimated 2016 earnings per share, or EPS, and 25.2x OKSB’s estimated 2017
EPS using financial forecasts and projections of OKSB provided by OKSB management and 34.3x OKSB’s
estimated 2016 EPS and 25.6x OKSB’s estimated 2017 EPS using consensus “street estimates” of OKSB.

OKSB Selected Companies Analyses.   Using publicly available information, KBW compared the financial
performance, financial condition and market performance of OKSB to 18 selected banks which were traded on
Nasdaq, the New York Stock Exchange or the New York Stock Exchange Market and headquartered in the
Midwest region (defined as Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska,
North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota and Wisconsin) or the OKSB region (defined as Colorado, Louisiana, New
Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas and Utah) and which had total assets between $1.0 billion and $3.0 billion, and
Tangible Common Equity / Tangible Assets (TCE / TA) greater than 9.0%. Merger targets, savings banks / thrifts
and Cass Information Systems, Inc. were excluded from the selected companies.

The selected companies were as follows:

Allegiance Bancshares, Inc. Independent Bank Corporation

To perform this analysis, KBW used profitability and other financial information for, as of, or, in the case of
latest 12 months, or LTM, information, through the most recent completed quarter, or MRQ, available (which in
the case of OKSB was the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2016) and market price information as of
December 12, 2016. KBW also used 2016 and 2017 earnings per share estimates taken from consensus “street
estimates” for OKSB and the selected companies. Where consolidated holding company level financial data for
the selected companies was unreported, subsidiary bank level data was utilized to calculate ratios. Certain
financial data prepared by KBW, and as referenced in the tables presented below, may not correspond to the data
presented in OKSB’s historical financial statements, or the data prepared by Mercer presented under the section
“The OKSB Merger — Opinion of Simmons’ Financial Advisor,” as a result of the different periods, assumptions
and methods used by KBW to compute the financial data presented.

No company used as a comparison in the above selected companies analysis is identical to OKSB.
Accordingly, an analysis of these results is not mathematical. Rather, it involves complex considerations and

Simmons Selected Companies Analysis.   Using publicly available information, KBW compared the financial
performance, financial condition and market performance of Simmons to 19 selected banks which were traded on
Nasdaq, the New York Stock Exchange or the New York Stock Exchange Market and headquartered in the
Southeast region, states in which Simmons has banking operations or states contiguous to those states and which
had total assets between $5.0 billion and $15.0 billion and non-performing assets, or NPAs, to assets of less than
4.0%. The Southeast region included Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, North Carolina, South
Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia and West Virginia. States in which Simmons has banking operations and states
contiguous to those states included Colorado, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri, Nebraska
and Oklahoma. Merger targets and savings banks / thrifts were excluded from the selected companies.

The selected companies were as follows:

Ameris Bancorp Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
BancFirst Corporation Renasant Corporation
BNC Bancorp ServisFirst Bancshares, Inc.
Capital Bank Financial Corp. South State Corporation
CenterState Banks, Inc. TowneBank
FCB Financial Holdings, Inc. Trustmark Corporation
First Busey Corporation Union Bankshares Corporation
First Midwest Bancorp, Inc. United Community Banks, Inc.
Heartland Financial USA, Inc. WesBanco, Inc.
Home BancShares, Inc.

To perform this analysis, KBW used profitability and other financial information for, as of, or, in the case of
LTM information, through the most recent completed quarter available (which in the case of Simmons was the
fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2016) and market price information as of December 12, 2016. KBW also used
2016 and 2017 EPS estimates taken from consensus “street estimates” for Simmons (adjusted as directed by
Simmons management to reflect the pro forma impact of the then pending HCIC Acquisition) and the selected
companies. Where consolidated holding company level financial data for the selected companies was unreported,
subsidiary bank level data was utilized to calculate ratios. Certain financial data prepared by KBW, and as
referenced in the tables presented below, may not correspond to the data presented in Simmons’ historical
financial statements, or the data prepared by Mercer presented under the section “The OKSB Merger — Opinion
of Simmons’ Financial Advisor,” as a result of the different periods, assumptions and methods used by KBW to

the total transaction consideration less tangible common equity in excess of 8.0% of tangible assets,

acquired company, referred to as core deposit premium.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

No company used as a comparison in the above selected companies analysis is identical to Simmons.
Accordingly, an analysis of these results is not mathematical. Rather, it involves complex considerations and
judgments concerning differences in financial and operating characteristics of the companies involved.

Selected Transactions Analysis.   KBW reviewed publicly available information related to 18 selected U.S.
bank and thrift transactions announced since January 1, 2014, with transaction values between $250 million and
$750 million and acquired companies’ MRQ tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio greater than or equal
to 9.0%. Transactions with non-bank buyers, transactions where the acquired company was a mutual and merger-
of-equals transactions were excluded from the selected transactions.

The selected transactions were as follows:

Acquiror Acquired Company

Independent Bank Group, Inc. Carlile Bancshares, Inc.
Cathay General Bancorp SinoPac Bancorp
First Midwest Bancorp, Inc. Standard Bancshares, Inc.
People’s United Financial, Inc. Suffolk Bancorp
South State Corporation Southeastern Bank Financial Corporation
Mechanics Bank California Republic Bancorp
Old National Bancorp Anchor BanCorp Wisconsin Inc.
Capital Bank Financial Corp. CommunityOne Bancorp

IBERIABANK Corporation Old Florida Bancshares, Inc.
BB&T Corporation Bank of Kentucky Financial Corporation
TowneBank Franklin Financial Corporation
Valley National Bancorp 1st United Bancorp, Inc.
Southside Bancshares, Inc. OmniAmerican Bancorp, Inc.

For each selected transaction, KBW derived the following implied transaction statistics, in each case based
on the transaction consideration value paid for the acquired company and using financial data based on the
acquired company’s then latest publicly available financial statements and, to the extent publicly available, next
year EPS consensus “street estimates” prior to the announcement of the respective transaction:

• price per common share to LTM EPS of the acquired company (in the case of selected transactions
involving a private acquired company, this transaction statistic was calculated as total transaction
consideration divided by LTM earnings); and

• price per common share to next year estimated EPS of the acquired company in the 10 selected
transactions in which consensus “street estimates” for the acquired company were then available.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

KBW also reviewed the price per common share paid for the acquired company for the 12 selected
transactions involving publicly traded acquired companies as a premium to the closing price of the acquired
company one day prior to the announcement of the acquisition (expressed as a percentage and referred to as the
one day market premium). The resulting transaction multiples and premiums for the selected transactions were
compared with the corresponding transaction multiples and premiums for the proposed OKSB merger based on
the implied value of the OKSB merger consideration of  $30.17 per share of OKSB common stock and using
historical financial information for OKSB as of or through September 30, 2016, consensus “street estimates” of
OKSB for the next 12 months and the closing price of OKSB common stock on December 12, 2016.

The results of the analysis are set forth in the following table (excluding the impact of LTM EPS multiple for
three of the selected transactions, which multiples were considered to be not meaningful because they were
negative, greater than 75.0x or reflect material nonrecurring items):

Selected Transactions

1-Day Market Premium (%) 24.9 14.1 18.7 23.0 34.1

No company or transaction used as a comparison in the above selected transaction analysis is identical to
OKSB or the proposed OKSB merger. Accordingly, an analysis of these results is not mathematical. Rather, it
involves complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and operating characteristics
of the companies involved.

Relative Contribution Analysis.   KBW analyzed the relative standalone contribution of Simmons and OKSB
to various pro forma balance sheet and income statement items and the pro forma market capitalization of the
combined entity. This analysis did not include purchase accounting adjustments or cost savings. To perform this
analysis, KBW used (i) balance sheet data for Simmons (pro forma for the then pending HCIC Acquisition based
on publicly available information) and OKSB as of September 30, 2016, (ii) publicly available consensus “street
estimates” of Simmons for 2016 through 2018 (which estimates were adjusted as directed by Simmons
management to reflect the pro forma impact of the then pending HCIC Acquisition) and an assumed long-term
EPS growth rate for Simmons provided by Simmons management, (iii) financial forecasts and projections of
OKSB provided by OKSB management, and (iv) market price data as of December 12, 2016. The results of
KBW’s analysis are set forth in the following table, which also compares the results of KBW’s analysis with the
implied pro forma ownership percentages of Simmons and OKSB shareholders in the combined company based
on the stock portion of the OKSB merger consideration of 0.3903 of a share of Simmons common stock provided
for in the OKSB merger agreement (reflecting an 83% stock / 17% cash implied merger consideration mix) and
also based on a hypothetical exchange ratio assuming 100% stock consideration in the proposed OKSB merger
for illustrative purposes:

Forecasted Pro Forma Financial Impact Analysis.   KBW performed a pro forma financial impact analysis
that combined projected income statement and balance sheet information of Simmons and OKSB. Using (i)
closing balance sheet estimates as of June 30, 2017 for Simmons, extrapolated from historical data using growth
rates taken from consensus “street estimates” (adjusted for the then pending HCIC Acquisition as directed by
Simmons management), and closing balance sheet estimates as of June 30, 2017 for OKSB provided by OKSB
management, (ii) publicly available consensus “street estimates” of Simmons for 2016 through 2018 (which
estimates were adjusted as directed by Simmons management to reflect the pro forma impact of the then pending
HCIC Acquisition) and an assumed long-term EPS growth rate for Simmons provided by Simmons management,
(iii) financial forecasts and projections of OKSB provided by OKSB management, and (iv) pro forma
assumptions (including certain purchase accounting adjustments, cost savings and related expenses) provided by
Simmons management, KBW analyzed the potential financial impact of the OKSB merger on certain projected
financial results of Simmons. This analysis indicated the OKSB merger could be accretive to Simmons’ estimated
2017 EPS, estimated 2018 EPS and estimated 2019 EPS and could be dilutive to Simmons’ estimated tangible
book value per share as of June 30, 2017. Furthermore, the analysis indicated that, pro forma for the OKSB
merger, each of Simmons’ tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio, Common Equity Tier 1 Ratio, Tier 1
Risk-Based Capital Ratio, leverage ratio and Total Risk-Based Capital Ratio as of June 30, 2017 could be lower.
For all of the above analysis, the actual results achieved by Simmons following the OKSB merger may vary from
the projected results, and the variations may be material.

Discounted Cash Flow Analysis.   KBW performed a discounted cash flow analysis of OKSB to estimate a
range for the implied equity value of OKSB. In this analysis, KBW used financial forecasts and projections
relating to the net income and assets of OKSB provided by OKSB management, and assumed discount rates
ranging from 11.0% to 15.0%. The ranges of values were derived by adding (i) the present value of the estimated
excess cash flows that OKSB could generate over the period from June 30, 2016 through December 31, 2021 as a
stand-alone company, and (ii) the present value of OKSB’s implied terminal value at the end of such period.
KBW assumed that OKSB would maintain a tangible common equity to tangible asset ratio of 8.00% and would
retain sufficient earnings to maintain that level. In calculating the terminal value of OKSB, KBW applied a range
of 12.0x to 18.0x estimated 2022 net income. This discounted cash flow analysis resulted in a range of implied
values per share of OKSB common stock of  $18.27 per share to $27.29 per share.

The discounted cash flow analysis is a widely used valuation methodology, but the results of such
methodology are highly dependent on the assumptions that must be made, including asset and earnings growth
rates, terminal values, dividend payout rates, and discount rates. The foregoing discounted cash flow analyses did
not purport to be indicative of the actual values or expected values of OKSB or the pro forma combined
company.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Miscellaneous.   KBW acted as financial advisor to OKSB and not as an advisor to or agent of any other
person. As part of its investment banking business, KBW is continually engaged in the valuation of bank and
bank holding company securities in connection with acquisitions, negotiated underwritings, secondary
distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements and valuations for various other purposes. As
specialists in the securities of banking companies, KBW has experience in, and knowledge of, the valuation of
banking enterprises. In the ordinary course of their broker-dealer businesses, including pursuant to existing sales
and trading relationships of both KBW and a KBW affiliate with each of OKSB and Simmons, KBW and its
affiliates may from time to time purchase securities from, and sell securities to, OKSB and Simmons and, as
market makers in securities, KBW and its affiliates may from time to time have a long or short position in, and
buy or sell, debt or equity securities of OKSB and Simmons for its and their own accounts and for the accounts of
its and their respective customers and clients.

Pursuant to the KBW engagement agreement, OKSB agreed to pay KBW a cash fee equal to 1.00% of the
aggregate merger consideration, $800,000 of which became payable to KBW with the rendering of its opinion
and the balance of which is contingent upon the closing of the OKSB merger. OKSB also agreed to reimburse
KBW for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses and disbursements incurred in connection with its retention and to
indemnify KBW against certain liabilities relating to or arising out of KBW’s engagement or KBW’s role in
connection therewith. In addition to this present engagement, during the two years preceding the date of its
opinion, KBW has provided investment banking and financial advisory services to OKSB and received
compensation for such services. KBW served as financial advisor to OKSB in connection with its acquisition of
First Commercial Bancshares, Inc. in May 2015. During the two years preceding the date of its opinion, KBW
has provided investment banking and financial advisory services to Simmons and received compensation for such
services. KBW acted as financial advisor to Simmons in connection with the HCIC Acquisition recently
completed in May 2017. KBW also acted as financial advisor to Simmons in connection with its acquisition of
Citizen National Bank completed in September 2016. An affiliated broker-dealer of KBW also acted as financial
advisor to Simmons in connection with its acquisition of Ozark Trust & Investment Corporation in October 2015
and also received compensation for such services. In addition, KBW has from time-to-time during the two years
preceding the date of its opinion provided investment banking assistance to Simmons in the ordinary course of
business, for which KBW did not enter into any engagement agreement or receive compensation. KBW may in
the future provide investment banking and financial advisory services to OKSB or Simmons and receive
compensation for such services.

Certain Simmons Prospective Financial Information Provided to OKSB

Simmons management does not as a matter of course make public projections as to future performance,
earnings or other results, and is especially wary of making projections for extended periods, due to the inherent
uncertainty of the underlying assumptions and estimates. However, Simmons provided certain projections to
KBW in its capacity as financial advisor to OKSB for purposes of certain of KBW's analyses performed in
connection with its fairness opinion.

These projections reflect numerous estimates and assumptions with respect to industry performance, general
business, economic, regulatory, market and financial conditions and other future events, as well as matters
specific to Simmons’ business, all of which are inherently uncertain and difficult to predict and many of which
are beyond Simmons’ control. These projections are subjective in many respects and thus are susceptible to
multiple interpretations and periodic revisions based on actual experience and business or economic
developments. These assumptions may also be affected by Simmons’ ability to achieve strategic goals, objectives

prospects;

• the fact that OKSB’s business and operations complement those of Simmons, that OKSB operates in

Accountants, or the AICPA, for preparation and presentation of prospective financial information. Neither
Simmons’ independent registered public accounting firm, nor any other independent accountants, have compiled,
examined or performed any procedures with respect to the projections included below, nor have they expressed
any opinion or any other form of assurance on such information or its achievability, and they assume no
responsibility for, and disclaim any association with, the projections. Furthermore, the projections do not take
into account any circumstances or events occurring after the date they were prepared.

You are strongly cautioned not to place undue reliance on the projections set forth below. The inclusion of
the projections in this joint proxy statement/prospectus should not be regarded as an indication that any of
Simmons, OKSB or their affiliates, advisors or representatives considered or consider the projections to be
necessarily predictive of actual future events, and the projections should not be relied upon as such. None of
Simmons, OKSB or their respective affiliates, advisors, officers, directors or representatives can give any
assurance that actual results will not differ materially from the projections, and none of them undertakes any
obligation to update or otherwise revise or reconcile the projections to reflect circumstances existing after the
date such projections were generated or to reflect the occurrence of future events even in the event that any or all
of the underlying assumptions are shown to be in error. None of Simmons, OKSB or their respective affiliates,
advisors or representatives makes any representation to any other person regarding the projections. The
projections are being included in this joint proxy statement/ prospectus solely to give Simmons’ shareholders and
OKSB’s shareholders access to the projections that were provided to KBW.

Simmons confirmed to KBW the publicly available consensus “street estimate” of its 2017 earnings at the
time of KBW’s inquiry, as adjusted for the HCIC Acquisition, of  $112.7 million, or $3.56 per share. In addition,
Simmons provided KBW with an estimated 5.0% long-term growth rate for Simmons earnings beyond 2018.

In light of the foregoing, and considering that the Simmons special meeting and the OKSB special
meeting will be held several months after the projections were prepared, as well as the uncertainties
inherent in any projections, Simmons shareholders and OKSB shareholders are cautioned not to place
unwarranted reliance on the projections. The projections should be evaluated, if at all, in conjunction with
the information about Simmons contained elsewhere in this joint proxy statement/prospectus and the
historical financial statements and other financial information about Simmons contained in its SEC filings.

Simmons’ Reasons for the OKSB Merger; Recommendation of Simmons’ Board of Directors

In reaching its decision to approve the OKSB merger agreement, the OKSB merger and the other
transactions contemplated by the OKSB merger agreement, the Simmons board of directors consulted with
Simmons’ management, as well as its financial and legal advisors, and considered a number of factors, including
the following material factors:

• OKSB’s market position within its banking markets in Oklahoma, Texas, Colorado and Kansas;

• OKSB’s attractive commercial lending expertise;

• the anticipated pro forma impact of the transaction on the combined company, including the expected
impact on financial metrics including earnings and tangible book value and regulatory capital levels;

• Simmons’ management’s expectation that Simmons will retain its strong capital position upon
completion of the OKSB merger;

• the financial and other terms of the OKSB merger agreement, including the fixed exchange ratio, tax
treatment and termination fee provisions, which it reviewed with its outside financial and legal
advisors;

• the integration experience and retention of OKSB management, which will help achieve a low
execution risk;

• the opinion of Mercer, rendered on December 14, 2016, addressed to the Simmons board of directors as
to the fairness, from a financial point of view and as of the date of such opinion, to Simmons of the
OKSB merger consideration provided for in the OKSB merger, which opinion was based on and
subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and limitations on the
review undertaken as more fully described below under “—Opinion of Simmons’ Financial Advisor.”

• the potential risks associated with achieving anticipated cost synergies and savings and successfully
integrating OKSB’s business, operations and workforce with those of Simmons;

• the potential risk of diverting management attention and resources from the operation of Simmons’
business and towards the completion of the OKSB merger;

• the regulatory and other approvals required in connection with the OKSB merger and the expectation
that such regulatory approvals will be received in a timely manner and without the imposition of
unacceptable conditions, including a burdensome condition;

• the structure of the OKSB merger as a combination in which the combined company would ultimately
operate under the Simmons brand and the Simmons board of directors and Simmons management
would have substantial participation in the combined company; and

• the nature and amount of payments and other benefits to be received by OKSB management in
connection with the OKSB merger pursuant to existing OKSB employment agreements and
compensation plans and arrangements and the OKSB merger agreement.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

The foregoing discussion of the factors considered by the Simmons board of directors is not intended to be
exhaustive, but, rather, includes the material factors considered by the Simmons board of directors. In reaching its
decision to approve the OKSB merger agreement, the OKSB merger and the other transactions contemplated by
the OKSB merger agreement, the Simmons board of directors did not quantify or assign any relative weights to
the factors considered, and individual directors may have given different weights to different factors. The
Simmons board of directors considered all these factors as a whole, including discussions with, and questioning
of, Simmons’ management and Simmons’ financial and legal advisors, and overall considered the factors to be
favorable to, and to support, its determination to approve the OKSB merger agreement. It should be noted that
this explanation of the OKSB board of directors’ reasoning and all other information presented in this section is
forward-looking in nature and, therefore, should be read in light of the factors discussed under the heading
“Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements.”

Opinion of Simmons’ Financial Advisor

On November 18, 2016, Simmons executed an engagement agreement with Mercer to provide financial
advisory services to Simmons, including a written opinion to the Simmons board of directors as to the fairness,

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OKSB shareholders. Simmons selected Mercer because Mercer is a nationally recognized financial advisory firm
with substantial experience in transactions similar to the merger. As part of its financial advisory business,
Mercer is continually engaged in the valuation of financial services businesses and their securities in connection
with mergers and acquisitions.

On December 14, 2016, the Simmons board of directors held a meeting to evaluate the proposed merger
with OKSB. At this meeting Mercer reviewed the financial aspects of the proposed merger and rendered an oral
opinion (subsequently confirmed in writing) that, as of such date and subject to the procedures followed,
assumptions made, matters considered, and qualifications and limitations on the review undertaken by Mercer as
set forth in such opinion, the merger consideration to be paid to OKSB shareholders is fair, from a financial point
of view, to the holders of Simmons common stock. The Simmons board of directors approved the stock purchase
agreement at this meeting.

The description of the opinion set forth herein is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the
opinion, which is attached as Annex C to this document and is incorporated herein by reference, and describes the
procedures followed, assumptions made, matters considered, and qualifications and limitations on the review
undertaken by Mercer in preparing the opinion.

Mercer’s opinion speaks only as of the date of the opinion, and Mercer has undertaken no obligation to
update or revise its opinion. The opinion was for the information of, and was directed to, the Simmons board of
directors in connection with its consideration of the financial terms of the merger. The opinion addressed only the
fairness, from a financial point of view, of the consideration to be paid to OKSB shareholders in the merger. It did
not address the underlying business decision of Simmons to engage in the merger. Mercer’s opinion did not and
does not constitute a recommendation to the Simmons board of directors in connection with the merger, and it
does not constitute a recommendation to any Simmons shareholder or any shareholder of any other entity as to
how to vote in connection with the merger or any other matter. Simmons and OKSB determined the merger
consideration through the negotiation process without assistance of Mercer.

In rendering its opinion, Mercer reviewed, among other things:

• the potential risks associated with achieving anticipated cost synergies and savings and successfully
integrating OKSB’s business, operations and workforce with those of Simmons;

• the potential risk of diverting Simmons management’s attention and resources from the operation of
Simmons business and towards the completion of the OKSB merger;

• the regulatory and other approvals required in connection with the OKSB merger and the expectation
that such regulatory approvals will be received in a timely manner and without the imposition of
unacceptable conditions;

• the structure of the OKSB merger as a combination in which the combined company would operate
under the Simmons brand and the Simmons board of directors and Simmons management would have
substantial participation in the combined company; and

• the nature and amount of payments and other benefits to be received by OKSB management in
connection with the OKSB merger pursuant to existing OKSB plans and compensation arrangements
and the OKSB merger agreement.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Mercer’s opinion was necessarily based upon conditions as they existed and could be evaluated on the date
of the opinion and the information made available to Mercer through the date of the opinion. In conducting its
review and arriving at its opinion, Mercer relied upon the accuracy and completeness of all of the financial and
other information provided to it or otherwise publicly available. Mercer did not independently verify the accuracy
or completeness of any such information or assume any responsibility for such verification or accuracy. Mercer
relied upon management of Simmons and OKSB as to the reasonableness and achievability of the financial and
operating forecasts and projections (and the assumptions and basis therefore) provided to Mercer. Mercer
assumed that such forecasts and projections reflected the best currently available estimates and judgments of such
managements and that such forecasts and projections will be realized in the amounts and in the time periods
currently estimated by such managements.

Mercer did not examine OKSB’s loan portfolio or the adequacy of the loan loss reserve. Mercer did not
make or obtain any evaluation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities of Simmons, OKSB or their respective
affiliates, nor did it examine any individual credit files. Mercer was not asked to and did not undertake any
independent verification of any such information, and Mercer did not assume any responsibility or liability for
the accuracy and completeness thereof.

The projections furnished to Mercer and used by it in certain of its analyses were prepared by management
of Simmons and OKSB. Neither Simmons nor OKSB publicly discloses internal management projections of the
type provided to Mercer in connection with its review of the OKSB merger. As a result, such projections were not
prepared with a view towards public disclosure. The projections were based on numerous variables and
assumptions, which are inherently uncertain, including factors related to general economic and competitive
conditions. Accordingly, actual results could vary significantly from those set forth in the projections.

The following is a summary of the material analyses presented by Mercer to the Simmons board of directors
on December 14, 2016, in connection with the rendering of its fairness opinion. The summary is not a complete
description of the analyses underlying the Mercer opinion, or the presentation, but summarizes the material
analyses performed and presented in connection with such opinion. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a
complex analytic process involving various determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant methods of
financial analysis and the application of those methods to the particular circumstances. Therefore, a fairness
opinion is not readily susceptible to the partial analysis or summary description. In arriving at its opinion, Mercer
did not attribute any particular weight to any analysis or factor that it considered, but rather made qualitative
judgments as to the significance and relevance of each analysis and factor. The financial analyses summarized
below include information presented in tabular format. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description
of the financial analyses. Accordingly, Mercer’s analyses and the summary of its analyses must be considered as
a whole, and selecting portions of its analyses and factors or focusing on the information presented below in
tabular format, without considering all analyses and factors or the full narrative description of the financial
analyses, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying the analyses, could create a misleading or
incomplete view of the process underlying its analyses and opinion.

• 158% and 199% of OKSB’s book value as of September 30, 2016;

• 167% and 211% of OKSB’s tangible book value as of September 30, 2016;

ended September 30, 2016;

• 20.0 times and 25.2 times 2017 estimated earnings; and

• 11.0 times and 14.4 times pro forma 2017 estimated earnings assuming the merger occurred on
January 1, 2017, with all expense savings fully realized, but excluding purchase accounting-related
adjustments.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Summary of the Proposed Merger.   Under the terms of the OKSB merger agreement, OKSB shareholders in
the aggregate will receive aggregate merger consideration of approximately 7,250,000 shares of Simmons
common stock and $95 million of cash. Mercer calculated the implied aggregate value of the merger
consideration to be $564.4 million based upon the closing sales price of Simmons common stock on
December 13, 2016, of  $64.75 per share. Mercer calculated the implied per share merger consideration to be
$30.38 per share based upon the sum of the cash consideration of  $5.11 per share and the product of Simmons
closing price of  $64.75 per share and the 0.3903 exchange ratio that constitutes the stock consideration.

Mercer also compared the implied value of the merger consideration as of December 13, 2016, with the
implied value on September 26, 2016, when OKSB executed the letter of intent because U.S. bank stocks rose
substantially in the weeks following the national elections on November 8 with the SNL U.S. Midcap Bank Index
(of which Simmons common stock is included) increasing 30% from September 26, 2016, through December 13,
2016. Based upon the closing price of Simmons common stock on September 26, 2016, of  $48.72 per share
Mercer calculated an implied aggregate value of the merger consideration to be $448 million and $24.13 per
share.

Mercer calculated the implied merger consideration as of September 26, 2016, and December 13, 2016, to
equate to:

In addition Mercer noted the implied per share merger consideration of  $24.13 per share as of
September 26, 2016, represented a one-day premium of 32% based upon OKSB’s closing price on September 25,
2016, and the implied per share merger consideration of  $30.38 per share as of December 13, 2016, equated to a
one-day premium of 25% based upon OKSB’s closing price on December 12, 2016.

Guideline Public Company Analysis.   Using publicly available information, Mercer compared the valuation,
market performance, financial condition, asset quality, and financial performance of OKSB and Simmons to 30
bank holding companies trading on the Nasdaq or NYSE, and headquartered in Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma,
Mississippi, Missouri, Tennessee and Texas with assets greater than $1.0 billion. Mercer selected the bank
holding companies based upon its professional judgment and experience.

The selected companies included in Simmons’ and OKSB’s “peer” group were:

Allegiance Bancshares, Inc. IBERIABANK Corporation
BancorpSouth, Inc. Independent Bank Group, Inc.
Bank of the Ozarks, Inc. International Bancshares Corporation
BOK Financial Corporation LegacyTexas Financial Group, Inc.

Guideline Transactions Analysis.   Mercer reviewed acquisition multiples for banks and thrifts with similar
characteristics to OKSB as reported by SNL Financial, a firm that tracks public market and M&A pricing in the
financial services industry. The database was screened by Mercer for the following characteristics to derive four
groups of banks and thrifts that had agreed to be acquired.

As shown in the table below, Mercer compared the proposed transaction ratios as of September 26, 2016,
when the letter of intent was executed, and December 13, 2016. For the pending group Mercer calculated the
current value of the proposed consideration as of December 13, 2016, to capture the impact of the appreciation in
U.S. bank stocks since the national election on November 8, 2016.

Transaction multiples for the OKSB merger were derived from the implied aggregate merger consideration
of  $448 million as of September 26, 2016, and $564.4 million as of December 13, 2016. Using the guideline
transaction data, Mercer derived and compared, among other things, the implied merger consideration to:

Discounted Cash Flow Analysis.   Mercer performed a discounted cash flow analysis to estimate a range of
present values of after-tax cash flows that OKSB could contribute to Simmons through 2021, including cost
savings. The discounted cash flow analysis is a widely used valuation method that relies upon numerous
assumptions, including asset and earnings growth rates, minimum tangible common equity ratios, expense
savings, terminal values and discount rates. The analysis did not purport to be indicative of the actual values or
expected values of OKSB.

In performing this analysis, Mercer relied on guidance from management to derive projected after-tax cash
flows for fiscal years 2017 through 2021. Mercer assumed that OKSB would maintain a tangible common equity
to tangible asset ratio of 8.0% and would retain sufficient earnings to maintain that level. Any earnings in excess
of what would need to be retained to maintain an 8.0% tangible asset ratio represented excess capital to be
distributed as a dividend.

Mercer derived a discount rate of 12.0% from the sum of  (a) 2.81% for the risk-free rate derived from the
yield on 20-year U.S. Treasuries; (b) the product of the estimated small-cap banking industry beta of 1.03x and
the common stock premium of 5.50% based upon Mercer’s review of long-term market return data; (c) the small
capitalization stock equity premium of 2.04% based upon the return of the 8  decile of U.S. market cap common
stocks as compiled by Duff  & Phelps; and (d) 1.50% for an incremental risk premium Mercer deemed to be
appropriate given company specific risk associated with OKSB.

Mercer applied terminal multiples ranging from 13.5 times to 17.5 times fiscal year 2021 forecasted
earnings. The upper-end of the band was based upon the 10-year average P/E of 16.6 times for OKSB, 15.9 times
for Simmons, 15.9 times the SNL Small Cap U.S. Bank Index and 16.9 times the SNL Mid Cap U.S. Bank Index.
Mercer considered the lower-end of the range to be more consistent with where small- and mid-sized banks
traded at the time the letter of intent was signed and prior to the revaluation of bank stocks after the November 8,
2016, national elections.

This analysis resulted in a range of values of OKSB from $497 million to $641 million based upon discount
rates of 11.0% to 13.0% and terminal multiples applied to projected 2021 net income of 13.5 times to 17.5 times.
Mercer developed a range of value $542 million to $631 million with a 16.5 times terminal multiple while
varying the discount rate from 11.0% to 13.0% and realized expense savings of 30% to 40% of OKSB’s operating
expenses. Mercer also developed a range of  $465 million to $673 million with a discount rate of 12.0% while
varying the terminal multiple from 13.5 times to 17.5 times and projected 2021 net income with expense savings
of  $40 million to $50 million.

Financial Impact Analysis.   Mercer performed pro forma merger analyses that combined projected income
statement and balance sheet information of Simmons and OKSB (giving effect to its then pending acquisition of
HCIC). Assumptions regarding the accounting treatment, acquisition adjustments and cost

TABLE OF CONTENTS

savings were used to calculate the financial impact that the OKSB merger would have on certain projected
financial results of Simmons. In the course of this analysis, Mercer used earnings estimates for Simmons and
OKSB for 2017 through 2021 provided by Simmons’ management. Mercer used pro forma assumptions
(including purchase accounting assumptions, merger related expenses and cost savings) provided by Simmons’
management. This analysis indicated that the OKSB merger is expected to be accretive to Simmons’ estimated
earnings per share in fiscal years 2018 through 2021. The analysis also indicated that the OKSB merger is
expected to be accretive to tangible book value per share for Simmons in approximately 2.5 years and that the pro
forma entity would maintain well capitalized capital ratios. For all of the above analyses, the actual results
achieved by Simmons following the OKSB merger will vary from the projected results, and the variations may be
material.

Process Consideration.   Mercer was retained to render a fairness opinion. The transaction was negotiated
by OKSB and Simmons management. Mercer was not asked and did not seek alternative bidders.

Other Considerations.   Mercer noted the merger, if consummated, will potentially increase Simmons’
growth rate over time because OKSB’s core markets are growing faster than the majority of Simmons’ markets,
and that upwards of 70% of the cash consideration to be paid in the merger is expected to be funded from
OKSB’s excess capital.

Relationships.   Pursuant to the engagement letter, Simmons agreed to pay Mercer a fee of  $250,000 to
opine as to the fairness of the merger consideration from a financial point of view that will be paid to OKSB
shareholders. No part of Mercer’s fee is contingent upon the conclusion of its analysis or of the merger. Mercer
does not own or make a market in any security that has been issued by Simmons or OKSB. Within the prior two
years, Mercer Capital has been engaged by Simmons related to the valuation of certain intangible assets obtained
in connection with its acquisition of Ozark Trust and Investment Corporation and to provide a fairness opinion
for the acquisition of HCIC. Mercer Capital has not been engaged by OKSB during the past two years.

Certain OKSB Prospective Financial Information Provided to Simmons

OKSB management does not as a matter of course make public projections as to future performance,
earnings or other results, and is especially wary of making projections for extended periods, due to the inherent
uncertainty of the underlying assumptions and estimates. However, OKSB provided certain projections to Mercer
in its capacity as financial advisor to Simmons and to KBW in its capacity as financial advisor to OKSB.

These projections reflect numerous estimates and assumptions with respect to industry performance, general
business, economic, regulatory, market and financial conditions and other future events, as well as matters
specific to OKSB’s business, all of which are inherently uncertain and difficult to predict and many of which are
beyond OKSB’s control. These projections are subjective in many respects and thus are susceptible to multiple
interpretations and periodic revisions based on actual experience and business or economic developments. These
assumptions may also be affected by OKSB’s ability to achieve strategic goals, objectives and targets over the
applicable periods. As such, these projections constitute forward-looking information and are subject to risks and
uncertainties, including the various risks set forth in the sections of this joint proxy statement/prospectus entitled
“Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors” and in OKSB’s Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 and subsequent reports OKSB has filed with
the SEC. The assumptions cover multiple years and such information by its nature becomes subject to greater
uncertainty with each successive year.

The projections were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure or complying with GAAP, the
published guidelines of the SEC regarding projections or the guidelines established by the AICPA for preparation
and presentation of prospective financial information. Neither OKSB’s independent registered public accounting
firm, nor any other independent accountants, have compiled, examined or performed any procedures with respect
to the projections included below, nor have they expressed any opinion or any other form of assurance on such
information or its achievability, and they assume no responsibility for, and disclaim any association with, the
projections. Furthermore, the projections do not take into account any circumstances or events occurring after the
date they were prepared.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

You are strongly cautioned not to place undue reliance on the projections set forth below. The inclusion of
the projections in this joint proxy statement/prospectus should not be regarded as an indication that any of OKSB,
Simmons or their affiliates, advisors or representatives considered or consider the projections to be necessarily
predictive of actual future events, and the projections should not be relied upon as such. None of OKSB,
Simmons or their respective affiliates, advisors, officers, directors or representatives can give any assurance that
actual results will not differ materially from the projections, and none of them undertakes any obligation to
update or otherwise revise or reconcile the projections to reflect circumstances existing after the date such
projections were generated or to reflect the occurrence of future events even in the event that any or all of the
underlying assumptions are shown to be in error. None of OKSB, Simmons or their respective affiliates, advisors
or representatives makes any representation to any other person regarding the projections. The projections are
being included in this joint proxy statement/ prospectus solely to give Simmons’ shareholders and OKSB’s
shareholders access to the projections that were provided to Mercer.

OKSB provided Mercer with projected 2017 earnings of  $22.8 million ($1.20 per share) and projected
earnings for 2018 of  $25.2 million ($1.32 per share). In addition, OKSB provided Mercer with an estimated
long-term growth rate of 9% beyond 2018, although Mercer used a lower 7% estimated long-term growth rate
after discussions with Simmons' management.

In addition, OKSB provided to KBW net income projections of  $22.8 million for 2017, $25.2 million for
2018, $27.5 million for 2019, $30.0 million for 2020 and $32.7 million for 2021, which were used by KBW for
purposes of the financial analyses that KBW performed in connection with its opinion. OKSB provided KBW
with an estimated 9% long-term growth rate for OKSB’s earning from 2018-2021 and an estimated 7% growth
rate for OKSB’s earnings for 2022.

In light of the foregoing, and considering that the Simmons special meeting and the OKSB special
meeting will be held several months after the projections were prepared, as well as the uncertainties
inherent in any projections, Simmons shareholders and OKSB shareholders are cautioned not to place
unwarranted reliance on the projections. The projections should be evaluated, if at all, in conjunction with
the information about OKSB contained elsewhere in this joint proxy statement/prospectus and the
historical financial statements and other financial information about OKSB contained in its SEC filings.
See ‘‘Where You Can Find More Information.’’

Interests of OKSB’s Directors and Executive Officers in the OKSB Merger

Certain members of OKSB’s executive management team and the members of OKSB’s board of directors
have financial and other interests in the OKSB merger that are in addition to, or different from, their interests as
OKSB shareholders generally. OKSB’s board of directors was aware of these interests and considered them,
among other matters, in approving and adopting the OKSB merger agreement. OKSB shareholders should take
these interests into account when deciding whether to vote for the OKSB merger proposal. These interests are
described in more detail below, and certain of them are quantified within the narrative disclosure and in the tables
below.

Employment Relationships.   A number of executive officers of OKSB, including Mark W. Funke, have
contractual rights to severance pay or benefits triggered by a change in control with OKSB and a termination of
their employment with OKSB or Simmons under certain circumstances. It is expected that Mr. Funke will
become an officer of Simmons Bank following the consummation of the merger of OKSB Bank with and into
Simmons Bank. It is a condition to Simmons’ obligation to consummate the OKSB merger that Simmons and Mr.
Funke enter into a new employment arrangement that is satisfactory to Simmons and that Mr. Funke and OKSB
terminate his existing employment agreement.

It is anticipated that many other OKSB Bank employees will continue to be employed by Simmons after the
OKSB merger. All such employees will be able to participate in all Simmons employee benefit plans offered to
similarly situated employees of Simmons, including severance benefits in accordance with the applicable
severance policy of Simmons (other than to any employee who is a party to individual agreements or letters that
entitle such person to different severance or termination benefits). Employees of OKSB or its subsidiaries
generally will receive service credit based on their service with OKSB or its subsidiaries for purposes of
participation in the Simmons employee benefit plans.

recently paid, prior to the change of control; (ii) a relocation of executive’s principal office with OKSB or any
successor that increases the executive’s commute by more than 35 miles per day; (iii) a substantial and adverse

(b) one times the average cash portion of Mr. Funke’s annual bonus for the three years immediately preceding the

termination of Mr. Funke’s employment; (ii) any service condition contained in any equity awards outstanding in
favor of Mr. Funke shall be deemed to have been satisfied immediately prior to the effective date of the

“Company Incentive Portion” of Mr. Shockley’s annual bonus under the OKSB ELT Incentive Plan for the three
years immediately prior to the date of the OKSB merger, which amount shall be paid in substantially equal

following the date of termination of Mr. Shockley’s employment.

Under the terms of each of Ms. Barnes, Mr. Bates, and Mr. LaForge’s existing change of control agreements
with OKSB, if, within 24 months following the closing of the OKSB merger, the executive’s employment is

reason: (i) the executive will be entitled to severance, payable in a single lump sum payment, within 30 days of
the date of termination, in an amount equal to the sum of  (a) two times the executive’s annual base salary as in
effect on the date of the change of control and (b) one times the average of the “Company Incentive Portion” of

will be entitled to continued participation in the medical, hospitalization, and dental programs maintained by us
for the benefit of our executive officers as in effect on the date of termination, at such level and terms and

OKSB Employee Stock Purchase Plan, OKSB and Affiliates Amended and Restated Severance Compensation
Plan, OKSB 2002 and 2003 Deferred Compensation Plans, OKSB 2013 Elective Non-Qualified Deferred
Compensation Plan, and OKSB Executive Leadership Team Incentive Plan, which remain outstanding
immediately prior to completion of the OKSB merger will immediately vest upon the effective time of the OKSB
merger and will be entitled to be exchanged for the OKSB merger consideration in the same manner as
unrestricted shares of OKSB common stock. Based on the OKSB merger consideration being $466.1 million, and
assuming the merger is completed in the fourth quarter of 2017, the value of all unvested shares that are held by
OKSB’s directors and executive officers as a group would be approximately $5.9 million.

Each outstanding share of OKSB common stock held in the OKSB Employee Stock Purchase Plan will be
entitled to be exchanged for OKSB merger consideration in the same manner as other shares of OKSB common
stock.

Security Ownership of OKSB Directors and Executive Officers.   As of the OKSB record date, there were
18,685,099 shares of OKSB common stock outstanding and entitled to vote. Approximately 6.37% of those
voting shares were owned and entitled to be voted by OKSB or OKSB Bank directors and executive officers and
their affiliates. Concurrently with execution of the OKSB merger agreement, OKSB’s directors entered into
OKSB support agreements with Simmons to vote his or her shares in favor of the OKSB merger proposal and
against certain competing acquisition proposals or other actions that would frustrate the purposes of, prevent or
materially delay completion of the OKSB merger, as well as certain other restrictions with respect to the voting
and transfer of such shareholder’s shares of OKSB common stock. OKSB also expects these shareholders will
vote in favor of the OKSB compensation proposal and the OKSB adjournment proposal, if necessary or
appropriate. These shareholders have also agreed to customary non-solicitation covenants that restrict such
shareholder’s ability to solicit business from, or interfere with, Simmons customers or to solicit Simmons’
employees.

Indemnification; Directors’ and Officers’ Insurance.   Simmons has agreed to indemnify and hold harmless
each present and former director and officer of OKSB and its subsidiaries following completion of the OKSB
merger. This indemnification covers liability and expenses arising out of matters existing or occurring at or prior
to the completion of the OKSB merger to the fullest extent permitted under state law and by OKSB’s certificate
of incorporation and bylaws as in effect on the date of the OKSB merger agreement, including provisions relating
to advances of expenses incurred in the defense of any litigation. Simmons also has agreed to use its reasonable
best efforts to maintain OKSB’s policy of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance coverage or policies of at
least the same coverage and amounts and containing terms and conditions which are substantially no less
advantageous than the current policy (or, with the consent of OKSB prior to the effective time of the OKSB
merger, any other policy), with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred prior to the effective
time of the merger for the benefit of OKSB’s existing directors and officers for six years following completion of
the OKSB merger as long as the premium to be paid is not more than 200% of the current annual premium paid
by OKSB for such insurance. In lieu of the insurance described in the preceding sentence, prior to the effective
time of the OKSB merger, Simmons, or OKSB, in consultation with Simmons, may obtain a six-year “tail”
prepaid policy providing coverage equivalent to such insurance.

OKSB Golden Parachute Compensation.   Set forth below is information about compensation that may be
payable to certain of OKSB’s executive officers that is based on or otherwise related to the OKSB merger. Under
applicable SEC rules, information is provided for OKSB’s principal executive officer, principal financial officer
and the three other most highly compensated executive officers who were serving as such at the end of 2016, and
who are referred to collectively as the OKSB named executive officers.

The following table sets forth the aggregate dollar value of the compensation that each of the OKSB named
executive officers would receive that is based on or otherwise related to the OKSB merger, assuming the
following:

• the OKSB named executive officers were terminated without cause, or resigned under circumstances
constituting an effective termination (in either case, a “covered termination” for the purpose of this
section), immediately following the closing of the OKSB merger on September 8, 2017, the last
practicable trading day before the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus; and

• the value of the vesting acceleration of the OKSB named executive officers’ equity awards is calculated
assuming a price per share of Simmons common stock of  $62.27, which was the average closing price
of Simmons common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market during the five-day period first
following the public announcement of the OKSB merger.

(1) The amounts in this column reflect the value in respect of unvested restricted stock that vests upon the
closing of the OKSB merger in accordance with the terms of the OKSB merger agreement, calculated
assuming a price per share of  $62.27, derived as stated above. This accelerated vesting is considered to be a
single-trigger arrangement, subject only to the closing of the OKSB merger itself. Refer to the table under
the heading “OKSB Equity Awards” of this section.

(2) The amounts in these columns are double-trigger benefits that require two conditions, which are the closing
of the OKSB merger as well as a covered termination of employment within 24 months following the
closing of the OKSB merger.

(3) The amounts in this column reflect the annual cost of the OKSB named executive officer’s medical,
hospitalization, and dental insurance coverage.

OKSB Compensation Proposal; Quantification of Potential Payments to OKSB’s Named Executive
Officers in Connection with the OKSB Merger

In accordance with Section 14A of the Exchange Act and SEC rules issued thereunder, OKSB shareholders
may cast a non-binding, advisory vote to approve compensation that may be paid or become payable to OKSB’s
named executive officers in connection with the OKSB merger, as set forth herein. Accordingly, the following
resolution will be submitted to a non-binding, advisory vote of OKSB shareholders at the OKSB special meeting:

RESOLVED, that the compensation that may be paid or become payable to OKSB’s named executive
officers, in connection with the OKSB merger, and the agreements or understandings pursuant to which such
compensation may be paid or become payable, in each case as disclosed pursuant to Item 402(t) of Regulation S-
K in the table below and the footnotes thereto and related narrative section, is hereby APPROVED.

THE OKSB BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT OKSB
SHAREHOLDERS VOTE “FOR” THE OKSB COMPENSATION PROPOSAL.

Dissenters’ Rights in the OKSB Merger

Introductory Information

General.   Dissenters’ rights with respect to OKSB common stock are governed by the OGCA. OKSB
shareholders have the right to dissent from the OKSB merger and to obtain payment of the “fair value” of their
shares in cash (as specified in the statute) in the event the OKSB merger is consummated. Strict compliance
with the dissent procedures is required to exercise and perfect dissenters’ rights under the OGCA. Subject
to the terms of the OKSB merger agreement, the OKSB board of directors could elect to terminate the OKSB
merger agreement even if it is approved by OKSB’s shareholders, thus cancelling dissenters’ rights.

OKSB urges any OKSB shareholder who contemplates exercising his right to dissent to read carefully the
provisions of Section 1091 of the OGCA, which are attached to this joint proxy statement/prospectus as Annex
H. A more detailed discussion of the provisions of the statute is included there. The discussion describes the steps
that each OKSB shareholder must take to exercise his right to dissent. Each OKSB shareholder who wishes to
dissent should read both the summary and the full text of the law. OKSB cannot give any OKSB shareholder
legal advice. To completely understand this law, each OKSB shareholder may want, and OKSB encourages any
OKSB shareholder seeking to dissent, to consult with his legal advisor. Any OKSB shareholder who wishes to
dissent should not send in a signed proxy unless he marks his proxy to vote against the OKSB merger or
such shareholder will lose the right to dissent.

Address for Notices.   Send or deliver any written notice or demand concerning any OKSB shareholder’s
exercise of his dissenters’ rights to Southwest Bancorp, Inc., 6301 Waterford Blvd., Suite 400, Oklahoma City,
Oklahoma 73118, Attention: Rusty LaForge, General Counsel, Telephone: (405) 427-4052.

Act Carefully.   OKSB urges any OKSB shareholder who wishes to dissent to act carefully. OKSB cannot
and does not accept the risk of late or undelivered notices or demands. A dissenting OKSB shareholder may call
OKSB at (405) 427-4052 and ask for OKSB’s General Counsel, Rusty LaForge to receive confirmation that his
notice or demand has been received. If his notices or demands are not timely received by OKSB, then such
shareholder will not be entitled to exercise his dissenters’ rights. OKSB’s shareholders bear the risk of non-
delivery and of untimely delivery.

If any OKSB shareholder intends to dissent, or thinks that dissenting might be in his best interests,
such shareholder should read Annex H carefully.

Summary of Section 1091 of the OGCA — Dissenters’ Rights

The following is a summary of Section 1091 of the OGCA and the procedures that an OKSB shareholder
must follow to dissent from the OKSB merger agreement and to perfect his appraisal rights and receive cash
rather than the OKSB merger consideration (including Simmons common stock), if the OKSB merger agreement
is approved and the OKSB merger is completed. This summary is qualified in its entirety

• deliver to OKSB, before a shareholder vote is taken at the OKSB special meeting, a written demand for
appraisal of the shares of the OKSB shareholder. The written demand must reasonably inform OKSB of
the identity of the shareholder and that such shareholder intends thereby to demand appraisal of the
shares of the shareholder. Neither a proxy nor vote against the OKSB merger will satisfy the
requirement of such written demand;

• not vote in favor of the OKSB merger proposal (note that a vote, in person or by proxy, against the
OKSB merger proposal will not satisfy the statutory requirement that a shareholder make a written
demand for an appraisal of his shares); and

• continuously hold his shares of OKSB common stock on and from the date he makes the demand
through the effective time of the OKSB merger.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

by reference to Section 1091 of the OGCA, which is reprinted in full as part of this Annex H to this joint proxy
statement/prospectus. Annex H should be reviewed carefully by any shareholder who wishes to perfect his
dissenters’ rights. Failure to strictly comply with the procedures set forth in Section 1091 of the OGCA will, by
law, result in the loss of dissenters’ rights. It may be prudent for a person considering whether to dissent to obtain
professional counsel.

If the OKSB merger is completed, any OKSB shareholder who has properly perfected his statutory
dissenters’ rights in accordance with Section 1091 of the OGCA has the right to obtain, in cash, payment of the
fair value of such shareholder’s shares of OKSB common stock. The appraised fair value may be more or less
than the value of the OKSB merger consideration to be received in the OKSB merger. Investment banker
opinions as to the fairness from a financial point of view of the consideration payable in a transaction such as the
OKSB merger are not opinions as to, and do not address in any manner, fair value under the OGCA.

Under Section 1091 of the OGCA, each OKSB shareholder who demands an appraisal in connection with
the OKSB merger and who complies with the various procedural requirements of Section 1091 of the OGCA is
entitled to “appraisal rights, “pursuant to which the OKSB shareholder will receive the fair value of his shares of
OKSB common stock in cash. The value as determined by an Oklahoma court may be more or less than the value
such shareholder is entitled to under the OKSB merger agreement.

To exercise and perfect appraisal rights under Section 1091 of the OGCA, an OKSB shareholder must do
each of the following:

If an OKSB shareholder does not vote against the OKSB merger proposal, it will not constitute a waiver of
his appraisal rights under the OGCA if such shareholder makes a written demand for payment before the vote is
taken at the OKSB special meeting. Conversely, voting against the OKSB merger agreement will not, by itself, be
sufficient to satisfy an OKSB shareholder’s obligations if he dissents and wants to exercise his appraisal rights.
An OKSB shareholder must follow the procedures set forth in Section 1091 of the OGCA to exercise any
appraisal rights.

Each outstanding share of OKSB common stock as to which a legally sufficient demand in accordance with
Section 1091 of the OGCA has been made and that did not vote in favor of approval of the OKSB merger
proposal retains all other rights of an OKSB shareholder until those rights are cancelled by consummation of the
OKSB merger. However, after the effective time of the OKSB merger, no dissenting shareholder who has
demanded appraisal rights shall be entitled to vote the stock for any purpose or to receive payment of dividends
(except dividends payable to shareholders of record prior to the effective time of the OKSB merger).

If the OKSB merger is approved at the OKSB special meeting, within 10 days after the effective date of the
OKSB merger, Simmons must notify the dissenting shareholders who have complied with the provisions of
Section 1091 of the OGCA described above that the OKSB merger has become effective. Within 120 days after
the effective date of the OKSB merger, Simmons will send to such dissenting shareholders, upon written request,
a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the OKSB merger proposal and
with respect to which demands for appraisal have been received and the aggregate number of holders of the
shares. The written statement will be mailed to the dissenting shareholders within 10 days after the written
request is received by Simmons or within 10 days after the expiration of the period for delivery of demands for
appraisal, whichever is later.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Also within 120 days after the effective date of the OKSB merger, any dissenting shareholder who has
complied with the provisions of Section 1091 of the OGCA or Simmons may file a petition in district court
demanding a determination of the value of the stock of the dissenting shareholders; however, at any time within
60 days after the effective date of the OKSB merger, each dissenting shareholder has the right to withdraw his
demand for appraisal and to accept the OKSB merger consideration offered under the OKSB merger agreement.
The court shall provide notice to Simmons of any such petition filed by a shareholder and, within 20 days of
service of that notice, Simmons shall provide to the court a list of all shareholders who have demanded payment
for their shares and with whom agreements regarding the value of their shares have not been reached by
Simmons. After providing proper notice of the proceeding, the court will determine the shareholders who are
entitled to appraisal rights and will direct Simmons to pay the fair value of the shares, together with interest, to
the OKSB shareholders entitled to such payment. In determining the fair value of the shares, the court will take
into account all relevant factors and will exclude any element of value arising from the accomplishment or
expectation of the OKSB merger. The court will determine the costs of the proceeding and may tax the parties as
it deems appropriate. Upon request by a dissenting shareholder, the court may order all or a portion of the
expenses incurred by any shareholder, including attorneys’ fees and expenses of experts, be charged pro rata
against the value of all of the shares entitled to an appraisal. Payment will be made to dissenting shareholders
with certificated shares immediately and to those with certificated shares upon surrender of the certificates
representing the shares of OKSB common stock.

The shares for which a dissenting shareholder has properly exercised and perfected appraisal rights and
followed the required procedures in the OGCA will not be converted into, or represent, the right to receive
Simmons common stock and cash as provided under the OKSB merger agreement. None of these OKSB shares
will, after the effective time of the OKSB merger, be entitled to vote for any purpose or receive any dividends or
other distributions. If, however, the holder of such shares fails to properly perfect, effectively withdraws, waives
or loses, or otherwise becomes ineligible to exercise appraisal rights under the OGCA, then at that time shares
held by such holder will be converted into Simmons common stock and cash as provided in the OKSB merger
agreement.

The foregoing discussion does not purport to be a complete statement of the procedures for exercising and
perfecting appraisal rights under the OGCA and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of Section
1091 of the OGCA, a copy of which is attached as Annex H to this joint proxy statement/ prospectus.

If any OKSB shareholder intends to dissent, or if such shareholder believes that dissenting might be in
his best interests, such shareholder should read Annex H carefully.

For a description of Simmons shareholders’ dissenters’ rights, see “The Mergers — Simmons Shareholders
Dissenters’ Rights in the OKSB Merger and First Texas Merger.”

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE FIRST TEXAS MERGER

The following discussion contains certain information about the First Texas merger. This discussion is
subject, and qualified in its entirety by reference, to the First Texas merger agreement attached as Annex B to this
joint proxy statement/prospectus and incorporated herein by reference. We urge you to read carefully this entire
joint proxy statement/prospectus, including the First Texas merger agreement attached as Annex B, for a more
complete understanding of the First Texas merger.

The First Texas merger proposal will be considered and voted upon by the Simmons shareholders at the
Simmons special meeting and by the First Texas shareholders at the First Texas special meeting.

Terms of the First Texas Merger

Each of Simmons’ and First Texas’ respective boards of directors has unanimously approved and adopted
the First Texas merger agreement. The First Texas merger agreement provides for the merger of First Texas with
and into Simmons, with Simmons continuing as the surviving corporation. Following completion of the First
Texas merger, First Texas Bank will operate as a separate bank subsidiary of Simmons until it is merged with and
into Simmons Bank.

In the First Texas merger, each share of First Texas common stock, $1.00 par value per share, issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the First Texas merger, except for shares of First Texas
common stock held directly or indirectly by First Texas or Simmons and any dissenting shares, will be converted
into the right to receive, subject to possible adjustment and based on certain assumptions described below, the
First Texas merger consideration. The amount of First Texas merger consideration described above is based on
the following assumptions derived from amounts that were applicable as of September 8, 2017: (1) immediately
prior to the effective time of the First Texas merger, there are (a) 7,884,553 shares of First Texas common stock
outstanding, (b) 644,191 shares of First Texas common stock subject to First Texas options outstanding with a
weighted average exercise price of  $27.76 per option, (c) 13,000 shares of First Texas common stock subject to
First Texas SARs outstanding with a weighted average initial value of  $19.76 per First Texas SAR, (d) 5,710
shares of First Texas common stock subject to First Texas restricted stock units and (e) 25,648 First Texas
Unallocated ESOP Shares outstanding, and (2) the average closing price per share of Simmons common stock at
the closing of the First Texas merger is $51.20, which was the closing sales price of Simmons common stock on
September 8, 2017, the last practicable trading day before the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus. Since
we will not know the actual amounts reflected in these assumptions until immediately prior to the effective time
of the First Texas merger, the amount of First Texas stock consideration and First Texas cash consideration
actually received by First Texas shareholders may be different than the amounts described herein. No fractional
shares of Simmons common stock will be issued in connection with the First Texas merger, and holders of First
Texas common stock that would otherwise receive a fractional share will be entitled to receive cash in lieu
thereof. First Texas shareholders and Simmons shareholders are being asked to approve the First Texas merger
agreement. See “The Merger Agreements” for additional and more detailed information regarding the legal
documents that govern the First Texas merger and the OKSB merger, including information about the conditions
to the completion of the First Texas merger and the provisions for terminating or amending the First Texas merger
agreement.

Background of the First Texas Merger

From time to time, the First Texas board of directors has engaged in reviews and discussions of First Texas’
long-term strategies and objectives, considering ways that it might enhance shareholder value and First Texas’
performance and prospects in light of competitive and other relevant factors. Strategic options considered by the
First Texas board of directors have included expanding organically, raising additional capital through private
placements or public offerings of equity or debt securities, and merging with another financial institution.

In 2015, Stephens contacted two parties that had previously expressed an interest in acquiring First Texas in
order to determine their continued interest in such an acquisition. Receiving a favorable response, First Texas
executed mutual non-disclosure agreements with each party on June 30, 2015 and July 1, 2015, respectively.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

After initial due diligence, Party A submitted an initial letter of intent to First Texas on July 15, 2015. The
letter of intent provided for an aggregate purchase price of  $350.0 million, to be paid entirely in shares of Party
A common stock, which is registered with the SEC and publicly traded. Party B provided a verbal offer that was
considerably lower than Party A’s.

After receipt of Party A’s initial letter of intent, the First Texas board of directors appointed an independent
board committee comprised of James Finley, Rafael Garza, Mason King and Tom Purvis to evaluate the offers
from Party A and Party B and to recommend next steps. The committee determined that it was not in the best
interest of First Texas shareholders to continue negotiations with Party B given the substantially more favorable
offer from Party A. On July 28, 2015, after continued negotiations, First Texas received a revised letter of intent
from Party A for an aggregate purchase price of  $353.1 million in Party A common stock. First Texas called a
special board meeting on July 29, 2015, which included presentations by senior executives of Party A as well as
representatives of Stephens.

First Texas and Party A held further conversations regarding the strategy of the combined organization in the
days immediately following First Texas board of directors meeting, and on August 1, 2015, the independent
committee of First Texas board of directors met with First Texas executive management to discuss the results of
these follow-up discussions. The committee expressed concerns regarding the direction of the combined
organization and addressed their concerns with Stephens. On August 4, 2015, Party A withdrew its letter of intent
without further negotiation. First Texas determined not to actively market itself for sale at that time but to
continue to consider strategic alternatives.

In late 2015 and early 2016, at the direction of First Texas executive management, Stephens continued to
have targeted discussions with potential merger partners, including an introduction between members of First
Texas and Simmons executives. In the summer of 2016, Stephens contacted ten parties regarding their interest in
pursuing a transaction. Simmons signed a confidentiality agreement on February 9, 2016, which was amended on
September 14, 2016. Simmons’ management team conducted preliminary due diligence on First Texas and, on
October 14, 2016, First Texas received a formal, non-binding letter of intent from Simmons, the terms of which
provided for the acquisition of First Texas for aggregate consideration of 6,500,000 shares of Simmons common
stock, which is registered with the SEC and publicly traded, and $60.0 million in cash. The stock consideration
was valued at approximately $323.7 million as of that date, for an aggregate consideration amount of
approximately $385 million.

From June through October 2016, the senior management of Simmons kept the Simmons board of directors
apprised of a number of acquisition opportunities including with First Texas. Senior management of Simmons
evaluated the financial and other information it had received from or on behalf of First Texas in order to
determine whether an acquisition of First Texas was financially and strategically viable to Simmons. In addition
to evaluating the financial considerations of a merger with First Texas, Simmons management evaluated the
strategic opportunities that a merger with First Texas offered to Simmons, including the banking markets that
First Texas operates in and its market share and brand within certain of those markets. Following its submission
of a non-binding indication of interest to acquire First Texas, and subsequent discussions with Stephens on behalf
of First Texas regarding the financial terms of its initial indication of interest, Simmons management re-evaluated
the financial and other information it had been provided on First Texas during its preliminary due diligence to
determine whether it could revise the financial terms of its proposal.

On October 25, 2016, First Texas received a letter of intent from another publicly-traded regional bank
holding company, Party C, the terms of which provided for aggregate consideration of approximately $400.0
million in Party C common stock. The letter of intent called for fixed consideration, with the common stock
exchange ratio to be determined based upon Party C’s public market trading price at the date of announcement of
a transaction. Vernon Bryant met with members of Party C’s management team on October 26, 2016, to discuss
the terms of the potential transaction and the strategy and prospects of a combined organization.

On October 26, 2016, Simmons submitted a revised letter of intent which increased the aggregate cash
consideration from $60.0 million to $70.0 million, or aggregate consideration of approximately $395 million.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

On October 27, 2016, First Texas held a special board meeting to discuss and consider the letters of intent
from Simmons and Party C. The First Texas board of directors discussed at length the prospects of combining
with each potential acquirer, including the results of conversations between the management teams of each
company, and the strategy, direction, culture and potential value of the respective potential combined entities.
After extensive deliberation, First Texas board of directors directed management to execute the letter of intent
with Simmons, which was executed on October 31, 2016.

The letter of intent provided for a period of exclusivity through January 31, 2017, to allow for the parties to
conduct due diligence and negotiate the terms of a definitive agreement. Each party conducted extensive due
diligence between November 2016 and January 2017, including Simmons conducting management interview due
diligence at the First Texas headquarters in Fort Worth, Texas during November and December 2016, and First
Texas conducting on-site due diligence at Simmons’ offices in Little Rock, Arkansas, during early January 2017.
Following due diligence, the parties negotiated the terms of a merger agreement.

On January 13, 2017, Simmons distributed an initial draft of the First Texas merger agreement to First
Texas. Between January 13, 2017 and January 23, 2017, the specific terms of the First Texas merger agreement
were negotiated between representatives of Simmons and its outside counsel, Covington, and First Texas and its
outside counsel Fenimore, Kay, Harrison & Ford, LLP, or FKHF. During this period, Covington and FKHF also
negotiated the terms of the First Texas support agreements.

On January 23, 2017, the First Texas board of directors held a special meeting to formally consider the
definitive agreement. Representatives from Stephens and First Texas’ outside counsel, FKHF, respectively gave
presentations regarding the financial and legal terms of the definitive agreement and answered questions posed by
the First Texas board of directors. The representatives from Stephens and FKHF also opined, respectively, to the
fairness of the financial terms of the transaction and to certain legal considerations. After due consideration, the
First Texas board of directors determined that the First Texas merger is in the best interests of First Texas and its
shareholders and that the consideration to be received in the First Texas merger is fair to the First Texas
shareholders. Accordingly, the First Texas board of directors unanimously approved the First Texas merger
agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby and directed management to execute the definitive
agreement on behalf of First Texas, which was completed on that date.

On January 23, 2017, the Simmons board of directors held a meeting to consider the terms of the proposed
First Texas merger. Prior to the meeting, the directors received copies of the draft First Texas merger agreement,
the draft First Texas support agreement and of the other draft transaction documents, as well as a presentation
prepared by its financial advisor, Mercer Capital. At the meeting, members of Simmons’ management reported on
the status of due diligence and negotiations with First Texas. Representatives of Mercer Capital reviewed Mercer
Capital’s financial analysis of the proposed First Texas merger, including discussing the various financial
methodologies used in its analysis. Representatives of Mercer Capital then delivered its oral opinion (which was
subsequently confirmed in writing by delivery of Mercer Capital’s written opinion dated January 23, 2017) that,
as of the date of the Simmons board of directors meeting and based upon and subject to the various factors,
assumptions and limitations set forth in its written opinion, the First Texas merger consideration to be paid by
Simmons in connection with the First Texas merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to Simmons. The full
text of the written opinion of Mercer Capital dated January 23, 2017, which sets forth the assumptions made,
procedures followed, matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken in connection with the opinion,
is attached as Annex D to this joint proxy statement/prospectus. At the meeting, Simmons’ internal legal counsel
reviewed with the Simmons board of directors its fiduciary duties and reviewed the key terms of the First Texas
merger agreement and related agreements (including the First Texas support agreements), as described elsewhere
in this joint proxy statement/prospectus, including a summary of the provisions relating to governance of the
combined company and the provisions relating to employee matters.

After considering the proposed terms of the First Texas merger agreement, the terms of the proposed First
Texas support agreements, and the various presentations of Mercer Capital and its internal legal counsel, and
taking into consideration the matters discussed during that meeting and prior meetings of the Simmons board of
directors, including the factors described under “— Simmons’ Reasons for the First

was likely to achieve on a stand-alone basis or through other strategic alternatives, including enhanced
access to capital and liquidity for First Texas’ future growth;

• First Texas’ belief that First Texas and Simmons share a similar strategic vision;

• Simmons’ commitment to enhancing its strategic position in its markets;

• the fact that the First Texas stock consideration would allow former First Texas shareholders to
participate as Simmons shareholders in the growth of Simmons and in any synergies resulting from the
First Texas merger;

• the performance of Simmons common stock;

• the limited liquidity that First Texas shareholders have with respect to their investment in First Texas,
for which there is no active public market, and the fact that as Simmons shareholders, First Texas’
shareholders would be expected to have increased liquidity in the form of a publicly-traded, Nasdaq-
listed security;

• the immediate liquidity to First Texas shareholders, and the certainty of the amount, reflected by the
First Texas cash consideration;

• the value of the First Texas merger consideration compared to the current and projected book value of
First Texas and compared to similar recent transactions in the industry;

Texas Merger; Recommendation of Simmons’ Board of Directors,” the Simmons board of directors unanimously
determined that the First Texas merger was consistent with Simmons’ business strategies and in the best interests
of Simmons and Simmons shareholders and the directors voted unanimously to approve and adopt the First Texas
merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby and recommended that Simmons shareholders
approve the First Texas merger agreement.

On January 23, 2017, the First Texas merger agreement was signed by First Texas and Simmons and a press
release announcing the First Texas merger was released.

First Texas’ Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of First Texas’ Board of Directors

At its meeting on January 23, 2017, the First Texas board of directors unanimously approved the First Texas
merger agreement and recommended that the First Texas shareholders vote “FOR” the First Texas merger
proposal.

In reaching its decision to approve the First Texas merger agreement and recommend the First Texas merger
to its shareholders, the First Texas board of directors evaluated the First Texas merger and the First Texas merger
agreement, in consultation with First Texas’ management, as well as its legal and financial advisors, and
considered a number of positive factors, including but not limited to the following material factors, which are not
presented in order of priority:

regarding the First Texas merger and the First Texas merger agreement;

• the financial presentation of Stephens, dated January 23, 2017, to the First Texas board of directors and
the opinion of Stephens, dated January 23, 2017, to the First Texas board of directors to the effect that,
as of January 23, 2017, and subject to the assumptions, limitations and qualifications set forth in the
opinion, the per share First Texas merger consideration was fair, from a financial point of view, to the
holders of First Texas common stock, as more fully described below under the section of this joint
proxy statement/prospectus entitled “— Opinion of First Texas’ Financial Advisor”; and

• the likelihood of Simmons consummating the First Texas merger based upon Simmons’ history of
completing other merger transactions.

• the challenges of combining the businesses, assets and workforces of two financial institutions;

• the potential risk of diverting management focus and resources from other strategic opportunities and
from operational matters while working to implement the First Texas merger;

• the risks and costs to First Texas if the First Texas merger is not completed;

• the fact that the First Texas merger consideration, a large component which consists of shares of
Simmons common stock, provides less certainty of value to First Texas shareholders compared to a
transaction in which they would receive only cash consideration;

• the potential for a decline in the value of Simmons common stock — whether before or after
consummation of the First Texas merger — reducing the value of the consideration received by First
Texas’ shareholders;

• the provisions of the First Texas merger agreement restricting First Texas’ solicitation of third party
acquisition proposals and the fact that First Texas would be obligated to pay a termination fee
following the termination of the First Texas merger agreement in certain circumstances;

• the fact that gains from the First Texas cash consideration would generally be taxable to First Texas’
U.S. shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes;

• the potential for unintended delays in the regulatory approval process, especially in light of the pending
protest regarding the merger application filed by Simmons with respect to a separate pending
acquisition; and

• the interests of certain of First Texas’ directors and executive officers in the First Texas merger that are
different from, or in addition to, their interests as First Texas shareholders, which are further described
in the section of this joint proxy statement/prospectus entitled “— Interests of First Texas’ Directors
and Executive Officers in the Merger.”

TABLE OF CONTENTS

The First Texas board of directors also considered potential risks and potentially negative factors concerning
the First Texas merger in connection with its deliberations of the proposed transaction, including the following
material factors:

The foregoing discussion of the factors considered by the First Texas board of directors is not intended to be
exhaustive, but is believed to include the material factors considered by the First Texas board of directors. The
First Texas board of directors collectively reached the unanimous conclusion to approve the First Texas merger
agreement and the First Texas merger in light of the various factors described above and other factors that each
member of the First Texas board of directors determined was appropriate. In view of the wide variety of the
factors considered in connection with its evaluation of the First Texas merger and the complexity of these
matters, the First Texas board of directors did not find it useful, and did not attempt, to quantify, rank or
otherwise assign relative weights to these factors. In considering the factors described above, the individual

different weight to different factors. The First Texas board of directors conducted an overall analysis of the
factors described above including thorough discussions with First Texas management and First Texas’ financial
and legal advisors, and considered the factors overall to be favorable to, and to support, its determination.

FOR THE REASONS SET FORTH ABOVE, THE FIRST TEXAS BOARD OF DIRECTORS
UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT THE FIRST TEXAS SHAREHOLDERS VOTE “FOR” THE
FIRST TEXAS MERGER PROPOSAL.

Opinion of First Texas’ Financial Advisor

Stephens was retained to serve as financial advisor to First Texas in connection with any business
combination transaction involving First Texas. As part of its engagement, First Texas requested the opinion of
Stephens as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to shareholder the holders of First Texas common
stock of the First Texas merger consideration to be received by them in the First Texas merger pursuant to the
First Texas merger agreement. On January 23, 2017, Stephens delivered its oral opinion to the First Texas board
of directors and subsequently confirmed in a written opinion, dated January 23, 2017 that, as of that date and
based upon and subject to the assumptions and qualifications stated in its written opinion, the First Texas merger
consideration to be exchanged by Simmons for the outstanding common stock of First Texas in the First Texas
merger was fair, from a financial point of view shareholder.

Stephens provided the opinion described above for the information and assistance of the First Texas board of
directors in connection with its consideration of the approval of the First Texas merger agreement. The terms of
the First Texas merger, including the amount and form of the consideration payable pursuant to the First Texas
merger agreement to First Texas’ shareholders, were determined through negotiations between First Texas and
Simmons, and were approved by the First Texas board of directors. Stephens did not recommend the amount or
form of consideration payable pursuant to the First Texas merger agreement. The full text of the written opinion
letter of Stephens, dated January 23, 2017, which sets forth assumptions made, procedures followed, matters
considered, qualifications stated and limitations to the review undertaken in connection with its opinion is
attached as Annex F to this joint proxy/prospectus.

Stephens’ opinion does not address the merits of the underlying decision by First Texas to enter into the First
Texas merger, the merits of the First Texas merger as compared to other alternatives potentially available to First
Texas or the relative effects of any alternative transaction in which First Texas might engage, nor is it intended to
be a recommendation to any person as to how to vote on the proposal to approve the First Texas merger. In
addition, except as explicitly set forth in Stephens’ opinion, Stephens was not asked to address, and Stephens’
opinion does not address, the fairness to, or any other consideration of, the holders of any class of securities,
creditors or other constituencies of First Texas other than the disinterested shareholders. Stephens was not asked
to express any opinion, and does not express any opinion, as to the fairness of the amount or nature of the
compensation to any of First Texas’ officers, directors or employees, or to any group of such officers, directors or
employees, relative to the compensation to other shareholders of First Texas, including (but not limited to) any
consideration expected to be received by any such persons in connection with the First Texas merger. Stephens’
fairness opinion committee approved the issuance of Stephens’ opinion.

In connection with rendering its opinion Stephens:

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Stephens has relied on the accuracy and completeness of the information and financial data provided by First
Texas and of the other information reviewed by Stephens in connection with the preparation of Stephens’
opinion, and its opinion is based upon such information. Stephens has not independently verified the accuracy or
completeness of the information and financial data on which Stephens’ opinion is based. The managements of
First Texas and Simmons have assured Stephens that they are not aware of any relevant information that has been
omitted or remains undisclosed to Stephens. Stephens has not assumed any responsibility for making or
undertaking an independent evaluation or appraisal of any of the assets or liabilities of First Texas or of Simmons,

solvency or fair value of First Texas or of Simmons under any laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar
matters. In addition, Stephens has not received or reviewed any individual credit files nor has Stephens made an
evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses of First Texas or Simmons. With respect to the
financial forecasts prepared by the management of First Texas, Stephens has assumed that such financial
forecasts have been reasonably prepared and reflect the best currently available estimates and judgments of the
management of First Texas as to the future financial performance of First Texas and that the financial results
reflected by such projections will be realized as predicted. Stephens has also assumed that the representations and
warranties contained in the First Texas merger agreement and all related documents are true, correct and complete
in all material respects.

Stephens’ opinion is necessarily based upon market, economic and other conditions as they exist and can be
evaluated on, and on the information made available to Stephens as of, the date hereof. It should be understood
that subsequent developments may affect the opinion and that Stephens does not have any obligations to update,
revise or reaffirm its opinion. Stephens has assumed that the First Texas merger will be consummated on the
terms of the latest draft of the First Texas merger agreement provided to Stephens, without material waiver or
modification. Stephens has assumed that in the course of obtaining the necessary regulatory, lending or other
consents or approvals (contractual or otherwise) for the First Texas merger, no restrictions, including any
divestiture requirements or amendments or modifications, will be imposed that would have a material adverse
effect on the contemplated benefits of the First Texas merger to First Texas or the shareholders.

The following is a summary of the material financial analyses performed and material factors considered by
Stephens in connection with its opinion. Stephens performed certain procedures, including each of the financial
analyses described below, and reviewed with the First Texas board of directors and executive management the
assumptions upon which the analyses were based, as well as other factors. Although the summary does not
purport to describe all of the analyses performed or factors considered by Stephens within this regard, it does set
forth those considered by Stephens to be material in arriving at its opinion. The order of the summaries of
analyses described does not represent the relative importance or weight given to those analyses by Stephens. It
should be noted that in arriving at its opinion, Stephens did not attribute any particular weight to any analysis or
factor considered by it, but rather made qualitative

judgments as to the significance and relevance of each analysis and factor. Accordingly, Stephens believes that its
analysis must be considered as a whole and that considering any portion of such analyses and factors, without
considering all analyses and factors as a whole, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the process
underlying its opinion.

Summary of Proposed Transaction.   Pursuant to the First Texas merger agreement and for purposes of its
opinion, Stephens assumed the consideration to be exchanged by Simmons for the outstanding First Texas
common stock to have an aggregate value of  $462.0 million, subject to potential adjustments as more fully
defined in the First Texas merger agreement. Simmons will issue a total of 6,500,000 shares worth approximately
$392.0 million, based upon Simmons common stock closing sales price of  $60.30 per share on January 20, 2017,
and pay an aggregate of  $70.0 million in cash to First Texas shareholders. Based upon the unaudited financial
information as of and for the 12 months ended December 31, 2016, Stephens calculated the following transaction
multiples:

Transaction Value / Last 12 Months, or LTM, Earnings: 24.8x
Transaction Value / Estimated 2017 Earnings: 21.0x
Transaction Value / Book Value: 2.04x
Transaction Value / Tangible Book Value: 2.44x

The last 12 months net income of the acquired company based on the most recent publicly available
financial statements prior to announcement. The estimated 2017 net income is based on assumptions provided by
First Texas management.

Relevant Public Companies Analysis.   Stephens compared the financial condition, operating statistics and
market valuation of First Texas and Simmons to separate groups of selected relevant public companies. Stephens
selected the companies outlined below because their relative asset size and financial performance, among other
factors, are reasonably similar to First Texas or Simmons; however, no selected company below is identical to
First Texas or Simmons. A complete analysis involves complex considerations and qualitative judgments
concerning differences in financial and operating characteristics and other factors that could affect the public
trading values of the relevant public companies. Mathematical analysis (such as determining the mean or the
median) is not in itself a meaningful method of using relevant public company data.

Relevant Transactions Analysis.   Stephens analyzed selected transaction multiples and related financial data
for relevant transactions in Texas announced since January 1, 2013 with target assets between $200 million and
$600 million and ROAA greater than 0.0%. The following transactions were considered by Stephens because
each acquired company’s relative asset size and financial performance, among other factors, is reasonably similar
to First Texas’ (in each case, the first named company was the acquirer and the second named company was the
acquired company and the transaction announcement date is noted parenthetically):

Stephens considered these selected transactions to be reasonably similar, but not identical, to the First Texas
merger. A complete analysis involves complex considerations and qualitative judgments concerning differences
in the selected transactions and other factors that could affect the transaction values in those selected transactions
to which the First Texas merger is being compared. Mathematical analysis (such as determining the mean or the
median) is not in itself a meaningful method of using selected transaction data. Stephens compared certain
proposed transaction multiples of the First Texas merger to the 25  percentile, median, mean and 75  percentile
transaction multiples of the relevant transactions:

Discounted Cash Flow Analysis, Terminal PE Method.   Stephens performed a discounted cash flow analysis
using projections developed by First Texas executive management. Stephens calculated a range of implied equity
values for First Texas based upon the discounted net present value of the projected after-tax free cash flows for
the projected period. Stephens determined the amount of cash flow assuming (i) a terminal earnings multiple of
18.0x, (ii) dividend payments for earnings and excess capital above a tangible common equity to tangible asset
ratio of 9.0% from 2016 to 2021 and (iii) the present value of First Texas’ implied terminal value at the end of
such period. Stephens calculated the terminal value of First Texas based on 2022 estimated earnings and
multiples of 17.0x to 19.0x. Stephens considered discount rates from 11.0% to 13.0%. Based on this analysis,
Stephens derived a range for the implied equity value of First Texas from $445.1 to $535.8 million.

Discounted Cash Flow Analysis, Terminal TBV Method.   In addition, Stephens performed a similar
discounted cash flow analysis based on the amount of cash flow assuming (i) a terminal tangible book multiple of
2.20x, (ii) dividend payments for earnings and excess capital above a tangible common equity to tangible asset
ratio of 9.0% from 2016 to 2021 and (iii) the present value of First Texas’ implied terminal value at the end of
such period. Stephens calculated the terminal value of First Texas based on 2021 estimated tangible book value
and multiples of 2.10x to 2.30x. Stephens considered discount rates from 11.0% to 13.0%. Based on this analysis,
Stephens derived a range for the implied equity value of First Texas from $367.4 million to $433.0 million.

Financial Impact Analysis.   Stephens analyzed the estimated merger consequences of certain pro forma
combined income statement and balance sheet information of First Texas and Simmons. Stephens discussed key
assumptions regarding the expected accounting treatment, potential cost savings and other acquisition
adjustments resulting from the First Texas merger with management of First Texas and Simmons. Stephens’
analysis utilized consensus earnings estimates for Simmons as of January 17, 2017, as well as earnings estimates
for First Texas provided by First Texas executive management. Based on this analysis, Stephens estimated that
the First Texas merger would likely be accretive to Simmons’ consensus earnings per share in the first two years
following the closing of the First Texas merger and would be dilutive to Simmons’ tangible book value per share.
Stephens also estimated that Simmons would maintain capital ratios in excess of those required by Simmons to
be considered well-capitalized under existing regulations. The actual results achieved by Simmons following the
First Texas merger will vary from these projected results analyzed by Stephens, and the variations may be
material.

Miscellaneous.   As part of Stephens’ investment banking business, Stephens regularly issues fairness
opinions and is continually engaged in the valuation of companies and their securities in connection with business
reorganizations, private placements, negotiated underwritings, mergers and acquisitions and valuations for estate,
corporate and other purposes. Stephens is familiar with First Texas and Simmons and has previously provided
investment banking services to First Texas and Simmons. Stephens also issues periodic research reports regarding
Simmons’ business activities and prospects. Stephens has received fees for providing investment banking
services to Simmons in the past and expects to pursue and may also receive fees for future services. Stephens
served as financial advisor to Simmons in connection with its pending acquisition of OKSB and will receive a fee
equal to $2.25 million. In addition, a senior executive of Stephens is a member of Simmons’ board of directors.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Texas in its private placement of common equity in 2015, and Stephens received investment banking
compensation for its services. Stephens has provided securities brokerage services to both First Texas and
Simmons and has received customary compensation for such services.

Stephens served as financial adviser to First Texas in connection with the First Texas merger, and is entitled
to receive from First Texas reimbursement of its expenses and a fee for its services as financial adviser to First
Texas equal to 1.2% of the purchase price less than or equal to $350 million plus 3.0% of the amount by which
the First Texas merger value exceeds $350 million, a significant portion of which is contingent upon the
consummation of the First Texas merger. Stephens also received a fee of  $500,000 from First Texas for providing
its opinion to the First Texas board of directors, which will be credited in full towards the transaction fee which
will become payable to Stephens upon consummation of the First Texas merger. First Texas has also agreed to
indemnify Stephens for certain liabilities arising out of its engagement, including certain liabilities that could
arise out of it providing the opinion letter. In the ordinary course of business, Stephens Inc. and its affiliates at
any time may hold long or short positions, and may trade or otherwise effect transactions as principal or for the

participant in the First Texas merger. Affiliates and employees of Stephens hold investments in First Texas and in
Simmons.

Conclusion.   Based upon the foregoing and its general experience as investment bankers, and subject to the
assumptions and qualifications set forth in its fairness opinion letter, Stephens concluded that the First Texas
merger consideration to be received by the shareholders of First Texas common stock in the First Texas merger is
fair to them from a financial point of view. Each shareholder is encouraged to read Stephens’ fairness opinion in
its entirety. The full text of the fairness opinion is included as Annex F to this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

Simmons’ Reasons for the First Texas Merger; Recommendation of Simmons’ Board of Directors

In reaching its decision to approve the First Texas merger agreement, the First Texas merger and the other
transactions contemplated by the First Texas merger agreement, the Simmons board of directors consulted with
Simmons management, as well as its financial and legal advisors, and considered a number of factors, including
the following material factors:

• the potential risks associated with achieving anticipated cost synergies and savings and successfully
integrating First Texas’ business, operations and workforce with those of Simmons;

• the potential risk of diverting Simmons management’s attention and resources from the operation of
Simmons business and towards the completion of the First Texas merger;

• the regulatory and other approvals required in connection with the First Texas merger and the
expectation that such regulatory approvals will be received in a timely manner and without the
imposition of unacceptable conditions, including a burdensome condition;

• the structure of the eventual First Texas Bank Merger as a combination in which the First Texas Bank
branches would continue to operate under the First Texas Bank brand as a division of Simmons Bank;
and

• the nature and amount of payments and other benefits to be received by First Texas management in
connection with the First Texas merger pursuant to existing First Texas plans and compensation
arrangements and the First Texas merger agreement.

provided for in the First Texas merger, which opinion was based on and subject to the assumptions
made, procedures followed, matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken as more fully
described below under “— Opinion of Simmons’ Financial Advisor”;

The foregoing discussion of the factors considered by the Simmons board of directors is not intended to be
exhaustive, but rather includes the material factors considered by the Simmons board of directors. In reaching its
decision to approve the First Texas merger agreement, the First Texas merger and the other transactions
contemplated by the First Texas merger agreement, the Simmons board of directors did not quantify or assign any
relative weights to the factors considered, and individual directors may have given different weights to different
factors. The Simmons board of directors considered all these factors as a whole, including discussions with, and
questioning of, Simmons’ management and Simmons’ financial and legal advisors, and overall considered the
factors to be favorable to, and to support, its determination to approve the First Texas merger agreement. It should
be noted that this explanation of the First Texas board of directors’ reasoning and all other information presented
in this section is forward-looking in nature and, therefore, should be read in light of the factors discussed under
the heading “Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements.”

Opinion of Simmons’ Financial Advisor

On November 22, 2016, Simmons executed an engagement agreement with Mercer to provide financial
advisory services to Simmons, including a written opinion to the Simmons board of directors as to the fairness,
from a financial point of view to Simmons shareholders, of the merger consideration to be paid to First Texas.
Simmons selected Mercer because Mercer is a nationally recognized financial advisory firm with substantial
experience in transactions similar to the merger and familiarity with Simmons and its business. As part of its
financial advisory business, Mercer is continually engaged in the valuation of financial services businesses and
their securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions.

On January 18, 2017, the Simmons board of directors held a meeting to evaluate the proposed merger with
First Texas. At this meeting Mercer reviewed the financial aspects of the proposed merger and rendered an oral
opinion (subsequently confirmed in writing) that, as of such date and subject to the procedures followed,
assumptions made, matters considered, and qualifications and limitations on the review undertaken by Mercer as
set forth in such opinion, the merger consideration to be paid to First Texas is fair, from a financial point of view,
to the holders of Simmons common stock. The Simmons board of directors approved the stock purchase
agreement at this meeting.

The description of the opinion set forth herein is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the
opinion, which is attached as Annex D to this document and is incorporated herein by reference, and describes
the procedures followed, assumptions made, matters considered, and qualifications and limitations on the review
undertaken by Mercer in preparing the opinion.

Mercer’s opinion speaks only as of the date of the opinion, and Mercer has undertaken no obligation to
update or revise its opinion. The opinion was for the information of, and was directed to, the Simmons board of
directors in connection with its consideration of the financial terms of the merger. The opinion

TABLE OF CONTENTS

addressed only the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the consideration to be paid to First Texas in the
merger. It did not address the underlying business decision of Simmons to engage in the merger. Mercer’s opinion
did not and does not constitute a recommendation to the Simmons board of directors in connection with the
merger, and it does not constitute a recommendation to any Simmons shareholder or any shareholder of any other
entity as to how to vote in connection with the merger or any other matter. Simmons and First Texas determined
the merger consideration through the negotiation process without assistance of Mercer.

In rendering its opinion, Mercer reviewed, among other things:

Mercer’s opinion was necessarily based upon conditions as they existed and could be evaluated on the date
of the opinion and the information made available to Mercer through the date of the opinion. In conducting its
review and arriving at its opinion, Mercer relied upon the accuracy and completeness of all of the financial and
other information provided to it or otherwise publicly available. Mercer did not independently verify the accuracy
or completeness of any such information or assume any responsibility for such verification or accuracy. Mercer
relied upon management of Simmons and First Texas as to the reasonableness and achievability of the financial
and operating forecasts and projections (and the assumptions and basis therefore) provided to Mercer. Mercer
assumed that such forecasts and projections reflected the best currently available estimates and judgments of such
managements and that such forecasts and projections will be realized in the amounts and in the time periods
currently estimated by such managements.

Mercer did not examine First Texas’ loan portfolio or the adequacy of the loan loss reserve. Mercer did not
make or obtain any evaluation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities of Simmons, First Texas or their respective
affiliates, nor did it examine any individual credit files. Mercer was not asked to and did not undertake any
independent verification of any such information, and Mercer did not assume any responsibility or liability for
the accuracy and completeness thereof.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

The projections furnished to Mercer and used by it in certain of its analyses were prepared by management
of Simmons and First Texas. Neither Simmons nor First Texas publicly discloses internal management
projections of the type provided to Mercer in connection with its review of the First Texas merger. As a result,
such projections were not prepared with a view towards public disclosure. The projections were based on
numerous variables and assumptions, which are inherently uncertain, including factors related to general
economic and competitive conditions. Accordingly, actual results could vary significantly from those set forth in
the projections.

The following is a summary of the material analyses presented by Mercer to the Simmons board of directors
on January 18, 2017, in connection with the rendering of its fairness opinion. The summary is not a complete
description of the analyses underlying the Mercer opinion, or the presentation, but summarizes the material
analyses performed and presented in connection with such opinion. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a
complex analytic process involving various determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant methods of
financial analysis and the application of those methods to the particular circumstances. Therefore, a fairness
opinion is not readily susceptible to the partial analysis or summary description. In arriving at its opinion, Mercer
did not attribute any particular weight to any analysis or factor that it considered, but rather made qualitative
judgments as to the significance and relevance of each analysis and factor. The financial analyses summarized
below include information presented in tabular format. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description
of the financial analyses. Accordingly, Mercer’s analyses and the summary of its analyses must be considered as
a whole, and selecting portions of its analyses and factors or focusing on the information presented below in
tabular format, without considering all analyses and factors or the full narrative description of the financial
analyses, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying the analyses, could create a misleading or
incomplete view of the process underlying its analyses and opinion.

Summary of the Proposed Merger.   Under the terms of the merger agreement, First Texas shareholders will
receive merger consideration of 6,500,000 shares of Simmons common stock and $70.0 million of cash. Mercer
calculated the implied aggregate value of the merger consideration to be $450 million based upon the closing
sales price of Simmons common stock on January 17, 2017, of  $58.50 per share. Mercer did not calculate a per
share consideration to be paid to First Texas shareholders because the number of fully diluted common shares of
First Texas had not been determined as of January 17, 2017.

Mercer also compared the implied value of the merger consideration as of January 17, 2017, with the
implied value on October 25, 2016, when First Texas executed the letter of intent, because U.S. bank stocks rose
substantially in the weeks following the national elections on November 8, with the SNL U.S. Midcap Bank
Index (which includes Simmons common stock) increasing 22% from October 25, 2016 through January 17,
2017. Based upon the closing price of Simmons common stock on October 25, 2016, of  $49.35 per share Mercer
calculated an implied aggregate value of the merger consideration to be $391 million.

Mercer calculated the implied merger consideration as of October 25, 2016, and January 17, 2017, to equate
to:

Guideline Public Company Analysis.   Using publicly available information, Mercer compared the valuation,
market performance, financial condition, asset quality, and financial performance of First Texas and Simmons to
30 bank holding companies trading on the Nasdaq or NYSE, and headquartered in Arkansas, Louisiana,
Oklahoma, Mississippi, Missouri, Tennessee and Texas with assets greater than $1.0 billion. Mercer selected the
bank holding companies based upon its professional judgment and experience.

Guideline Transactions Analysis.   Mercer reviewed acquisition multiples for banks and thrifts with similar
characteristics to First Texas as reported by SNL Financial. The database was screened by Mercer for the
following characteristics to derive three groups of banks and thrifts that had agreed to be acquired.

As shown in the table below, Mercer compared the proposed transaction ratios as of October 25, 2016, when
the letter of intent was executed, and January 17, 2017. For the pending group Mercer calculated the current
value of the proposed consideration as of January 17, 2017, to capture the impact of the appreciation in U.S. bank
stocks since the national election on November 8, 2016.

Transaction multiples for the First Texas merger were derived from the implied aggregate merger
consideration of  $391 million as of October 25, 2016, and $450 million as of January 17, 2017. Using the
guideline transaction data, Mercer derived and compared, among other things, the implied merger consideration
to:

Mercer noted that because First Texas has a high concentration in commercial real estate-related loans that it
considered 9.0% to represent a threshold level of core capital in its analysis of First Texas rather than 8.0% as
reflected in its analysis of OKSB.

Discounted Cash Flow Analysis.   Mercer performed a discounted cash flow analysis to estimate a range of
present values of after-tax cash flows that First Texas could contribute to Simmons through 2021, including cost
savings. The discounted cash flow analysis is a widely used valuation method that relies upon numerous
assumptions, including profitability, asset and earnings growth rates, minimum tangible common equity ratios,
expense savings, terminal values and discount rates. The analysis did not purport to be indicative of the actual
values or expected values of First Texas.

In performing this analysis, Mercer relied on guidance from management to derive projected after-tax cash
flows for fiscal years 2017 through 2021. Mercer assumed that First Texas would maintain a tangible common
equity to tangible asset ratio of 9.0% and would retain sufficient earnings to maintain that level. Any earnings in
excess of what would need to be retained to maintain a 9.0% tangible asset ratio represented excess capital that
could be distributed as a dividend.

Mercer derived a discount rate of 11.9% from the sum of  (a) 2.68% for the risk-free rate derived from the
yield on 20-year U.S. Treasuries; (b) the product of the estimated small-cap banking industry beta of 1.04x and
the common stock premium of 5.50% based upon Mercer’s review of long-term market return data; (c) the small
capitalization stock equity premium of 2.04% based upon the return of the 8  decile of U.S. market cap common
stocks as compiled by Duff  & Phelps; and (d) 1.50% for an incremental risk premium Mercer deemed to be
appropriate given company specific risk associated with First Texas.

Mercer applied terminal multiples ranging from 13.5 times to 17.5 times fiscal year 2021 forecasted
earnings. The upper-end of the band was based upon the 10-year average P/E of 15.9 times for Simmons, 15.9
times for the SNL Small Cap U.S. Bank Index and 16.9x for the SNL Mid Cap U.S. Bank Index. Mercer
considered the lower-end of the range to be more consistent with where small- and mid-sized banks traded at the
time the letter of intent was signed and prior to the revaluation of bank stocks after the November 8, 2016
national elections.

This analysis resulted in a range of values of First Texas from $393 million to $535 million based upon
discount rates of 11.0% to 13.0% and terminal multiples applied to projected 2021 net income of 13.5 times to
17.5 times. Mercer developed a range of value of  $463 million to $544 million with a 16.5x terminal multiple
while varying the discount rate from 11.0% to 13.0% and realized expense savings of 30% to 40% of First Texas’
operating expenses. Mercer also developed a range of  $373 million to $587 million with a discount rate of 11.9%
while varying the terminal multiple from 13.5 times to 17.5 times and projected 2021 net income with expense
savings of  $40 million to $50 million.

Financial Impact Analysis.   Mercer performed pro forma merger analyses that combined projected income
statement and balance sheet information of Simmons and First Texas (giving effect to its then pending
acquisitions of HCIC and OKSB). Assumptions regarding the accounting treatment, acquisition adjustments and
cost savings were used to calculate the financial impact that the First Texas merger would have on certain
projected financial results of Simmons. In the course of this analysis, Mercer used earnings estimates for
Simmons and First Texas for 2017 through 2021 provided by Simmons’ management. Mercer

TABLE OF CONTENTS

used pro forma assumptions (including purchase accounting assumptions, merger related expenses and cost
savings) provided by Simmons’ management. This analysis indicated that the First Texas merger is expected to
be accretive to Simmons’ estimated earnings per share in fiscal years 2018 through 2021. The analysis also
indicated that the First Texas merger is expected to be accretive to tangible book value per share for Simmons in
approximately 3.75 years and that the pro forma entity would maintain well capitalized capital ratios. For all of
the above analyses, the actual results achieved by Simmons following the First Texas merger will vary from the
projected results, and the variations may be material.

Process Consideration.   Mercer was retained to render a fairness opinion. The transaction was negotiated
by First Texas and Simmons management. Mercer was not asked and did not seek alternative bidders or targets.

Other Considerations.   Mercer noted the merger, if consummated, will potentially increase Simmons’
growth rate over time because First Texas’ core markets are growing faster than the majority of Simmons’
markets.

Relationships.   Pursuant to the engagement letter, Simmons agreed to pay Mercer a fee of  $250,000 to
opine as to the fairness of the merger consideration from a financial point of view that will be paid to First Texas
shareholders. No part of Mercer’s fee is contingent upon the conclusion of its analysis or of the merger. Mercer
does not own or make a market in any security that has been issued by Simmons or First Texas. Within the prior
two years, Mercer Capital has been engaged by Simmons related to the valuation of certain intangible assets
obtained in connection with its acquisition of Ozark Trust and Investment Corporation and to provide fairness
opinions for the acquisitions of HCIC and OKSB. Mercer Capital has not been engaged by First Texas during the
past two years.

Certain First Texas Prospective Financial Information Provided to Simmons

First Texas management does not as a matter of course make public projections as to future performance,
earnings or other results, and is especially wary of making projections for extended periods, due to the significant
unpredictability of the underlying assumptions and estimates. However, First Texas provided certain projections
to Mercer in its capacity as financial advisor to Simmons.

These projections reflect numerous estimates and assumptions with respect to industry performance, general
business, economic, regulatory, market and financial conditions and other future events, as well as matters
specific to First Texas’ business, all of which are inherently uncertain and difficult to predict and many of which
are beyond First Texas’ control. These projections are subjective in many respects and thus are susceptible to
multiple interpretations and periodic revisions based on actual experience and business or economic
developments. These projections may also be affected by First Texas’ ability to achieve strategic goals, objectives
and targets over the applicable periods. As such, these projections constitute forward-looking information and are
subject to risks and uncertainties, including the various risks set forth in the sections of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus entitled “Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk
Factors.” The projections cover multiple years and such information by its nature becomes less reliable with each
successive year.

The projections were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure or complying with GAAP, the
published guidelines of the SEC regarding projections or the guidelines established by the AICPA for preparation
and presentation of prospective financial information. Neither First Texas’ independent auditor, nor any other
independent accountants, have compiled, examined or performed any procedures with respect to the projections
included below, nor have they expressed any opinion or any other form of assurance on such information or its
achievability, and they assume no responsibility for, and disclaim any association with, the projections.
Furthermore, the projections do not take into account any circumstances or events occurring after the date they
were prepared.

You are strongly cautioned not to place undue reliance on the projections set forth below. The inclusion of
the projections in this joint proxy statement/prospectus should not be regarded as an indication that any of First
Texas, Simmons or their affiliates, advisors or representatives considered or consider the projections to be
predictive of actual future events, and the assumptions should not be relied upon as such. None of First Texas,
Simmons or their respective affiliates, advisors, officers, directors or representatives can give any assurance that
actual results will not differ materially from the projections, and none of them

TABLE OF CONTENTS

undertakes any obligation to update or otherwise revise or reconcile the projections to reflect circumstances
existing after the date such projections were generated or to reflect the occurrence of future events even in the
event that any or all of the underlying assumptions are shown to be in error. None of First Texas, Simmons or
their respective affiliates, advisors or representatives makes any representation to any other person regarding the
projections. The projections are being included in this joint proxy statement/ prospectus solely to give Simmons’
shareholders and First Texas’ shareholders access to the projections that were provided to Mercer.

First Texas provided Mercer with projected 2017 earnings of  $22.0 million and projected earnings for 2018
that were reduced to $25.0 million following input from Simmons’ management. In addition, First Texas
provided Mercer with an estimated long-term growth rate for First Texas earnings beyond 2018, although Mercer
used a lower 10% estimated growth rate provided by Simmons’ management.

In light of the foregoing, and considering that the Simmons special meeting and the First Texas special
meeting will be held several months after the projections were prepared, as well as the uncertainties
inherent in any projections, Simmons shareholders and First Texas shareholders are cautioned not to place
unwarranted reliance on the projections. The projections should be evaluated, if at all, in conjunction with
the information about First Texas contained elsewhere in this joint proxy statement/prospectus and the
historical financial statements and other financial information about First Texas contained in Annex J to
this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

Interests of First Texas’ Directors and Executive Officers in the First Texas Merger
Certain members of First Texas’ executive management team and the members of First Texas’ board of

directors have financial and other interests in the First Texas merger that are in addition to, or different from, their
interests as First Texas shareholders generally. First Texas’ board of directors was aware of these interests and
considered them, among other matters, in approving and adopting the First Texas merger agreement. First Texas
shareholders should take these interests into account when deciding whether to vote for the First Texas merger
proposal. These interests are described in more detail below, and certain of them are quantified within the
narrative disclosure and in the tables below.

Employment Relationships.   Charles Cox, as Chief Financial Officer, Terry Smith, as Chief Lending Officer,
and Randy Talley, as Chief Credit Officer, have each entered into separate severance and change in control
agreements with First Texas. The payment for Mr. Cox amounts to two times his annual base salary at the time of
the change of control event. Mr. Smith will also receive a payment of two times his base salary upon a change of
control event. Mr. Talley’s arrangement provides for a payment of one times his annual salary at the time of a
change of control event, but only if his position is eliminated within 12 months after the change of control
becomes effective.

In addition, it is expected that Vernon Bryant, chief executive officer of First Texas and the chairman and
chief executive officer of First Texas Bank, will become an officer of Simmons Bank following the
consummation of the merger of First Texas Bank with and into Simmons Bank. Please see the information set
forth in “Quantifications of Potential Payments to First Texas’ Named Executive Officers in Connection with the
First Texas Merger” below for further information.

First Texas Equity Awards.   Each option, whether vested or unvested, to purchase shares of First Texas
common stock outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the First Texas merger will be cancelled and
converted into the right to receive a cash payment equal to the difference between (1) the First Texas cash
consideration plus the cash equivalent of the First Texas stock consideration and (2) the exercise price of such
option. Any such option with an exercise price per share that equals or exceeds the amount set forth in (1) will be
cancelled at the effective time of the merger with no consideration paid to the option holder. Simmons will be
entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the exchange agent to deduct and withhold, all amounts payable with
respect to First Texas stock options as it is required to deduct and withhold under the Code or any provisions of
federal, state, local or foreign tax law.

Each outstanding First Texas RSU will fully vest at the effective time of the First Texas merger and will be
cancelled and converted automatically into the right to receive the First Texas merger consideration on the same
basis as unrestricted shares of First Texas common stock. Simmons will be entitled to deduct and withhold, or
cause the exchange agent to deduct and withhold, all amounts payable with respect to First Texas RSUs as it is
required to deduct and withhold under the Code or any provisions of federal, state, local or foreign tax law.

of the grant date set forth in the applicable award agreement.

Security Ownership of First Texas Directors and Executive Officers.   As of the First Texas record date, there
were 7,884,553 shares of First Texas common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the special meeting.
Approximately 15.81% of those voting shares were owned and entitled to be voted by First Texas or First Texas
Bank directors and executive officers and their affiliates. Concurrently with execution of the First Texas merger
agreement, certain of First Texas’ directors and officers entered into First Texas support agreements with
Simmons to vote his or her shares in favor of the First Texas merger proposal and against certain competing
acquisition proposals or other actions that would frustrate the purposes of, prevent or materially delay completion
of the First Texas merger, as well as certain other restrictions with respect to the voting and transfer of such
shareholder’s shares of First Texas common stock. First Texas also expects these shareholders will vote in favor
of the First Texas adjournment proposal, if necessary or appropriate. These shareholders have also agreed to
customary non-solicitation covenants that restrict such shareholder’s ability to solicit customers or employees of
Simmons that were customers or employees of First Texas prior to the merger. As of the record date, the First
Texas directors and officers party to these support agreements owned and were entitled to vote approximately
1,198,897 shares of First Texas common stock, representing approximately 15.21% of the total shares of First
Texas common stock outstanding on that date. See “Security Ownership of First Texas Directors, Named
Executive Officers, and Certain Beneficial Owners of First Texas.”

Indemnification; Directors’ and Officers’ Insurance.   Simmons has agreed to indemnify and hold harmless
each present and former director and officer of First Texas and its subsidiaries following completion of the First
Texas merger. This indemnification covers liability and expenses arising out of matters existing or occurring at or
prior to the completion of the First Texas merger to the fullest extent permitted under state law and by First
Texas’ articles of incorporation and bylaws as in effect on the date of the First Texas merger agreement, including
provisions relating to advances of expenses incurred in the defense of any litigation. Simmons also has agreed to
use its reasonable best efforts to maintain First Texas’ policy of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance
coverage or policies of at least the same coverage and amounts and containing terms and conditions which are
substantially no less advantageous than the current policy (or, with the consent of First Texas prior to the effective
time of the First Texas merger, any other policy), with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred
prior to the effective time of the merger for the benefit of First Texas’ existing directors and officers for six years
following completion of

Dissenters’ Rights in the First Texas Merger

Introductory Information

General.   Dissenters’ rights with respect to First Texas common stock are governed by Chapter 10,
Subchapter H of the TBOC. First Texas shareholders have the right to dissent from the First Texas merger and to
have the appraised fair value of their shares of First Texas common stock as of the date immediately prior to the
effective date of the merger paid to them in cash in the event the First Texas merger agreement is consummated.
Strict compliance with the dissent procedures is mandatory. Subject to the terms of the First Texas merger
agreement, First Texas could elect to terminate the First Texas merger agreement even if it is approved by First
Texas’ shareholders, thus cancelling dissenters’ rights.

First Texas urges any First Texas shareholder who contemplates exercising his right to dissent to read
carefully the provisions of Chapter 10, Subchapter H of the TBOC, which is attached to this joint proxy
statement/prospectus as Annex I. A more detailed discussion of the provisions of the statute is included below.
This discussion describes the steps that each First Texas shareholder must take to exercise his right to dissent.
Each First Texas shareholder who wishes to dissent should read both the summary and the full text of the law.
First Texas cannot give any First Texas shareholder legal advice. To completely understand this law, each First
Texas shareholder may want, and First Texas encourages any First Texas shareholder

• own First Texas common stock as of the close of business on September 8, 2017, the record date for the
First Texas special meeting at which the approval of the First Texas merger is submitted to a vote;

• provide First Texas with a written objection to the merger prior to the First Texas special meeting that
states that you intend to exercise your right to dissent if the First Texas merger agreement is approved
and the merger is completed and that provides an address to which notice of effectiveness of the merger
should be delivered or mailed to you if the merger is completed. Neither a vote against, a failure to
vote for, or an abstention from voting will satisfy the requirement that a written objection be
delivered to First Texas before the vote is taken;

• vote against the First Texas merger proposal at the First Texas special meeting;

• within 20 days after Simmons sends notice that First Texas merger is effected, make a written demand
on Simmons, as the surviving corporation, for payment of the fair value of the shares of First Texas
common stock you own that states the number and class of shares of First Texas common stock you
own, your estimate of the fair value of such stock and an address to which a notice relating to the
dissent appraisal procedures may be sent. Any shareholder who fails to make a written demand for
payment within the 20-day period after the effective time will be conclusively

seeking to dissent, to consult with his legal counsel. Any First Texas shareholder who wishes to dissent should
not send in a signed proxy unless he marks his proxy to vote against the First Texas merger, or marks his
proxy to abstain with respect to the First Texas merger, or such shareholder will lose the right to dissent.

Address for Notices.   If you intend to exercise your right to dissent from the merger, prior to the First Texas
special meeting, you must send or deliver the notice of objection to First Texas’ Corporate Secretary, Lisanne
Davidson, at 2200 West 7th Street, Suite 104, Fort Worth, Texas 76107 (overnight delivery) or P.O. Box 962020,
Fort Worth, Texas 76162-2020 (regular mail).

Act Carefully.   First Texas urges any shareholder who wishes to dissent to act carefully. First Texas cannot
and does not accept the risk of late or undelivered written objections. A dissenting First Texas shareholder may
call First Texas at (817) 292-4820 and ask for First Texas’ corporate secretary, Lisanne Davidson, to receive
confirmation that his written objection has been received prior to the First Texas special meeting. If a dissenting
First Texas shareholder’s written objection is not timely received by First Texas prior to or at the First Texas
special meeting, then he will not be entitled to exercise his dissenters’ rights. First Texas’ shareholders bear the
risk of non-delivery and of untimely delivery.

If any First Texas shareholder intends to dissent, or thinks that dissenting might be in his best
interests, such First Texas shareholder should read Annex I carefully.

Summary of Chapter 10, Subchapter H of the TBOC — Dissenters’ Rights

The following is a summary of Chapter 10, Subchapter H of the TBOC and the procedures that a
shareholder must follow to dissent from the proposed First Texas merger agreement and to perfect his dissenters’
rights and receive cash rather than shares of Simmons common stock if the First Texas merger agreement is
approved and the First Texas merger is completed. This summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to
Chapter 10, Subchapter H of the TBOC, which is reprinted in full as part of Annex I to this joint proxy
statement/prospectus. Annex I should be reviewed carefully by any shareholder who wishes to perfect his
dissenters’ rights. Failure to strictly comply with the procedures set forth in Chapter 10, Subchapter H of the
TBOC will, by law, result in the loss of dissenters’ rights. It may be prudent for a person considering whether to
dissent to obtain professional counsel.

If the proposed merger of First Texas with and into Simmons is completed, any First Texas shareholder who
has properly perfected his statutory dissenters’ rights in accordance with Chapter 10, Subchapter H of the TBOC
has the right to obtain, in cash, payment of the fair value of such shareholder’s shares of First Texas common
stock as of the date immediately prior to the effective date of the First Texas merger.

To exercise and perfect your dissenters’ rights under Chapter 10, Subchapter H of the TBOC and be entitled
to appraisal and payment of the fair value of your shares under the TBOC, you must:

• within 20 days after you make your demand for payment to Simmons as described above, submit your
certificates representing First Texas common stock to Simmons.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

presumed to have consented to the First Texas merger agreement and will be bound by the terms
thereof. Neither a vote against the adoption of the First Texas merger agreement nor the written
objection referred to above will satisfy the written demand requirement referred to in this
paragraph; and

A First Texas shareholder of record who fails to satisfy these requirements is not entitled to payment for his
shares of First Texas common stock under Chapter 10, Subchapter H of the TBOC. In addition, any shareholder
who returns a signed proxy but fails to provide instructions as to the manner in which such shares are to be voted
will be deemed to have voted in favor of approving and adopting the First Texas merger and will not be entitled
to assert dissenters’ rights.

If, within 30 days after the effective date of the First Texas merger, the value of the dissenting shareholder’s
shares of First Texas common stock is agreed upon between the dissenting First Texas shareholder and the
surviving corporation, then payment for such shares must be made by the surviving corporation within 90 days
after the effective date of the First Texas merger, upon the surrender of the dissenting First Texas shareholder’s
stock certificates representing such shareholder’s shares, duly endorsed for transfer, to Simmons. Upon payment
of the agreed value, the dissenting First Texas shareholder ceases to have any interest in the shares or in the
surviving corporation.

If, within 90 days after the effective date of the First Texas merger, there is no such agreement as to the fair
value of the dissenting shareholder’s shares of First Texas common stock between the dissenting First Texas
shareholder and the surviving corporation, then the surviving corporation or the dissenting First Texas
shareholder may, within 60 days after the expiration of the 90-day period, commence proceedings in Tarrant
County, Texas asking the court to determine the fair value of such shares of First Texas common stock. The court
will determine if the dissenting shareholder has complied with the provisions of the TBOC regarding their right
of dissent and if such shareholder has become entitled to receive payment for their shares of First Texas common
stock. The court will appoint one or more qualified persons to act as appraisers to determine the fair value of the
dissenting shareholder’s shares in the manner prescribed by the TBOC. The appraisers will determine the fair
value of such shares and will report this value to the court. Once the appraisers’ report is filed with the court, the
dissenting shareholder will receive a notice from the court indicating that the report has been filed. If either the
dissenting shareholder or the surviving corporation objects to the report or any part of it, the court will hold a
hearing to determine the fair value of such shares of First Texas common stock. The court will determine the fair
value of the dissenting shareholder’s shares of First Texas common stock and direct Simmons to pay that amount,
plus interest, which will begin to accrue 91 days after the merger is completed. The court may require the
dissenting shareholder to share in the court costs relating to the matter to the extent the court deems it fair and
equitable that such shareholder do so. The judgment will only be payable upon and simultaneously with the
surrender to the surviving corporation of the stock certificates representing the shares of First Texas common
stock owned by the dissenting First Texas shareholder. Upon payment of the judgment, such shareholder will
cease to have any interest in the shares or in the surviving corporation. Further, unless the dissenting shareholder
files the petition with the court within the 90-day time limit described above, such shareholder and all persons
claiming under such shareholder shall be conclusively presumed to have approved or ratified the First Texas
merger and shall be bound by the terms thereof. The right of a dissenting shareholder to be paid the fair value of
such shareholder’s shares as provided above ceases if and when First Texas abandons the First Texas merger.

The foregoing does not purport to be a complete statement of the procedures for exercising dissenter’s rights
under the TBOC and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of Chapter 10, Subchapter H of the
TBOC, a copy of which is attached as Annex I to this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

If any First Texas shareholder intends to dissent, or if such shareholder believes that dissenting might be in
his best interests, such shareholder should read Annex I carefully.

Dissenters’ Rights in the OKSB Merger and First Texas Merger.”

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE MERGERS

Board of Directors and Management of Simmons after the Mergers

At the effective time of the mergers, the number of directors on the board of directors of the combined
company will be 13, of which one will be George A. Makris Jr., the current Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer of Simmons and the remaining 13 will be the existing members of Simmons’ board of directors who will
be independent from Simmons under the listing rules of the Nasdaq Global Select Market. If the Simmons
director proposal is approved, the number of directors constituting the Simmons board of directors will be
increased by two and following the effective time of the OKSB merger, Russell W. Teubner will be appointed to
the Simmons board of directors and following the effective time of the First Texas merger, Tom Purvis will be
appointed to the Simmons board of directors.

The mergers will not affect the composition of Simmons’ management team. After the effective time of the
mergers, Mr. Makris will continue to serve as Chief Executive Officer, Robert A. Fehlman will continue to serve
as Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and Marty D. Casteel will continue to serve as
Senior Executive Vice President.

Public Trading Markets

Simmons common stock is listed for trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “SFNC.”
OKSB common stock is listed for trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “OKSB.” Upon
completion of the OKSB merger, OKSB common stock currently listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market will
ceased to be listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market and will be subsequently deregistered under the Exchange
Act. First Texas common stock is not listed for trading on any securities exchange and there is no established
public trading market for First Texas common stock. In addition, because there have been no recent private sales
of First Texas common stock of which Simmons or First Texas are aware, no recent price data regarding First
Texas common stock is available.

Under the merger agreements, Simmons will cause the shares of Simmons common stock to be issued in the
mergers to be approved for listing on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, subject to notice of issuance, and each of
the merger agreements provides that OKSB and First Texas will not be required to complete the respective
mergers if such shares have not been authorized for listing on the Nasdaq Global Select Market.

Simmons’ Dividend Policy

No assurances can be given that any dividends will be paid by Simmons or that dividends, if paid, will not
be reduced in future periods. Dividends from Simmons will depend, in large part, upon receipt of dividends from
Simmons Bank, and any other banks which Simmons acquires, because Simmons will have limited sources of
income other than dividends from Simmons Bank and earnings from the investment of proceeds from the sale of
shares of common stock retained by Simmons. In addition, the terms of Simmons’ outstanding junior
subordinated debentures prohibit Simmons from declaring or paying dividends on its common stock if it is aware
of any event that would be an event of default under the indenture governing those junior subordinated
debentures or at any time that Simmons has deferred payment of interest on those debentures.

Simmons’ board of directors may change its dividend policy at any time, and the payment of dividends by
banks and financial holding companies is generally subject to legal and regulatory limitations. For further
information on Simmons’ dividend history, see “Comparative Market Prices and Dividends.”

Simmons Shareholders Dissenters’ Rights in the OKSB Merger and First Texas Merger

Introductory Information

General.   Dissenters’ rights with respect to Simmons common and preferred stock are governed by the
ABCA. Shareholders of Simmons have the right to dissent from the OKSB merger and the First Texas merger to
obtain payment of the “fair value” of their shares (as specified in the statute) in the event the OKSB merger or
First Texas merger is consummated. Strict compliance with the dissent procedures is

• deliver to Simmons, before the vote is taken at the Simmons special meeting, written notice of his
intent to demand payment for his shares of Simmons common stock if the OKSB merger or First Texas
merger, respectively, is completed; and

TABLE OF CONTENTS

mandatory. Subject to the terms of the OKSB merger agreement, OKSB could elect to terminate the OKSB
merger agreement even if it is approved by OKSB’s shareholders, thus cancelling dissenters’ rights. Similarly,
under the terms of the First Texas merger agreement, First Texas could elect to terminate the First Texas merger
agreement even if it is approved by First Texas’ shareholders, thus cancelling dissenters’ rights.

The term “fair value” means the value of a share of Simmons common stock immediately before the
effective date of the OKSB merger or the First Texas merger, respectively, taking into account all relevant factors,
but excluding any appreciation or depreciation in anticipation of the OKSB merger or the First Texas merger,
respectively, unless exclusion would be inequitable.

Simmons urges any Simmons shareholder who contemplates exercising his right to dissent to read carefully
the provisions of Subchapter 13 of the ABCA, and the summary of those provisions, which are attached to this
joint proxy statement/prospectus as Annex G. A more detailed discussion of the provisions of the statute is
included there. The discussion describes the steps that each Simmons shareholder must take to exercise his right
to dissent. Each Simmons shareholder who desires to dissent should read both the summary and the full text of
the law. Simmons cannot give any Simmons shareholder legal advice. To completely understand this law, each
Simmons shareholder may want, and Simmons encourages any Simmons shareholder seeking to dissent, to
consult with his legal advisor. Any Simmons shareholder who wishes to dissent, should not send in a signed
proxy unless he marks his proxy to vote against the OKSB merger or the First Texas merger, respectively,
or such shareholder will lose the right to dissent.

Address for Notices.   Send or deliver any written notice or demand required concerning any Simmons
shareholders’ exercise of his dissenters’ rights to Simmons First National Corporation, 501 Main Street, Pine
Bluff, Arkansas 71601, Attention: Patrick A. Burrow.

Act Carefully.   Simmons urges any shareholder who wishes to dissent to act carefully. Simmons cannot and
does not accept the risk of late or undelivered notices or demands. A shareholder who wishes to dissent may call
Simmons at (870) 541-1000 and ask for Patrick A. Burrow, Corporate Secretary, to receive confirmation that his
notice or demand has been received. If a dissenting Simmons shareholder’s notices or demands are not timely
received by Simmons, then he will not be entitled to exercise his dissenters’ rights. Simmons shareholders bear
the risk of non-delivery and of untimely delivery.

If any Simmons shareholder intends to dissent, or such shareholder believes that dissenting might be
in his best interests, such Simmons shareholder should read Annex G carefully.

Summary of Subchapter 13 of the ABCA — Dissenters’ Rights

The following is a summary of Subchapter 13 of the ABCA and the procedures that a shareholder must
follow to dissent from the proposed OKSB merger or First Texas merger, respectively, and to perfect his
dissenters’ rights and receive cash if the OKSB merger agreement or First Texas merger agreement is approved
and the OKSB merger or First Texas merger is completed. This summary is qualified in its entirety by reference
to Subchapter 13, which is reprinted in full as part of this Annex G to this joint proxy statement/prospectus.
Annex G should be reviewed carefully by any shareholder who wishes to perfect his dissenters’ rights. Failure to
strictly comply with the procedures set forth in Sections Subchapter 13 will, by law, result in the loss of
dissenters’ rights. It may be prudent for a person considering whether to dissent to obtain professional counsel.

If the proposed merger of OKSB or First Texas, respectively, with and into Simmons is completed, any
shareholder who has properly perfected his statutory dissenters’ rights in accordance with Subchapter 13 has the
right to obtain, in cash, payment of the fair value of such shareholder’s shares of Simmons common stock. By
statute, the “fair value” is determined immediately prior to the completion of the merger or mergers and excludes
any appreciation or depreciation in anticipation of the OKSB merger or the First Texas merger, respectively,
unless exclusion would be inequitable.

To exercise dissenters’ rights under Subchapter 13, a Simmons shareholder must:

139

• not vote his shares in favor of approving and adopting the merger.

• state where the demand for payment must be sent and where and when certificates for certificated
shares must be deposited;

• inform holders of uncertificated shares to what extent transfer of those shares will be restricted after the
demand for payment is received;

• supply a form for demanding payment that includes the date of the announcement of the proposed
merger to the public (December 14, 2016 for the OKSB merger and January 23, 2017 for the First
Texas merger) and requires that the shareholder asserting dissenters’ rights certify whether or not he
acquired beneficial ownership of such shares prior to said date;

• set a date by which Simmons must receive the demand for payment, which date may not be fewer than
30 nor more than 60 days after the Simmons dissenters’ notice is delivered; and

• be accompanied by a copy of Subchapter 13 of the ABCA.

• certain recent Simmons financial statements;

TABLE OF CONTENTS

A shareholder of record who fails to satisfy both of these two requirements is not entitled to payment for his
shares of Simmons common stock under Subchapter 13. In addition, any shareholder who returns a signed
proxy but fails to provide instructions as to the manner in which such shares are to be voted will be
deemed to have voted in favor of approving the OKSB merger and First Texas merger and may not be
entitled to assert dissenters’ rights.

A shareholder may assert dissenters’ rights as to fewer than all the shares registered in his name only if he
dissents with respect to all shares beneficially owned by any one beneficial shareholder and notifies Simmons in
writing of the name and address of each person on whose behalf he is asserting dissenters’ rights. The rights of
such a partial dissenter are determined as if the shares as to which he dissents and his other shares are registered
in the names of different Simmons shareholders.

If the OKSB merger or the First Texas merger, respectively, is approved and adopted at the Simmons special
meeting, Simmons must deliver a written dissenters’ notice, or the Simmons dissenters’ notice, to all Simmons
shareholders who satisfied the two requirements of Subchapter 13 described above. The Simmons dissenters’
notice must be sent no later than 10 days after the effective time (the date that the merger is completed) and must:

A Simmons shareholder of record on the record date who receives the Simmons dissenters’ notice must
demand payment, certify that he acquired beneficial ownership of such shares prior to the date set forth in the
Simmons dissenters’ notice and deposit his certificates in accordance with the terms of the Simmons dissenters’
notice. Simmons may elect to withhold payment required by Subchapter 13 of the ABCA from the dissenting
shareholder unless such shareholder was the beneficial owner of the shares prior to the public announcement of
the proposed mergers (December 14, 2016 for the OKSB merger and January 23, 2017 for the First Texas
merger). A dissenting shareholder will retain all other rights of a Simmons shareholder until those rights are
cancelled or modified by the completion of the OKSB merger or the First Texas merger, respectively. A
shareholder of record who does not demand payment or deposit his share certificates where required, each by the
date set in the Simmons dissenters’ notice, is not entitled to payment for his shares under Subchapter 13 of the
ABCA or otherwise as a result of the OKSB merger or the First Texas merger, respectively.

Simmons may restrict the transfer of any uncertificated shares from the date the demand for their payment is
received until the OKSB merger or the First Texas merger, respectively, is completed. A Simmons shareholder for
whom dissenters’ rights are asserted as to uncertificated shares of Simmons common stock retains all other rights
of an OKSB shareholder until these rights are cancelled or modified by the completion of the OKSB merger or
the First Texas merger, respectively.

At the effective time or upon receipt of a demand for payment, Simmons must offer to pay each dissenting
shareholder who strictly and fully complied with Subchapter 13 of the ABCA the amount that Simmons estimates
to be the fair value of his shares, plus accrued interest from the effective time. The offer of payment must be
accompanied by:

• Simmons’ estimate of the fair value of the shares;

• an explanation of how the interest was calculated;

• a statement of the dissenter’s right to demand payment under ABCA Section 4-27-1328; and

• a copy of this Subchapter 13 of the ABCA.

• such shareholder believes that the amount offered or paid by Simmons is less than the fair value of his
shares or that the interest due has been calculated incorrectly;

• Simmons fails to make payment within 60 days after the date set forth for demanding payment; or

• Simmons, having failed to complete the OKSB merger or First Texas merger, respectively, does not
return the deposited certificates or release the transfer restrictions imposed on uncertificated shares
within 60 days after the date set for demanding payment.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

If the OKSB merger or the First Texas merger, respectively, is not completed within 60 days after the date
set for demanding payment and depositing share certificates, Simmons must return the deposited certificates and
release the transfer restrictions imposed on the uncertificated shares. If, after such return or release, the OKSB
merger or the First Texas merger, respectively, is completed, Simmons must send a new Simmons dissenters’
notice and repeat the payment procedure described above.

If a dissenting Simmons shareholder is dissatisfied with or rejects Simmons’ calculation of fair value, such
dissenting shareholder must notify Simmons in writing of his own estimate of the fair value of those shares and
the interest due, and may demand payment of his estimate, if:

A dissenting shareholder waives his right to dispute Simmons’ calculation of fair value unless he notifies
Simmons of his demand in writing within 30 days after Simmons’ makes or offers payment for such person’s
shares.

If a demand for payment by a Simmons shareholder remains unsettled, Simmons must commence a
proceeding in the appropriate court, as specified in Subchapter 13 of the ABCA, within 60 days after receiving
the demand for payment, and petition the court to determine the fair value of the shares and accrued interest. If
Simmons does not commence the proceeding within the 60-day period, Simmons is required to pay each
dissenting shareholder whose demand remains unsettled, the amount demanded. Simmons is required to make all
dissenting Simmons shareholders whose demands remain unsettled parties to the proceeding and to serve a copy
of the petition upon each dissenting shareholder. The court may appoint one or more appraisers to receive
evidence and to recommend a decision on fair value. Each dissenting shareholder made a party to the proceeding
is entitled to judgment for the fair value of such person’s shares plus interest to the date of judgment that exceeds
the amount paid by the corporation.

In an appraisal proceeding commenced under Subchapter 13 of the ABCA, the court must determine the
costs of the proceeding, including the reasonable compensation and expenses of appraisers appointed by the
court. The court will assess these costs against Simmons, except that the court may assess the costs against all or
some of the dissenting shareholders to the extent the court finds they acted arbitrarily, vexatiously, or not in good
faith in demanding payment under Subchapter 13 of the ABCA. The court also may assess the fees and expenses
of attorneys and experts for the respective parties against Simmons if the court finds that Simmons did not
substantially comply with the requirements of Subchapter 13 of the ABCA, or against either Simmons or a
dissenting shareholder if the court finds that such party acted arbitrarily, vexatiously, or not in good faith with
respect to the rights provided by Subchapter 13 of the ABCA.

If the court finds that the services of the attorneys for any dissenting shareholder were of substantial benefit
to other dissenting shareholders similarly situated, and that the fees for those services should not be assessed
against Simmons, the court may award those attorneys reasonable fees out of the amounts awarded the dissenting
shareholders who were benefitted.

The foregoing does not purport to be a complete statement of the provisions of the ABCA relating to
statutory dissenters’ rights and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the dissenters rights provisions, which
are reproduced in full in Annex G to this joint proxy statement/prospectus and which are incorporated herein by
reference.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

If any Simmons shareholder intends to dissent, or if such shareholder believes that dissenting might
be in his best interests, such shareholder should read Annex G carefully.

Regulatory Approvals Required for the Mergers

Completion of the mergers is subject to prior receipt of certain approvals and consents required to be
obtained from applicable governmental and regulatory authorities, without materially burdensome conditions or
requirements being imposed by any governmental authority as part of a regulatory approval. Subject to the terms
and conditions of the merger agreements, Simmons and OKSB, and Simmons and First Texas have agreed to use
their reasonable best efforts and cooperate to promptly prepare and file all necessary documentation and to obtain
as promptly as practicable all regulatory approvals necessary or advisable to complete the transactions
contemplated by each of the merger agreements. These approvals include, among others, approval from the
Federal Reserve Board with respect to both mergers and from the TDB, with respect to the First Texas merger.
No assurance can be given that the necessary regulatory approvals will be received in time to effect the mergers
in the fourth quarter of 2017.

Federal Reserve Board

The transactions contemplated by the merger agreements are subject to approval by the Federal Reserve
Board, pursuant to the BHC Act. Specifically, Simmons has previously submitted an application under the BHC
Act seeking the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board for each of OKSB and First Texas to merge with and
into Simmons. As of the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, Simmons, OKSB and First Texas have
received the approval from the Federal Reserve to consummate each of the mergers. Below is a summary
description of the factors and considerations that the Federal Reserve typically considers when evaluating
applications such as the ones submitted by Simmons.

The Federal Reserve Board takes into consideration a number of factors when acting on such applications.
These factors include the financial condition and future prospects of the applicant bank holding company,
merging bank holding companies, and subsidiary banks (including current and projected capital levels); their
managerial resources (including consideration of the competence, experience, and integrity of the officers,
directors, and principal shareholders); and the convenience and needs of the communities to be served, including
the subsidiary banks’ records of performance under the Community Reinvestment Act, which we refer to as the
CRA. As of their most recent CRA examinations, Simmons Bank, OKSB Bank, and First Texas Bank had CRA
ratings of  “satisfactory.”

The Federal Reserve Board also is required to consider the effectiveness of the applicant in combatting
money laundering, including a review of the anti-money laundering program of the applicant and the anti-money
laundering compliance record of banks to be acquired as part of the transaction. Finally, the Federal Reserve
Board takes into consideration the extent to which the transaction would result in greater or more concentrated
risks to the stability of the U.S. banking or financial system.

In evaluating an application pursuant to the BHC Act, the Federal Reserve Board may not approve an
application if the transaction would result in a monopoly or further any conspiracy or attempt to monopolize the
business of banking in any part of the United States. The Federal Reserve Board also may not approve an
application if the effect of the transaction may be substantially to lessen competition in any section of the country
or in any other manner be in restraint of trade, unless the Federal Reserve Board concludes that the transaction’s
anti-competitive effects are clearly outweighed by its probable effect in meeting the convenience and needs of the
community. The Federal Reserve Board may not approve an application if the applicant has failed to provide the
Federal Reserve Board with adequate assurances that the applicant will make available information on its
operations and activities and its affiliates’ operations and activities necessary to determine compliance with the
BHC Act and other applicable federal banking statutes.

Furthermore, Simmons is required to publish notice of its applications under the BHC Act and to provide the
opportunity for public comment on these applications. The Federal Reserve Board takes into account the views of
third party commenters, particularly on the subject of the convenience and needs of the communities to be served.
The Federal Reserve Board may upon request or upon its own initiative hold a public hearing or meeting to
clarify facts or issues raised by the application in order to aid in the Federal Reserve Board’s decision-making
process. Any hearing, meeting or comments provided by third parties could prolong the period during which the
applications are under review by the Federal Reserve Board.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Transactions approved under the BHC Act generally may not be completed until 30 days after the approval
of the appropriate federal banking agency is received (here, the Federal Reserve Board), during which time the
Department of Justice, which we refer to as the DOJ, may initiate legal action to prevent consummation of the
transaction if the DOJ determines the transaction may have a significantly adverse effect on competition. With
the approval of the applicable federal agency and the concurrence of the DOJ, the 30-day waiting period may be
reduced to no less than 15 days. The commencement of an antitrust action would stay the effectiveness of such an
approval unless a court specifically ordered otherwise. In reviewing the merger, the DOJ could analyze the
merger’s effect on competition differently than the Federal Reserve Board, and thus it is possible that the DOJ
could reach a different conclusion than the Federal Reserve Board regarding the transaction’s effects on
competition. A determination by the DOJ not to object to the transaction may not prevent the filing of antitrust
actions by private persons or state attorneys general.
State of Oklahoma

Although no application is required to be filed with the OSBD in order to complete the OKSB merger, the
OSBD does request that a copy of the application submitted to the Federal Reserve Board also be provided to the
OSBD at the time of the submission to the Federal Reserve Board. In addition, because the OKSB merger will
constitute a change of control of OKSB Bank, the Oklahoma Banking Code requires that a written notice of the
proposed change of control be provided to the Oklahoma State Banking Commissioner.
State of Texas

To complete the First Texas merger, Simmons is required to submit an application to, and receive approval
from, the TDB. The TDB will review the application to determine whether the merger complies with Texas law.
As of the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, Simmons has submitted the required application to the
TDB.
Additional Regulatory Approvals and Notices

Notifications and/or applications requesting approval may be submitted to various other federal and state
regulatory authorities and self-regulatory organizations.

Simmons, OKSB and First Texas believe that the mergers do not raise significant regulatory concerns and
that we will be able to obtain all requisite regulatory approvals. None of Simmons, OKSB or First Texas can
assure you that all of the regulatory approvals described above will be obtained and, if obtained, we cannot assure
you as to the timing of any such approvals, our ability to obtain the approvals on satisfactory terms or the absence
of any litigation challenging such approvals. In addition, there can be no assurance that such approvals will not
impose conditions or requirements that, individually or in the aggregate, would or could reasonably be expected
to have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, results of operations, assets or business of the
combined company.

Simmons, OKSB and First Texas are not aware of any material governmental approvals or actions that are
required for completion of the mergers other than those described above. It is presently contemplated that if any
such additional governmental approvals or actions are required, those approvals or actions will be sought. There
can be no assurance, however, that any additional approvals or actions will be obtained.
Litigation Relating to the OKSB Merger

A putative shareholder class action complaint relating to the OKSB merger has been filed. This action,
Bergman v. Southwest Bancorp Inc. et al., Case No. CIV-17-852-HE, was filed in the United States District Court
for the Western District of Oklahoma on August 9, 2017. The complaint names as defendants OKSB, its directors
and certain of its officers. The complaint alleges that the members of the OKSB board of directors violated
Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-9 by filing a preliminary proxy statement that
allegedly contains materially incomplete and misleading information. The plaintiffs seek to enjoin the defendants
from holding the OKSB special meeting and taking any steps to consummate the OKSB merger, or, in the event
the merger is consummated, damages, attorneys’ fees and costs, and other and further relief. OKSB believes the
claims asserted in this action are without merit and intends to vigorously defend against this lawsuit. However, at
this time, it is not possible to predict the outcome of the proceedings or their impact on OKSB, Simmons or the
OKSB merger.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE MERGER AGREEMENTS

The following describes certain material provisions of the merger agreements, but does not describe all of
the terms of the merger agreements and may not contain all of the information about the merger agreements that
is important to you. The following description of the merger agreements is subject to, and qualified in its entirety
by reference to, the OKSB merger agreement, which is attached to this joint proxy statement/ prospectus as Annex
A, and the First Texas merger agreement, which is attached to this joint proxy statement/ prospectus as Annex B,
each of which is incorporated by reference into this joint proxy statement/prospectus. We urge you to read each of
the merger agreements carefully and in their entirety, as it is the legal document governing the respective
mergers.

Structure of the Mergers

The boards of directors of Simmons and OKSB, and the boards of directors of Simmons and First Texas,
have adopted the OKSB merger agreement and the First Texas merger agreement, respectively, which provide for
the merger of OKSB and First Texas, as applicable, with and into Simmons, with Simmons continuing as the
surviving corporation following each merger. Following the completion of each merger, both OKSB’s wholly
owned bank subsidiary, OKSB Bank, and First Texas’ wholly owned bank subsidiary, First Texas Bank, will
operate as separate bank subsidiaries of Simmons until they are merged with and into Simmons Bank, which will
be the surviving bank following each bank merger. Simmons expects the merger of OKSB Bank and Simmons
Bank to occur in the second quarter of 2018 and the merger of First Texas Bank and Simmons Bank to occur in
the first quarter of 2018.

The Merger Consideration

As a result of the OKSB merger, each share of OKSB common stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the OKSB merger, except for shares of OKSB common stock held directly or indirectly by OKSB or
Simmons and any dissenting shares, will be converted into the right to receive, subject to possible adjustment, (1)
0.3903 shares of Simmons common stock and (2) $5.11 in cash. In the aggregate, the consideration paid to OKSB
shareholders will consist of approximately 7,250,000 shares of Simmons common stock and approximately $95
million in cash.

As a result of the First Texas merger, each share of First Texas common stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the First Texas merger will be converted into the right to receive, subject to possible
adjustment and based on certain assumptions described below, (1) 0.8264 shares of Simmons common stock and
(2) $6.93 in cash. The amount of First Texas merger consideration described above is based on the following
assumptions derived from amounts that were applicable as of September 8, 2017: (1) immediately prior to the
effective time of the First Texas merger, there are (a) 7,884,553 shares of First Texas common stock outstanding,
(b) 644,191 shares of First Texas common stock subject to First Texas options outstanding with a weighted
average exercise price of  $27.76 per option, and (c) 13,000 shares of First Texas common stock subject to First
Texas SARs outstanding with a weighted average initial value of $19.76 per First Texas SAR, (d) 5,710 shares of
First Texas common stock subject to First Texas restricted stock units and (e) 25,648 First Texas Unallocated
ESOP Shares outstanding, and (2) the average closing price per share of Simmons common stock at the closing
of the First Texas merger is $51.20, which was the closing sales price of Simmons common stock on
September 8, 2017, the last practicable trading day before the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus. Since
we will not know the amounts reflected in these assumptions until immediately prior to the effective time of the
First Texas merger, the amount of First Texas stock consideration and First Texas cash consideration actually
received by First Texas shareholders may be different than the amounts described herein. In the aggregate, the
consideration paid to First Texas shareholders will consist of 6,500,000 shares of Simmons common stock and
$70 million in cash.

Potential Adjustment to Exchange Ratios

If the number of shares of OKSB common stock outstanding (including shares of OKSB restricted stock)
increases or decreases prior to the effective time of the OKSB merger, then the OKSB merger consideration will
be equitably and proportionately adjusted, if necessary and without duplication, to fully effect such change. In
addition, if the OKSB board of directors exercises its right to terminate the OKSB

TABLE OF CONTENTS

merger agreement due to the decrease in the average closing price of Simmons common stock below $39.66 and
relative to an index of banking stocks, Simmons may prevent the OKSB merger agreement from being terminated
by electing to pay additional cash consideration for each share of OKSB common stock. See “— Termination of
the Merger Agreements.”

If the number of shares of First Texas common stock outstanding (including shares of First Texas subject to
equity award agreements) increases or decreases prior to the effective time of the First Texas merger other than as
permitted under the terms of the First Texas merger agreement, then the First Texas merger consideration will be
equitably and proportionately adjusted, if necessary and without duplication, to fully effect such change, but in no
event will Simmons issue more than 6,500,000 shares of Simmons common stock or pay aggregate cash
consideration in excess of  $70 million in the First Texas merger. In addition, if the First Texas board of directors
exercises its right to terminate the First Texas merger agreement due to the decrease in the average closing price
of Simmons common stock below $39.98 and relative to an index of banking stocks, Simmons may prevent the
First Texas merger agreement from being terminated by electing to pay additional cash consideration for each
share of OKSB common stock. See “— Termination of the Merger Agreements.”

Fractional Shares

Simmons will not issue any fractional shares of Simmons common stock in the mergers. Instead, OKSB or
First Texas shareholders who otherwise would have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Simmons
common stock will receive cash in lieu thereof. The applicable cash amount will be determined by multiplying
the fraction of a share of Simmons common stock to which the holder would otherwise be entitled by the average
of the daily closing prices of Simmons common stock on the 20 trading days ending on the 10th day prior to the
closing of the applicable merger.

Governing Documents; Directors and Officers
At the effective time of the mergers, Simmons’ articles of incorporation and bylaws in effect immediately

prior to the effective time of the mergers will be the articles of incorporation and bylaws of Simmons as the
surviving corporation of the mergers, until thereafter amended or repealed in accordance with their respective
terms and applicable law. The directors and officers of Simmons immediately prior to the effective time of the
mergers will continue as the directors and officers of the surviving corporation of the merger.

Treatment of Equity Awards

OKSB Restricted Stock
At the effective time of the OKSB merger, outstanding unvested shares of OKSB restricted stock will

become fully vested and will be cancelled and converted automatically into the right to receive the OKSB merger
consideration on the same basis as all other shares of OKSB common stock. Simmons will be entitled to deduct
and withhold, or cause the exchange agent to deduct and withhold, all amounts payable with respect to OKSB
restricted stock as it is required to deduct and withhold under the Code or any provisions of federal, state, local or
foreign tax law. For additional information, see “The OKSB Merger — Interests of OKSB’s Directors and
Executive Officers in the OKSB Merger.”

First Texas Equity Awards
Stock Options.   At the effective time of the First Texas merger, each option, whether vested or unvested, to

purchase shares of First Texas common stock outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the First
Texas merger will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive a cash payment equal to the difference
between (1) the First Texas cash consideration plus the cash equivalent of the First Texas stock consideration and
(2) the exercise price of such option. Any such option with an exercise price per share that equals or exceeds the
amount set forth in (1) will be cancelled at the effective time of the merger with no consideration paid to the
option holder. Simmons will be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the exchange agent to deduct and
withhold, all amounts payable with respect to First Texas stock options as it is required to deduct and withhold
under the Code or any provisions of federal, state, local or foreign tax law.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Restricted Stock Units.   At the effective time of the First Texas merger, each First Texas RSU will become
fully vested and will be cancelled and converted automatically into the right to receive the First Texas merger
consideration on the same basis as all other shares of First Texas common stock and treating the First Texas RSUs
as if they are shares of First Texas common stock for such purposes. Simmons will be entitled to deduct and
withhold, or cause the exchange agent to deduct and withhold, all amounts payable with respect to First Texas
RSUs as it is required to deduct and withhold under the Code or any provisions of federal, state, local or foreign
tax law.

Stock Appreciation Rights.   At the effective time of the First Texas merger, each outstanding First Texas
SAR will become fully vested and will be cancelled and converted automatically into the right to receive from
Simmons a cash payment equal to the difference between (1) the First Texas cash consideration plus the cash
equivalent of the First Texas stock consideration and (2) the initial value of the First Texas SAR as of the grant
date set forth in the applicable award agreement.

For additional information, see “The First Texas Merger — Interests of First Texas’ Directors and Executive
Officers in the First Texas Merger.”

Treatment of Employee Stock Purchase Plans and Employee Stock Ownership Plans

OKSB Employee Stock Purchase Plan

At the effective time of the OKSB merger, each share of OKSB common stock held in the OKSB Employee
Stock Purchase Plan will be converted into the right to receive the OKSB merger consideration in the same
manner as other shares of OKSB common stock.

First Texas Employee Stock Ownership Plan

At the effective time of the First Texas merger, First Texas Unallocated ESOP shares will be cancelled and
Simmons will pay to the trustee of the First Texas ESOP an aggregate cash payment equal to the sum of  (1) the
cash equivalent of the First Texas stock consideration and product of the First Texas Unallocated ESOP shares
and the First Texas cash consideration. The shares of First Texas common stock that are allocated in the First
Texas ESOP will be converted automatically into the right to receive the First Texas merger consideration and the
First Texas merger consideration will be distributed by the trustee to participants in accordance with their
allocations.

Closing and Effective Time of the Mergers

The mergers will be completed only if all of the respective conditions set forth in the OKSB merger
agreement and the First Texas merger agreement and discussed in this joint proxy statement/prospectus are either
satisfied or waived. See “— Conditions to Consummation of the Mergers.”

The OKSB merger will become effective as set forth in the articles of merger to be filed with the Secretary
of State for the State of Arkansas and certificate of merger to be filed with the Oklahoma Secretary of State. The
First Texas merger will become effective as set forth in the articles of merger to be filed with the Secretary of
State for the State of Arkansas and certificate of merger to be filed with the Texas Secretary of State. We have
agreed to cause the effective time of each merger to occur on a date within 30 days following the satisfaction or
waiver (subject to applicable laws) of the last of the conditions specified in the applicable merger agreement as
determined by Simmons, or on another date that is mutually agreed upon by the respective parties.

It currently is anticipated that the effective time of the mergers will occur no earlier than the fourth quarter
of 2017, subject to the receipt of regulatory approvals and waivers and other customary closing conditions, but
we cannot guarantee when or if either of the respective mergers will be completed.

Conversion of Shares; Exchange of Certificates

The conversion of OKSB common stock into the right to receive the OKSB merger consideration, and the
conversion of the First Texas common stock into the right to receive the First Texas merger consideration, will
each occur automatically at the effective time of the respective mergers. At or promptly

TABLE OF CONTENTS

after the effective time of each merger, Simmons will deposit with its transfer agent, or in the case of the First
Texas merger, its transfer agent or another exchange agent acceptable to it, (1) certificates or evidence of
Simmons common stock in book-entry form equal to the stock consideration for the applicable merger and (2)
funds equal to the aggregate cash consideration and cash payable in lieu of fractional shares.

Appropriate transmittal materials will be mailed or delivered by the exchange agent to record holders of
OKSB common stock and the holders of First Texas common stock, as applicable, as soon as reasonably practical
after the effective time of the respective mergers. Upon surrender of a certificate or book entry shares for
cancellation to the transfer agent together with executed transmittal materials and such other customary
documents as required, the holder will be entitled to receive (1) book-entry shares of Simmons common stock
constituting the OKSB stock consideration or the First Texas stock consideration, as applicable, (2) cash
constituting the OKSB cash consideration or the First Texas cash consideration, as applicable, (3) cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Simmons common stock to which the holder of OKSB common stock or First Texas common
stock is entitled and (4) any dividends or other distributions to which the holder of OKSB common stock or First
Texas common stock is entitled.

If a certificate for OKSB common stock or First Texas common stock has been lost, stolen or destroyed, the
transfer agent will issue the applicable merger consideration upon receipt of an affidavit from the holder of such
shares and, if required by Simmons, a bond in such reasonable and customary amount as determined by
Simmons, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such certificate.

After the effective time of each merger, there will be no further transfers on the stock transfer books of
OKSB or First Texas.

Withholding

Simmons and the transfer agent will be entitled to deduct and withhold from the merger consideration and
any other amounts otherwise payable pursuant to each merger agreement to any holder of OKSB common stock
or First Texas common stock, as applicable, which such amounts Simmons is required to deduct and withhold
under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that any amounts are so withheld,
these amounts will be treated for all purposes of each merger agreement as having been paid to the shareholders
from whom they were withheld.

Dividends and Distributions

No dividends or other distributions declared or made after the effective time of each merger with respect to
Simmons common stock with a record date after the effective time of such merger will be paid to the holder of
any unsurrendered certificate or book-entry shares of OKSB common stock or First Texas common stock, as
applicable, until the holder surrenders such shares. After the surrender of a certificate in accordance with the
applicable merger agreement, the record holder thereof will be entitled to receive, without interest, (1) all
dividends and other distributions payable with respect to Simmons common stock with a record date after the
effective time and a payment date on or prior to the surrender of shares of OKSB common stock or First Texas
common stock, as applicable, and not previously paid and (2) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of
dividends or other distributions which had been declared with a record date after the effective time of the
applicable merger but prior to the surrender of shares of OKSB common stock or First Texas common stock, as
applicable, and with a payment date occurring after such surrender that is payable with respect to shares of
Simmons common stock.

Representations and Warranties

The representations, warranties and covenants described below and included in the merger agreements were
made only for purposes of each merger agreement and as of specific dates, are solely for the benefit of Simmons
and OKSB, in the case of the OKSB merger agreement, and Simmons and First Texas, in the case of the First
