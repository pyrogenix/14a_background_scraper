TRANSACTION PROPOSED—YOUR VOTE IS VERY IMPORTANT

Dear Stockholders:

           Each of the boards of directors of Rockwell Collins, Inc. and B/E Aerospace, Inc. has unanimously approved a merger, combining Rockwell Collins' capabilities in flight
deck avionics, cabin electronics, mission communications and simulation and training and information management systems with B/E Aerospace's range of cabin interior products,
which include seating, food and beverage preparation and storage equipment, lighting and oxygen systems and modular galley and lavatory systems for commercial airliners and
business jets. The merger presents an opportunity to accelerate growth and build value for Rockwell Collins' stockholders through market-leading positions in cockpit and cabin
solutions, and presents to B/E Aerospace's stockholders an immediate premium and a substantial equity interest in a strong combined company with a broader range of products,
customers and the combined expertise and resources to create future value.

           Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace entered into an agreement and plan of merger on October 23, 2016. Subject to stockholder approvals and the satisfaction or (to the
extent permitted by law) waiver of certain other closing conditions, Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace will combine their businesses through the merger of B/E Aerospace with a
newly formed, wholly owned subsidiary of Rockwell Collins, with B/E Aerospace thereupon becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Rockwell Collins as the surviving
corporation, which transaction is referred to as the merger in this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

           If the merger is completed, B/E Aerospace stockholders (other than (i) Rockwell Collins, B/E Aerospace and Quarterback Merger Sub Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of
Rockwell Collins, and (ii) any stockholders holding shares of B/E Aerospace common stock with respect to which appraisal rights are properly demanded and not withdrawn under
the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware) will receive $34.10 in cash, without interest, and a fraction of a validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of
Rockwell Collins common stock with a value of $27.90, subject to adjustment pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement as further described below, for each share of
B/E Aerospace common stock, which cash and stock are collectively referred to as the merger consideration. The fraction of a share of Rockwell Collins common stock into which
each share of B/E Aerospace common stock will be converted, which is referred to as the exchange ratio, will be determined based on the volume-weighted average price per share
of Rockwell Collins common stock over a specified period of time before the closing of the merger, which is referred to as the Rockwell Collins stock price. This exchange ratio
will be adjusted to reflect changes in the price of the Rockwell Collins common stock prior to the closing of the merger. If the Rockwell Collins stock price is less than $77.41 or
greater than $89.97, a two-way collar mechanism will apply, pursuant to which (i) if the Rockwell Collins stock price is greater than $89.97, the exchange ratio will be fixed at
0.3101 and the value of the stock consideration will be more than $27.90, and (ii) if the Rockwell Collins stock price is less than $77.41, the exchange ratio will be fixed at 0.3604
and the value of the stock consideration will be less than $27.90. Upon the completion of the merger, based on minimum and maximum exchange ratios of 0.3101 and 0.3604, the
estimated number of shares of Rockwell Collins common stock issuable as a portion of the merger consideration is between 31.1 million shares and 36.1 million shares, which will
result in former B/E Aerospace stockholders holding approximately 19.2% to 21.7% of the outstanding Rockwell Collins common stock, based on the number of outstanding shares
of common stock and outstanding stock-based awards of Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace as of January 26, 2017. For more details on the calculation of the Rockwell Collins
stock price, the calculation of the exchange ratio and the two-way collar mechanism, see "The Merger Agreement—Merger Consideration to be Received by B/E Aerospace
Stockholders" beginning on page 128 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

           If the Rockwell Collins stock price were equal to the Rockwell Collins' closing stock price on January 26, 2017, the most recent practicable date for which such information
was available, holders of B/E Aerospace common stock would receive $34.10 in cash, without interest, plus 0.3101 shares of Rockwell Collins common stock, resulting in Rockwell
Collins issuing 31.1 million shares of Rockwell Collins common stock as a portion of the aggregate merger consideration and representing approximately $62.40 in value per share
of B/E Aerospace common stock, which represents a premium of approximately 23.3% over B/E Aerospace's closing stock price on October 21, 2016, the last trading day before
the public announcement of the merger. The actual value of the merger consideration and the number of shares of Rockwell Collins common stock to be issued by Rockwell Collins
may differ from this example, given the Rockwell Collins stock price will not be determinable until the trading day prior to the closing of the merger. The common stock of
Rockwell Collins is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "COL," and the common stock of B/E Aerospace is listed on The NASDAQ Stock Market under the
symbol "BEAV." We urge you to obtain current market quotations for the shares of common stock of Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace.

           All fractional shares of Rockwell Collins common stock that would otherwise be issued to a B/E Aerospace stockholder as part of the merger consideration will be
aggregated to create whole shares of Rockwell Collins common stock that will be issued to B/E Aerospace stockholders as part of the merger consideration. If a fractional share of
Rockwell Collins common stock remains payable to a B/E Aerospace stockholder after aggregating all fractional shares of Rockwell Collins common stock payable to such B/E
Aerospace stockholder, then such B/E Aerospace stockholder will be paid, in lieu of such remaining fractional share of Rockwell Collins common stock, an amount in cash, without
interest, rounded down to the nearest cent, equal to the product of (x) the amount of the fractional share interest in a share of Rockwell Collins common stock to which such holder
would otherwise be entitled (rounded to three decimal places) and (y) the Rockwell Collins stock price. Rockwell Collins stockholders will continue to own their existing shares of
common stock of Rockwell Collins, the form of which will not be changed by the transaction.

           Each of Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace is holding a special meeting of its stockholders to vote on the proposals necessary to complete the merger. Information about
these meetings, the merger, the share issuance, and the other business to be considered by stockholders at each of the special meetings is contained in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus. Any stockholder entitled to attend and vote at the Rockwell Collins or B/E Aerospace special meeting is entitled to appoint a proxy to attend and vote on such
stockholder's behalf. Such proxy need not be a holder of Rockwell Collins or B/E Aerospace common stock. We urge you to read this joint proxy statement/prospectus and the
annexes and documents incorporated by reference carefully. You should also carefully consider the risks that are described in the "Risk Factors" section beginning on page
46.

           Your vote is very important regardless of the number of shares of Rockwell Collins common stock or B/E Aerospace common stock that you own. The merger
cannot be completed without approval of (i) the proposal to issue Rockwell Collins common stock by the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the votes cast by the
shares of Rockwell Collins common stock represented (in person or by proxy) at the Rockwell Collins special meeting that are entitled to vote on such proposal and
(ii) adoption of the merger agreement by the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the shares of B/E Aerospace common stock outstanding and entitled to vote on
the record date.

           Whether or not you plan to attend your company's special meeting of stockholders, please submit your proxy as soon as possible to make sure that your shares are
represented at that meeting.

           The Rockwell Collins board of directors unanimously recommends that Rockwell Collins stockholders vote "FOR" the proposal to approve the issuance of
Rockwell Collins common stock in the merger, which is necessary to complete the merger.

           The B/E Aerospace board of directors unanimously recommends that B/E Aerospace stockholders vote "FOR" the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, which
is necessary to complete the merger.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE MERGER AND THE SPECIAL MEETINGS 

        The following questions and answers briefly address some commonly asked questions about the merger and each of the Rockwell
Collins and B/E Aerospace special meetings. They may not include all the information that is important to stockholders of Rockwell
Collins and B/E Aerospace. Stockholders should carefully read this entire joint proxy statement/prospectus, including the annexes and the
other documents referred to or incorporated by reference herein.

Q: What is the merger? 

A: Rockwell Collins, Inc., which is referred to as Rockwell Collins, and B/E Aerospace, Inc., which is referred to as B/E Aerospace,
have entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of October 23, 2016, which (as the same may be amended from time
to time) is referred to as the merger agreement. A copy of the merger agreement is attached as Annex A to this joint proxy
statement/prospectus. The merger agreement contains the terms and conditions of the proposed business combination of Rockwell
Collins and B/E Aerospace. Under the merger agreement, subject to satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by law) waiver of the
conditions to the merger set forth in the merger agreement and described hereinafter, Quarterback Merger Sub Corp., a wholly
owned subsidiary of Rockwell Collins, which is referred to as Merger Sub, will merge with and into B/E Aerospace, with B/E
Aerospace continuing as the surviving corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Rockwell Collins, in a transaction which is
referred to as the merger. 

Q: Why am I receiving these materials? 

A: Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace are sending these materials to their respective stockholders to help them decide how to vote
their shares of Rockwell Collins or B/E Aerospace common stock, as the case may be, with respect to the merger and other matters
to be considered at their respective special meetings.

The merger cannot be completed unless Rockwell Collins stockholders approve the issuance of Rockwell Collins common stock in
the merger and B/E Aerospace stockholders adopt the merger agreement. Each of Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace is holding
a special meeting of its stockholders to vote on the proposals necessary to complete the merger. Information about these special
meetings, the merger and the other business to be considered by stockholders at each of the special meetings is contained in this
joint proxy statement/prospectus.

This joint proxy statement/prospectus constitutes both a joint proxy statement of Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace and a
prospectus of Rockwell Collins. It is a joint proxy statement because each of the boards of directors of Rockwell Collins and B/E
Aerospace are soliciting proxies from their respective stockholders. It is a prospectus because Rockwell Collins will issue shares of
its common stock in exchange for outstanding shares of B/E Aerospace common stock in the merger.

Q: What will B/E Aerospace stockholders receive in the merger? 

A: If the merger is completed, B/E Aerospace stockholders (other than (i) Rockwell Collins, B/E Aerospace and Merger Sub and
(ii) any stockholders holding shares of B/E Aerospace common stock with respect to which appraisal rights are properly demanded
and not withdrawn under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware) will receive $34.10 per share in cash, without
interest, and a fraction of a validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of Rockwell Collins common stock with a value of
$27.90 per share, subject to adjustment pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, for each share of B/E Aerospace common
stock. The precise fraction of a share of Rockwell Collins common stock into which each share of B/E Aerospace common stock
will be converted, which is referred to as the exchange ratio, will be determined based upon the Rockwell Collins stock price, as
described in more detail in "The Merger

Table of Contents

Agreement—Merger Consideration to be Received by B/E Aerospace Stockholders" beginning on page 128. If the Rockwell
Collins stock price is greater than or equal to $77.41 and less than or equal to $89.97, the exchange ratio will be equal to the
quotient of (a) $27.90 divided by (b) the Rockwell Collins stock price, which, in each case, will result in the stock consideration
having a value equal to $27.90. If the Rockwell Collins stock price is less than $77.41 or greater than $89.97, a two-way collar
mechanism will apply pursuant to which, (1) if the Rockwell Collins stock price is greater than $89.97, the exchange ratio will be
fixed at 0.3101 and the value of the stock consideration will be more than $27.90, and (2) if the Rockwell Collins stock price is
less than $77.41, the exchange ratio will be fixed at 0.3604 and the value of the stock consideration will be less than $27.90.

All fractional shares of Rockwell Collins common stock that would otherwise be issued to a B/E Aerospace stockholder as part of
the merger consideration will be aggregated to create whole shares of Rockwell Collins common stock that will be issued to B/E
Aerospace stockholders as part of the merger consideration. If a fractional share of Rockwell Collins common stock remains
payable to a B/E Aerospace stockholder after aggregating all fractional shares of Rockwell Collins common stock payable to such
B/E Aerospace stockholder, then such B/E Aerospace stockholder will be paid, in lieu of such remaining fractional share of
Rockwell Collins common stock, an amount in cash, without interest, rounded down to the nearest cent, equal to the product of
(x) the amount of the fractional share interest in a share of Rockwell Collins common stock to which such holder would otherwise
be entitled (rounded to three decimal places) and (y) the Rockwell Collins stock price.

Q: How will Rockwell Collins pay the cash component of the merger consideration? 

A: Rockwell Collins' obligation to complete the merger is not conditioned upon its obtaining financing. Rockwell Collins anticipates
that approximately $3.6 billion will be required to pay the aggregate cash portion of the merger consideration to the B/E Aerospace
stockholders. Rockwell Collins intends to fund the cash component of the merger through sources of debt financing.

For a more complete description of sources of funding for the merger and related costs, see "The Merger—Source of Funding for
the Merger" beginning on page 123.

Q: When do Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace expect to complete the transaction? 

A: Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace are working to complete the transaction as soon as practicable. We currently expect that the
transaction will be completed in the spring of 2017. Neither Rockwell Collins nor B/E Aerospace can predict, however, the actual
date on which the transaction will be completed because it is subject to conditions beyond each company's control, including the
necessary regulatory approvals.

See "The Merger Agreement—Conditions to the Merger" beginning on page 148.

Q: What am I being asked to vote on, and why is this approval necessary? 

A: Rockwell Collins stockholders are being asked to vote on the following proposals:

        1.     to approve the issuance of Rockwell Collins common stock, par value $0.01 per share, pursuant to the merger agreement,
which is referred to as the Share Issuance proposal; and

        2.     to approve any proposal to adjourn the Rockwell Collins special meeting from time to time, if necessary or appropriate,
to solicit additional proxies in the event there are not sufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the Share
Issuance proposal, which is referred to as the Rockwell Collins Adjournment proposal.

Table of Contents

Approval of the Share Issuance proposal by Rockwell Collins stockholders is required to complete the merger.

B/E Aerospace stockholders are being asked to vote on the following proposals:

        1.     to adopt the merger agreement, which is referred to as the Merger proposal;

        2.     to approve, on an advisory basis, the merger-related compensation arrangements of B/E Aerospace's named executive
officers, which is referred to as the Merger-Related Compensation proposal; and

        3.     to approve any proposal to adjourn the B/E Aerospace special meeting from time to time, if necessary or appropriate, to
solicit additional proxies in the event there are not sufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the Merger
proposal, which is referred to as the B/E Aerospace Adjournment proposal.

Approval of the Merger proposal by B/E Aerospace stockholders is required for completion of the merger.

Q: What vote is required to approve each proposal at the Rockwell Collins Special Meeting? 

A: The Share Issuance proposal:    The affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the votes cast by shares of Rockwell Collins
common stock represented (in person or by proxy) at the Rockwell Collins special meeting is required to approve the Share
Issuance proposal, which is referred to as the Rockwell Collins Stockholder Approval.

The Rockwell Collins Adjournment proposal:    The affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the shares of Rockwell Collins
common stock represented (in person or by proxy) at the Rockwell Collins special meeting and entitled to vote on the proposal,
whether or not a quorum is present, is required to approve the Rockwell Collins Adjournment proposal.

Q: What vote is required to approve each proposal at the B/E Aerospace Special Meeting? 

A: The Merger proposal:    The affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of B/E Aerospace
common stock is required to approve the Merger proposal, which is referred to as the B/E Aerospace Stockholder Approval.

The Merger-Related Compensation proposal:    The affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the votes cast by stockholders
entitled to vote on the proposal that are present in person or represented by proxy, assuming a quorum, is required to approve the
Merger-Related Compensation proposal. Because the vote on the Merger-Related Compensation proposal is advisory only, it will
not be binding on B/E Aerospace. Accordingly, if the Merger proposal is approved and the merger is completed, the merger-related
compensation will be payable to B/E Aerospace's named executive officers, subject only to the conditions applicable thereto,
regardless of the outcome of the approval of the Merger-Related Compensation proposal.

The B/E Aerospace Adjournment proposal:    The affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the votes cast by B/E Aerospace
stockholders present in person or represented by proxy, whether or not a quorum is present is required to approve the B/E
Aerospace Adjournment proposal. If a quorum is present, the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the votes cast by the
shares of B/E Aerospace common stock represented (in person or by proxy) at the B/E Aerospace special meeting and entitled to
vote on the proposal is required to approve the B/E Aerospace Adjournment proposal.

Q: What happens if the non-binding advisory proposal to approve compensation that will or may be paid or provided by B/E
Aerospace to its named executive officers in connection with the merger is not approved? 

A: Approval, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, of compensation that will or may be paid or provided by B/E Aerospace to its
named executive officers in connection with the merger is not a condition to completion of the merger. The vote is an advisory vote
and is not binding. If the merger is completed, B/E Aerospace expects to pay "compensation in connection with the merger" to its
named executive officers. 

Q: What constitutes a quorum? 

A: The presence at the Rockwell Collins special meeting, in person or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the shares of Rockwell
Collins common stock issued and outstanding on the record date for the Rockwell Collins special meeting will constitute a quorum
for the transaction of business at the Rockwell Collins special meeting. The presence at the B/E Aerospace special meeting, in
person or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of B/E Aerospace votes entitled to be cast by stockholders entitled to vote on the
record date for the B/E Aerospace special meeting will constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at the B/E Aerospace
special meeting. Abstentions (which are described below) will count for the purpose of determining the presence of a quorum for
the transaction of business at each special meeting. 

Q: How does the Rockwell Collins Board recommend that I vote? 

A: The board of directors of Rockwell Collins, which is referred to as the Rockwell Collins Board, unanimously recommends that
holders of Rockwell Collins common stock vote "FOR" the Share Issuance proposal and "FOR" the Rockwell Collins
Adjournment proposal. 

Q: How does the B/E Aerospace Board recommend that I vote? 

A: The board of directors of B/E Aerospace, which is referred to as the B/E Aerospace Board, unanimously recommends that B/E
Aerospace stockholders vote "FOR" the Merger proposal and "FOR" the B/E Aerospace Adjournment proposal. In addition, the
B/E Aerospace Board unanimously recommends that holders of B/E Aerospace common stock vote "FOR" the Merger-Related
Compensation proposal to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, any "golden parachute" compensation arrangement that
may be paid or become payable to B/E Aerospace's named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the merger or
contemplated by the merger agreement. 

Q: What do I need to do now? 

A: After carefully reading and considering the information contained in this joint proxy statement/prospectus, please vote your shares
as soon as possible so that your shares will be represented at your respective company's special meeting. Please follow the
instructions set forth on the proxy card or on the voting instruction form provided by the record holder if your shares are held in the
name of your broker, bank or other nominee.

Please do not submit your B/E Aerospace stock certificates at this time. If the merger is completed, you will receive
instructions for surrendering your B/E Aerospace stock certificates in exchange for shares of Rockwell Collins common
stock from the exchange agent.

Q: How do I vote? 

A: If you are a stockholder of record of Rockwell Collins as of January 18, 2017, which is referred to as the Rockwell Collins record
date, or a stockholder of B/E Aerospace as of January 18, 2017, which is referred to as the B/E Aerospace record date, you may
submit your proxy before your respective company's special meeting in one of the following ways: 

• Telephone voting—use the toll-free number shown on your proxy card; 

• Via the Internet—visit the website shown on your proxy card to vote via the Internet; or 

• Mail—complete, sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card in the enclosed postage-paid envelope.

If you are a stockholder of record, you may also cast your vote in person at your respective company's special meeting.

If your shares are held in "street name," through a broker, bank or other nominee, that institution will send you separate
instructions describing the procedure for voting your shares. "Street name" stockholders who wish to vote at the meeting will need
to obtain a "legal proxy" form from their broker, bank or other nominee.

Q: How do I vote my shares of B/E Aerospace common stock held through B/E Aerospace's 401(k) Plan? 

A: If you hold shares of B/E Aerospace common stock through B/E Aerospace's 401(k) Plan, you may vote your shares by telephone,
mail or via the Internet as described above. If you vote your shares by telephone or via the Internet, your voting instructions must
be received before 11:59 p.m. (Eastern time) on March 6, 2017 in order for you to instruct B/E Aerospace's 401(k) Plan trustee
how to vote your shares. If you vote your shares by mail, your voting instructions must be received before 6:00 p.m. (Eastern time)
on March 6, 2017 in order for you to instruct B/E Aerospace's 401(k) Plan trustee how to vote your shares. If you hold shares
through B/E Aerospace's 401(k) Plan and do not timely submit your voting instructions by this deadline, your applicable shares
will be voted in the same proportion to the shares held in B/E Aerospace's 401(k) Plan for which votes were cast.

If you hold shares of B/E Aerospace common stock through B/E Aerospace's 401(k) Plan, you may attend the B/E Aerospace
special meeting. However, shares held through B/E Aerospace's 401(k) Plan can only be voted as described in the above
paragraph, and cannot be voted in person at the B/E Aerospace special meeting.

Q: How do I vote my shares of Rockwell Collins common stock held through the Rockwell Collins Retirement Savings Plan? 

A: If you hold shares of Rockwell Collins common stock through the Rockwell Collins Retirement Savings Plan, you may vote your
shares by telephone, mail or via the Internet as described above. If you hold shares through the Rockwell Collins Retirement
Savings Plan and are an employee of Rockwell Collins, you will receive an email with instructions on how to vote the shares you
hold through the plan. If you vote your shares by telephone or via the Internet, your voting instructions must be received before
11:59 p.m. (Central time) on March 5, 2017 in order for you to instruct the Rockwell Collins Retirement Savings Plan trustee how
to vote your shares. If you vote your shares by mail, your voting instructions must be received by March 5, 2017 in order for you to
instruct the Rockwell Collins Retirement Savings Plan trustee how to vote your shares. If you hold shares through the Rockwell
Collins Retirement Savings Plan and do not timely submit your voting

instructions by this deadline, your applicable shares will be voted in the same proportion to the shares held in the Rockwell Collins
Retirement Savings Plan for which votes were cast.

If you hold shares of Rockwell Collins common stock through the Rockwell Collins Retirement Savings Plan, you may attend the
Rockwell Collins special meeting. However, shares held through the Rockwell Collins Retirement Savings Plan can only be voted
as described in the above paragraph, and cannot be voted in person at the Rockwell Collins special meeting.

Q: If my shares are held in "street name" by a broker, bank or other nominee, will my broker, bank or other nominee vote my
shares for me? 

A: If your shares are held in "street name" in a stock brokerage account or by a broker, bank or other nominee, you must provide the
record holder of your shares with instructions on how to vote your shares. Please follow the voting instructions provided by your
broker, bank or other nominee. Please note that you may not vote shares held in street name by returning a proxy card directly to
Rockwell Collins or B/E Aerospace or by voting in person at your respective company's special meeting unless you provide a
"legal proxy," which you must obtain from your broker, bank or other nominee. Your broker, bank or other nominee is obligated to
provide you with a voting instruction card for you to use.

Brokers who hold shares in street name for a beneficial owner of those shares typically have the authority to vote in their discretion
on "routine" proposals when they have not received instructions from beneficial owners. However, brokers are not allowed to
exercise their voting discretion with respect to the approval of matters determined to be "non-routine" without specific instructions
from the beneficial owner. It is expected that all proposals to be voted on at the Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace special
meetings are such "non-routine" matters. Broker non-votes occur when a broker or nominee is not instructed by the beneficial
owner of shares to vote on a particular proposal for which the broker does not have discretionary voting power.

If you are a Rockwell Collins stockholder and you do not instruct your broker, bank or other nominee on how to vote your shares:

• your broker, bank or other nominee may not vote your shares on the Share Issuance proposal, which broker non-votes, if
any, will have no effect on the vote count for such proposal (assuming a quorum is present); and 

• your broker, bank or other nominee may not vote your shares on the Rockwell Collins Adjournment proposal, which broker
non-votes, if any, will have no effect on the vote count for such proposal (regardless of whether a quorum is present).

If you are a B/E Aerospace stockholder and you do not instruct your broker, bank or other nominee on how to vote your shares:

• your broker, bank or other nominee may not vote your shares on the Merger proposal, which broker non-votes, if any, will
have the same effect as a vote AGAINST such proposal; 

• your broker, bank or other nominee may not vote your shares on the Merger-Related Compensation proposal, which broker
non-votes, if any, will have no effect on the vote count for such proposal (assuming a quorum is present); and 

• your broker, bank or other nominee may not vote your shares on the B/E Aerospace Adjournment proposal, which broker
non-votes, if any, will have no effect on the vote count for such proposal (regardless of whether a quorum is present).

A: For purposes of each of the Rockwell Collins special meeting and the B/E Aerospace special meeting, an abstention occurs when a
stockholder attends the applicable special meeting in person and does not vote or returns a proxy with an "abstain" instruction.

Rockwell Collins

Share Issuance proposal:    An abstention will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the Share Issuance proposal. If a
Rockwell Collins stockholder is not present in person at the Rockwell Collins special meeting and does not respond by proxy, it
will have no effect on the vote count for the Share Issuance proposal.

Rockwell Collins Adjournment proposal:    An abstention will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the Rockwell Collins
Adjournment proposal. If a Rockwell Collins stockholder is not present in person at the Rockwell Collins special meeting and does
not respond by proxy, it will have no effect on the vote count for the Rockwell Collins Adjournment proposal (assuming a quorum
is present).

B/E Aerospace

Merger proposal:    An abstention will have the same effect as a vote cast "AGAINST" the Merger proposal. If a B/E Aerospace
stockholder is not present in person at the B/E Aerospace special meeting and does not respond by proxy, it will have the effect of
a vote cast "AGAINST" such proposal.

Merger-Related Compensation proposal:    An abstention will have no effect on the vote count for the Merger-Related
Compensation proposal. If a B/E Aerospace stockholder is not present in person at the B/E Aerospace special meeting and does not
respond by proxy, it will have no effect on the vote count for the Merger-Related Compensation proposal (assuming a quorum is
present).

B/E Aerospace Adjournment proposal:    An abstention will have no effect on the vote count for the B/E Aerospace Adjournment
proposal. If a B/E Aerospace stockholder is not present in person at

the B/E Aerospace special meeting and does not respond by proxy, it will have no effect on the vote count for such proposal
(assuming a quorum is present).

Q: What will happen if I return my proxy or voting instruction card without indicating how to vote? 

A: If you sign and return your proxy or voting instruction card without indicating how to vote on any particular proposal, the
Rockwell Collins common stock represented by your proxy will be voted as recommended by the Rockwell Collins Board with
respect to that proposal or the B/E Aerospace common stock represented by your proxy will be voted as recommended by the B/E
Aerospace Board with respect to that proposal, as applicable. Unless a Rockwell Collins stockholder or a B/E Aerospace
stockholder, as applicable, checks the box on its proxy card to withhold discretionary authority, the applicable proxy holders may
use their discretion to vote on other matters relating to the Rockwell Collins special meeting or B/E Aerospace special meeting, as
applicable. 

Q: What if I hold shares of both Rockwell Collins common stock and B/E Aerospace common stock? 

A: If you are a stockholder of both Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace, you will receive two separate packages of proxy materials.
A vote as a B/E Aerospace stockholder will not constitute a vote as a Rockwell Collins stockholder and vice versa. Therefore,
please sign, date and return all proxy cards that you receive, whether from Rockwell Collins or B/E Aerospace, or vote as both a
Rockwell Collins stockholder and as a B/E Aerospace stockholder by Internet or telephone. 

Q: May I change or revoke my vote after I have delivered my proxy or voting instruction card? 

A: Yes. If you are a record holder, you may change or revoke your vote before your proxy is voted at the Rockwell Collins or B/E
Aerospace special meeting as described herein. You may do this in one of the following four ways: 

• by sending a notice of revocation to the corporate secretary of Rockwell Collins or B/E Aerospace, as applicable; 

• by logging onto the Internet website specified on your proxy card in the same manner you would to submit your proxy
electronically or by calling the telephone number specified on your proxy card, in each case if you are eligible to do so; 

• by sending a completed proxy card bearing a later date than your original proxy card; or 

• by attending the Rockwell Collins or B/E Aerospace special meeting, as applicable, and voting in person.

If you choose any of the first three methods, you must take the described action no later than the beginning of the applicable
special meeting.

If your shares are held in an account at a broker, bank or other nominee or through B/E Aerospace's 401(k) Plan or the Rockwell
Collins Retirement Savings Plan and you have delivered your voting instruction card or otherwise given instruction on how to vote
your shares to your broker, bank or other nominee or your plan administrator, you should contact your broker, bank or other
nominee or your plan administrator to change your vote.

Q: What are the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger? 

A: The exchange of B/E Aerospace common stock pursuant to the merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax
purposes. Accordingly, a U.S. holder (as defined in "The Merger—U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences") of B/E Aerospace
common stock who receives the merger consideration in exchange for such U.S. holder's shares of B/E Aerospace common

Table of Contents

stock generally will recognize taxable gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between (i) the sum of the fair
market value of the Rockwell Collins common stock and the amount of cash, including cash in lieu of fractional shares, received in
the merger and (ii) such U.S. holder's adjusted tax basis in the shares of B/E Aerospace common stock exchanged therefor. If you
are a non-U.S. holder (as defined in "The Merger—U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences"), the merger generally will not result
in tax to you under U.S. federal income tax laws unless you have certain connections with the United States.

For a more complete description of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger, see "The Merger—U.S. Federal
Income Tax Consequences" beginning on page 125.

This joint proxy statement/prospectus contains a general discussion of United States federal income tax consequences of the
merger. This description does not address any non-U.S. tax consequences, nor does it pertain to state, local or other tax
consequences. Consequently, you are urged to contact your own tax advisor to determine the particular tax consequences to
you of the merger.

Q: Do I have appraisal rights in connection with the transaction? 

A: Under Delaware law, Rockwell Collins stockholders will not be entitled to exercise any appraisal rights in connection with the
merger or any other transaction described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

Subject to the closing of the merger, record holders of B/E Aerospace common stock who do not vote in favor of the adoption of
the merger agreement and otherwise comply fully with the requirements and procedures of Section 262 of the General Corporation
Law of the State of Delaware, which is referred to as the DGCL, may exercise their rights of appraisal, which generally entitle
stockholders to receive a lump sum cash payment equal to the fair value of their B/E Aerospace common stock exclusive of any
element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger. The "fair value" could be higher or lower than, or
the same as, the merger consideration. A detailed description of the appraisal rights and procedures available to B/E Aerospace
stockholders is included in "The Merger—Appraisal Rights" beginning on page 119. The full text of Section 262 of the DGCL is
attached as Annex E to this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

Q: What will happen to my B/E Aerospace stock-based awards? 

A: Treatment of B/E Aerospace Restricted Stock Awards and RSU Awards

Upon completion of the merger, each outstanding award of B/E Aerospace restricted stock and each B/E Aerospace restricted stock
unit award that in each case was granted prior to the date of the merger agreement will (i) become fully vested and, to the extent
such award is subject to performance conditions, such performance conditions will be deemed satisfied at the maximum level and
(ii) be cancelled and converted into the right to receive a lump sum cash payment per share of B/E Aerospace common stock
underlying such award equal to the value of the per share merger consideration, less any applicable withholding taxes. Upon
completion of the merger, except for outstanding restricted stock unit awards granted to the executive officers of B/E Aerospace in
November 2016, consistent with past practice, which will be cancelled and converted into a cash payment pursuant to their terms,
each outstanding award of B/E Aerospace restricted stock and each B/E Aerospace restricted stock unit award that in each case was
granted on or following the date of the merger agreement will be assumed by Rockwell Collins and converted into a Rockwell
Collins award of restricted stock or restricted stock unit award, as applicable, which will vest subject to the grantee's continued
service with Rockwell Collins or its affiliates through each applicable vesting date (with any performance conditions that were

applicable to the B/E Aerospace award deemed satisfied at target level performance and following the closing, the converted
Rockwell Collins award subject only to time-based vesting) covering a number of shares of Rockwell Collins common stock
(rounded down to the nearest whole share) determined by multiplying the number of shares of B/E Aerospace that were subject to
the B/E Aerospace award by a ratio of the value of the merger consideration divided by the Rockwell Collins stock price (with the
value of the stock consideration portion of the merger consideration determined by multiplying the number of such shares of
Rockwell Collins common stock by the Rockwell Collins stock price).

Treatment of B/E Aerospace Stock Units

Each stock unit credited to the account of any current or former director under the B/E Aerospace Amended and Restated Non-
Employee Directors Stock and Deferred Compensation Plan that is outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the
merger, which is referred to as the effective time, will be converted into the right to receive the merger consideration.

For a more complete description of the treatment of outstanding restricted stock unit awards granted to the executive officers of
B/E Aerospace in November 2016, see "The Merger—Interests of Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger" beginning on
page 102.

Any applicable withholding taxes resulting from this treatment will be satisfied by reducing the amount of cash, if any, that would
otherwise be provided to holders of such awards. If no cash is to be provided to a holder of such an award or if the amount of cash
that would otherwise be provided to a holder of such awards is not sufficient to cover the applicable withholding taxes, then the
number of shares of Rockwell Collins common stock that would otherwise be provided to the holder in accordance with the terms
described above will be reduced to the extent necessary to cover the shortfall.

Q: What happens if I sell my shares of B/E Aerospace common stock after the record date but before the B/E Aerospace
special meeting? 

A: The record date for the B/E Aerospace special meeting (the close of business on January 18, 2017) is earlier than the date of the
B/E Aerospace special meeting and earlier than the date that the merger is expected to be completed. If you sell or otherwise
transfer your shares of B/E Aerospace common stock after the record date but before the date of the B/E Aerospace special
meeting, you will retain your right to vote at the B/E Aerospace special meeting. However, you will not have the right to receive
the merger consideration to be received by B/E Aerospace stockholders in the merger. In order to receive the merger consideration,
you must hold your shares through completion of the merger. 

Q: What happens if I sell my Rockwell Collins shares after the record date but before the Rockwell Collins special meeting? 

A: The record date for the Rockwell Collins special meeting (the close of business on January 18, 2017) is earlier than the date of the
Rockwell Collins special meeting. If you sell or otherwise transfer your Rockwell Collins common shares after the record date but
before the date of the Rockwell Collins special meeting, you will retain your right to vote at the Rockwell Collins special meeting. 

Q: Whom should I contact if I have any questions about the proxy materials or voting?

Merger Sub

        Merger Sub, a wholly owned subsidiary of Rockwell Collins, is a Delaware corporation incorporated on October 19, 2016 for
the purpose of effecting the merger. Merger Sub has not conducted any activities other than those incidental to its formation and the
matters contemplated by the merger agreement, including the preparation of applicable regulatory filings in connection with the
merger. The principal executive offices of Merger Sub are located at 400 Collins Road NE, Cedar Rapids, Iowa 52498.

The Transaction 

Merger Agreement

        On October 23, 2016, Rockwell Collins, B/E Aerospace and Merger Sub entered into the merger agreement, which provides
that, subject to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement and in accordance with the DGCL, Merger Sub will merge with
and into B/E Aerospace, with B/E Aerospace continuing as the surviving corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Rockwell
Collins.

Amendment to Tax Sharing Agreement

        In connection with entry into the merger agreement, B/E Aerospace and KLX entered into a first amendment to the Tax
Sharing and Indemnification Agreement, dated as of December 15, 2014, which is referred to as the KLX tax sharing agreement.
The KLX tax sharing agreement was originally entered into in connection with B/E Aerospace's contribution of assets to KLX, B/E
Aerospace's repayment of certain debt obligations with the proceeds of a cash distribution from KLX, and B/E Aerospace's
distribution of the stock of KLX, all in December of 2014, in transactions intended to qualify for tax-free treatment under
Sections 355, 361 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, which transactions, collectively, are
referred to as the KLX spin-off and which tax treatment is referred to as the KLX spin-off tax treatment. Among other things, the
KLX tax sharing agreement sets forth the allocation between B/E Aerospace and KLX of liabilities for taxes arising prior to, as a
result of, and subsequent to the KLX spin-off and certain related restructuring transactions and sets out certain restrictions on the
activities of both B/E Aerospace and KLX following the KLX spin-off.

        The amendment to the KLX tax sharing agreement modifies a requirement under the KLX tax sharing agreement relating to
the ability of B/E Aerospace to enter into certain transactions after the KLX spin-off. In satisfaction of this modified requirement,
B/E Aerospace provided KLX with an opinion that B/E Aerospace received from its tax advisor, Shearman & Sterling LLP, which
is referred to as Shearman & Sterling, relating to the impact of the merger on the KLX spin-off tax treatment. In addition, pursuant
to the terms of the amendment to the KLX tax sharing agreement, KLX delivered a representation letter to Shearman & Sterling, for
purposes of such opinion. This opinion relies on certain representations, assumptions, undertakings and covenants, from KLX,
B/E Aerospace and Rockwell Collins and the conclusion set forth in the opinion may be adversely affected if one or more of the
representations and assumptions is incorrect or one or more of the undertakings and covenants is not complied with.

Consideration to be Received in the Merger by B/E Aerospace Stockholders 

        At the effective time, each share of B/E Aerospace common stock that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
effective time (other than (i) shares of B/E Aerospace common stock owned

or held directly or indirectly by Rockwell Collins, B/E Aerospace (including as treasury stock) or Merger Sub, which will be
cancelled immediately prior to the effective time, and (ii) shares of B/E Aerospace common stock with respect to which appraisal
rights are properly demanded and not withdrawn under Section 262 of the DGCL) will be converted into the right to receive $34.10
in cash, without interest, which is referred to as the cash consideration, and a fraction of a validly issued, fully paid and non-
assessable share of Rockwell Collins common stock having a value equal to $27.90 (subject to adjustment based upon a two-way
collar mechanism), which is referred to as the stock consideration. The exchange ratio will be determined based upon the Rockwell
Collins stock price, as described in more detail in "The Merger Agreement—Merger Consideration to be Received by
B/E Aerospace Stockholders" beginning on page 128. If the Rockwell Collins stock price is greater than or equal to $77.41 and less
than or equal to $89.97, the exchange ratio will be equal to the quotient of (a) $27.90 divided by (b) the Rockwell Collins stock
price, which, in each case, will result in the stock consideration having a value equal to $27.90. If the Rockwell Collins stock price
is less than $77.41 or greater than $89.97, then the two-way collar mechanism will apply pursuant to which, (1) if the Rockwell
Collins stock price is greater than $89.97, the exchange ratio will be fixed at 0.3101 and the value of the stock consideration will be
more than $27.90, and (2) if the Rockwell Collins stock price is less than $77.41, the exchange ratio will be fixed at 0.3604 and the
value of the stock consideration will be less than $27.90. Upon the completion of the merger, based on minimum and maximum
exchange ratios of 0.3101 and 0.3604, the estimated number of shares of Rockwell Collins common stock issuable as a portion of
the merger consideration is between 31.1 million shares and 36.1 million shares, which will result in former B/E Aerospace
stockholders holding approximately 19.2% to 21.7% of the outstanding Rockwell Collins common stock, based on the number of
outstanding shares of common stock and outstanding stock-based awards of Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace as of January 26,
2017. For more details on the shares of Rockwell Collins common stock and other consideration to be received by B/E Aerospace
stockholders, see "The Merger Agreement—Merger Consideration to be Received by B/E Aerospace Stockholders" beginning on
page 128 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

        All fractional shares of Rockwell Collins common stock that would otherwise be issued to a B/E Aerospace stockholder as part
of the merger consideration will be aggregated to create whole shares of Rockwell Collins common stock that will be issued to B/E
Aerospace stockholders as part of the merger consideration. If a fractional share of Rockwell Collins common stock remains
payable to a B/E Aerospace stockholder after aggregating all fractional shares of Rockwell Collins common stock payable to such
B/E Aerospace stockholder, then such B/E Aerospace stockholder will be paid, in lieu of such remaining fractional share of
Rockwell Collins common stock, an amount in cash, without interest, rounded down to the nearest cent, equal to the product of
(x) the amount of the fractional share interest in a share of Rockwell Collins common stock to which such holder would otherwise
be entitled (rounded to three decimal places) and (y) the Rockwell Collins stock price.

Treatment of Stock-Based Awards 

B/E Aerospace

Treatment of B/E Aerospace Restricted Stock Awards and RSU Awards

        Upon completion of the merger, each outstanding award of B/E Aerospace restricted stock and each B/E Aerospace restricted
stock unit award that in each case was granted prior to the date of the merger agreement will (i) become fully vested and, to the
extent such award is subject to performance conditions, such performance conditions will be deemed satisfied at the maximum level
and (ii) be cancelled and converted into the right to receive a lump sum cash payment per share of B/E Aerospace common stock
underlying such award equal to the value of the per share merger consideration, less any applicable withholding taxes. Upon
completion of the merger, except for outstanding restricted stock unit awards granted to the executive officers of B/E Aerospace in
November 2016, consistent with past

date of the merger agreement will be assumed by Rockwell Collins and converted into a Rockwell Collins award of restricted stock
or restricted stock unit award, as applicable, which will vest subject to the grantee's continued service with Rockwell Collins or its
affiliates through each applicable vesting date (with any performance conditions that were applicable to the B/E Aerospace award
deemed satisfied at target level performance and, following the closing, the converted Rockwell Collins award subject only to time-
based vesting) covering a number of shares of Rockwell Collins common stock (rounded down to the nearest whole share)
determined by multiplying the number of shares of B/E Aerospace that were subject to the B/E Aerospace award by a ratio of the
value of the merger consideration divided by the Rockwell Collins stock price (with the value of the stock consideration portion of
the merger consideration determined by multiplying the number of such shares of Rockwell Collins common stock by the Rockwell
Collins stock price).

Treatment of B/E Aerospace Stock Units

        Each stock unit credited to the account of any current or former director under the B/E Aerospace Amended and Restated Non-
Employee Directors Stock and Deferred Compensation Plan that is outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the
merger, which is referred to as the effective time, will be converted into the right to receive the merger consideration.

        For a more complete description of the treatment of outstanding restricted stock unit awards granted to the executive officers of
B/E Aerospace in November 2016, see "The Merger—Interests of Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger" beginning on
page 102.

Rockwell Collins

        The merger will not affect Rockwell Collins' stock-based awards. All such awards will remain outstanding subject to the same
terms and conditions that are applicable to such stock-based awards prior to the merger.

Rockwell Collins Board of Directors Following Completion of the Merger 

        The merger agreement provides that Rockwell Collins will take all necessary corporate action so that, upon and after the
effective time, the size of the Rockwell Collins Board will be increased by two members to a total of eleven, and two individuals
selected by B/E Aerospace who meet Rockwell Collins' independence criteria and are otherwise reasonably acceptable to Rockwell
Collins will be appointed to the Rockwell Collins Board. One such individual will serve as a member of the class of directors of the
Rockwell Collins Board with terms expiring in 2018, and the other will serve as a member of the class of directors of the Rockwell
Collins Board with terms expiring in 2020. Pursuant to this provision of the merger agreement, John T. Whates and Richard G.
Hamermesh, both members of the B/E Aerospace Board, were selected by B/E Aerospace to be appointed to the Rockwell Collins
Board and are expected to serve as members of the class of directors of the Rockwell Collins Board with terms expiring in 2018 and
2020, respectively. Other than such additional directors, no changes to the Rockwell Collins Board are expected in connection with
the consummation of the merger.

        For a more complete description of the directors and executive officers of the surviving corporation, see "The Merger—
Governance of Rockwell Collins Following Completion of the Merger" beginning on page 101.

Headquarters 

        Upon completion of the transaction, Rockwell Collins' headquarters will remain in Cedar Rapids, Iowa.

Opinions of Financial Advisors 

Rockwell Collins' Financial Advisor

Opinion of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC

        Rockwell Collins retained J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, which is referred to as J.P. Morgan, to act as its financial advisor in
connection with the proposed merger. At the meeting of the Rockwell Collins Board on October 21, 2016, J.P. Morgan rendered its
oral opinion to the Rockwell Collins Board that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth
in its opinion, the merger consideration to be paid by Rockwell Collins was fair, from a financial point of view, to Rockwell Collins.
The oral opinion was subsequently confirmed in writing by delivery of J.P. Morgan's written opinion dated October 23, 2016.

        The full text of the written opinion of J.P. Morgan, which sets forth the assumptions made, matters considered and
limits on the review undertaken, is attached as Annex B to this joint proxy statement/prospectus and is incorporated herein
by reference. The summary of the opinion of J.P. Morgan set forth in this joint proxy statement/prospectus is qualified in its
entirety by reference to the full text of such opinion. Rockwell Collins stockholders are urged to read the opinion in its
entirety. J.P. Morgan's opinion was addressed to the Rockwell Collins Board (in its capacity as such) in connection with and
for the purposes of its evaluation of the merger, was directed only to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to Rockwell
Collins of the merger consideration to be paid by Rockwell Collins and did not address any other aspect of the merger. J.P.
Morgan expressed no opinion as to the fairness of the merger consideration to the holders of any class of securities, creditors
or other constituencies of Rockwell Collins or as to the underlying decision by Rockwell Collins to engage in the merger. The
issuance of J.P. Morgan's opinion was approved by a fairness committee of J.P. Morgan.

B/E Aerospace's Financial Advisors

Opinion of Citigroup Global Markets Inc.

        On October 23, 2016, Citigroup Global Markets Inc., which is referred to as Citigroup, delivered to the B/E Aerospace Board a
written opinion dated October 23, 2016, to the effect that, as of such date and based on and subject to the assumptions made,
procedures followed, matters considered and limitations and qualifications set forth in the written opinion, each as described in
greater detail in the section entitled "The Merger—Opinions of B/E Aerospace's Financial Advisors" beginning on page 82, the
merger consideration to be received by the holders of outstanding shares of common stock of B/E Aerospace, other than shares of
B/E Aerospace common stock held by holders who are entitled to, and properly demand, appraisal of their shares of B/E Aerospace
common stock and shares of B/E Aerospace common stock that are owned, directly or indirectly, by Rockwell Collins, B/E
Aerospace (as treasury shares or otherwise) or Merger Sub (collectively, referred to as the excluded holders) in the merger was fair,
from a financial point of view, to such holders. Citigroup's opinion, the issuance of which was authorized by Citigroup's fairness
opinion committee, was provided to the B/E Aerospace Board in connection with its evaluation of the merger and was limited to the
fairness, from a financial point of view, as of the date of Citigroup's opinion, to the holders of outstanding shares of common stock
of B/E Aerospace (other than excluded holders) of the merger consideration to be received by such holders in the merger.

        Citigroup's opinion does not address any other aspects or implications of the merger and does not constitute a
recommendation to any stockholder as to how such stockholder should vote or act on any matters relating to the merger.
The summary of Citigroup's opinion contained in this joint proxy statement/prospectus is qualified in its entirety by
reference to the full text of the opinion. We encourage you to read the full text of Citigroup's written opinion, which is
attached to this joint proxy statement/prospectus as Annex C and sets forth, among other things, the assumptions made,
procedures followed, matters considered and limitations and qualifications on the scope of review undertaken.

Opinion of Goldman, Sachs & Co.

        On October 23, 2016, Goldman, Sachs & Co., which is referred to as Goldman Sachs, delivered to the B/E Aerospace Board a
written opinion dated October 23, 2016, to the effect that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions
set forth therein, the merger consideration to be paid to the holders (other than Rockwell Collins and its affiliates) of outstanding
shares of common stock of B/E Aerospace pursuant to the merger agreement was fair from a financial point of view to such holders.

        The full text of the written opinion of Goldman Sachs, dated October 23, 2016, which sets forth assumptions made,
procedures followed, matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken in connection with the opinion, is
attached as Annex D. Goldman Sachs provided its opinion for the information and assistance of the B/E Aerospace Board in
connection with its consideration of the merger. The Goldman Sachs opinion is not a recommendation as to how any holder
of B/E Aerospace common stock should vote with respect to the merger or any other matter.

Interests of Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger 

        The directors and executive officers of B/E Aerospace have interests in the merger that are in addition to their interests as
stockholders of B/E Aerospace generally. These interests include, but are not limited to, continued employment of certain executive
officers with the surviving company,

Table of Contents

indemnification and insurance for current and former directors and executive officers, transaction bonuses for certain executive
officers and the treatment in the merger of B/E Aerospace restricted stock units, restricted stock awards and other equity-based
awards held by these directors and executive officers (including accelerated vesting of B/E Aerospace restricted stock units and
restricted stock awards immediately upon the effective time). Certain B/E Aerospace executive officers are, by reason of their
respective employment agreements with B/E Aerospace, entitled to severance payments and other benefits immediately upon the
consummation of the merger (certain other executive officers are entitled to severance payments and benefits upon a qualifying
termination of employment following the merger). In addition, Richard G. Hamermesh and John T. Whates, both members of the
B/E Aerospace Board, will be appointed to the Rockwell Collins Board. The B/E Aerospace Board was aware of these interests and
considered them, among other matters, in approving the merger agreement and in determining to recommend that B/E Aerospace
stockholders adopt the merger agreement.

U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger 

        The exchange of B/E Aerospace common stock pursuant to the merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax
purposes. Accordingly, a U.S. holder (as defined in "The Merger—U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences" beginning on page 125)
of B/E Aerospace common stock who receives the merger consideration in exchange for such U.S. holder's shares of B/E Aerospace
common stock generally will recognize taxable gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between (i) the sum of the
fair market value of the Rockwell Collins common stock and the amount of cash, including cash in lieu of fractional shares,
received in the merger and (ii) such U.S. holder's adjusted tax basis in the shares of B/E Aerospace common stock exchanged
therefor. If you are a non-U.S. holder, the merger generally will not result in tax to you under U.S. federal income tax laws unless
you have certain connections with the United States.

        This joint proxy statement/prospectus contains a general discussion of United States federal income tax consequences of
the merger. This description does not address any non-U.S. tax consequences, nor does it pertain to state, local or other tax
consequences. Consequently, you are urged to contact your own tax advisor to determine the particular tax consequences to
you of the merger.

Accounting Treatment of the Merger 

        The merger will be accounted for as an acquisition of B/E Aerospace by Rockwell Collins under the acquisition method of
accounting in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., which is referred to as GAAP.

Appraisal Rights 

        Under Delaware law, Rockwell Collins stockholders will not be entitled to any appraisal rights in connection with the merger
or any other transactions described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

        Under Delaware law, if the merger is completed, record holders of B/E Aerospace common stock who do not vote in favor of
the adoption of the merger agreement and who otherwise properly exercise their appraisal rights will be entitled to seek appraisal
for, and obtain payment in cash for the judicially determined fair value of, their shares of B/E Aerospace common stock, in lieu of
receiving the merger consideration. The "fair value" could be higher or lower than, or the same as, the merger consideration. The
relevant provisions of the DGCL are included as Annex E to this joint proxy statement/prospectus. B/E Aerospace stockholders are
encouraged to read these provisions carefully and in their entirety. Moreover, due to the complexity of the procedures for exercising
the right to seek appraisal, B/E Aerospace stockholders who are considering exercising that right are encouraged to seek the advice
of legal counsel. Failure to comply strictly with these provisions may result in loss of the right of appraisal. For a more complete
description of B/E Aerospace stockholders' appraisal rights, see "The Merger—Appraisal Rights" beginning on page 119.

Regulatory Approvals 

        The merger is subject to the requirements of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, which is
referred to as the HSR Act, which prevents Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace from completing the merger until required
information and materials are furnished to the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice, which is referred to as the DOJ, and
the Federal Trade Commission, which is referred to as the FTC, and the HSR Act waiting period is terminated or expires. On
November 7, 2016, Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace filed the requisite notification and report forms under the HSR Act with
the DOJ and the FTC. The required 30-day waiting period under the HSR Act expired at 11:59 Eastern time on December 7, 2016.

        The merger is also subject to antitrust review by governmental authorities in several foreign jurisdictions in which the
companies have a sufficient market presence to require filings. The parties are making filings in Europe, China, the Philippines,
South Korea and Turkey.

        Although we expect that all regulatory clearances and approvals will be obtained, we cannot assure you that these clearances
and approvals will be timely obtained or obtained under the terms of the merger agreement at all or that the granting of these
clearances and approvals will not involve the imposition of additional conditions on the completion of the merger, including the
requirement to divest assets, or require changes to the terms of the merger agreement. These conditions or changes could result in
the conditions to the merger not being satisfied.

        For a more complete description of regulatory approvals relating to the merger, see "The Merger—Regulatory
Approvals Required for the Merger" beginning on page 116.

Litigation Relating to the Merger

        In connection with the merger, three putative class action lawsuits were filed by three different purported B/E Aerospace
stockholders. The lawsuits allege, among other things, that the Form S-4 filed by Rockwell Collins on November 23, 2016 misstates
and/or omits material information. Two of the lawsuits assert claims against B/E Aerospace and the members of the B/E Aerospace
Board; the other lawsuit asserts claims against B/E Aerospace, the members of the B/E Aerospace Board, Rockwell Collins and
Merger Sub. The lawsuits seek to enjoin the merger, to recover damages and other relief. For a more detailed description of
litigation in connection with the merger, see "The Merger—Litigation Relating to the Merger" beginning on page 124.

Conditions to Completion of the Merger 

        The parties expect to complete the merger after all of the conditions to the merger in the merger agreement are satisfied or
waived, including after Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace receive stockholder approval of the Share Issuance proposal and the
Merger proposal, respectively, at their respective special meetings and receive all required regulatory approvals. The parties
currently expect to complete the transaction in the spring of 2017. However, it is possible that factors outside of each company's
control could require them to complete the transaction at a later time or not to complete it at all.

Conditions to the Obligations of the Parties to Complete the Merger

        The obligations of each of Rockwell Collins, Merger Sub and B/E Aerospace to complete the merger are subject to the
satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by law) waiver of the following conditions:

Merger" beginning on page 148.

Treatment of B/E Aerospace's Existing Debt; Financing 

        In connection with the merger, the parties intend to terminate B/E Aerospace's existing revolving credit facility and term loan
facility.

        Rockwell Collins' obligation to complete the merger is not conditioned upon its obtaining financing. Rockwell Collins
anticipates that approximately $3.6 billion will be required to pay the aggregate cash portion of the merger consideration to the
B/E Aerospace stockholders and approximately $2.1 billion to refinance B/E Aerospace's existing debt. Rockwell Collins intends to
fund the cash component of the merger consideration and refinance the acquired debt through new sources of debt financing. Upon
the closing of the acquisition, Rockwell Collins expects to have approximately $8 billion in total debt.

        For a more complete description of sources of funding for the merger, see "The Merger—Source of Funding for the Merger"
beginning on page 123.

Timing of the Transaction 

        The transaction is expected to be completed in the spring of 2017. However, it is possible that factors outside of each
company's control could require them to complete the merger at a later time or not to complete the merger at all.

No Solicitation 

        In the merger agreement, each of Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace has agreed:

• to immediately cease and terminate, and to use reasonable best efforts to cause its officers, directors and other
representatives to cease and terminate all existing discussions, negotiations and communications with any person or
entity with respect to acquisition proposals from any person or entity, including proposals to acquire 20% or more of
such party's voting power, consolidated assets, revenues or net income, as further described under "The Merger
Agreement—Covenants and Agreements—No Solicitation" beginning on page 141; 

• not to, and not to authorize any of its representatives to, directly or indirectly initiate, seek, solicit, knowingly
encourage or knowingly induce or take any other action reasonably expected to lead to an acquisition proposal,
engage in negotiations or discussions with or provide any non-public information to any person or entity relating to
an acquisition proposal or grant any waiver or release under any standstill or other agreement (unless either party's
board of directors determines in good faith that refusing to grant such waiver or release would be inconsistent with
its fiduciary duties under applicable law); 

• not to provide access (and within one business day of the date of the merger agreement, to terminate any such
access) to any third party to any data room containing any of such party's information; and 

• within two business days of the date of the merger agreement, to demand the return or destruction of all confidential,
non-public information and materials and all other information and materials related to any acquisition proposal that
have been provided to third parties that have entered into confidentiality agreements relating to a possible acquisition
proposal with the referenced party or any of its subsidiaries.

        The merger agreement includes certain exceptions to the non-solicitation covenant such that, prior to obtaining the
B/E Aerospace Stockholder Approval or the Rockwell Collins Stockholder Approval, as applicable, the parties may take actions
prohibited by the above limitations regarding an unsolicited acquisition proposal. Also, the applicable party's board of directors
may, subject to complying with certain specified procedures, including providing the other party with a chance to negotiate, and, in
certain circumstances, payment of a termination fee as described below, (i) change its recommendation in favor of the merger and

        In no event will Rockwell Collins or B/E Aerospace be required to pay a termination fee if such party has already paid a
termination fee, and no termination fee will be payable more than once.

        In addition to the termination fees described above, the merger agreement provides for expense reimbursements in connection
with the termination of the merger agreement under the following circumstances:

• B/E Aerospace will reimburse Rockwell Collins for reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses
incurred by Rockwell Collins, including all fees and expenses incurred by Rockwell Collins in connection with the
financing of the merger and the fees and expenses of advisors incurred by Rockwell Collins in connection with the
merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, in an amount not to exceed
$85 million: 

• if the merger agreement is terminated (i) by either Rockwell Collins or B/E Aerospace due to failure of
B/E Aerospace to obtain the B/E Aerospace Stockholder Approval, (ii) by B/E Aerospace pursuant to the
B/E Aerospace Tax Opinion Termination Right, (iii) by Rockwell Collins pursuant to the Rockwell Collins
Breach Termination Right or (iv) by Rockwell Collins pursuant to the Rockwell Collins Tax Opinion
Termination Right and, in the case of this clause (iv), either (1) a breach or inaccuracy in the B/E Aerospace
Signing Representation Letter causes the Rockwell Collins Tax Advisor Opinion not to be delivered (and
either the B/E Aerospace Tax Advisor Opinion or the opinion of the additional tax counsel is not delivered
for any reason) or (2) B/E Aerospace fails to comply with its obligations under the covenant in the merger
agreement related to certain tax matters. 

• Rockwell Collins will reimburse B/E Aerospace for reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses
incurred by B/E Aerospace, including all fees and expenses of advisors incurred by B/E Aerospace in connection
with the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, in an amount not to exceed
$56 million: 

• if the merger agreement is terminated by either Rockwell Collins or B/E Aerospace due to failure of
Rockwell Collins to obtain the Rockwell Collins Stockholder Approval.

        Payment of the expense reimbursements by either party does not affect the other party's right to receive any applicable
termination fees, but does reduce on a dollar-for-dollar basis any termination fee that becomes due and payable to such other party
under the terms of the merger agreement.

        The right of either party to receive the applicable termination fee and expense reimbursement, in circumstances in which the
applicable termination fee or expense reimbursement is owed, is the sole and exclusive monetary remedy of the receiving party
against the other party and its subsidiaries and representatives for all losses and damages suffered as a result of the failure of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement to be consummated or failure to perform under the merger
agreement or otherwise, except (i) in the event of (a) termination due to failure of a party to include its required recommendation
under the merger agreement in this joint proxy statement/prospectus or due to breach of such party's non-solicitation obligations,
(b) intentional breach of the covenant in the merger agreement related to certain tax matters or fraudulent breach of either party's
representations and warranties under the merger agreement related to their respective tax representation letters or (c) the right of
each party to receive the applicable termination fee less the applicable expense reimbursement under certain circumstances and
(ii) that any party that fails to timely pay any termination fee or expense reimbursement due pursuant to the merger agreement will
be obligated to pay any costs and expenses in connection with any suit brought by the other party that results in a judgment against
the delinquent party for the payment of such termination fee and expense reimbursement.

SELECTED UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL INFORMATION

        The following selected unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information gives effect to the merger and the
related financing transactions as described in the section entitled "Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial
Statements" beginning on page 173 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus. The selected unaudited pro forma condensed combined
balance sheet data as of September 30, 2016 give effect to the merger as if it occurred on September 30, 2016, which was the end of
Rockwell Collins' 2016 fiscal year. The selected unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of income data for the year
ended September 30, 2016, give effect to the merger as if it occurred on October 1, 2015, the first day of Rockwell Collins' 2016
fiscal year. Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace have different fiscal year ends. As a consequence, the B/E Aerospace historical
results have been aligned to more closely conform to the fiscal periods of Rockwell Collins as further described in the section
entitled "Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements" beginning on page 173 of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus.

        The selected pro forma data have been derived from, and should be read in conjunction with, the more detailed unaudited pro
forma condensed combined financial statements of the combined company appearing elsewhere in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus and the accompanying notes to the pro forma financial statements. In addition, the pro forma financial
statements were based on, and should be read in conjunction with, the historical consolidated financial statements and related notes
of Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace for the applicable periods, which have been incorporated in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus by reference. See the sections entitled "Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements" and
"Where You Can Find More Information" beginning on page 173 and page 198, respectively, of this joint proxy

COMPARATIVE HISTORICAL AND UNAUDITED PRO FORMA PER SHARE DATA

        The following table summarizes unaudited per share data (i) for Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace on a historical basis,
(ii) for Rockwell Collins on a pro forma combined basis giving effect to the merger and (iii) on a pro forma combined equivalent
basis calculated by multiplying the pro forma combined data by an exchange ratio of 0.3101, which is calculated as if the Rockwell
Collins stock price were equal to the Rockwell Collins' closing stock price on January 26, 2017, the most recent practicable date for
which such information was available. The actual exchange ratio will be adjusted to reflect changes in the price of Rockwell Collins
common stock prior to the closing of the merger as described in the section entitled "The Merger Agreement—Merger
Consideration to be Received by B/E Aerospace Stockholders" beginning on page 128 this joint proxy statement/prospectus. These
computations exclude the $34.10 per share cash portion of the merger consideration.

        The unaudited pro forma per share information reflects the merger and related transactions as if they had occurred on
October 1, 2015 in the case of income from continuing operations per share, and as if they had occurred on September 30, 2016 in
the case of book value per share. The information in the table is based on, and should be read together with, the historical financial
information of Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace which is incorporated by reference in this joint proxy statement/prospectus and
the financial information contained under "Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements," "Selected Historical
Financial Data—Selected Historical Consolidated Financial Data of Rockwell Collins" and "Selected Historical Financial Data—
Selected Historical Consolidated Financial Data of B/E Aerospace" beginning on page 173, page 35, and page 37, respectively. See
the section entitled "Where You Can Find More Information" beginning on page 198 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

        The unaudited pro forma combined per share data is presented for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of
actual or future financial position or results of operations that would have been realized if the proposed merger had been completed
as of the dates indicated or will be realized upon the completion of the proposed merger. The summary pro forma information is
preliminary, based on initial estimates of the fair value of assets acquired (including intangible assets) and liabilities assumed, and is
subject to change as more information regarding the fair values are obtained, which changes could be materially different than the
initial estimates.

        Both Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace declared and paid dividends during the periods presented. For more information on

Comparison of Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace Market Prices and Implied Value of Merger Consideration 

        The following table sets forth the closing sale price per share of Rockwell Collins common stock and B/E Aerospace common
stock as reported on the NYSE and the NASDAQ, respectively, as of October 21, 2016, the last trading day prior to the public
announcement of the merger and on January 26, 2017, the last practicable trading day before the filing of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus with the SEC. The table also shows the estimated implied value of the per share consideration proposed for
each share of B/E Aerospace common stock as of the same two days. This implied value was calculated by multiplying the closing
prices of shares of Rockwell Collins common stock on those dates by the exchange ratio of 0.3101 (based on the closing price of
Rockwell Collins' common stock as of the close of business on January 26, 2017, the most recent practicable date for which such
information was available) and adding the cash portion of the merger consideration of $34.10 per share, without interest. The
market prices of Rockwell Collins common stock and B/E Aerospace common stock will fluctuate before the special meetings and
before the merger is completed. The exchange ratio may be adjusted to reflect changes in the Rockwell Collins stock price prior to
the closing of the merger, and the number of shares of Rockwell Collins common stock to be issued as part of the stock
consideration (and, in turn, the value of the merger consideration to be received in exchange for each share of B/E Aerospace
common stock) may fluctuate with the market value of Rockwell Collins common stock until the last trading day before the merger
is complete.

        The market prices of Rockwell Collins common stock and B/E Aerospace common stock have fluctuated since the date of the
announcement of the merger agreement and will continue to fluctuate from the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus to the
date of the Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace special meetings and the date the merger is completed and thereafter. No assurance
can be given concerning the market prices of Rockwell Collins common stock or B/E Aerospace common stock before completion
of the merger or Rockwell Collins common stock after completion of the merger. The exchange ratio may be adjusted to reflect
changes in the price of the Rockwell Collins common stock prior to the closing of the merger, and the number of shares of Rockwell
Collins common stock to be issued as part of the stock consideration (and, in turn, the value of the merger consideration to be
received in exchange for each share of B/E Aerospace common stock) when received by B/E Aerospace stockholders after the
merger is completed could be greater than, less than or the same as shown in the table above. Accordingly, stockholders are advised
to obtain current market quotations for Rockwell Collins common stock and B/E Aerospace common stock in deciding whether to
vote for adoption of the merger agreement or the issuance of shares of Rockwell Collins common stock, as applicable.

RISK FACTORS 

        In addition to the other information included and incorporated by reference into this joint proxy statement/prospectus, including,
among other things, the matters addressed in the section entitled "Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" beginning on
page 44, you should carefully consider the following risk factors before deciding whether to vote for the proposal to adopt the merger
agreement, in the case of B/E Aerospace stockholders, or for the proposal to approve the issuance of the shares of Rockwell Collins
common stock forming part of the merger consideration, in the case of Rockwell Collins stockholders. In addition, you should read and
consider the risks associated with each of the businesses of B/E Aerospace and Rockwell Collins because these risks will relate to the
combined company following the completion of the merger. Descriptions of some of these risks can be found in the Rockwell Collins
annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 and the B/E Aerospace annual report on Form 10-K for the
fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, as such risks may be updated or supplemented in each company's subsequently filed Quarterly
Reports on Form 10-Q or Current Reports on Form 8-K, which are incorporated by reference into this joint proxy statement/prospectus.
You should also consider the other information in this document and the other documents incorporated by reference into this document.
See the section entitled "Where You Can Find More Information" beginning on page 198.

Risks Related to the Merger 

The merger is subject to conditions, some or all of which may not be satisfied, or completed on a timely basis, if at all. Failure to
complete the merger could have material adverse effects on Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace.

        The completion of the merger is subject to a number of conditions, including, among other things, receipt of the Rockwell Collins
Stockholder Approval, receipt of the B/E Aerospace Stockholder Approval and receipt of certain other regulatory approvals, which make
the completion and timing of the completion of the merger uncertain. See the section entitled "The Merger Agreement—Conditions to the
Merger," beginning on page 148, for a more detailed discussion. Also, either Rockwell Collins or B/E Aerospace may terminate the
merger agreement if the merger has not been consummated by 5:00 p.m. (New York time) on October 21, 2017, except that this right to
terminate the merger agreement will not be available to any party whose failure to perform or comply with any of its obligations under the
merger agreement has been the principal cause of or resulted in the failure of the closing of the merger to have occurred on or before that
date.

        If the merger is not completed, Rockwell Collins' and B/E Aerospace's respective ongoing businesses may be materially adversely
affected and, without realizing any of the benefits of having completed the merger, Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace will be subject to
a number of risks, including the following:

• the market price of Rockwell Collins common stock or B/E Aerospace common stock could decline; 

• Rockwell Collins or B/E Aerospace could owe substantial termination fees to the other party under certain circumstances;

• Rockwell Collins or B/E Aerospace may experience negative reactions from the financial markets or from their respective
customers or employees; and 

• Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace may be required to pay their respective costs relating to the merger, such as legal,
accounting, financial advisory and printing fees, whether or not the merger is completed.

        In addition, if the merger is not completed, Rockwell Collins or B/E Aerospace could be subject to litigation related to any failure to
complete the merger or related to any enforcement proceeding commenced against Rockwell Collins or B/E Aerospace to perform their
respective obligations under the merger agreement. The materialization of any of these risks could materially and adversely impact
Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace's respective ongoing businesses.

        Similarly, delays in the completion of the merger could, among other things, result in additional transaction costs, loss of revenue or
other negative effects associated with uncertainty about completion of the merger.

The merger agreement contains provisions that limit each party's ability to pursue alternatives to the merger, could discourage a
potential competing acquiror of either Rockwell Collins or B/E Aerospace from making a favorable alternative transaction proposal
and, in specified circumstances, could require either party to pay substantial termination fees to the other party.

        The merger agreement contains certain provisions that restrict each of Rockwell Collins' and B/E Aerospace's ability to, among other
things, initiate, seek, solicit, knowingly encourage, knowingly induce or take any other action reasonably expected to lead to, or engage in
negotiations or discussions relating to, or approve or recommend, any third-party acquisition proposal. Further, even if the Rockwell
Collins Board withdraws or qualifies its recommendation with respect to the issuance of Rockwell Collins common stock forming part of
the merger consideration or if the B/E Aerospace Board withdraws or qualifies its recommendation with respect to the adoption of the
merger agreement, in each case as permitted by the merger agreement, unless the merger agreement has also been terminated in
accordance with its terms, Rockwell Collins or B/E Aerospace, as the case may be, will still be required to submit each of the Share
Issuance proposal and the Merger proposal, as applicable, to a vote at their special meeting of stockholders. In addition, following receipt
by Rockwell Collins or B/E Aerospace, as the case may be, of any third-party acquisition proposal that constitutes a "superior proposal,"
the other party will have an opportunity to offer to modify the terms of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement before the
board of directors of the receiving party may withdraw or qualify its recommendation with respect to the Share Issuance proposal or the
Merger proposal, as applicable, in favor of such superior proposal, as described further under "The Merger Agreement—Covenants and
Agreements—No Solicitation" beginning on page 141.

        In some circumstances, upon termination of the merger agreement, Rockwell Collins could be required to pay a termination fee of
$300 million to B/E Aerospace and B/E Aerospace could be required to pay a termination fee of $200 million to Rockwell Collins. For
further discussion, see the section entitled "The Merger Agreement—Termination;—Effect of Termination;—Termination Fees and
Expense Reimbursements" beginning on page 152.

        These provisions could discourage a potential third-party acquiror or merger partner that might have an interest in acquiring all or a
significant portion of Rockwell Collins or B/E Aerospace or pursuing an alternative transaction from considering or proposing such a
transaction, even if it were prepared to pay consideration with a higher per share cash or market value than the per share cash or market
value proposed to be received or realized in the merger. In particular, a termination fee, if applicable, may be substantial, and could result
in a potential third-party acquiror or merger partner proposing to pay a lower price to the Rockwell Collins stockholders or B/E Aerospace
stockholders than it might otherwise have proposed to pay absent such a fee.

        If the merger agreement is terminated and either Rockwell Collins or B/E Aerospace determines to seek another business
combination, Rockwell Collins or B/E Aerospace, as applicable, may not be able to negotiate a transaction with another party on terms
comparable to, or better than, the terms of the merger.

The merger is subject to the expiration or termination of applicable waiting periods and the receipt of approvals, consents or
clearances from regulatory authorities that may impose conditions that could have an adverse effect on B/E Aerospace, Rockwell
Collins or the combined company or, if not obtained, could prevent completion of the merger.

        Before the merger may be completed, any applicable waiting period (and any extension thereof) under the HSR Act relating to the
consummation of the merger must have expired or been terminated, and any authorization or consent from a governmental authority
required to be obtained with respect to the merger in certain other applicable foreign antitrust laws must have been obtained. In deciding
whether to grant the required regulatory authorization or consent, the relevant governmental entities will consider the effect of the merger
on competition within their relevant jurisdiction. The terms and conditions of the authorizations and consents that are granted may impose
requirements, limitations or costs or place restrictions on the conduct of the combined company's business. Under the merger agreement,
Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace have agreed to use their reasonable best efforts to obtain such authorizations and consents and
therefore may be required to comply with conditions or limitations imposed by governmental authorities, except that Rockwell Collins will
not be required to agree to sell, divest, lease, license, transfer, dispose of or otherwise encumber or impair its ability to own or operate any
of its or B/E Aerospace's assets or properties if such action would require the divestiture or holding separate of any assets of Rockwell
Collins or B/E Aerospace or any of their subsidiaries representing more than $175 million of annual revenue generated in the 2015
calendar year.

        In addition, regulators may impose conditions, terms, obligations or restrictions in connection with their authorization of or consent to
the merger, and such conditions, terms, obligations or restrictions may delay completion of the merger or impose additional material costs
on or materially limit the revenues of the combined company following the completion of the merger or may hinder the anticipated
benefits of the merger. There can be no assurance that regulators will choose not to impose such conditions, terms, obligations or
restrictions, and, if imposed, such conditions, terms, obligations or restrictions may delay or lead to the abandonment of the merger. For a
more detailed description of the regulatory review process, see the section entitled "The Merger—Regulatory Approvals Required for the
Merger" beginning on page 116.

The value of the stock portion of the merger consideration is subject to changes based on fluctuations in the value of Rockwell Collins
common stock, and B/E Aerospace stockholders may receive stock consideration with a value that, at the time received, is less than
$27.90 per share of B/E Aerospace common stock.

        The market value of Rockwell Collins common stock will fluctuate during the period before the date of the Rockwell Collins and B/E
Aerospace special meetings, during the 20 trading day period that the exchange ratio will be based upon, and the time between the last day
of the 20 trading day period and the time B/E Aerospace stockholders receive merger consideration in the form of Rockwell Collins
common stock, as well as thereafter.

        Upon completion of the merger, each issued and outstanding share of B/E Aerospace common stock will be converted into the right
to receive the merger consideration, which is equal to $34.10 in cash, without interest, and a fraction of a share of Rockwell Collins
common stock having a value equal to $27.90, subject to adjustment based upon a two-way collar mechanism as described below. If the
Rockwell Collins stock price is greater than or equal to $77.41 and less than or equal to $89.97, the exchange ratio will be equal to the
quotient of (i) $27.90 divided by (ii) the Rockwell Collins stock

price, which, in each case, will result in the stock consideration having a value equal to $27.90. If Rockwell Collins stock price is greater
than $89.97, the exchange ratio will be fixed at 0.3101 and the value of the stock consideration will be more than $27.90, and if the
Rockwell Collins stock price is less than $77.41, the exchange ratio will be fixed at 0.3604 and the value of the stock consideration will be
less than $27.90. Accordingly, the actual number of shares and the value of Rockwell Collins common stock delivered to B/E Aerospace
stockholders will depend on the Rockwell Collins stock price, and the value of the shares of Rockwell Collins common stock delivered for
each such share of B/E Aerospace common stock may be greater than, less than or equal to $27.90.

        It is impossible to accurately predict the market price of Rockwell Collins common stock at the effective time or during the period
over which the Rockwell Collins stock price is calculated and therefore impossible to accurately predict the number or value of the shares
of Rockwell Collins common stock that B/E Aerospace stockholders will receive in the merger. You should obtain current market
quotations for shares of Rockwell Collins common stock.

Each party is subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the proposed merger is pending, which could
adversely affect each party's business and operations.

        In connection with the pendency of the merger, it is possible that some customers, suppliers and other persons with whom Rockwell
Collins or B/E Aerospace has a business relationship may delay or defer certain business decisions or might decide to seek to terminate,
change or renegotiate their relationships with Rockwell Collins or B/E Aerospace, as the case may be, as a result of the merger, which
could negatively affect Rockwell Collins' or B/E Aerospace's respective revenues, earnings and cash flows, as well as the market price of
Rockwell Collins common stock or B/E Aerospace common stock, regardless of whether the merger is completed.

        Under the terms of the merger agreement, B/E Aerospace is subject to certain restrictions on the conduct of its business prior to
completing the merger which may adversely affect its ability to execute certain of its business strategies, including the ability in certain
cases to enter into or amend contracts, acquire or dispose of assets, incur indebtedness or incur capital expenditures. Such limitations could
adversely affect B/E Aerospace's business and operations prior to the completion of the merger.

        Under the terms of the merger agreement, Rockwell Collins is subject to a more limited set of restrictions on the conduct of its
business prior to completing the merger which may adversely affect its ability to execute certain of its business strategies, including the
ability in certain cases to amend its organizational documents, pay dividends and issue shares of Rockwell Collins common stock. Such
limitations could adversely affect Rockwell Collins' business and operations prior to the completion of the merger.

        Each of the risks described above may be exacerbated by delays or other adverse developments with respect to the completion of the
merger.

Uncertainties associated with the merger may cause a loss of management personnel and other key employees which could adversely
affect the future business and operations of the combined company.

        Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace are dependent on the experience and industry knowledge of their officers and other key
employees to execute their business plans. The combined company's success after the completion of the merger will depend in part upon
the ability of Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace to retain certain key management personnel and employees. Prior to completion of the
merger, current and prospective employees of Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace may experience uncertainty about their roles within
the combined company following the completion of the merger, which may have an adverse effect on the ability of each of Rockwell
Collins and B/E Aerospace to attract or retain key management and other key personnel. In addition, no assurance can be given that the
combined company will be able to attract or retain key management personnel and other key

employees of Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace to the same extent that Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace have previously been able
to attract or retain their own employees.

Litigation filed against Rockwell Collins, B/E Aerospace, Merger Sub and the members of the B/E Aerospace Board could prevent or
delay the consummation of the merger or result in the payment of damages following completion of the merger.

        In connection with the merger, three putative class action lawsuits were filed by three different purported B/E Aerospace
stockholders. Two of the lawsuits assert claims against B/E Aerospace and the members of the B/E Aerospace Board; the other lawsuit
asserts claims against B/E Aerospace, the members of the B/E Aerospace Board, Rockwell Collins and Merger Sub. The lawsuits seek to
enjoin the merger, recover damages and other relief. For a more detailed description of litigation in connection with the merger, see "The
Merger—Litigation Relating to the Merger."

        The outcome of these lawsuits is uncertain. One of the conditions to the closing of the merger is that no governmental authority has
issued or entered any order after the date of the merger agreement having the effect of enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the
consummation of the merger or the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, and these lawsuits seek an order enjoining
consummation of the merger. If the cases are not resolved, these lawsuits could prevent or delay completion of the merger and result in
substantial costs to Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace, including, but not limited to, costs associated with the indemnification of
directors and officers. The defense or settlement of any lawsuit or claim that remains unresolved at the time the merger is completed may
adversely affect Rockwell Collins' and B/E Aerospace's business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information in this joint proxy statement/prospectus is presented for
illustrative purposes only and may not be reflective of the operating results and financial condition of the combined company following
completion of the merger.

        The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information in this joint proxy statement/prospectus is presented for
illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of what the combined company's actual financial position or results of
operations would have been had the merger been completed on the dates indicated. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined
financial information is subject to a number of assumptions, and does not take into account any synergies related to the proposed
transaction. Further, the combined company's actual results and financial position after the merger may differ materially and adversely
from the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial data that is included in this joint proxy statement/prospectus. The unaudited
pro forma condensed combined financial information has been prepared with the expectation, as of the date of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus, that Rockwell Collins will be identified as the acquirer under GAAP and reflects adjustments based upon
preliminary estimates of the fair value of assets to be acquired and liabilities to be assumed. The final acquisition accounting will be based
upon the actual purchase price and the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the party that is determined to be the acquiree under GAAP
as of the date of the completion of the merger. In addition, subsequent to the closing date, there will be further refinements of the
acquisition accounting as additional information becomes available. Accordingly, the final acquisition accounting may differ materially
from the pro forma condensed combined financial information reflected in this document. For further discussion, see "Unaudited Pro
Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements" beginning on page 173.

Completion of the merger will trigger change in control or other provisions in certain agreements to which B/E Aerospace is a party,
which may have an adverse impact on the combined company's business and results of operations.

        The completion of the merger will trigger change in control and other provisions in certain agreements to which B/E Aerospace is a
party. If Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace are unable to negotiate waivers of those provisions, the counterparties may exercise their
rights and remedies under the agreements, potentially terminating the agreements or seeking monetary damages. Even if Rockwell Collins
and B/E Aerospace are able to negotiate waivers, the counterparties may require a fee for such waivers or seek to renegotiate the
agreements on terms less favorable to B/E Aerospace or the combined company. Any of the foregoing or similar developments may have
an adverse impact on the combined company's business and results of operations.

The Rockwell Collins common stock to be received by B/E Aerospace stockholders upon completion of the merger will have different
rights from shares of B/E Aerospace common stock.

        Upon completion of the merger, B/E Aerospace stockholders will no longer be stockholders of B/E Aerospace but will instead
become stockholders of Rockwell Collins and their rights as Rockwell Collins stockholders will be governed by the terms of Rockwell
Collins' certificate of incorporation and by-laws. The terms of Rockwell Collins' certificate of incorporation and by-laws are in some
respects materially different than the terms of B/E Aerospace's certificate of incorporation and by-laws, which currently govern the rights
of B/E Aerospace stockholders.

        For a more complete description of the different rights associated with shares of B/E Aerospace common stock and shares of
Rockwell Collins common stock, see "Comparison of Rights of Stockholders of Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace" beginning on
page 187.

The merger could result in significant liability to Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace if the merger causes the KLX spin-off to fail to
qualify for the KLX spin-off tax treatment.

        At the time of the KLX spin-off, B/E Aerospace received an opinion of Shearman & Sterling to the effect that, subject to the
limitations and assumptions set forth therein, the KLX spin-off that occurred in December 2014 will qualify for the KLX spin-off tax
treatment, which generally means a transaction tax-free to B/E Aerospace and its stockholders under the U.S. federal income tax rules for
spin-offs in Section 355 of the Code and related provisions. If, however, the KLX spin-off were to fail to qualify for the KLX spin-off tax
treatment, B/E Aerospace would be subject to tax on substantial gain as if B/E Aerospace had sold the KLX common stock in a taxable
sale for its fair market value at the time of the KLX spin-off. In addition, if the KLX spin-off failed to qualify for tax-free treatment, each
B/E Aerospace stockholder at the time of the KLX spin-off would be treated as if it had received a distribution from B/E Aerospace in an
amount equal to the fair market value of the KLX common stock that they received; this distribution generally would be taxed as a
dividend to the extent of the stockholder's pro rata share of B/E Aerospace's current and accumulated earnings and profits at the time of the
KLX spin-off and then treated as a non-taxable return of capital to the extent of the stockholder's basis in the B/E Aerospace common
stock and finally as capital gain from the sale or exchange of B/E Aerospace common stock.

        Under current U.S. federal income tax law, the KLX spin-off would fail to qualify for the KLX spin-off tax treatment if the KLX
spin-off was determined to have been used by B/E Aerospace principally as a device for the distribution of earnings and profits by, for
example, facilitating a taxable sale of the stock of B/E Aerospace or KLX through a planned or intended change-in-control transaction
identified prior to the KLX spin-off rather than principally to achieve one or more valid corporate business purposes. Furthermore, even if
the KLX spin-off were otherwise to qualify for tax-free treatment under Section 355 and related provisions of the Code, it would be
taxable to B/E

Table of Contents

Aerospace (but not to B/E Aerospace's stockholders) under Section 355(e) of the Code, if the KLX spin-off was determined to be part of a
plan (or series of related transactions) pursuant to which one or more persons acquire, directly or indirectly, stock representing a 50% or
greater interest in B/E Aerospace or KLX.

        If it is determined that the KLX spin-off fails to qualify for the KLX spin-off tax treatment as a result of the merger (for example, if
the merger is viewed as part of a plan or series of related transactions that includes the KLX spin-off or the KLX spin-off is found to have
been used principally as a device for the distribution of earnings and profits), or because of the failure of the KLX spin-off to initially
qualify for the KLX spin-off tax treatment, B/E Aerospace could incur significant tax liabilities. Because B/E Aerospace will be a wholly
owned subsidiary of Rockwell Collins following the consummation of the merger, any such tax liabilities of B/E Aerospace could also
adversely affect Rockwell Collins. If the KLX spin-off fails to qualify for the KLX spin-off tax treatment, this may also result in adverse
tax consequences to stockholders of B/E Aerospace at the time of the KLX spin-off because they would be taxed on the distribution of
KLX stock as described above.

        In connection with the signing of the merger agreement, Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace each received an opinion from their
respective counsel, Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP, which is referred to as Skadden, and Shearman & Sterling to the effect
that the merger will not cause the KLX spin-off to fail to qualify for the KLX spin-off tax treatment. The merger is conditioned upon
receipt by Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace of tax opinions to the same effect at the time of the consummation of the merger;
provided, however, that if either party's tax counsel indicates it is unwilling or unable to deliver a tax opinion at the time of the
consummation of the merger, the tax opinion condition of either Rockwell Collins or B/E Aerospace may be satisfied by such party's
receipt of similar tax opinions from both the other party's tax counsel and the additional tax counsel.

        The tax opinions received by Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace in connection with the signing of the merger agreement rely on
certain representations, assumptions, undertakings and covenants, and the opinions to be delivered at the consummation of the merger will
be based on similar representations, assumptions, undertakings and covenants, including representation letters from each of Rockwell
Collins and B/E Aerospace. These representations relate to, among other items, confirming the accuracy of the representations and
warranties originally made with respect to the KLX spin-off, along with compliance with covenants, the actions taken in pursuit of the
corporate business purposes of the KLX spin-off, the interaction of the parties, and business developments since the KLX spin-off. If any
of the factual representations in any of the representation letters, or any of the assumptions in the tax opinions is untrue or incomplete, an
undertaking or covenant is not complied with or the facts upon which a tax opinion is based are materially different from the facts at the
time of the merger, the opinions may not be valid. Moreover, opinions of counsel are not binding on the IRS or the courts. As a result, the
conclusions expressed in the tax opinions could be challenged by the IRS, and a court may sustain such a challenge. None of Rockwell
Collins, B/E Aerospace or KLX has requested a ruling from the IRS regarding the impact of the merger on the qualification of the KLX
spin-off for the KLX spin-off tax treatment.

Risks Relating to the Combined Company after Completion of the Merger 

The combined company may be unable to successfully integrate the businesses of Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace and realize the
anticipated benefits of the merger.

        The success of the merger will depend, in part, on the combined company's ability to successfully combine the businesses of
Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace, which currently operate as independent public companies, and realize the anticipated benefits,
including synergies, cost savings, innovation and operational efficiencies, from the combination. If the combined company is unable to
achieve these objectives within the anticipated time frame, or at all, the anticipated benefits may not be

Table of Contents

realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected and the value of the Rockwell Collins common stock may be harmed.
Additionally, credit rating agencies may take negative credit rating actions against the combined company if the credit metrics and other
rating criteria used by the credit rating agencies to rate debt no longer support Rockwell Collins' current credit ratings, which would be
negatively impacted due to the additional debt Rockwell Collins expects to incur to finance the transaction.

        The merger will involve the integration of B/E Aerospace's business with Rockwell Collins' existing business, which is a complex,
costly and time-consuming process. Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace have not previously completed a transaction comparable in size
or scope to the proposed merger. The integration of the two companies may result in material challenges, including, without limitation:

• the diversion of management's attention from ongoing business concerns and performance shortfalls at one or both of the
companies as a result of the devotion of management's attention to the merger; 

• managing a larger combined company; 

• maintaining employee morale and retaining key management and other employees; 

• the possibility of faulty assumptions underlying expectations regarding the integration process; 

• retaining existing business and operational relationships and attracting new business and operational relationships; 

• consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures and eliminating duplicative operations; 

• coordinating geographically separate organizations; 

• unanticipated issues in integrating information technology, communications and other systems; and 

• unforeseen expenses or delays associated with the merger.

        Many of these factors will be outside of the combined company's control and any one of them could result in delays, increased costs,
decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management's time and energy, which could materially affect the combined
company's financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

        Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace are currently permitted to conduct only limited planning for the integration of the two
companies following the merger and have not yet determined the exact nature of how the businesses and operations of the two companies
will be combined after the merger. The actual integration may result in additional and unforeseen expenses, and the anticipated benefits of
the integration plan may not be realized on a timely basis, if at all.

Rockwell Collins stockholders and B/E Aerospace stockholders will have a reduced ownership and voting interest after the merger and
will exercise less influence over the policies of the combined company than they now have on the policies of Rockwell Collins and B/E
Aerospace, respectively.

        Rockwell Collins stockholders presently have the right to vote in the election of the Rockwell Collins Board and on other matters
affecting Rockwell Collins. B/E Aerospace stockholders presently have the right to vote in the election of the B/E Aerospace Board and on
other matters affecting B/E Aerospace. Immediately after the merger is completed, it is expected that current Rockwell Collins
stockholders will own approximately 80.8% of the combined company's common stock outstanding and current B/E Aerospace
stockholders will own approximately 19.2% of the combined company's common stock outstanding.

        As a result, current Rockwell Collins stockholders and current B/E Aerospace stockholders will have less influence on the policies of
the combined company than they now have on the policies of Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace, respectively.

The future results of the combined company may be adversely impacted if the combined company does not effectively manage its
expanded operations following the completion of the merger.

        Following the completion of the merger, the size of the combined company's business will be significantly larger than the current size
of either Rockwell Collins' or B/E Aerospace's respective businesses. The combined company's ability to successfully manage this
expanded business will depend, in part, upon management's ability to design and implement strategic initiatives that address not only the
integration of two discrete companies, but also the increased scale and scope of the combined business with its associated increased costs
and complexity. There can be no assurances that the combined company will be successful or that it will realize the expected operating
efficiencies, cost savings and other benefits currently anticipated from the merger.

The combined company is expected to incur substantial expenses related to the completion of the merger and the integration of
Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace.

        There are a large number of processes, policies, procedures, operations, technologies and systems that must be integrated, including
purchasing, accounting and finance, sales, payroll, pricing, revenue recognition, marketing, employee benefits, legal and compliance,
strategic and financial planning, information technology and treasury. In addition, the businesses of Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace
will continue to maintain a presence in Cedar Rapids, Iowa and Wellington, Florida, respectively. The substantial majority of these costs
will be non-recurring expenses related to the merger (including financing of the merger and the refinancing of certain indebtedness),
facilities and systems consolidation costs. The combined company may incur additional costs to maintain employee morale and to retain
key employees. Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace will also incur transaction fees and costs related to formulating integration plans for
the combined business, and the execution of these plans may lead to additional unanticipated costs and time delays. Additionally, as a
result of the merger, rating agencies may take negative actions with regard to the combined company's credit ratings, which may increase
the combined company's costs in connection with the financing of the merger and its future cost of capital. These incremental transaction
and merger-related costs may exceed the savings the combined company expects to achieve from the elimination of duplicative costs and
the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses, particularly in the near term and in the event there are
material unanticipated costs.

The combined company will be significantly more leveraged than Rockwell Collins is currently.

        In connection with the merger, the combined company intends to seek approximately $5.9 billion in additional indebtedness. The
combined company will have consolidated indebtedness of approximately $8.0 billion, which is greater than the current indebtedness of
Rockwell Collins prior to the merger. The increased indebtedness and higher debt-to-total capitalization ratio of the combined company in
comparison to that of Rockwell Collins on a historical basis may have the effect, among other things, of reducing the flexibility of
Rockwell Collins to respond to changing business and economic conditions, requiring the combined company to use substantial amounts
of cash flow to acquire indebtedness, increasing borrowing costs and placing the combined company in a disadvantage compared to its
competitors with less leverage.

        For a more complete description of the financial impact of the combined company's indebtedness, see "Unaudited Pro Forma
Condensed Combined Financial Statements" beginning on page 173.

The financing arrangements that Rockwell Collins has entered into in connection with the merger contain restrictions and limitations
that could, under certain circumstances, significantly impact its ability to operate its business.

        Rockwell Collins intends to incur significant new indebtedness in connection with the merger. The agreements governing the
indebtedness that it will incur in connection with the merger contain covenants that, among other things, may, under certain circumstances,
place limitations on the dollar amounts paid or other actions relating to:

• consolidating with or merging into any other corporation or conveying or transferring its properties and assets substantially
as an entirety; 

• incurring secured debt; 

• entering into sale and leaseback transactions; and 

• designating subsidiaries as restricted or unrestricted.

        Such agreements also require the combined company to maintain a debt-to-capitalization ratio, which may further limit the combined
company's discretion in the operation of its business following the merger. Such agreements also contain additional restrictive covenants.
Various risks, uncertainties and events beyond the combined company's control could affect its ability to comply with the covenants
contained in its debt agreements. Failure to comply with any of the covenants in its existing or future financing agreements could result in
a default under those agreements and under other agreements containing cross-default provisions. A default would permit lenders to
accelerate the maturity of the debt under these agreements. Under these circumstances, Rockwell Collins might not have sufficient funds
or other resources to satisfy all of its obligations. In addition, the limitations imposed by financing agreements on the combined company's
ability to incur additional debt and to take other actions might significantly impair its ability to obtain other financing.

The market price of the combined company's common stock may be affected by factors different from those affecting the price of
Rockwell Collins or B/E Aerospace common stock.

        Upon completion of the merger, holders of Rockwell Collins common stock and B/E Aerospace common stock will be holders of
common stock of Rockwell Collins. As the businesses of Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace are different, the results of operations as
well as the price of the combined company's common stock may in the future be affected by factors different from those factors affecting
Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace as independent stand-alone companies. The combined company will face additional risks and
uncertainties that Rockwell Collins or B/E Aerospace may currently not be exposed to as independent companies.

The market price of Rockwell Collins' common stock may decline as a result of the merger.

        The market price of Rockwell Collins common stock may decline as a result of the merger if, among other things, the combined
company is unable to achieve the expected growth in earnings, or if the operational cost savings estimates in connection with the
integration of Rockwell Collins' and B/E Aerospace's businesses are not realized, or if the transaction costs related to the merger are
greater than expected, or if the financing related to the transaction is on unfavorable terms. The market price also may decline if the
combined company does not achieve the perceived benefits of the merger as rapidly or to the extent anticipated by financial or industry
analysts or if the effect of the merger on the combined company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows is not consistent
with the expectations of financial or industry analysts.

THE MERGER 

        The following is a discussion of the transaction and the material terms of the merger agreement between Rockwell Collins and B/E
Aerospace. You are urged to read carefully the merger agreement in its entirety, a copy of which is attached as Annex A to this joint proxy
statement/prospectus and incorporated by reference herein.

Background of the Merger 

        As part of B/E Aerospace's ongoing strategic planning process, members of the B/E Aerospace Board and members of B/E Aerospace
senior management periodically review and assess B/E Aerospace's operations, financial performance and competitive position, as well as
industry trends and potential strategic initiatives. In addition, members of B/E Aerospace senior management meet with members of the
B/E Aerospace Board in the ordinary course of business to discuss strategic alternatives in order to enhance stockholder value, including,
among other things, business combinations, acquisitions, divestitures, dividends and share repurchases. In connection with these reviews
and assessments, from time to time, the B/E Aerospace Board and members of B/E Aerospace senior management enlist the assistance of
financial advisors and outside legal advisors.

        As part of Rockwell Collins' ongoing strategic planning process, members of the Rockwell Collins Board and members of Rockwell
Collins senior management periodically review and assess Rockwell Collins' operations, financial performance and competitive position,
as well as industry trends and potential strategic initiatives to accelerate growth. As part of this process, Rockwell Collins considered a
number of alternatives to expand and strengthen its business. Given Rockwell Collins' strong position in the products and services that it
currently serves, Rockwell Collins determined to focus its consideration of possible growth opportunities on businesses that were adjacent
to Rockwell Collins current products and services. Rockwell Collins evaluated the possibility of expanding channels or capabilities, but
determined that adding products and services that would build on Rockwell Collins' existing strong customer relationships would be a
more efficient and lower risk path.

        Accordingly, in early 2015, Rockwell Collins undertook an initiative to assess the desirability of expanding the industry segments
addressed by Rockwell Collins. This initiative involved a strategic assessment of Rockwell Collins' capabilities and customer
relationships. Starting with approximately 80 companies that fit a general set of criteria, potential targets were analyzed against these
criteria. In considering potential acquisition targets, Rockwell Collins considered a number of factors and qualities with respect to potential
acquisition targets, including the technical differentiation of their respective products and services, the similarity of regulatory regimes in
which they operated, their leadership position in the segments that they served, their customer relationships and reputation and their full
product life cycle capability. At Rockwell Collins' board meeting in June 2015, a short list of potential targets, which included B/E
Aerospace, was presented. In subsequent board meetings in November 2015, April 2016 and June 2016, the candidates were evaluated
against changing market conditions and assessed fit. The short list of targets evaluated by the Rockwell Collins Board at these meetings
varied from 2 to 4 companies. Changes in the composition of the list were made based on Rockwell Collins' ongoing valuation analysis
and consideration of market conditions, as well as Rockwell Collins' assessment of the potential target's receptivity to a potential sale
transaction. B/E Aerospace remained an acquisition candidate of interest throughout this time.

        The following chronology sets forth a summary of the material events leading up to the execution of the merger agreement.

        In January 2016, a representative of a company, referred to as Party A, contacted Mr. Amin J. Khoury, Executive Chairman of B/E
Aerospace, seeking to arrange a meeting. In the ordinary course of business, B/E Aerospace senior management met with Party A from
time to time to discuss, generally, the ongoing business relationship between the parties. In advance of this particular meeting,

representatives of Party A requested to include a member of its business development team at such meeting, to which B/E Aerospace
senior management agreed. In mid-February 2016, Mr. Khoury met with representatives of Party A. During this meeting, the parties
discussed, among other things, their businesses, their business relationship and general market trends. Party A did not make any specific
inquiries with respect to a potential transaction involving B/E Aerospace at or following such meeting.

        In February 2016, based on Citigroup's prior financial advisory work for Rockwell Collins, representatives of Rockwell Collins
contacted representatives of Citigroup to inquire about exploring a potential transaction in the aircraft interiors industry. Following that
initial discussion on February 8, Rockwell Collins contacted representatives of Citigroup and expressed preliminary interest in exploring a
potential transaction with B/E Aerospace.

        In late February 2016, Mr. Jeffrey MacLauchlan, Senior Vice President of Corporate Development of Rockwell Collins, contacted
Mr. Joseph Lower, Chief Financial Officer of B/E Aerospace, to arrange a meeting. On February 29, 2016, Messrs. MacLauchlan and
Lower met to discuss market conditions and industry trends. In addition, Mr. MacLauchlan discussed the complementary nature of
Rockwell Collins' and B/E Aerospace's respective businesses. At the conclusion of the meeting, Messrs. MacLauchlan and Lower agreed
to stay in touch and to potentially continue their conversation at a future date. Following the meeting, Mr. Lower informed other members
of B/E Aerospace senior management about the meeting.

        In April 2016, a company, which, together with its parent company is referred to as Party B, called Mr. Khoury to arrange a meeting
that would include, among others, a senior executive of Party B. Mr. Khoury notified the B/E Aerospace Board of such request. On
May 11, 2016, representatives of B/E Aerospace senior management met with representatives of Party B to explore potential strategic
alternatives, including an investment in B/E Aerospace by Party B or a combination of B/E Aerospace and Party B. Shortly thereafter,
Party B informed B/E Aerospace senior management that it was not prepared to make an investment in, or further explore a strategic
transaction with, B/E Aerospace.

        Between February and June 2016, Rockwell Collins senior management continued to evaluate potential targets and their relative
merits. Rockwell Collins senior management provided a status report of this process to the Rockwell Collins Board at its April 2016
meeting. At the June 2016 meeting of the Rockwell Collins Board, Rockwell Collins senior management provided a further update on its
evaluation and recommended to the Rockwell Collins Board that Rockwell Collins engage more formally with B/E Aerospace to consider
the potential for a transaction.

        On or about June 27, 2016, Mr. Kelly Ortberg, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Rockwell Collins, contacted
Mr. Khoury telephonically. Mr. Khoury and Mr. Ortberg discussed the complementary nature of Rockwell Collins' and B/E Aerospace's
respective businesses, as well as the prospect of a potential transaction involving the two companies. At the conclusion of the
conversation, Mr. Ortberg advised that Mr. MacLauchlan would contact Mr. Lower to schedule a face-to-face meeting to continue the
discussions.

        On July 7, 2016, B/E Aerospace and Rockwell Collins executed a mutual non-disclosure agreement. Following execution of the
agreement, representatives of senior management of Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace scheduled a meeting for July 20, 2016.

        On July 20, 2016, representatives of senior management of B/E Aerospace (Messrs. Khoury and Lower and Mr. Werner Lieberherr,
President and Chief Executive Officer of B/E Aerospace) and Rockwell Collins (Messrs. Ortberg and MacLauchlan, and Mr. Patrick
Allen, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Rockwell Collins) met at B/E Aerospace's headquarters in Wellington, Florida
to discuss the prospect of a potential transaction involving the two companies. Each party presented portions of their investor relations
materials, which included publicly available information about each company's respective financial and operational results, business and
product lines. In addition, B/E Aerospace and Rockwell Collins discussed potential areas of cost and revenue synergies

that were identified by each party. Rockwell Collins expressed an interest in continuing discussions to further explore the potential
combination benefits. The parties agreed that if further discussions were held, advisors could be helpful in refining these estimates and
approaches.

        On July 28, 2016, the B/E Aerospace Board met in Boston, Massachusetts in connection with the regularly scheduled annual meeting
of stockholders of B/E Aerospace. At this meeting, among other matters, B/E Aerospace senior management provided an overview of the
recent interest expressed by Party A, Party B and Rockwell Collins in connection with a potential transaction involving B/E Aerospace.
Following conversations amongst the B/E Aerospace Board and B/E Aerospace senior management, the B/E Aerospace Board directed
B/E Aerospace senior management to explore potential strategic alternatives with assistance from independent financial advisors.

        Subsequent to the B/E Aerospace Board meeting, the parties agreed to meet to continue discussions and to include financial and legal
advisors going forward.

        On August 9, 2016, senior management of B/E Aerospace and Rockwell Collins met in New York to continue preliminary
discussions regarding a potential transaction involving the two companies and discussed the expectations for the meeting with advisors to
occur the following day.

        On August 10, 2016, representatives of senior management of B/E Aerospace and Rockwell Collins, together with representatives
from Shearman & Sterling LLP, which is referred to as Shearman & Sterling, outside counsel to B/E Aerospace, Citigroup, as financial
advisor to B/E Aerospace, Goldman Sachs, as financial advisor to B/E Aerospace, Skadden, outside counsel to Rockwell Collins, and J.P.
Morgan, as financial advisor to Rockwell Collins, met at the offices of Shearman & Sterling. At the meeting, representatives of senior
management of B/E Aerospace and Rockwell Collins discussed their respective businesses. In addition, B/E Aerospace senior
management discussed the financial outlook of B/E Aerospace and potential cost and revenue synergies that could be achieved in
connection with a potential combination of B/E Aerospace and Rockwell Collins. At the conclusion of the meeting, senior management of
B/E Aerospace and Rockwell Collins agreed to perform additional due diligence and financial analyses with their respective
representatives, and to meet again following such additional diligence and analyses to further explore the prospects of a potential
combination.

        On August 15, 2015, the executive committee of the Rockwell Collins Board met telephonically. At the meeting, Rockwell Collins
senior management provided the committee with an update on the potential acquisition of B/E Aerospace, including the meetings between
the two parties on August 9 and August 10, 2016.

        On August 16, 2016, the B/E Aerospace Board met telephonically. Present at the meeting were members of B/E Aerospace senior
management and representatives from Shearman & Sterling, Citigroup and Goldman Sachs. At the meeting, B/E Aerospace senior
management discussed the B/E Aerospace five-year plan that had previously been distributed to the B/E Aerospace Board and answered
questions from members of the B/E Aerospace Board regarding the assumptions and inputs of the plan. The five-year plan, which had
been prepared in connection with B/E Aerospace senior management's evaluation of a potential transaction with Rockwell Collins,
included information related to revenue, earnings before interest and income tax, earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortization and free cash flow for the periods set forth therein. B/E Aerospace senior management then provided an update with respect
to the ongoing discussions between B/E Aerospace and Rockwell Collins, including a report on the meetings between the two parties on
August 9 and August 10, 2016.

        Also at this meeting, representatives of Citigroup and Goldman Sachs discussed certain aspects of the transaction and advised the B/E
Aerospace Board that it was expected that any transaction would include consideration consisting of a significant Rockwell Collins stock
component. Representatives of Shearman & Sterling discussed with the B/E Aerospace Board, among other things, its fiduciary duties
under Delaware law in the context of a transaction process.

        Following these discussions, representatives of Citigroup and Goldman Sachs were then excused from the meeting to allow the B/E
Aerospace Board to discuss formally engaging both Citigroup and Goldman Sachs as joint financial advisors. Representatives from each
of Citigroup and Goldman Sachs were then asked to return to the meeting at separate times to answer specific questions about their
respective relationships with Rockwell Collins.

        At the conclusion of the meeting, the B/E Aerospace Board authorized B/E Aerospace senior management to proceed with
negotiations with Rockwell Collins and to provide the B/E Aerospace five-year plan to Rockwell Collins in order to facilitate further
discussions. In addition, the B/E Aerospace Board authorized B/E Aerospace senior management to formally retain both Citigroup and
Goldman Sachs as joint financial advisors in connection with the consideration and review of strategic alternatives by the B/E Aerospace
Board. On September 6, 2016, Citigroup and Goldman Sachs each executed engagement letters with B/E Aerospace to provide financial
advisory services to B/E Aerospace in connection with the consideration and review of strategic alternatives by the B/E Aerospace Board.

        On August 22, 2016, representatives of senior management of B/E Aerospace and Rockwell Collins met to further discuss the
prospect of a potential transaction. The parties also discussed their respective business plans, including each company's five-year plan, and
presented certain legal, financial and operational information to each other.

        On September 2, 2016, the corporate strategy and finance committee and the executive committee of the Rockwell Collins Board met
telephonically in a joint meeting. Present at the meeting were members of Rockwell Collins senior management and representatives from
Skadden and J.P. Morgan. At the meeting, Rockwell Collins senior management provided an update with respect to the potential
acquisition of B/E Aerospace, including a review of the process followed by Rockwell Collins senior management to identify suitable
acquisition candidates and a review of B/E Aerospace's financial and market profile, the impact of the potential acquisition on the
companies' combined business portfolio and potential cost synergies. Representatives of J.P. Morgan discussed J.P. Morgan's preliminary
financial analysis perspectives with respect to the potential transaction. Rockwell Collins senior management then reviewed with the
committees, and obtained their concurrence on, the terms of a proposed preliminary, non-binding indication of interest for the potential
transaction.

        Later on September 2, 2016, Rockwell Collins delivered a preliminary, non-binding indication of interest to B/E Aerospace, pursuant
to which Rockwell Collins proposed to acquire 100% of the common stock of B/E Aerospace for a per share purchase price of between
$58 and $60, to be paid 50% in cash and 50% in shares of Rockwell Collins common stock.

        On September 5, 2016, following preliminary discussions with B/E Aerospace senior management, representatives of Citigroup and
Goldman Sachs were directed to contact representatives of J.P. Morgan to inform J.P. Morgan that B/E Aerospace senior management
believed that the B/E Aerospace Board would likely view Rockwell Collins' proposal as not sufficiently attractive and would likely be
unwilling to engage in further discussions based on the valuation included in the proposal.

        On September 7, 2016, the B/E Aerospace Board met at the offices of Shearman & Sterling. Also present at the meeting were
members of B/E Aerospace senior management and representatives from Shearman & Sterling, Citigroup and Goldman Sachs. At the
meeting, B/E Aerospace senior management updated the B/E Aerospace Board with respect to the performance and outlook of
B/E Aerospace, other general market conditions that impact B/E Aerospace's businesses, and other factors viewed as relevant in
determining whether B/E Aerospace should further consider the Rockwell Collins proposal or other strategic alternatives. Following that
discussion, B/E Aerospace senior management, together with its financial advisors, provided a general summary of the September 2, 2016
non-binding indication of interest, and representatives of Citigroup and Goldman Sachs provided their

preliminary financial analysis with respect to B/E Aerospace and Rockwell Collins and an overview of preliminary discussions with J.P.
Morgan with respect to the proposal.

        The B/E Aerospace Board, together with senior management and its advisors, then engaged in a detailed discussion on how to best
facilitate a process that would be in the best interests of B/E Aerospace and its stockholders. The B/E Aerospace Board and B/E Aerospace
senior management discussed possible strategic alternatives available to maximize stockholder value, including executing B/E Aerospace's
organic business plan, alternative capital structures and capital deployment priorities, potential strategic acquisitions or an alternative
business combination. B/E Aerospace senior management and the B/E Aerospace Board then discussed the current environment in the
aerospace industry, including the trends in consolidation and competition, and the likely effect of these factors on B/E Aerospace.
Following these discussions, the B/E Aerospace Board did not believe that other strategic alternatives would likely be as attractive as a
potential transaction with Rockwell Collins (assuming more favorable terms could be negotiated).

        B/E Aerospace senior management then provided an overview of its prior discussions with Party A and Party B regarding a potential
transaction involving B/E Aerospace, and noted that neither such discussions resulted in an express or implied indication of interest from
Party A or Party B that such companies were prepared to pursue a potential transaction involving B/E Aerospace. The B/E Aerospace
Board then asked one of its directors that had a previous relationship with (and from time to time speaks to representatives of) a potential
strategic partner, referred to as Party C, to contact Party C to gauge its interest in a potential transaction involving B/E Aerospace.
Following the meeting and in response to the inquiry made by a member of the B/E Aerospace Board, Party C advised that it was not
interested in pursuing a transaction with B/E Aerospace.

        Representatives of Citigroup and Goldman Sachs then provided an overview of potential transaction partners (other than Rockwell
Collins) that may have both a strategic rationale and the financial wherewithal to consummate a transaction with B/E Aerospace. These
potential acquirers included companies currently serving the aerospace and defense markets as well as financial buyers. As part of these
discussions, the B/E Aerospace Board discussed whether other parties should be contacted in light of Rockwell Collins' proposal and
discussed the likelihood that any other parties would be interested in a strategic transaction involving B/E Aerospace on the same or
similar terms to the Rockwell Collins proposal. Based upon these discussions, the prior contacts with Party A and Party B (and subject to
the result of the inquiry to be made to Party C), and advice from the financial advisors, the B/E Aerospace Board determined that such
transaction partners would not likely be able to consummate a transaction with B/E Aerospace that would provide equal or greater value to
B/E Aerospace stockholders as compared to a potential transaction with Rockwell Collins (assuming more favorable terms could be
negotiated). As such, the B/E Aerospace Board determined not to expand its search for strategic alternatives with other third parties to
avoid the risk of losing momentum with what was viewed as the most attractive strategic alternative.

        The B/E Aerospace Board, together with B/E Aerospace senior management and its advisors, then engaged in an extensive discussion
regarding a potential transaction with Rockwell Collins. Following these discussions, the B/E Aerospace Board determined that Rockwell
Collins' proposal was, as then proposed, not yet sufficiently attractive from a financial point of view, but that further discussion with
Rockwell Collins was warranted. The B/E Aerospace Board authorized Citigroup and Goldman Sachs to advise J.P. Morgan that
B/E Aerospace found the Rockwell Collins proposal to be not sufficiently attractive and to provide guidance with respect to elements of
the proposal that would need to be improved.

        On September 8, 2016, representatives of Citigroup and Goldman Sachs advised representatives of J.P. Morgan of the outcome of the
B/E Aerospace Board meeting on September 7, 2016, and the need to improve the economic terms of the proposal by Rockwell Collins in
order for B/E Aerospace to further consider a potential combination.

        On September 14, 2016, the Rockwell Collins Board met in person for a regularly scheduled board meeting at Rockwell Collins'
headquarters in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Present at the meeting were members of Rockwell Collins senior management and representatives
from Skadden and J.P. Morgan. At the meeting, representatives of Skadden discussed with the Rockwell Collins Board, among other
things, its fiduciary duties under Delaware law in the context of a potential acquisition of B/E Aerospace. Rockwell Collins senior
management provided an update with respect to the potential acquisition of B/E Aerospace, including a review of the process followed by
management to identify suitable acquisition candidates and a review of B/E Aerospace's financial and market profile, the impact of the
potential acquisition on the companies' combined business portfolio and potential cost synergies. Rockwell Collins senior management
then presented preliminary valuation perspectives regarding B/E Aerospace and reviewed the terms of the preliminary, non-binding
indication of interest submitted to B/E Aerospace on September 2, 2016 and B/E Aerospace's response to such indication of interest.
Rockwell Collins senior management then reviewed with the Rockwell Collins Board possible revisions to the terms of its indication of
interest. The preliminary valuation perspectives regarding B/E Aerospace presented by Rockwell Collins senior management and the
possible revisions to the terms of the September 12, 2016 indication of interest included the merger consideration (including a cash and
stock mix) set forth in the merger agreement.

        On September 16, 2016, representatives of J.P. Morgan, at Rockwell Collins' direction, indicated to representatives of Citigroup and
Goldman Sachs that Rockwell Collins remained interested in a transaction and was prepared, subject to additional diligence, to negotiate a
transaction (i) in a price range of $61 to $62 per share, consisting of 50% cash and 50% shares of Rockwell Collins common stock, subject
to a price collar, (ii) with termination fees payable by each company under certain circumstances of $200 million and (iii) whereby one
director designated by B/E Aerospace would be appointed to the Rockwell Collins Board.

        Between September 16, 2016 and September 27, 2016, each of B/E Aerospace and Rockwell Collins continued to perform additional
due diligence on the other party, including a telephonic due diligence session that was held on September 25, 2016 among B/E Aerospace,
Rockwell Collins and their respective financial advisors.

        On September 20, 2016, members of the B/E Aerospace Board met telephonically with representatives of B/E Aerospace senior
management, Shearman & Sterling, Citigroup and Goldman Sachs, during which B/E Aerospace senior management, together with its
financial advisors, provided an update on negotiations between B/E Aerospace and Rockwell Collins and reviewed the revised terms of the
proposed transaction conveyed to Citigroup and Goldman by J.P. Morgan on September 16, 2016.

        On September 21, 2016, the compensation committee of the B/E Aerospace Board, consulted with Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP,
which is referred to as Gibson Dunn, regarding the possible engagement of Gibson Dunn as independent legal counsel to assist the
compensation committee in its evaluation of certain compensation matters related to a potential transaction. Specifically, as previously
disclosed in B/E Aerospace's public filings, since 2013, the B/E Aerospace Board and the compensation committee determined that they
would favorably consider the grant of transaction bonuses to the top named executive officers of B/E Aerospace in the event of a change in
control transaction, which bonuses would be in addition to amounts payable under the employment agreements with each executive. The
final determination of the structure and the specific amount of such bonuses was deferred by the compensation committee until such time
as B/E Aerospace might become involved in active transaction negotiations. The compensation committee determined to retain Gibson
Dunn, negotiated the terms of the Gibson Dunn engagement, and ultimately executed an engagement letter with Gibson Dunn on
September 30, 2016.

        On September 27, 2016, representatives of B/E Aerospace and Rockwell Collins senior management, as well as representatives from

and J.P. Morgan met at the offices of Shearman & Sterling. Following several rounds of negotiations, the parties reached a tentative
agreement, subject to further due diligence, the negotiation of other material transaction terms and the negotiation of acceptable definitive
documentation and board approval, on the following terms: (i) Rockwell Collins would acquire 100% of the common stock of
B/E Aerospace for $62 per share, with the consideration consisting of 50% cash and 50% shares of Rockwell Collins common stock,
subject to a two-way 7.5% collar; (ii) the termination fee payable by Rockwell Collins to B/E Aerospace under certain circumstances
would be $300 million and the termination fee payable by B/E Aerospace to Rockwell Collins under certain circumstances would be
$200 million; (iii) Rockwell Collins would add two directors designated by B/E Aerospace to the Rockwell Collins Board; and (iv) certain
B/E Aerospace compensation and benefits related matters. Based upon Rockwell Collins' director qualification requirements, John T.
Whates and Richard G. Hamermesh, both members of the B/E Aerospace Board, were identified as the likely B/E Aerospace designees.

        On September 27, 2016, members of Rockwell Collins senior management contacted Mr. Lieberherr to discuss Mr. Lieberherr's
willingness to remain with the combined company following the closing of the potential merger. Mr. Lieberherr retained Latham &
Watkins LLP, which is referred to as Latham & Watkins, to advise him regarding the terms of any future employment with the combined
company. Mr. Lieberherr subsequently informed B/E Aerospace senior management of the possibility that he would continue to work for
the combined company following closing of the potential merger.

        On September 29, 2016, B/E Aerospace opened a virtual data room and invited Rockwell Collins and its representatives to review
due diligence materials relating to B/E Aerospace included therein.

        On September 30, 2016, Skadden distributed an initial draft of the merger agreement to Shearman & Sterling.

        On September 30, 2016, J.P. Morgan, at Rockwell Collins' request, provided due diligence materials relating to Rockwell Collins to
Citigroup and Goldman Sachs, which in turn provided these materials to B/E Aerospace for due diligence review. The due diligence
materials included Rockwell Collin's strategic plan and related projections.

        Between September 30, 2016 and October 23, 2016, Rockwell Collins' and B/E Aerospace's legal counsels negotiated the terms and
conditions of the merger agreement, including, among other things, representations and warranties, covenants relating to conduct of
business and regulatory approvals, tax matters relating to the KLX spin-off, the treatment of various pre- and post-closing compensation-
related matters, closing conditions and termination rights and fees.

        Between October 1, 2016 and October 21, 2016, Mr. Lieberherr and his counsel, Latham & Watkins, negotiated terms of a future
employment agreement with Rockwell Collins and Skadden. In the course of these negotiations, Rockwell Collins and Mr. Lieberherr
discussed a possible leadership role in the combined company and ultimately agreed that Mr. Lieberherr would serve as an Executive Vice
President of Rockwell Collins and the Chief Operating Officer of Rockwell Collins' aircraft interior systems business unit. On October 21,
2016, Mr. Lieberherr and Rockwell Collins executed and delivered an employment agreement. Later that same day, Mr. Lieberherr notified
B/E Aerospace senior management that he had entered into such employment agreement.

        On October 3, 2016, Rockwell Collins hosted a telephonic due diligence call with B/E Aerospace and its financial advisors during
which Rockwell Collins answered various questions regarding Rockwell Collins, its strategic plan and projections and the related due
diligence materials previously provided.

        On October 5, 2016, J.P. Morgan, at Rockwell Collins' request, provided additional due diligence materials relating to Rockwell
Collins to Citigroup and Goldman Sachs, which in turn provided these

opinion, the merger consideration to be paid by Rockwell Collins was fair, from a financial point of view, to Rockwell Collins. (The oral
opinion was subsequently confirmed in writing by delivery of J.P. Morgan's written opinion dated October 23, 2016.) Following extensive
discussion, the Rockwell Collins Board unanimously approved the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby and
unanimously approved and adopted resolutions authorizing the transaction and related matters.

        On October 21, 2016, the B/E Aerospace Board met at the offices of Shearman & Sterling. B/E Aerospace senior management
updated the B/E Aerospace Board on the status of negotiations with Rockwell Collins and the results of the financial and legal due
diligence performed on Rockwell Collins. Representatives of Shearman & Sterling reviewed, among other things, the terms of the draft
merger agreement, a copy of which previously had been provided to the B/E Aerospace Board along with a summary of the material terms
of the merger agreement.

        Representatives of Citigroup and Goldman Sachs presented their updated financial analyses with respect to B/E Aerospace and
Rockwell Collins.

        Representatives of Citigroup then advised the B/E Aerospace Board that, based on Citigroup's current understandings and subject to
review of the execution version of the merger agreement and future developments, Citigroup expected to be able to render an opinion to
the B/E Aerospace Board, as of the date of the merger agreement and to the effect that, as of that date and based upon and subject to the
factors and assumptions described therein, the merger consideration to be paid to the holders (other than Rockwell Collins and its
affiliates) of outstanding shares of common stock of B/E Aerospace pursuant to the merger agreement is fair from a financial point of view
to such holders.

        Representatives of Goldman Sachs then advised the B/E Aerospace Board that, based on Goldman Sachs' current understandings and
subject to review of the execution version of the merger agreement and future developments, Goldman Sachs expected to be able to render
an opinion to the B/E Aerospace Board, as of the date of the merger agreement and to the effect that, as of that date and based upon and
subject to the factors and assumptions described therein, the merger consideration to be paid to the holders (other than Rockwell Collins
and its affiliates) of outstanding shares of common stock of B/E Aerospace pursuant to the merger agreement is fair from a financial point
of view to such holders.

        The B/E Aerospace Board and its advisors engaged in an extended discussion of the potential transaction and the proposed terms and
conditions of the merger agreement, considering a number of factors, including the comparative likelihood of consummation of the
potential transaction, the opportunities presented by the potential transaction, the recent and historical market prices for B/E Aerospace
common stock and Rockwell Collins common stock and the fact that the stock portion of the merger consideration would be subject to a
two-way 7.5% collar. The B/E Aerospace Board then reviewed the proposed resolutions authorizing the execution of the merger
agreement. After carefully considering the merger agreement and the proposed resolutions, it was the consensus of the B/E Aerospace
Board that the merger was in the best interests of B/E Aerospace's stockholders and, subject to an acceptable outcome in the negotiation of
the final issues under the merger agreement, including certain tax matters, the ability of a party to terminate the agreement and the
applicable fees payable in connection therewith, and certain other matters, the B/E Aerospace Board agreed that it was prepared to approve
and adopt such proposed resolutions and authorized B/E Aerospace senior management to continue to negotiate and to finalize the merger
agreement.

        On the evening of October 21, 2016, representatives of Shearman & Sterling, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, Skadden and J.P. Morgan
met at the offices of Shearman & Sterling to negotiate the final terms of the potential transaction.

        On the morning of October 22, 2016, the B/E Aerospace Board reconvened for a telephonic meeting with B/E Aerospace senior
management and Shearman & Sterling. At the meeting, B/E Aerospace senior management provided an update with respect to the
negotiation of the terms and

conditions of the potential transaction with Rockwell Collins, the remaining issues related thereto and the proposed resolution of such
issues. Following a discussion, the B/E Aerospace Board authorized B/E Aerospace senior management to continue to negotiate and
finalize the definitive transaction documents in accordance with the proposed terms discussed at the meeting.

        On October 22, 2016, representatives of senior management of B/E Aerospace and Rockwell Collins and their respective advisors
continued to negotiate the final terms and conditions of the merger agreement and related transactions.

        On the morning of October 23, 2016, Shearman & Sterling circulated an execution version of the merger agreement to the B/E
Aerospace Board, B/E Aerospace senior management, Citigroup and Goldman Sachs. Later that morning, by written consent, the B/E
Aerospace Board confirmed that the merger was in the best interests of B/E Aerospace's stockholders, unanimously approved and adopted
the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby and unanimously approved and adopted the resolutions authorizing the
transaction and related matters. The B/E Aerospace Board received a written opinion, dated October 23, 2016, from each of Citigroup and
Goldman Sachs to the effect that, as of that date and based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth in such opinion, the
merger consideration to be paid to the holders (other than Rockwell Collins and its affiliates) of outstanding shares of common stock of
B/E Aerospace pursuant to the merger agreement was fair from a financial point of view to such holders.

        On the same day, each of B/E Aerospace, Rockwell Collins and Merger Sub executed and delivered the merger agreement.
Thereafter, B/E Aerospace and Rockwell Collins issued a joint press release announcing the merger.

Rockwell Collins Board of Directors' Recommendations and Its Reasons for the Transaction 

        On October 21, 2016, the Rockwell Collins Board unanimously (i) approved the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated
by the merger agreement; (ii) determined that the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement are
advisable and in the best interests of Rockwell Collins and Rockwell Collins' stockholders; (iii) directed that the Share Issuance proposal
be submitted to a vote of Rockwell Collins' stockholders; and (iv) recommended that the stockholders of Rockwell Collins vote "FOR" the
Share Issuance proposal.

        In evaluating the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, the Rockwell Collins Board
consulted with Rockwell Collins' management and legal and financial advisors and, in reaching its determinations, the Rockwell Collins
Board considered a variety of factors with respect to the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement,
including the specific reasons described above under "Risk Factors" and "—Background of the Merger" beginning on page 46 and
page 57, respectively, and the factors listed below.

• The merger would significantly increase Rockwell Collins' scale and diversify its product portfolio, customer mix and
geographic presence; 

• The merger would combine market leaders with complementary capabilities in avionics and interior products that also have
a shared reputation for innovation, quality and on-time delivery and a common customer base, including OEMs, airlines
and lessors; 

• The combination of B/E Aerospace and Rockwell Collins would accelerate technological leadership in integrated digital
airplanes in that it uniquely positions Rockwell Collins to provide a more integrated solution to meet the digital demands of
the commercial airplane; 

• The merger would substantially increase Rockwell Collins' buyer-furnished equipment and aftermarket exposure by
providing it with a large revenue stream tied to passenger traffic growth and airline profitability with a substantial
aftermarket component, which would serve to balance Rockwell Collins' current cyclical exposure to OEM production
rates;

Table of Contents

• The combination of B/E Aerospace's leading business jet aircraft cabin interior products with Rockwell Collins' dealer
network and owner and maintenance databases would facilitate creation of a private aircraft interiors aftermarket, which is
a significant new opportunity; 

• The expectation is that the combined company would achieve approximately $160 million of identified cost synergies
from, among other things, the elimination of corporate and public company costs, manufacturing consolidation,
information technology consolidation and supply chain leveraging, and would have improved pre-tax earnings of
approximately $60 to $90 million per year for the first six years after the acquisition due to certain conforming purchase
accounting adjustments related to capitalized development costs related to seller furnished equipment contracts; 

• The merger would significantly enhance Rockwell Collins' financial profile by accelerating Rockwell Collins' free cash
flow growth and would be accretive to Rockwell Collins' earnings per share in the first full fiscal year following the
acquisition; 

• The fact that the stock portion of the merger consideration is based upon a floating exchange ratio and subject to a two-way
7.5% collar, which provides protection against fluctuations in the market price of Rockwell Collins common stock between
the date of the merger agreement and the date of the completion of the merger; 

• The Rockwell Collins Board's knowledge of Rockwell Collins' business, operations, financial condition, earnings and
prospects and its knowledge of B/E Aerospace's business, operations, financial condition, earnings and prospects, taking
into account B/E Aerospace's publicly-filed information and the results of Rockwell Collins' due diligence review of B/E
Aerospace; 

• The long-term and recent historical trading prices of Rockwell Collins common stock and B/E Aerospace common stock
and the amount of the merger consideration; 

• The expectation that the combined company will benefit from the experienced management teams of Rockwell Collins and
B/E Aerospace; 

• The commitments by both Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace to complete the merger, as set forth in the merger
agreement, and the belief of the Rockwell Collins Board that the transaction does not present significant regulatory
concerns that would impact the ability to complete the merger; 

• The Rockwell Collins Board's review of Rockwell Collins' and B/E Aerospace's business, strategies, current and projected
financial condition, current earnings and earnings prospects; 

• The oral opinion of J.P. Morgan rendered to the Rockwell Collins Board on October 21, 2016, that, as of such date and
based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth in its opinion, the merger consideration to be paid by
Rockwell Collins was fair, from a financial point of view, to Rockwell Collins, as more fully described in the section
entitled "—Opinion of Rockwell Collins' Financial Advisor" beginning on page 74. The oral opinion was subsequently
confirmed in writing by delivery of J.P. Morgan's written opinion dated October 23, 2016. The full text of the written
opinion of J.P. Morgan, which sets forth the assumptions made, matters considered and limits on the review undertaken, is
attached as Annex B to this joint proxy statement/prospectus and is incorporated herein by reference, and Rockwell Collins'
stockholders are urged to read this written opinion in its entirety; 

• The current environment in the aerospace industry, including the trend of consolidation and increased competition; and 

• The merger will be subject to the approval of Rockwell Collins' stockholders.

        The Rockwell Collins Board also specifically considered the terms of the merger agreement, including the following:

• The termination fee payable by B/E Aerospace to Rockwell Collins if B/E Aerospace terminates the merger agreement to
pursue a competing transaction with a third party or in certain other circumstances; 

• That if Rockwell Collins were to receive a takeover proposal from a third party that provided superior value to Rockwell
Collins and its stockholders, Rockwell Collins and the Rockwell Collins Board would be able, under circumstances
described in the merger agreement, to consider such superior proposal and the Rockwell Collins Board may change its
recommendation that Rockwell Collins stockholders vote in favor of the Share Issuance proposal and/or terminate the
merger agreement; 

• Rockwell Collins' ability, under circumstances described in the merger agreement, to provide information to and engage in
discussions or negotiations with a third party that makes an unsolicited bona fide written takeover proposal; 

• The ability of the Rockwell Collins Board, subject to certain conditions, to change its recommendation supporting the
merger in response to an intervening event if the Rockwell Collins Board determines that failure to take such action would
be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties; 

• Rockwell Collins' obligation to consummate the transaction is subject to the condition that Rockwell Collins has received
an opinion regarding the effect of the transaction on the tax-free nature of the KLX spin-off; and 

• The customary nature of Rockwell Collins' other representations, warranties and covenants in the merger agreement.

        The Rockwell Collins Board weighed the foregoing against a number of potentially negative factors, including:

• The risk of not being able to realize all of the anticipated cost savings and operational synergies between Rockwell Collins
and B/E Aerospace and the risk that other anticipated benefits might not be realized; 

• The challenges inherent in the combination of two businesses of the size and complexity of Rockwell Collins and B/E
Aerospace; 

• The costs associated with the completion of the merger and the realization of the benefits expected to be obtained in
connection with the merger, including management's time and energy and potential opportunity cost; 

• The risks that the merger may not be completed and the challenges in absorbing the effect of any failure to complete the
merger, including stockholder and market reactions, as well as the diversion of management's attention from ongoing
business concerns; 

• The fact that the value of the merger consideration payable to B/E Aerospace stockholders could increase in the event that
the price of Rockwell Collins common stock increases more than 7.5% prior to completion of the merger; 

• The restrictions on the conduct of Rockwell Collins' business during the period between the execution of the merger
agreement and the completion of the merger; 

• The risk that regulatory agencies may not approve the merger or may impose terms and conditions on their approvals that
adversely affect the business and financial results of the combined company as more fully described under "—Regulatory
Approvals Required for the Merger" beginning on page 116;

• The termination fee payable by Rockwell Collins to B/E Aerospace if Rockwell Collins terminates the merger agreement to
pursue a competing transaction with a third party or in certain other circumstances; 

• The fact that Rockwell Collins will be required to reimburse B/E Aerospace for its expenses up to $56 million if the merger
agreement is terminated by either party because the Rockwell Collins stockholders did not approve the share issuance for
the transaction; 

• The fact that the merger agreement does not preclude a third party from making an unsolicited proposal for a competing
transaction with B/E Aerospace and that, under certain circumstances more fully described in the sections "The Merger
Agreement—Covenants and Agreements—No Solicitation" beginning on page 141 and "The Merger Agreement—
Covenants and Agreements—Adverse Recommendation Change and Termination" beginning on page 142, B/E Aerospace
may furnish non-public information to and enter into discussions with such third party regarding the competing transaction
and the B/E Aerospace Board may withdraw or modify its recommendations to B/E Aerospace stockholders regarding the
transaction and may terminate the merger agreement to enter into a competing transaction under certain circumstances; 

• The fact that certain senior executives of B/E Aerospace would receive substantial payments in connection with the merger;

• The fact that B/E Aerospace could have substantial liabilities if the merger causes the KLX spin-off to fail to qualify for the
KLX spin-off tax treatment; 

• The risk that the Rockwell Collins stockholders do not approve the Share Issuance proposal; 

• The fact that Rockwell Collins' obligation to complete the transaction is not conditioned upon the ability of Rockwell
Collins to obtain financing for the cash portion of the consideration; 

• The risk of litigation related to the transaction; and 

• The risks of the type and nature described under "Risk Factors" beginning on page 46 and the matters described under
"Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" beginning on page 44.

        This discussion of the information and factors considered by the Rockwell Collins Board in reaching its conclusions and
recommendation includes the principal factors considered by the Rockwell Collins Board, but is not intended to be exhaustive and may not
include all of the factors considered by the Rockwell Collins Board. In view of the wide variety of factors considered in connection with
its evaluation of the transaction, and the complexity of these matters, the Rockwell Collins Board did not find it useful and did not attempt
to quantify, rank or assign any relative or specific weights to the various factors that it considered in reaching its determination to approve
the transaction, including the share issuance, and to make its recommendation to Rockwell Collins stockholders. Rather, the Rockwell
Collins Board viewed its decisions as being based on the totality of the information presented to it and the factors it considered, including
its discussions with, and questioning of, members of Rockwell Collins' management and Rockwell Collins' advisors, as well as its
experience and history. In addition, individual members of the Rockwell Collins Board may have assigned different weights to different
factors.

        The Rockwell Collins Board unanimously determined that the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement were advisable and in the best interests of Rockwell Collins and its stockholders and approved the merger agreement.
Accordingly, the Rockwell Collins Board unanimously recommends that Rockwell Collins stockholders vote "FOR" the Share Issuance
proposal at the Rockwell Collins special meeting.

B/E Aerospace Board of Directors' Recommendations and Its Reasons for the Transaction 

        On October 23, 2016, the B/E Aerospace Board unanimously (i) approved and declared advisable the merger agreement and the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement; (ii) determined that the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the
merger agreement are advisable and in the best interests of B/E Aerospace and B/E Aerospace's stockholders; (iii) directed that the Merger
proposal be submitted to a vote of B/E Aerospace's stockholders; and (iv) recommended that the stockholders of B/E Aerospace vote
"FOR" the Merger proposal.

        In evaluating the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, the B/E Aerospace Board consulted
with B/E Aerospace's management and legal and financial advisors and, in reaching its determinations, the B/E Aerospace Board
considered a variety of factors with respect to the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the
specific reasons described above under "Risk Factors" and "—Background of the Merger" beginning on page 46 and page 57, respectively,
and the factors listed below.

• The merger would combine market leaders with complementary capabilities in avionics and interior products that also have
a shared reputation for innovation, quality and on-time delivery and a common customer base, including OEMs, airlines
and lessors; 

• The combination of B/E Aerospace and Rockwell Collins would accelerate technological leadership in integrated digital

flow growth and would be accretive to Rockwell Collins' earnings per share in the first full fiscal year following the
acquisition, thereby adding value to the stock portion of the consideration received by B/E Aerospace stockholders; 

• The fact that the merger consideration consists of cash, providing B/E Aerospace stockholders with certainty of value and
liquidity upon completion of the merger, along with a significant stock component, which would result in B/E Aerospace
stockholders immediately prior to the merger holding approximately 20.3% of the common stock of Rockwell Collins
immediately following completion of the merger, thus providing B/E Aerospace stockholders with meaningful participation
in the upside potential of a larger, more diversified company;

the date of the merger agreement and the date of the completion of the merger; 

• The fact that the value of the merger consideration payable to B/E Aerospace stockholders could increase in the event that
the price of Rockwell Collins common stock increases more than 7.5% prior to completion of the merger; 

• The B/E Aerospace Board's knowledge of B/E Aerospace's business, operations, financial condition, earnings and
prospects and its knowledge of Rockwell Collins' business, operations, financial condition, earnings and prospects, taking
into account Rockwell Collins' publicly-filed information and the results of B/E Aerospace's due diligence review of
Rockwell Collins; 

• The long-term and recent historical trading prices of B/E Aerospace common stock and Rockwell Collins common stock
and the amount of the merger consideration; 

• The implied value of the merger consideration at the offer price of $62 per share of B/E Aerospace stock represented: 

• a 34% premium to B/E Aerospace's closing share price of $46.34 as of July 20, 2016, the initial formal meeting
between the parties regarding a potential transaction; 

• a 22% premium to B/E Aerospace's closing share price of $50.65 as of October 20, 2016; 

• a 23% premium to B/E Aerospace's trailing 30-day volume-weighted average price of $50.61 as of October 20,
2016; and 

• a 28% premium to B/E Aerospace's trailing 90-day volume-weighted average price of 48.30 as of October 20,
2016; 

• The offer price of $62 per share of B/E Aerospace stock represented a multiple of 13.6 times EV/EBITDA of
B/E Aerospace for the last 12 months ending September 30, 2016; 

• 45% of the merger consideration would be in stock, which will allow B/E Aerospace's stockholders to participate in the
future performance of the combined company; 

• The expectation that the combined company will benefit from the experienced management teams of B/E Aerospace and
Rockwell Collins; 

• The commitments by both B/E Aerospace and Rockwell Collins to complete the merger, as set forth in the merger
agreement, and the belief of the B/E Aerospace Board that the transaction does not present significant regulatory concerns
that would impact the ability to complete the merger; 

• The risks and uncertainties associated with, and inherent in, maintaining B/E Aerospace's existence as an independent
company;

of such date and based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth in the opinion, the merger consideration to
be paid to the holders (other than Rockwell Collins and its affiliates) of B/E Aerospace common stock in the merger was
fair, from a financial point of view, to such stockholders, as more fully described below under the caption "—Opinions of
B/E Aerospace's Financial Advisors" beginning on page 82. The full text of the written opinions of Citigroup and Goldman

forth, among other things, the assumptions made, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the reviews
undertaken in rendering their opinions, are attached as Annex C and Annex D, respectively, to this joint proxy
statement/prospectus, and are incorporated herein by reference;

• The current environment in the aerospace industry, including the trends in consolidation and increased competition, and the
potential financial impact of such trends on B/E Aerospace in the future; 

• The merger will be subject to the approval of B/E Aerospace's stockholders and that, in this regard, B/E Aerospace's
directors and executive officers do not own a sufficient interest in B/E Aerospace common stock, in the aggregate, to
influence substantially the outcome of such stockholder vote; and 

• B/E Aerospace stockholders who do not vote to adopt the merger agreement and approve the merger and who follow
certain prescribed procedures are entitled to appraisal rights under Delaware law.

        The B/E Aerospace Board also specifically considered the terms of the merger agreement, including the following:

• The lack of a financing condition to Rockwell Collins' obligation to complete the merger; 

• The termination fee payable by Rockwell Collins to B/E Aerospace if Rockwell Collins terminates the merger agreement to
pursue a competing transaction with a third party or in certain other circumstances; 

• That if B/E Aerospace were to receive a takeover proposal from a third party that provided superior value to B/E Aerospace
and its stockholders, B/E Aerospace and the B/E Aerospace Board would be able, under certain circumstances described in
the merger agreement, to consider such superior proposal and the B/E Aerospace Board may change its recommendation
that B/E Aerospace stockholders vote in favor of the Merger proposal and/or terminate the merger agreement; 

• B/E Aerospace's ability, under circumstances described in the merger agreement, to provide information to and engage in
discussions or negotiations with a third party that makes an unsolicited bona fide written takeover proposal; 

• The ability of the B/E Aerospace Board, subject to certain conditions, to change its recommendation supporting the merger
in response to an intervening event if the B/E Aerospace Board determines that failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties; and 

• The customary nature of B/E Aerospace's other representations, warranties and covenants in the merger agreement.

        The B/E Aerospace Board weighed the foregoing against a number of potentially negative factors, including:

• The fact that the value of the merger consideration payable to B/E Aerospace stockholders could decrease in the event that
the price of Rockwell Collins common stock decreases more than 7.5% prior to completion of the merger; 

• The restrictions on the conduct of B/E Aerospace's business during the period between the execution of the merger
agreement and the completion of the merger;

recommendation includes the principal factors considered by the B/E Aerospace Board, but is not intended to be exhaustive and may not
include all of the factors considered by the B/E Aerospace Board. In view of the wide variety of factors considered in connection with its
evaluation of the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, and the complexity of these matters, the
B/E Aerospace Board did not find it useful and did not attempt to quantify, rank or assign any relative or specific weights to the various
factors that it considered in reaching its determination to approve the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement, and to make its recommendation to B/E Aerospace stockholders. Rather, the

B/E Aerospace Board viewed its decisions as being based on the totality of the information presented to it and the factors it considered,
including its discussions with, and questioning of, members of B/E Aerospace's management and B/E Aerospace's advisors, as well as its
experience and history. In addition, individual members of the B/E Aerospace Board may have assigned different weights to different
factors.

        Certain of B/E Aerospace's directors and executive officers have financial interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition
to, those of B/E Aerospace's stockholders generally. The B/E Aerospace Board was aware of and considered these potential interests,
among other matters, in evaluating the merger and in making its recommendation to B/E Aerospace stockholders. For a discussion of these
interests, see "—Interests of Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger" beginning on page 102.

        The B/E Aerospace Board unanimously determined that the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement were advisable and in the best interests of B/E Aerospace and its stockholders and approved the merger agreement.
Accordingly, the B/E Aerospace Board unanimously recommends that B/E Aerospace stockholders vote "FOR" the Merger proposal at the
B/E Aerospace special meeting.

Opinion of Rockwell Collins' Financial Advisor 

        Pursuant to an engagement letter dated October 6, 2016, Rockwell Collins retained J.P. Morgan as its financial advisor in connection
with the merger.

        At the meeting of the Rockwell Collins Board on October 21, 2016, J.P. Morgan rendered its oral opinion to the Rockwell Collins
Board that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth in its opinion, the merger consideration to
be paid by Rockwell Collins was fair, from a financial point of view, to Rockwell Collins. J.P. Morgan has confirmed its October 21, 2016
oral opinion by delivering its written opinion to the Rockwell Collins Board, dated October 23, 2016, that, as of such date, the merger
consideration to be paid by Rockwell Collins was fair, from a financial point of view, to Rockwell Collins.

        The full text of the written opinion of J.P. Morgan, which sets forth the assumptions made, matters considered and limits on
the review undertaken, is attached as Annex B to this joint proxy statement/prospectus and is incorporated herein by reference.
The summary of the opinion of J.P. Morgan set forth in this joint proxy statement/prospectus is qualified in its entirety by
reference to the full text of such opinion. Rockwell Collins stockholders are urged to read the opinion in its entirety. J.P. Morgan's
opinion was addressed to the Rockwell Collins Board (in its capacity as such) in connection with and for the purposes of its
evaluation of the merger, was directed only to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to Rockwell Collins of the merger
consideration to be paid by Rockwell Collins and did not address any other aspect of the merger. J.P. Morgan expressed no
opinion as to the fairness of the merger consideration to the holders of any class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of
Rockwell Collins or as to the underlying decision by Rockwell Collins to engage in the merger. The issuance of J.P. Morgan's
opinion was approved by a fairness committee of J.P. Morgan. The opinion does not constitute a recommendation to any
stockholder of Rockwell Collins as to how such stockholder should vote with respect to the merger or any other matter.

        In arriving at its opinion, J.P. Morgan, among other things:

• reviewed a draft dated October 23, 2016 of the merger agreement; 

• reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information concerning B/E Aerospace and Rockwell Collins
and the industries in which they operate;

Table of Contents

• compared the proposed financial terms of the merger with the publicly available financial terms of certain transactions
involving companies J.P. Morgan deemed relevant and the consideration received for such companies; 

• compared the financial and operating performance of B/E Aerospace and Rockwell Collins with publicly available
information concerning certain other companies J.P. Morgan deemed relevant and reviewed the current and historical
market prices of B/E Aerospace common stock and Rockwell Collins common stock and certain publicly traded securities
of such other companies; 

• reviewed certain internal financial analyses and forecasts prepared by the managements of B/E Aerospace and Rockwell
Collins relating to their respective businesses and by Rockwell Collins relating to B/E Aerospace's business, as well as the
estimated amount and timing of the cost savings and related expenses and synergies expected to result from the merger,
which are referred to as the Synergies; and 

• performed such other financial studies and analyses and considered such other information as J.P. Morgan deemed
appropriate for the purposes of its opinion.

        In addition, J.P. Morgan held discussions with certain members of the management of B/E Aerospace and Rockwell Collins with
respect to certain aspects of the merger, the past and current business operations of B/E Aerospace and Rockwell Collins, the financial
condition and future prospects and operations of B/E Aerospace and Rockwell Collins, the effects of the merger on the financial condition
and future prospects of Rockwell Collins, and certain other matters J.P. Morgan believed necessary or appropriate to its inquiry.

        In giving its opinion, J.P. Morgan relied upon and assumed the accuracy and completeness of all information that was publicly
available or was furnished to or discussed with J.P. Morgan by B/E Aerospace and Rockwell Collins or otherwise reviewed by or for J.P.
Morgan, and J.P. Morgan did not independently verify (and did not assume responsibility or liability for independently verifying) any such
information or its accuracy or completeness. J.P. Morgan did not conduct and was not provided with any valuation or appraisal of any
assets or liabilities, nor did J.P. Morgan evaluate the solvency of B/E Aerospace or Rockwell Collins under any applicable laws relating to
bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. In relying on financial analyses and forecasts provided to J.P. Morgan or derived therefrom,
including the Synergies, J.P. Morgan assumed that they were reasonably prepared based on assumptions reflecting the best currently
available estimates and judgments by management as to the expected future results of operations and financial condition of B/E Aerospace
and Rockwell Collins to which such analyses or forecasts relate. J.P. Morgan expressed no view as to such analyses or forecasts (including
the Synergies) or the assumptions on which they were based. J.P. Morgan also assumed that the merger and the other transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement will have the tax consequences described in discussions with, and materials furnished to J.P.
Morgan by, representatives of Rockwell Collins, and will be consummated as described in the merger agreement, and that the definitive
merger agreement would not differ in any material respects from the draft thereof furnished to J.P. Morgan. J.P. Morgan also assumed that
the representations and warranties made by Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace in the merger agreement and the related agreements were
and will be true and correct in all respects material to J.P. Morgan's analysis. J.P. Morgan is not a legal, regulatory or tax expert and relied
on the assessments made by advisors to Rockwell Collins with respect to such issues. J.P. Morgan further assumed that all material
governmental, regulatory or other consents and approvals necessary for the consummation of the merger will be obtained without any
adverse effect on B/E Aerospace or Rockwell Collins or on the contemplated benefits of the merger.

        J.P. Morgan's opinion was necessarily based on economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made
available to J.P. Morgan as of, the date of such opinion. J.P. Morgan's opinion noted that subsequent developments may affect J.P.
Morgan's opinion, and that J.P. Morgan does not have any obligation to update, revise, or reaffirm such opinion. J.P. Morgan's opinion is

limited to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the merger consideration to be paid by Rockwell Collins, and J.P. Morgan has
expressed no opinion as to the fairness of any merger consideration to the holders of any class of securities, creditors or other
constituencies of Rockwell Collins or as to the underlying decision by Rockwell Collins to engage in the merger. Furthermore, J.P. Morgan
expressed no opinion with respect to the amount or nature of any compensation to any officers, directors, or employees of any party to the
merger, or any class of such persons relative to the merger consideration to be paid by Rockwell Collins or with respect to the fairness of
any such compensation. J.P. Morgan expressed no opinion as to the price at which Rockwell Collins common stock or B/E Aerospace
common stock will trade at any future time.

        The terms of the merger agreement, including the exchange ratio, were determined through arm's length negotiations between
Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace, and the decision to enter into the merger agreement was solely that of the Rockwell Collins Board
and the B/E Aerospace board of directors. J.P. Morgan's opinion and financial analyses constituted only one of the many factors considered
by the Rockwell Collins Board in its evaluation of the merger and should not be viewed as determinative of the views of the Rockwell
Collins Board or management with respect to the merger or the merger consideration.

        In accordance with customary investment banking practice, J.P. Morgan employed generally accepted valuation methodology in
rendering its opinion to the Rockwell Collins Board and contained in the presentation delivered to the Rockwell Collins Board in
connection with the rendering of such opinion and does not purport to be a complete description of the analyses or data presented by
J.P. Morgan. Some of the summaries of the financial analyses include information presented in tabular format. The tables are not intended
to stand alone, and in order to more fully understand the financial analyses used by J.P. Morgan, the tables must be read together with the
full text of each summary. Considering the data set forth below without considering the full narrative description of the financial analyses,
including the methodologies and assumptions underlying the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of J.P. Morgan's
analyses.

B/E Aerospace Financial Analyses

Public Trading Multiples

        Using publicly available information, J.P. Morgan compared selected financial and market data of B/E Aerospace with similar data
for selected publicly traded companies that J.P. Morgan deemed relevant for purposes of analysis. The companies selected by J.P. Morgan
were as follows:

• HEICO Corporation; 

• Meggitt PLC; 

• Rockwell Collins, Inc.; 

• TransDigm Group Inc.; and 

• Zodiac Aerospace.

        These companies were selected, among other reasons, because they are publicly traded companies with operations and businesses
that, for purposes of J.P. Morgan's analysis, may be considered similar to those of B/E Aerospace based on business sector participation,
operational characteristics and financial metrics. Using publicly available information, J.P. Morgan calculated, for each selected company,
(i) the multiple of enterprise value as of October 20, 2016 to estimated EBITDA (which means earnings before interest, tax, depreciation
and amortization) for calendar year 2017, or EV/EBITDA 2017E, and (ii) the multiple of closing share price as of October 20, 2016 to
estimated earnings per share for calendar year 2017, or P/E 2017E, based on Wall Street analysts' consensus

estimates and FactSet data. This analysis indicated the following EV/EBITDA 2017E and P/E 2017E multiples:

        Based on the results of this analysis and other factors that J.P. Morgan considered relevant, J.P. Morgan selected a multiple reference
range for EV/EBITDA 2017E of 10.0x - 13.5x and a multiple reference range for P/E 2017E of 12.0x - 19.5x.

        After applying such ranges to Rockwell Collins management's estimate of the EBITDA and EPS, respectively, for B/E Aerospace for
calendar year 2017 in the adjusted B/E Aerospace forecast, the analysis indicated the following implied per share equity value ranges for
B/E Aerospace common stock, rounded to the nearest $0.25:

        The ranges of implied per share equity values for B/E Aerospace common stock were compared to the closing share price of $50.65
of B/E Aerospace common stock as of October 20, 2016, and the offer price of $62.00 per share of B/E Aerospace common stock, which
consists of $34.10 in cash consideration and shares of Rockwell Collins common stock with a value of $27.90 in stock consideration,
subject to adjustment as described in detail in "The Merger Agreement—Merger Consideration to be Received by B/E Aerospace
Stockholders" beginning on page 128 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

Transaction Multiples Analysis

        Using publicly available information, J.P. Morgan examined selected transactions involving businesses that J.P. Morgan considered to
be analogous to B/E Aerospace's business or aspects thereof for purposes of analysis. These transactions were selected, among other
reasons, because the businesses involved in these transactions share similar business characteristics to B/E Aerospace based on business

sector participation, operational characteristics and financial metrics. Specifically, J.P. Morgan reviewed the following transactions:

        J.P. Morgan calculated, for each selected transaction, (i) the multiple of the transaction value to the target company's EBITDA for the
12-month period prior to the announcement of the applicable transaction, or TV/ LTM EBITDA, and (ii) the multiple of the per share offer
price in the transaction to the earnings per share of the target company or the equity value in the transaction to the net income for the 12-
month period prior to the announcement of the applicable transaction, or LTM P/E.

        Based on the results of this analysis and other factors that J.P. Morgan considered relevant, J.P. Morgan selected a multiple reference
range of 10.0x - 14.0x for TV/ LTM EBITDA and a multiple reference range of 20.0x - 30.0x for LTM P/E.

        After applying such ranges to figures provided by B/E Aerospace for LTM EBITDA and LTM EPS, respectively, for B/E Aerospace
for the 12-month period ended September 30, 2016, the analysis indicated the following implied per share equity value ranges for B/E
Aerospace common stock, rounded to the nearest $0.25:

        The ranges of implied per share equity values for B/E Aerospace common stock were compared to the closing price of $50.65 per
share of B/E Aerospace common stock on October 20, 2016, and the offer price of $62.00 per share of B/E Aerospace common stock.

Discounted Cash Flow Analysis

        J.P. Morgan conducted a discounted cash flow analysis for the purpose of determining the fully diluted equity value per share for B/E
Aerospace common stock.

        J.P. Morgan calculated the unlevered free cash flows that B/E Aerospace is expected to generate (i) during the fourth quarter of
calendar year 2016 through calendar year 2021 based upon the adjusted B/E Aerospace forecast and (ii) during calendar years 2022
through 2026 based upon extrapolations from the adjusted B/E Aerospace forecast reviewed and approved by Rockwell Collins
management. J.P. Morgan calculated a range of terminal values for B/E Aerospace at the end of the projection period by applying terminal
growth rates, based on J.P. Morgan's professional judgment given the nature of B/E Aerospace, its business and its industry, ranging from
2.5% to 3.5%. The unlevered free cash flows and the range of terminal values were then discounted to present values using discount rates
ranging from 7.5% to 8.5%, which were chosen by J.P. Morgan based upon an analysis of the weighted average cost of capital of B/E
Aerospace. The present values of the unlevered free cash flows and the range of terminal values were then adjusted for B/E Aerospace's
net debt and divided by the fully diluted shares outstanding of B/E Aerospace. The discounted cash flow analysis indicated an implied per
share equity value range for B/E Aerospace common stock, rounded to the nearest $0.25, of $53.50 to $78.25.

        The range of implied per share equity values for B/E Aerospace common stock was compared to the closing price of $50.65 per share
of B/E Aerospace common stock on October 20, 2016, and the offer price of $62.00 per share of B/E Aerospace common stock.

Rockwell Collins Financial Analysis

Discounted Cash Flow Analysis

        J.P. Morgan conducted a discounted cash flow analysis for the purpose of determining the fully diluted equity value per share for
Rockwell Collins common stock.

        J.P. Morgan calculated the unlevered free cash flows that Rockwell Collins is expected to generate (i) during fiscal years 2017
through 2021 based upon the Rockwell Collins stand-alone management forecast and (ii) during fiscal years 2022 through 2026 based
upon extrapolations from the Rockwell Collins stand-alone management forecast reviewed and approved by Rockwell Collins
management. J.P. Morgan calculated a range of terminal values for Rockwell Collins at the end of the projection period by applying
terminal growth rates, based on J.P. Morgan's professional judgment given the nature of Rockwell Collins, its business and its industry,
ranging from 2.0% to 3.0% to the unlevered free cash flows excluding pension contributions, to which a 0% terminal growth rate was
applied per Rockwell Collins management instruction. The unlevered free cash flows and the range of terminal values were then
discounted to present values using discount rates ranging from 7.5% to 8.5%, which were chosen by J.P. Morgan based upon an analysis of
the weighted average cost of capital of Rockwell Collins. The present values of the unlevered free cash flows and the range of terminal
values were then adjusted for Rockwell Collins' net debt and divided by the fully diluted shares outstanding of Rockwell Collins. The
discounted cash flow analysis indicated an implied per share equity value range for Rockwell Collins common stock, rounded to the
nearest $0.25, of $98.25 to $136.75.

Potential Value Creation Analysis—Intrinsic Value Approach

        J.P. Morgan prepared a value creation analysis that compared the implied equity value derived from J.P. Morgan's discounted cash
flow analysis of Rockwell Collins on a standalone basis to Rockwell Collins stockholders' pro forma ownership of the implied equity
value of the combined company.

        The pro forma combined company equity value was equal to: (i) Rockwell Collins' standalone discounted cash flow value of
$15.1 billion (calculated using a 2.5% terminal growth rate and 8.0% discount rate, representing the midpoint of the terminal growth rate
and discount rate ranges, respectively, applied in the discounted cash flow analysis for Rockwell Collins described above), plus (ii) B/E
Aerospace's standalone discounted cash flow value of $6.5 billion (calculated using a 3.0% terminal growth rate and an 8.0% discount
rate, representing the midpoint of the terminal growth rate

and discount rate ranges, respectively, applied in the discounted cash flow analysis for B/E Aerospace described above), plus (iii) the
discounted cash flow value of Rockwell Collins management expectations of after-tax synergies totaling $1.8 billion (calculated using a
3.0% terminal growth rate and an 8.0% discount rate representing the midpoint of the terminal growth rate and discount rate ranges,
respectively), less (iv) cash consideration of $3.8 billion (which includes the retirement of certain B/E Aerospace restricted stock units,
transaction costs and change of control expenses). J.P. Morgan then calculated the implied pro forma equity value of the combined
company attributable to Rockwell Collins stockholders based on the implied equity ownership percentage of 80% by Rockwell Collins
stockholders implied by the exchange ratio in the consideration (assuming Rockwell Collins' closing share price as of October 20, 2016)
and the number of Rockwell Collins diluted shares outstanding on a standalone basis (based on information as of September 30, 2016 per
Rockwell Collins management). J.P. Morgan then compared the result to the implied equity value of Rockwell Collins on a standalone
basis indicated by the discounted cash flow analysis of Rockwell Collins (described above) whereby the discount rates used were chosen
by J.P. Morgan based upon an analysis of the weighted average cost of capital of Rockwell Collins. The value creation analysis indicated
an implied pro forma equity value of $15.6 billion attributable to Rockwell Collins stockholders and implied pro forma accretion in
implied equity value to Rockwell Collins stockholders of 3.4% higher than the implied equity value on a standalone basis indicated by the
discounted cash flow analysis of Rockwell Collins.

Other Information

$66.00 per share of B/E Aerospace common stock.

        J.P. Morgan noted that the historical stock trading and equity research analyst price targets analyses are not valuation methodologies
but were presented merely for reference only.

Miscellaneous

        The foregoing summary of financial analyses does not purport to be a complete description of the analyses or data presented by J.P.
Morgan. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary
description. J.P. Morgan believes that the foregoing summary and its analyses must be considered as a whole and that selecting portions of
the foregoing summary and these analyses, without considering all of its analyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view of the
processes underlying the analyses and its opinion. As a result, the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis or
combination of analyses described above were merely utilized to create points of reference for analytical purposes and should not be taken
to be the view of J.P. Morgan with respect to the actual value of Rockwell Collins or B/E Aerospace. The order of analyses described does
not represent the relative importance or weight given to those analyses by J.P. Morgan. In arriving at its opinion, J.P. Morgan did not
attribute any particular weight to any analyses or factors considered by it and did not form an opinion as to whether any individual analysis
or factor (positive or negative), considered in isolation, supported or failed to support its opinion. Rather, J.P. Morgan considered the
totality of the factors and analyses performed in determining its opinion.

        Analyses based upon forecasts of future results are inherently uncertain, as they are subject to numerous factors or events beyond the
control of the parties and their advisors. Accordingly, forecasts and analyses used or made by J.P. Morgan are not necessarily indicative of
actual future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by those analyses. Moreover, J.P. Morgan's analyses
are not and do not purport to be appraisals or otherwise reflective of the prices at which businesses actually could be acquired or sold.
None of the selected companies reviewed as described in the above summary is identical to B/E Aerospace, and none of the selected
transactions reviewed was identical to the merger. However, the companies selected were chosen because they are publicly traded
companies with operations and businesses that, for purposes of J.P. Morgan's analysis, may be considered similar to those of B/E
Aerospace. The transactions selected were similarly chosen because their participants, size and other factors, for purposes of J.P. Morgan's
analysis, may be considered similar to the merger. The analyses necessarily involve complex considerations and judgments concerning
differences in financial and operational characteristics of the companies involved and other factors that could affect the companies
compared to B/E Aerospace and the transactions compared to the merger.

        As a part of its investment banking business, J.P. Morgan and its affiliates are continually engaged in the valuation of businesses and
their securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions, investments for passive and control purposes, negotiated underwritings,
secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements, and valuations for corporate and other purposes. J.P. Morgan
was selected to advise Rockwell Collins with respect to the merger on the basis of, among other things, such experience and its
qualifications and reputation in connection with such matters and its familiarity with Rockwell Collins, B/E Aerospace and the industries
in which they operate.

        For services rendered in connection with the merger, Rockwell Collins agreed to pay J.P. Morgan a transaction fee of $27.5 million,
of which $5.0 million became payable by Rockwell Collins at the time J.P. Morgan delivered its opinion, and the balance of which is
payable upon the closing of the merger. Rockwell Collins has also agreed to pay J.P. Morgan 10% of any break-up fee received by
Rockwell Collins following or in connection with the termination, abandonment or failure of the merger, provided that such fee will not
exceed the amount that would have been payable to J.P. Morgan if the merger had been consummated. In addition, Rockwell Collins has
agreed to reimburse J.P. Morgan for certain of its expenses incurred in connection with its services, including the fees and expenses of
counsel, and will indemnify J.P. Morgan against certain liabilities arising out of J.P. Morgan's engagement. During the two years preceding
the date of J.P. Morgan's opinion, J.P. Morgan and its affiliates have had commercial or investment banking relationships with Rockwell
Collins and B/E Aerospace for which J.P. Morgan and such affiliates have received customary compensation. Such services during such
period have included acting as joint bookrunner and joint lead arranger on Rockwell Collins' revolving credit facility in February 2016; as
joint lead arranger and joint bookrunner on the B/E Aerospace credit facilities in December 2014 and in May 2016; as lead arranger and
lead-left bookrunner on credit facilities of KLX; as lead bookrunner on an offering of debt securities of KLX in November 2014; and as
financial advisor to B/E Aerospace in connection with the KLX spin-off in December 2014. J.P. Morgan and its affiliates also provided
asset management services to Rockwell Collins during such period. In addition, J.P. Morgan's commercial banking affiliate is an agent
bank and a lender under outstanding credit facilities of Rockwell Collins, B/E Aerospace and KLX, for which it receives customary
compensation or other financial benefits. J.P. Morgan and its affiliates have committed to provide financing to Rockwell Collins in
connection with the merger for customary compensation, which is expected to be approximately $20 million in fees payable to J.P. Morgan
in connection with such financing. During the two-year period preceding delivery of its opinion, the aggregate fees received by J.P.
Morgan from Rockwell Collins were approximately $3 million and from B/E Aerospace were approximately $10 million. In the ordinary
course of their businesses, J.P. Morgan and its affiliates may actively trade the debt and equity securities or financial instruments
(including derivatives, bank loans or other obligations) of Rockwell Collins or B/E Aerospace for their own

the merger consideration to be received by such holders in the merger. Citigroup's opinion does not address any other aspects or
implications of the merger and does not constitute a recommendation to any stockholder as to how such stockholder should vote or
act on any matters relating to the merger or otherwise. Citigroup's opinion does not address the underlying business decision of
B/E Aerospace to effect the merger, the relative merits of the merger as compared to any alternative business strategies that might

Citigroup's opinion.

        In arriving at its opinion, Citigroup, among other things:

• considered, to the extent publicly available, the financial terms of certain other transactions which Citigroup considered
relevant in evaluating the merger; 

• analyzed certain financial, stock market and other publicly available information relating to the businesses of other
companies whose operations Citigroup considered relevant in evaluating those of B/E Aerospace and Rockwell Collins; 

• evaluated certain potential pro forma financial effects of the merger on Rockwell Collins; and 

• conducted such other analyses and examinations and considered such other information and financial, economic and

        In rendering its opinion, Citigroup assumed and relied, without independent verification, upon the accuracy and completeness of all
financial and other information and data publicly available or provided to or otherwise reviewed by or discussed with Citigroup and upon
the assurances of the managements of B/E Aerospace and Rockwell Collins that they were not aware of any relevant information that was
omitted or that remained undisclosed to Citigroup. With respect to financial forecasts and other information and data provided to or
otherwise reviewed by or discussed with Citigroup, Citigroup was advised by the respective managements of B/E Aerospace and Rockwell
Collins that such forecasts and other information and data were reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available
estimates and judgments of the managements of B/E Aerospace and Rockwell Collins as to the future financial performance of
B/E Aerospace and Rockwell Collins, the potential strategic implications and operational benefits anticipated to result from the merger and
the other matters covered thereby, and assumed, with B/E Aerospace's consent, that the financial results (including the potential strategic
implications and operational benefits anticipated to result from the merger) reflected in such forecasts and other information and data will
be realized in the amounts and at the times projected.

        Citigroup also assumed, with B/E Aerospace's consent, that the merger will be consummated in accordance with its terms, without
waiver, modification or amendment of any material term, condition or agreement and that, in the course of obtaining the necessary
regulatory or third party approvals, consents and releases for the merger, no delay, limitation, restriction or condition will be imposed that
would have an adverse effect on B/E Aerospace, Rockwell Collins or the contemplated benefits of the merger. Citigroup's opinion related
to the relative values of B/E Aerospace and Rockwell Collins. Citigroup did not express any opinion as to what the value of Rockwell
Collins common stock actually will be when issued pursuant to the merger or the price at which shares of Rockwell Collins common stock
will trade at any time. Citigroup did not make and it was not provided with an independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets or
liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of B/E Aerospace or Rockwell Collins and Citigroup did not make any physical inspection of the
properties or assets of B/E Aerospace or Rockwell Collins. Citigroup's opinion did not address the underlying business decision of
B/E Aerospace to effect the merger, the relative merits of the merger as compared to any alternative business strategies that might exist for
B/E Aerospace or the effect of any other transaction in which B/E Aerospace might engage. Citigroup also expressed no view as to, and
Citigroup's opinion did not address, the fairness (financial or otherwise) of the amount or nature or any other aspect of any compensation
to any officers, directors or employees of any parties to the merger, or any class of such persons, relative to the merger consideration or
otherwise. Citigroup's opinion was necessarily based upon information available to it, and financial, stock market and other conditions and
circumstances existing, as of October 20, 2016, except as otherwise noted.

        For a summary of the material financial analyses presented by Citigroup, together with Goldman Sachs, to the B/E Aerospace Board
in connection with the delivery of Citigroup's opinion, see the section entitled "—Financial Analyses by Financial Co-Advisors" beginning

        Under the terms of Citigroup's engagement, B/E Aerospace has agreed to pay Citigroup, for its financial advisory services in
connection with the merger, an aggregate fee of approximately $27.3 million, $5 million of which was payable upon delivery by Citigroup
of its opinion and the remainder of which is payable upon completion of the merger. Subject to certain limitations, B/E Aerospace also has
agreed to reimburse Citigroup, subject to certain conditions, for reasonable and documented travel and other reasonable and documented
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Citigroup in performing its services, including reasonable and documented fees and expenses of its
legal counsel, and to indemnify Citigroup and related persons against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the federal securities
laws, arising out of its engagement.

        Citigroup and its affiliates in the past have provided, and currently provide, services to B/E Aerospace unrelated to the merger, for
which services Citigroup and such affiliates have received and expect to receive compensation, including, without limitation, during the
two-year period prior to October 23, 2016, having acted or acting (i) as financial advisor to B/E Aerospace in connection with
B/E Aerospace's spin-off of KLX Inc. in December 2014, and (ii) as lender, syndication agent, joint lead arranger and joint book-runner in
connection with a term loan and revolving credit facility of B/E Aerospace. During the two year period ended October 23, 2016, Citigroup
has received compensation for financial advisory and/or underwriting services provided by its Investment Banking Division directly to
B/E Aerospace and/or its affiliates of approximately $18,700,000. Citigroup and its affiliates in the past have also provided, and currently
provide, services to Rockwell Collins unrelated to the merger, for which services Citigroup and such affiliates have received and expect to
receive compensation, including, without limitation, during the two-year period prior to October 23, 2016, acting as lender, syndication
agent, joint lead arranger and joint book-runner in connection with two revolving credit facilities of Rockwell Collins, as well as acting as
lender in connection with certain committed corporate credit card facilities of Rockwell Collins. During the two-year period ended
October 23, 2016, Citigroup has received compensation for financial advisory and/or underwriting services provided by its Investment
Banking Division directly to Rockwell Collins and/or to its affiliates of approximately $50,000. In the ordinary course of business,
Citigroup and its affiliates may actively trade or hold the securities of B/E Aerospace and Rockwell Collins for its own account or for the
account of its customers and, accordingly, may at any time hold a long or short position in such securities. In addition, Citigroup and its
affiliates (including Citigroup Inc. and its affiliates) may maintain relationships with B/E Aerospace, Rockwell Collins and their respective
affiliates.

        In response to a request by Rockwell Collins, made after the execution of the merger agreement, that Citigroup participate in the
financing of the merger by Rockwell Collins, the B/E Aerospace Board granted Citigroup permission to participate in such financing.
Pursuant to such request and consent, Citigroup is now participating in such financing, including as a joint lead arranger and lender with
respect to certain credit facilities, and Citigroup is now actively exploring participating, and may participate as an active bookrunner with
respect to capital markets offerings.

        The B/E Aerospace Board selected Citigroup to act as one of its financial advisors in connection with the merger based on Citigroup's
reputation and experience. Citigroup is an internationally recognized investment banking firm which regularly engages in the valuation of
businesses and their securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions, negotiated underwritings, competitive bids, secondary
distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements and valuations for corporate and other purposes.

Rockwell Collins and its affiliates) of outstanding shares of common stock of B/E Aerospace pursuant to the merger agreement was fair
from a financial point of view to such holders.

        The full text of the written opinion of Goldman Sachs, dated October 23, 2016, which sets forth assumptions made,
procedures followed, matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken in connection with the opinion, is attached as
Annex D. Goldman Sachs provided its opinion for the information and assistance of the B/E Aerospace Board in connection with
its consideration of the merger. The Goldman Sachs opinion is not a recommendation as to how any holder of B/E Aerospace's
common stock should vote with respect to the merger or any other matter.

        In connection with rendering the opinion described above and performing its related financial analyses, Goldman Sachs reviewed,
among other things:

• the merger agreement; 

• annual reports to stockholders and Annual Reports on Form 10-K of B/E Aerospace and Rockwell Collins for the five
fiscal years ended December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2015, respectively; 

• certain interim reports to stockholders and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q of B/E Aerospace and Rockwell Collins; 

• certain other communications from B/E Aerospace and Rockwell Collins to their respective stockholders; 

• certain publicly available research analyst reports for B/E Aerospace and Rockwell Collins; and 

• certain internal financial analyses and forecasts for B/E Aerospace prepared by its management and for Rockwell Collins
prepared by its management, in each case, as approved for Goldman Sachs' use by B/E Aerospace (which is referred to as
the Forecasts) and certain operating synergies projected by the managements of B/E Aerospace and Rockwell Collins to
result from the transaction, as approved for Goldman Sachs' use by B/E Aerospace (which is referred to as the Synergies).

        Goldman Sachs also held discussions with members of the senior managements of B/E Aerospace and Rockwell Collins regarding
their assessment of the strategic rationale for, and the potential benefits of, the merger and the past and current business operations,
financial condition and future prospects of B/E Aerospace and Rockwell Collins; reviewed the reported price and trading activity for
shares of B/E Aerospace common stock and shares of Rockwell Collins common stock; compared certain financial and stock market
information for B/E Aerospace and Rockwell Collins with similar information for certain other companies the securities of which are
publicly traded; reviewed the financial terms of certain recent business combinations in the aerospace and defense industry and in other
industries; and performed such other studies and analyses, and considered such other factors, as it deemed appropriate.

        For purposes of rendering its opinion, Goldman Sachs, with B/E Aerospace's consent, relied upon and assumed the accuracy and
completeness of all of the financial, legal, regulatory, tax, accounting and other information provided to, discussed with or reviewed by, it,
without assuming any responsibility for independent verification thereof. In that regard, Goldman Sachs assumed with B/E Aerospace's
consent that the Forecasts and Synergies were reasonably prepared on a basis reflecting the best currently available estimates and
judgments of the management of B/E Aerospace. Goldman Sachs did not make an independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets and
liabilities (including any contingent, derivative or other off-balance-sheet assets and liabilities) of B/E Aerospace or Rockwell Collins or
any of their respective subsidiaries and it was not furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal. Goldman Sachs assumed that all
governmental, regulatory or other consents and approvals necessary for the consummation of the merger will be obtained without any
adverse effect on B/E Aerospace or Rockwell Collins or on the expected benefits of the merger in any way

meaningful to its analysis. Goldman Sachs has also assumed that the merger will be consummated on the terms set forth in the merger
agreement, without the waiver or modification of any term or condition the effect of which would be in any way meaningful to its analysis.

        Goldman Sachs' opinion does not address the underlying business decision of B/E Aerospace to engage in the merger or the relative
merits of the merger as compared to any strategic alternatives that may be available to B/E Aerospace; nor does it address any legal,
regulatory, tax or accounting matters. Goldman Sachs' opinion addresses only the fairness from a financial point of view to the holders
(other than Rockwell Collins and its affiliates) of outstanding shares of common stock of B/E Aerospace, as of the date of the opinion, of
the merger consideration to be paid to such holders pursuant to the Merger Agreement. Goldman Sachs' opinion does not express any view
on, and does not address, any other term or aspect of the merger agreement or the merger or any term or aspect of any other agreement or
instrument contemplated by the merger agreement or entered into or amended in connection with the merger, including the fairness of the
merger to, or any consideration received in connection therewith by, the holders of any other class of securities, creditors, or other
constituencies of B/E Aerospace; nor as to the fairness of the amount or nature of any compensation to be paid or payable to any of the
officers, directors or employees of B/E Aerospace, or class of such persons in connection with the merger, whether relative to the merger
consideration to be paid to the holders (other than Rockwell Collins and its affiliates) of outstanding shares of common stock of
B/E Aerospace pursuant to the merger agreement or otherwise. In addition, Goldman Sachs does not express any opinion as to the prices at
which shares of common stock of Rockwell Collins will trade at any time or as to the impact of the merger on the solvency or viability of
B/E Aerospace or Rockwell Collins or the ability of B/E Aerospace or Rockwell Collins to pay their respective obligations when they
come due. Goldman Sachs' opinion was necessarily based on economic, monetary, market and other conditions, as in effect on, and the
information made available to it as of, the date of the opinion and Goldman Sachs assumed no responsibility for updating, revising or
reaffirming its opinion based on circumstances, developments or events occurring after the date of its opinion. Goldman Sachs' opinion
was approved by a fairness committee of Goldman Sachs.

        Goldman Sachs and its affiliates are engaged in advisory, underwriting and financing, principal investing, sales and trading, research,
investment management and other financial and non-financial activities and services for various persons and entities. Goldman Sachs and
its affiliates and employees, and funds or other entities in which they invest or have other economic interests or with which they co-invest,
may at any time purchase, sell, hold or vote long or short positions and investments in securities, derivatives, loans, commodities,
currencies, credit default swaps and other financial instruments of B/E Aerospace, Rockwell Collins, any of their respective affiliates and
third parties, or any currency or commodity that may be involved in the merger contemplated by the merger agreement. Goldman Sachs
acted as financial advisor to B/E Aerospace in connection with, and participated in certain of the negotiations leading to, the merger
contemplated by the merger agreement. Goldman Sachs has provided certain financial advisory and/or underwriting services to
B/E Aerospace and/or its affiliates from time to time for which the Investment Banking Division of Goldman Sachs has received, and may
receive, compensation, including having acted as book manager with respect to a private offering of KLX, a former subsidiary of
B/E Aerospace, 5.875% Senior Notes due 2022 (aggregate principal amount of $1,200,000,000) in November 2014; as lead arranger with
respect to B/E Aerospace's term loan (aggregate principal amount of $2,200,000,000) put in place in November 2014; as B/E Aerospace's
financial advisor in connection with the KLX spin-off in December 2014; and as a participant in B/E Aerospace's revolving credit facility
(aggregate principal amount of $600,000,000) put in place in December 2014. During the two year period ended October 23, 2016,
Goldman Sachs has received compensation for financial advisory and/or underwriting services provided by its Investment Banking
Division directly to B/E Aerospace and/or to its affiliates of approximately $9,900,000. During the two-year period ended October 23,

Investment Banking Division of Goldman Sachs has received compensation. Goldman Sachs may also in the future provide financial
advisory and/or underwriting services to B/E Aerospace, Rockwell Collins and their respective affiliates for which the Investment Banking
Division of Goldman Sachs may receive compensation.

        The B/E Aerospace Board selected Goldman Sachs as its financial advisor because it is an internationally recognized investment
banking firm that has substantial experience in transactions similar to the merger. Pursuant to a letter agreement dated September 6, 2016,
B/E Aerospace engaged Goldman Sachs to act as its financial advisor in connection with the merger. The engagement letter between
B/E Aerospace and Goldman Sachs provides for a transaction fee that is estimated, based on the information available as of the date of
announcement, at approximately $27.3 million, $5 million of which became payable at announcement of the transaction, and the
remainder of which is contingent upon consummation of the transaction. In addition, B/E Aerospace has agreed to reimburse Goldman
Sachs for certain of its expenses, including attorneys' fees and disbursements, and to indemnify Goldman Sachs and related persons against
various liabilities, including certain liabilities under the federal securities laws.

Financial Analyses by Financial Co-Advisors 

        The following is a summary of the material financial analyses delivered by Citigroup and Goldman Sachs, referred to as the financial
co-advisors, to the B/E Aerospace Board in connection with rendering their respective opinions described above. The following summary,
however, does not purport to be a complete description of the financial analyses performed by the financial co-advisors, nor does the order
of analyses described represent relative importance or weight given to those analyses by the financial co-advisors. Some of the summaries
of the financial analyses include information presented in tabular format. The tables must be read together with the full text of each
summary and are alone not a complete description of the financial co-advisors' financial analyses. Except as otherwise noted, the following
quantitative information, to the extent that it is based on market data, is based on market data as it existed on or before October 20, 2016,
and is not necessarily indicative of current market conditions.

        The preparation of financial opinions is a complex process involving various determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant
methods of financial analysis and the application of those methods to the particular circumstances and, therefore, financial opinions are not
readily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. Selecting portions of the analyses or of the summary set forth below,
without considering the analyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view of the processes underlying each financial co-advisor
opinion. In arriving at their respective fairness determinations, the financial co-advisors considered the results of all of their analyses and
did not attribute any particular weight to any factor or analysis considered by them. Rather, each financial co-advisor made its
determination as to fairness on the basis of its experience and professional judgment after considering the results of all of its analyses. No
company or transaction used in the above analyses as a comparison is directly comparable to B/E Aerospace or Rockwell Collins or the
contemplated merger.

        The financial co-advisors prepared these analyses for purposes of providing their respective opinions to the B/E Aerospace Board as
to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders (other than Rockwell Collins and its affiliates) of outstanding shares of
common stock of B/E Aerospace, as of the date of the opinions, of the merger consideration to be paid to such holders pursuant to the
merger agreement. These analyses do not purport to be appraisals nor do they necessarily reflect the prices at which businesses or
securities actually may be sold. Analyses based upon forecasts of future results are not necessarily indicative of actual future results, which
may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by these analyses. Because these analyses are inherently subject to uncertainty,
being based upon numerous factors or events beyond the control of the parties or their respective advisors, none of B/E Aerospace,
Rockwell Collins, Citigroup, Goldman

Sachs or any other person assumes responsibility if future results are materially different from those forecast.

        The merger consideration was determined through arm's-length negotiations between B/E Aerospace and Rockwell Collins, rather
than by any financial advisor, and was approved by the B/E Aerospace Board. The financial co-advisors provided advice to B/E Aerospace
during these negotiations. The financial co-advisors did not, however, recommend any specific amount of consideration to B/E Aerospace
or the B/E Aerospace Board or that any specific amount of consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration for the transaction.

        As described above, each financial co-advisor's opinion to the B/E Aerospace Board was one of many factors taken into consideration
by the B/E Aerospace Board in making its determination to approve the merger agreement. The foregoing summary does not purport to be
a complete description of the analyses performed by the financial co-advisors in connection with their respective fairness opinions and is
qualified in its entirety by reference to their respective written opinions attached as Annex C for Citigroup and Annex D for Goldman
Sachs.

        Historical Stock Trading Analysis.    The financial co-advisors first calculated $62.00 as the implied value of the per share merger
consideration (which we refer to as the "implied per share consideration") by adding the cash consideration of $34.10 per share of
B/E Aerospace common stock to $27.90, the implied value of the stock portion of the per share merger consideration based on the closing
price per share of Rockwell Collins common stock on October 20, 2016.

        The financial co-advisors then reviewed the historical trading prices for B/E Aerospace common stock and compared the implied per
share consideration to the closing price per share of B/E Aerospace common stock as of October 20, 2016, the volume weighted average
prices per share of B/E Aerospace common stock for the 30-day and 90-day periods ended October 20, 2016, the intra-day high price per
share of B/E Aerospace common stock for the 52-week period ended October 20, 2016, and the closing price per share of B/E Aerospace
common stock as of July 20, 2016 (the date of the initial meeting between the managements of B/E Aerospace and Rockwell Collins to
discuss a potential merger).

        This analysis indicated that the implied per share consideration to be paid to the holders (other than Rockwell Collins and its
affiliates) of outstanding shares of common stock of B/E Aerospace pursuant to the merger agreement represented:

• a premium of 22.4% to the closing price of $50.65 per share of B/E Aerospace common stock as of October 20, 2016; 

• a premium of 22.5% to the volume weighted average price of $50.61 per share of B/E Aerospace common stock for the 30-
day period ended October 20, 2016; 

• a premium of 28.4% to the volume weighted average price of $48.30 per share of B/E Aerospace common stock for the 90-
day period ended October 20, 2016; 

• a premium of 16.4% to the 52-week intraday high price of $53.25 per share of B/E Aerospace common stock for the 52-
week period ended October 20, 2016; and 

• a premium of 33.8% to the closing price of $46.34 per share of B/E Aerospace common stock as of July 20, 2016.

        Implied Premia Analysis for U.S. Transactions.    For each year from 2013 through 2016 (as of October 6, 2016), the financial co-
advisors calculated, using publicly available information, the first quartile, median and third quartile one-day unaffected stock price premia
paid in such year for acquisition transactions announced in such year (expressed as a percentage of the merger consideration on the trading
day prior to either (i) the announcement of the transaction or (ii) the date on which either the target confirmed a sale process or merger
talks in the six months leading up to the

transaction or rumors surfaced in the month leading up to the transaction). This analysis covered transactions announced or completed in
this time period involving U.S. domiciled companies where the consideration exceeded $500 million and consisted of a mixture of cash
and stock. The analysis excluded transactions in the financial institutions and real estate sectors as well as transactions with premia below
0%. The analysis indicated a first quartile, median and third quartile one-day unaffected stock premia of 18.5%, 27.7% and 41.7%,
respectively. The financial co-advisors then multiplied the 18.5%-41.7% range of premia to the closing price of $51.35 per share of
B/E Aerospace common stock as of October 17, 2016, which resulted in an illustrative range of prices per share of B/E Aerospace
common stock of $60.75 to $72.75 (rounded to the nearest $0.25).

        Selected Transactions Analysis.    The financial co-advisors analyzed certain publicly available information relating to the following
selected transactions in the aerospace and defense industry since September 2011:

• Berkshire Hathaway Inc./Precision Castparts Corp. (announced August 2015) 

• RBC Bearings Incorporated/Sargent Aerospace and Defense (announced March 2015) 

• TransDigm Group Incorporated/Telair Cargo Group (announced February 2015) 

• Cobham plc/Aeroflex Inc. (announced May 2014) 

• Rockwell Collins, Inc./Aeronautical Radio, Incorporated (announced August 2013) 

• General Electric Company/Avio S.p.A. (announced December 2012) 

• United Technologies Corporation/Goodrich Corporation (announced September 2011)

        For each of the selected transactions, the financial co-advisors calculated and compared FV as a multiple of the target's EBITDA for
the last 12 months as most recently disclosed at the time of the announcement of the transaction (which we refer to as the FV/LTM
EBITDA Multiple). While none of the companies that participated in the selected transactions are directly comparable to B/E Aerospace,
the target companies that participated in the selected transactions are companies with operations that, for the purposes of analysis, may be
considered similar to certain of B/E Aerospace's results, market size and product profile. In addition, the financial co-advisors calculated
the FV/LTM EBITDA Multiple of B/E Aerospace, using the implied per share consideration and B/E Aerospace's EBITDA for the
12 months ended September 30, 2016 as provided to the financial co-advisors by the management of B/E Aerospace.

        The following tables present the results of this analysis:

        The financial co-advisors identified an illustrative range of FV/LTM EBITDA Multiples of 11.6x to 13.6x based on the 12.6x median
FV/LTM EBITDA Multiple. The financial co-advisors then applied the 11.6x to 13.6x range of FV/LTM EBITDA Multiples to
B/E Aerospace's EBITDA for the last 12 months ended September 30, 2016 as provided to the financial co-advisors by the management of
B/E Aerospace, which resulted in a range of illustrative prices per share of B/E Aerospace common stock of $50.00 to $61.75 (rounded to
the nearest $0.25).

        Illustrative Present Value of Future Share Price Analysis—B/E Aerospace Standalone.    The financial co-advisors performed an
illustrative analysis of the implied present value of the future price per share of B/E Aerospace common stock (including the present value
of projected dividends).

        The financial co-advisors first calculated an illustrative range of the implied future values per share of B/E Aerospace common stock
as of the end of each of the fiscal years 2017 to 2020, respectively, by applying a forward earnings per share multiple range of 13.5x to
15.0x to the estimated earnings per share for B/E Aerospace for each of the fiscal years from 2018 to 2021 using the Forecasts. The
financial co-advisors then discounted these implied future values per share to determine the implied present values as of September 30,
2016 using an illustrative discount rate of 10.0% reflecting an estimate of B/E Aerospace's cost of equity. The financial co-advisors then,
for each of the fiscal years 2017 to 2020, used the same illustrative discount rate to discount the future values per share of projected
dividends from September 30, 2016 through and including the applicable fiscal year (using the Forecasts) to determine the implied present
values of such projected dividends as of September 30, 2016, and added such implied present values of the projected dividends to the
range of present values it derived above. This analysis resulted in a range of implied present values of $52.29 to $61.06 per share of
B/E Aerospace common stock.

        The financial co-advisors also used the Forecasts to calculate an illustrative range of the implied future values per share of
B/E Aerospace common stock as of the end of each of the fiscal years 2017 to 2020, respectively, by applying a price to next 12 months
earnings per share multiple of 14.2x, which represented B/E Aerospace's standalone next 12 months earnings per share multiple as of
October 17, 2016 based on IBES estimates, to the earnings per share of B/E Aerospace for each of the fiscal years from 2018 to 2021 using
the Forecasts and then discounted these implied future values per share to determine the implied present values as of September 30, 2016
using an illustrative discount rate range of 9.0% to 10.5%, reflecting an estimate of B/E Aerospace's cost of equity. The financial co-
advisors then, for each of the fiscal years 2017 to 2020, used the same illustrative range of discount rates to discount the future values per
share of projected dividends from September 30, 2016 through and including the applicable fiscal year (using the Forecasts) to determine a
range of the implied present values of such projected dividends as of September 30, 2016, and added such range of implied present values
of the projected dividends to the range of present values it derived above. This analysis resulted in a range of implied present values of
$54.64 to $60.23 per share of B/E Aerospace common stock.

        Illustrative Present Value of Future Share Price Analysis—Rockwell Collins Standalone.    The financial co-advisors performed an
illustrative analysis of the implied present value of the future price per share of Rockwell Collins common stock (including the present
value of projected dividends).

        The financial co-advisors first calculated an illustrative range of the implied future values per share of Rockwell Collins common
stock for each of the fiscal years 2017 to 2020, respectively, by applying a forward earnings per share multiple range of 14.0x to 15.5x to
the estimated earnings per share of Rockwell Collins for each of the fiscal years from 2018 to 2021 using the Forecasts and then
discounted these implied future values per share to determine the implied present values as of September 30, 2016 using an illustrative
discount rate of 8.5%, reflecting an estimate of Rockwell Collins' cost of equity. The financial co-advisors then, for each of the fiscal years
2017 to 2020, used the same illustrative discount rate to discount the future values per share of projected dividends from September 30,
2016 through and including the applicable fiscal year (using the Forecasts) to determine the implied present values of such projected
dividends as of September 30, 2016, and added such implied present values of

the projected dividends to the range of present values it derived above. This analysis resulted in a range of implied present values of
$75.14 to $96.92 per share of Rockwell Collins common stock.

        The financial co-advisors also calculated an illustrative range of the implied future values per share of Rockwell Collins common
stock for each of the fiscal years 2017 to 2020, respectively, by applying a price to next 12 months earnings per share multiple of 14.8x,
which represented Rockwell Collins' standalone next 12 month earnings per share multiple as of October 17, 2016 based on IBES
estimates, to the earnings per share for Rockwell Collins for each of the fiscal years from 2018 to 2021 using the Forecasts and then
discounted these implied future values per share to determine the implied present values as of September 30, 2016 using an illustrative
discount rate range of 7.5% to 9.0%, reflecting an estimate of Rockwell Collins' cost of equity. The financial co-advisors then, for each of
the fiscal years 2017 to 2020, used the same illustrative range of discount rates to discount the future values per share of projected
dividends from September 30, 2016 through and including the applicable fiscal year (using the Forecasts) to determine a range of the
implied present values of such projected dividends as of September 30, 2016, and added such range of implied present values of the
projected dividends to the range of present values it derived above. This analysis resulted in a range of implied present values of $78.99 to
$96.17 per share of Rockwell Collins common stock.

        Illustrative Present Value of Future Pro Forma Combined Company Share Price Analysis Plus Cash Consideration.    The financial
co-advisors performed an illustrative analysis of the implied present value of the future price per share of the combined company's
common stock (including the present value of projected dividends) pro forma for consummation of the merger to determine an illustrative
range of the implied present values of the portion of the per share merger consideration consisting of Rockwell Collins common stock and
added the per share cash consideration to be paid pursuant to the merger to determine an illustrative range of the implied present values of
the per share merger consideration into which each share of B/E Aerospace common stock converts in the merger.

        The financial co-advisors calculated the implied future values per share of the pro forma combined company's common stock for each
of the fiscal years 2017 to 2020, respectively, by applying a price to next 12 months earnings per share multiple of 14.6x, which
represented the blended next 12 month earnings per share multiple for B/E Aerospace and Rockwell Collins as of October 17, 2016 based
on IBES estimates, to the earnings per share of the pro forma combined company for each of the fiscal years from 2018 to 2021 using the
Forecasts (including the Synergies), and then discounted these implied future values per share to determine the implied present values as
of September 30, 2016 using an illustrative discount rate range of 8.5% to 10%, reflecting an estimate of the pro forma combined
company's cost of equity. The financial co-advisors then, for each of the fiscal years 2017 to 2020, used the same illustrative range of
discount rates to discount the future values per share of projected dividends from September 30, 2016 through and including the applicable
fiscal year (using the Forecasts and including the Synergies) to determine a range of the implied present values of such projected dividends
as of September 30, 2016, and added such range of implied present values of the projected dividends to the range of present values it
derived above. The financial co-advisors then multiplied the resulting range of implied present values for shares (which included the
present values of project dividends) of the pro forma combined company's common stock by an assumed exchange ratio of Rockwell
Collins common stock for each share of B/E Aerospace stock (determined by using the closing price per share of Rockwell Collins
common stock on October 17, 2016), and added the product of that calculation to the $34.10 in per share cash consideration to be paid to
holders of B/E Aerospace common stock in the merger. This analysis resulted in a range of implied present values of the per share merger
consideration, into which each share of B/E Aerospace common stock converts in the merger, of $63.17 to $67.57.

        Illustrative Discounted Cash Flow Analysis—B/E Aerospace Standalone.    Using the Forecasts, the financial co-advisors performed
an illustrative discounted cash flow analysis on B/E Aerospace. Using discount rates ranging from 7.75% to 9.25%, reflecting estimates of
B/E Aerospace's weighted average

cost of capital and derived by application of the Capital Asset Pricing Model, which takes into account certain company-specific metrics,
including B/E Aerospace's target capital structure, the cost of long-term debt, after-tax yield on permanent excess cash, if any, forecast tax
rate and beta, as well as certain financial metrics for the United States financial markets generally, the financial co-advisors discounted to
present value as of September 30, 2016, (i) estimates of unlevered free cash flow for B/E Aerospace for the fourth calendar quarter of 2016
and the calendar years 2017 through 2021 as reflected in the Forecasts and (ii) a range of illustrative terminal values for B/E Aerospace,
which was calculated by applying a last 12 months EBITDA multiple ranging from 10.5x to 12.0x to the terminal year estimate of the last
12 months of EBITDA for B/E Aerospace, as reflected in the Forecasts. The financial co-advisors derived ranges of illustrative FVs for
B/E Aerospace by adding the ranges of present values derived above. The financial co-advisors then subtracted from the range of
illustrative FVs it derived for B/E Aerospace the $1.938 billion of net debt of B/E Aerospace as of September 30, 2016 as provided by the
management of B/E Aerospace to derive a range of illustrative equity values for B/E Aerospace. The financial co-advisors then divided
this range of illustrative equity values by the number of fully diluted outstanding shares of B/E Aerospace as provided by the management
of B/E Aerospace to derive a range of illustrative present values ranging from $59.15 to $73.02 per share of B/E Aerospace common stock.

        Illustrative Discounted Cash Flow Analysis—Rockwell Collins Standalone.    Using the Forecasts, the financial co-advisors
performed an illustrative discounted cash flow analysis on Rockwell Collins. Using discount rates ranging from 7.00% to 8.00%,
reflecting estimates of Rockwell Collin's weighted average cost of capital and derived by application of the Capital Asset Pricing Model,
which takes into account certain company-specific metrics, including Rockwell Collins' target capital structure, the cost of long-term debt,
after-tax yield on permanent excess cash, if any, forecast tax rate and beta, as well as certain financial metrics for the United States
financial markets generally, the financial co-advisors discounted to present value as of September 30, 2016, (i) estimates of unlevered free
cash flow for Rockwell Collins for the fiscal years ending on September 30, 2017 through September 30, 2021 as reflected in the Forecasts
and (ii) a range of illustrative terminal values for Rockwell Collins, which was calculated by applying a last 12 months EBITDA multiple
ranging from 9.5x to 11.0x to the terminal year estimate of the last 12 months of EBITDA for Rockwell Collins, as reflected in the
Forecasts. The financial co-advisors derived ranges of illustrative FVs for Rockwell Collins by adding the ranges of present values derived
above. The financial co-advisors then subtracted from the range of illustrative FVs it derived for Rockwell Collins the $1.755 billion of net
debt of Rockwell Collins as of September 30, 2016, as provided by the management of Rockwell Collins and as approved for the financial
co-advisors' use by B/E Aerospace, to derive a range of illustrative equity values for Rockwell Collins. The financial co-advisors then
divided this range of illustrative equity values by the number of fully diluted outstanding shares of Rockwell Collins, as provided by the
management of Rockwell Collins and as approved for the financial co-advisors' use by B/E Aerospace, to derive a range of illustrative
present values ranging from $104.52 to $125.33 per share of Rockwell Collins common stock.

        Illustrative Discounted Cash Flow Analysis—Pro Forma for Combined Company Plus Cash Consideration.    Using the Forecasts
(including the Synergies), the financial co-advisors performed an illustrative discounted cash flow analysis on the pro forma combined
company to determine an illustrative range of implied present values of the portion of the per share merger consideration consisting of
Rockwell Collins common stock and added the per share cash consideration to be paid pursuant to the merger to determine an illustrative
range of the implied present values of the per share merger consideration into which each share of B/E Aerospace common stock converts
in the merger. Using discount rates ranging from 7.25% to 8.50%, reflecting estimates of the pro forma combined company's weighted
average cost of capital and derived by application of the Capital Asset Pricing Model, which takes into account certain company-specific
metrics, including the pro forma combined company's target capital structure, the cost of long-term debt, after-tax yield on permanent

if any, forecast tax rate and beta, as well as certain financial metrics for the United States financial markets generally, the financial co-
advisors discounted to present value as of September 30, 2016, (i) estimates of unlevered free cash flow for the pro forma combined
company for the fiscal years ending on September 30, 2017 through September 30, 2021 as reflected in the Forecasts and including the
Synergies, and (ii) a range of illustrative terminal values for the pro forma combined company, which was calculated by applying a last 12
months EBITDA multiple ranging from 9.75x to 11.25x to the terminal year estimate of last 12 months EBITDA for the pro forma
combined company, as reflected in the Forecasts and including the Synergies. The financial co-advisors derived ranges of illustrative FVs
for the pro forma combined company by adding the ranges of present values derived above. The financial co-advisors then subtracted from
the range of illustrative FVs they derived for the pro forma combined company the $7.278 billion of pro forma net debt of the pro forma
combined company, assuming the merger closed on December 31, 2016, as provided by the managements of B/E Aerospace and Rockwell
Collins, and approved for the financial co-advisors use by B/E Aerospace, to derive a range of illustrative equity values for the pro forma
combined company. The financial co-advisors then divided this range of illustrative equity values by the number of fully diluted
outstanding shares of the pro forma combined company, as provided by the managements of B/E Aerospace and Rockwell Collins and
approved for the financial co-advisors use by B/E Aerospace, to derive a range of illustrative present values per share for the combined
company's common stock. The financial co-advisors then multiplied the resulting range of implied present values per share of the pro
forma combined company's common stock by an assumed exchange ratio of Rockwell Collins common stock for each share of
B/E Aerospace stock (determined by using the closing price per share of Rockwell Collins common stock on October 17, 2016), and added
the product of that calculation to the $34.10 in per share cash consideration to be paid to holders of B/E Aerospace common stock in the
merger. This analysis resulted in a range of implied present values of the per share merger consideration, into which each share of
B/E Aerospace common stock converts in the merger, of $69.13 to $78.09.

        Selected Companies Analysis.    The financial co-advisors reviewed and compared certain financial information for B/E Aerospace to
corresponding financial information, ratios and public market multiples for the following publicly traded corporations in the aerospace and
defense industry (collectively referred to as the selected companies):

• Astronics Corporation, 

• Esterline Technologies Corporation, 

• Meggit PLC, 

• Moog Inc., 

• Rockwell Collins, Inc., 

• Woodward, Inc., and 

• Zodiac Aerospace, S.A.

        Although none of the selected companies is directly comparable to B/E Aerospace, the companies included were chosen because they
are publicly traded companies with operations that, for purposes of analysis, may be considered similar to certain operations of
B/E Aerospace. The quantitative information used in this analysis, to the extent that it is based on market data, was based on market data
as of October 17, 2016.

        The financial co-advisors also calculated and compared various financial multiples and ratios using information they obtained from
SEC filings and IBES estimates. With respect to the selected companies, the financial co-advisors calculated the ratio of the price of a
share of common stock of the selected companies (using the applicable closing market price per share as of October 17, 2016) to estimated
earnings per share (which is referred to as the P/E Ratio) for calendar year 2017, and firm

cash and cash equivalents (which is referred to as FV), as a multiple of projected earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization (which is referred to as EBITDA, and such multiple is referred to as the FV/EBITDA Multiple) for calendar year 2017. The
multiples and ratios for each of the selected companies were based on IBES estimates. The following tables present the results of this
analysis:

        Calculated using IBES estimates.    Range and median include B/E Aerospace multiples calculated using IBES estimates.

        For reference purposes, the financial co-advisors identified an illustrative range of P/E Ratios of 13.0x to 16.0x using the median P/E
Ratio of 14.5x for calendar year 2017. The financial co-advisors then multiplied the estimated earnings per share of B/E Aerospace
common stock for calendar year 2017, using the Forecasts, by the 13.0x to 16.0x illustrative range of P/E Ratios for calendar year 2017,
which resulted in an illustrative range of implied values of $47.50 to $58.50 per share of B/E Aerospace common stock (rounded to the
nearest $0.25).

        For reference purposes, the financial co-advisors also identified an illustrative range of FV/EBITDA Multiples of 8.0x to 11.0x using
the median FV/EBITDA Multiple of 9.5x for calendar year 2017. The financial co-advisors then multiplied the estimated EBITDA for
B/E Aerospace for calendar year 2017, using the Forecasts, by the 8.0x to 11.0x illustrative range of FV/EBITDA Multiples for calendar
year 2017, which resulted in an illustrative range of implied values of $32.25 to $51.50 per share of B/E Aerospace common stock
(rounded to the nearest $0.25).

        The financial co-advisors also calculated (a) FV/EBITDA Multiples for B/E Aerospace, using the implied per share consideration to
calculate FV and using the Forecasts for 2017 EBITDA, and (b) a P/E Ratio for B/E Aerospace, using the implied per share consideration
as the price per share and the Forecasts for earnings per share for 2017. The following table presents the results of this analysis:

Certain Financial Projections 

Certain Financial Projections Utilized by the Rockwell Collins Board of Directors and Rockwell Collins' Financial Advisor

        Rockwell Collins does not, as a matter of course, make long-term projections as to future performance available to the public other
than generally providing, on a quarterly basis, estimated ranges of certain expected financial results and operational metrics for the current
or impending fiscal year in its regular earnings press releases and other investor materials. Rockwell Collins avoids making public
projections for extended periods due to, among other things, the unpredictability of the underlying assumptions and estimates.

        In connection with the proposed transaction, certain non-public, unaudited financial projections regarding Rockwell Collins'
anticipated results of operations for fiscal years 2017 through 2021 were provided to the Rockwell Collins Board, Rockwell Collins'
financial advisor, J.P. Morgan, and to B/E Aerospace. Such projections are referred to as the Rockwell Collins management forecast. The
Rockwell Collins management forecast includes the results of projected acquisitions over the forecast period. Also, in connection with the
proposed transaction, certain non-public, unaudited financial projections regarding Rockwell Collins' anticipated results of operations for
fiscal years 2017 through 2021 excluding the results of projected acquisitions were provided to the Rockwell Collins Board, J.P. Morgan
and B/E Aerospace. Such projections are referred to as the Rockwell Collins stand-alone management forecast. The Rockwell Collins
management forecast and the Rockwell Collins stand-alone management forecast are the only financial forecasts provided by Rockwell
Collins to B/E Aerospace.

        The Rockwell Collins management forecast and Rockwell Collins stand-alone management forecast are based on numerous estimates
and assumptions. The 2017 amounts resulted from Rockwell Collins' operating plan process, and reflect a detailed forecast primarily
driven by Rockwell Collins' original equipment manufacturer production rate projections and other market insights into expected revenues,
as well as anticipated product line margins and discretionary spending. The 2017 amounts are consistent with the fiscal 2017 financial
guidance provided publicly on October 23, 2016. The 2018 to 2021 amounts resulted from Rockwell Collins' strategic and financial
planning process, and reflect more general market-level forecasts primarily driven by original equipment manufacturer rate projections and
other market growth rate projections, as well as anticipated portfolio margins and discretionary spending. The underlying assumptions
used in the strategic and financial planning process are generally based on information and market factors known to management in the
spring of 2016.

        In addition, the Rockwell Collins Board received and reviewed certain non-public, unaudited financial projections regarding
B/E Aerospace's anticipated results of operations for the fiscal years 2016 through 2021, which were prepared by B/E Aerospace's
management as described in the section of this joint proxy statement/prospectus entitled "—Certain Financial Projections Utilized by the
B/E Aerospace Board of Directors and B/E Aerospace's Financial Advisors" beginning on page 98. Rockwell Collins' management
reviewed and performed due diligence regarding such projections. Rockwell Collins' management made certain adjustments to the
B/E Aerospace management forecast described below. Such projections, as adjusted, are referred to as the adjusted B/E Aerospace
forecast.

        As discussed below, the B/E Aerospace management forecast is based on numerous estimates and assumptions. In preparing the
adjusted B/E Aerospace forecast, Rockwell Collins made adjustments to such forecast based on Rockwell Collins' view of key market
drivers such as air traffic growth rates, original equipment manufacturer delivery rates, aircraft fleet growth, as well as Rockwell Collins'
views of B/E Aerospace's competitiveness in each product line and its backlog levels.

        The forecasted financial information contained in this section "—Certain Financial Projections Utilized by the Rockwell Collins
Board of Directors and Rockwell Collins' Financial Advisor" was not prepared for public disclosure. The inclusion of this information in
this joint proxy statement/prospectus does not constitute an admission or representation by Rockwell Collins that the information is
material.

Issuance proposal or any other proposal at the Rockwell Collins special meeting.

        Rockwell Collins uses certain financial measures that are not in accordance with GAAP as supplemental measures to evaluate its
operational performance. While Rockwell Collins believes that non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information,
there are limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in
accordance with GAAP, are not reported by all of Rockwell Collins' competitors and may not be directly comparable to similarly titled
measures of Rockwell Collins' competitors due to potential differences in the exact method of calculation.

        The following is a summary of the Rockwell Collins management forecast prepared by senior management of Rockwell Collins and
given to B/E Aerospace, the Rockwell Collins Board and J.P. Morgan, in each case, prior to the execution of the merger agreement (based

Certain Financial Projections Utilized by the B/E Aerospace Board of Directors and B/E Aerospace's Financial Advisors

        B/E Aerospace does not, as a matter of course, create long-term projections as to future performance or make any other projections as
to future performance available to the public other than generally providing, from time to time, estimated ranges of certain expected
financial results and operational metrics for the current or impending fiscal year in its regular earnings press releases and other investor
materials. B/E Aerospace avoids making public projections for extended periods due to, among other things, the unpredictability of the
underlying assumptions and estimates. However, in connection with its evaluation of the proposed merger, B/E Aerospace's senior
management prepared certain non-public, unaudited financial projections regarding B/E Aerospace's anticipated results of operations for
fiscal years 2016 through 2021. Such projections were provided to B/E Aerospace's financial advisors, Citigroup and Goldman Sachs, and
to Rockwell Collins. Such projections are referred to as the B/E Aerospace management forecast. The B/E Aerospace management
forecast was not prepared for public disclosure. The B/E Aerospace management forecast is based on numerous estimates and
assumptions. The outlook is developed in the context of assumed passenger traffic growth and sustained airline profitability. The forecasts
take into account awarded backlog with scheduled delivery dates, original equipment manufacturer rate projections, expected new product
introductions and anticipated program launches. The forecasts incorporate products produced for both new aircraft deliveries and
refurbishment of existing aircraft. The projections are based upon anticipated program margins with the continued benefit of cost reduction
initiatives and disciplined expense management. The inclusion of the B/E Aerospace management forecast in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus does not constitute an admission or representation by B/E Aerospace that the information is material. You should
note that projections included in the B/E Aerospace management forecast constitute forward-looking statements. See "Cautionary Note
Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" beginning on page 44 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

        In addition, the B/E Aerospace Board received and reviewed certain non-public, unaudited financial projections regarding Rockwell

Financial Projections Utilized by the B/E Aerospace Board of Directors and B/E Aerospace's Financial Advisors" beginning on page 98
are collectively referred to as the unaudited financial projections. While the unaudited financial projections summarized above in the
sections of this joint proxy statement/prospectus entitled "—Certain Financial Projections Utilized by the Rockwell Collins Board of
Directors and Rockwell Collins' Financial Advisor" beginning on page 95 and "—Certain Financial Projections Utilized by the
B/E Aerospace Board of Directors and B/E Aerospace's Financial Advisors" beginning on page 98 were prepared by the respective
managements of Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace in good faith and based on information available at the time of preparation, they
constitute forward-looking information and no assurance can be made regarding actual future events. The estimates and assumptions
underlying the unaudited financial projections involve judgments with respect to, among other things, future economic, competitive,
regulatory and financial market conditions and future business decisions that may not be realized and that are inherently subject to
significant uncertainties and contingencies, including, among others, risks and uncertainties described in the sections of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus entitled "Risk Factors" beginning on page 46 and "Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements"
beginning on page 44, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond the control of Rockwell Collins and B/E
Aerospace. There can be no assurance that the underlying assumptions or projected results will be realized, and actual results will likely
differ, and may differ materially, from those reflected in the unaudited financial projections, whether or not the merger is completed. As a
result, the unaudited financial projections cannot be considered predictive of actual future operating results, and this information should
not be relied on as such.

        The unaudited financial projections were prepared solely for internal use by Rockwell Collins or B/E Aerospace, as the case may be,
or their respective financial advisors, and not with a view toward public disclosure or with a view toward complying with the guidelines
established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation and presentation of prospective financial data,
published guidelines of the SEC regarding forward-looking statements and the use of non-GAAP measures or GAAP. In the view of
Rockwell Collins' management and B/E Aerospace's management, the respective forecasts prepared by them were prepared on a
reasonable basis based on the information available to Rockwell Collins' management and B/E Aerospace's management, respectively, at
the time of their preparation. The unaudited financial projections, however, are not facts and should not be relied upon as being indicative
of actual future results, and readers of this joint proxy statement/prospectus are cautioned not to place undue, or any, reliance on this
information. The inclusion of the unaudited financial projections in this joint proxy statement/prospectus is not an admission or
representation by Rockwell Collins or B/E Aerospace that such information is material or that the results contained in the prospective
financial information will be achieved. None of the unaudited financial projections reflect any impact of the merger or the other
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, except as noted herein. As a reminder, actual results may differ materially from those
contained in these unaudited financial projections.

        The unaudited financial projections summarized in this section were prepared by and are the responsibility of the management of
Rockwell Collins or B/E Aerospace, as the case may be. No independent registered public accounting firm has examined, compiled or
otherwise performed any procedures with respect to the prospective financial information contained in these financial forecasts and,
accordingly, no independent registered public accounting firm has expressed any opinion or given any other form of assurance with
respect thereto and no independent registered public accounting firm assumes any responsibility for the prospective financial information
or its achievability. The reports of the independent registered public accounting firms incorporated by reference into this joint proxy
statement/prospectus relate to the historical financial information of Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace, respectively. Such reports do

Governance of Rockwell Collins Following Completion of the Merger 

        The merger agreement provides that Rockwell Collins will take all necessary corporate action so that, upon and after the effective
time, the size of the Rockwell Collins Board will be increased by two members to a total of eleven, and two individuals selected by B/E
Aerospace who meet Rockwell Collins' independence criteria and are otherwise reasonably acceptable to Rockwell Collins will be
appointed to the Rockwell Collins Board. One such individual will serve as a member of the class of directors of the Rockwell Collins
Board with terms expiring in 2018, and the other will serve as a member of the class of directors of the Rockwell Collins Board with terms
expiring in 2020. Pursuant to this provision of the merger agreement, John T. Whates and Richard G. Hamermesh, both members of the
B/E Aerospace Board, were selected by B/E Aerospace to be appointed to the Rockwell Collins Board and are expected to serve as
members of the class of directors of the Rockwell Collins Board with terms expiring in 2018 and 2020, respectively. Other than such
additional directors, no changes to the Rockwell Collins Board are expected in connection with the consummation of the merger.

Interests of Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger 

Interests of Directors and Executive Officers of B/E Aerospace in the Merger

        In considering the recommendation of the B/E Aerospace Board that B/E Aerospace stockholders vote "FOR" the merger proposal,
B/E Aerospace stockholders should be aware that B/E Aerospace's directors and executive officers have interests in the merger that may be
different from, or in addition to, those of B/E Aerospace stockholders generally. The B/E Aerospace Board was aware of these interests
and considered them, among other matters, in approving the merger agreement and recommending that the B/E Aerospace stockholders
adopt the merger agreement.

        The following discussion sets forth certain of these interests in the merger of each person who has served as a non-employee director
or executive officer of B/E Aerospace since January 1, 2015. The amounts presented in the following discussion do not reflect the impact
of applicable withholding or other taxes.

Consideration Payable for Shares Converted Pursuant to the Merger Agreement

        As of January 18, 2017, the non-employee directors and executive officers of B/E Aerospace beneficially owned, in the aggregate,
269,296 shares of B/E Aerospace common stock (or approximately .3% of the outstanding shares as of such date), which for the purposes
of this discussion and the table immediately below does not include shares underlying outstanding unvested restricted stock awards or
shares subject to restricted stock units. Each share of B/E Aerospace common stock issued prior to the effective time of the merger (other
than canceled shares and dissenting shares) will be converted into the right to receive $34.10 per share in cash, without interest, from
Rockwell Collins and a number of validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of Rockwell Collins common stock equal to the
exchange ratio and, if applicable, cash in lieu of fractional shares of Rockwell Collins common stock. Upon the conversion of all shares of
B/E Aerospace common stock held by the non-employee directors and executive officers of B/E Aerospace, they would receive an
aggregate of $16,696,352 in cash, which includes the value of the shares of Rockwell Collins common stock to be issued pursuant to the
merger agreement, assuming an exchange ratio of 0.3604 pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement.

        The following table sets forth, as of January 18, 2017, the cash consideration and the value of the Rockwell Collins common stock

Treatment of Restricted Stock Awards

        As of January 18, 2017, non-employee directors and executive officers of B/E Aerospace held an aggregate of 257,531 restricted
stock awards, which are referred to as B/E Aerospace restricted stock awards, under a B/E Aerospace equity plan. As described below
under "The Merger Agreement—Treatment of B/E Aerospace Stock-Based Awards" beginning on page 130, each unvested B/E Aerospace
restricted stock award granted under a B/E Aerospace equity plan prior to the date of the merger agreement will vest as a result of the
merger (provided that to the extent that such award is subject to performance conditions, any performance conditions will be deemed to
have been satisfied at the maximum level) and such award will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive a lump sum cash
payment equal to the product of the merger consideration and the number of shares of B/E Aerospace common stock subject to such B/E
Aerospace restricted stock award, with the portion of the merger consideration that consists of shares of Rockwell Collins common stock
converted to a lump sum cash payment equal to the product of the applicable number of shares of Rockwell Collins common stock and the
stock price of Rockwell Collins common stock, as described in the merger agreement.

Table of Contents

        The following table provides information for the non-employee directors and executive officers of B/E Aerospace as of January 18,
2017, regarding the aggregate number of shares of B/E Aerospace common stock subject to outstanding unvested B/E Aerospace restricted
stock awards that will become vested upon consummation of the merger. The number of shares subject to B/E Aerospace restricted stock
awards provided in the following table does not include shares of B/E Aerospace common stock that are beneficially owned by the non-
employee directors and executive officers as provided in the table immediately above or shares underlying unvested restricted stock units.

Treatment of Restricted Stock Units

        As of January 18, 2017, non-employee directors and executive officers of B/E Aerospace held an aggregate of 395,622 restricted
stock units, which are referred to as B/E Aerospace RSU awards, under the B/E Aerospace equity plans. As described below under "—
Treatment of B/E Aerospace Stock-Based Awards" beginning on page 130, each unvested B/E Aerospace RSU award granted under a B/E
Aerospace equity plan prior to the date of the merger agreement will vest as a result of the merger (provided that to the extent that such
award is subject to performance conditions, any performance conditions will be deemed to have been satisfied at the maximum level,
which, in certain cases, is 200% of target) and such award will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive a lump sum cash
payment equal to the product of the merger consideration and the number of shares of B/E Aerospace common stock underlying such B/E
Aerospace RSU awards. Accordingly, the number of B/E Aerospace RSU awards for which vesting will accelerate set forth in the table
below will be greater than the number of RSU awards outstanding as of January 18, 2017.

        Consistent with past practice, each of Amin J. Khoury, Joseph T. Lower, and Ryan M. Patch, as well as two additional executive
officers, all of whose employment will terminate upon consummation of the merger, have been granted on November 15, 2016
B/E Aerospace RSU awards (time- and performance-based), which will vest in full (with performance-based restricted stock units vesting

the terms of the merger agreement. Mr. Lieberherr's November 2016 B/E Aerospace RSU awards that are outstanding prior to the effective
time of the merger, will be converted to a cash amount (with performance conditions deemed to be satisfied at 200% of target) payable on
the first anniversary of the consummation of the merger, provided that he has not resigned without "good reason" (as defined in his
employment agreement with Rockwell Collins, as described below). Pursuant to the transaction bonus agreements between B/E Aerospace
and each of Messrs. Khoury, Lieberherr, Patch, and Lower, as described further under "—Interests of Directors and Executive Officers in
the Merger—Transaction Bonuses" beginning on page 112, if such executive's employment is terminated prior to the consummation of the
merger due to the executive's death or disability, by B/E Aerospace for any reason or by the executive for "good reason" (as defined in the
executive's employment agreement), the executive will be entitled to the immediate full vesting of the executive's November 2016 B/E
Aerospace RSU awards (with performance-based RSUs vesting at 200% of target), with payment to be made upon the consummation of
the merger.

        As negotiated as part of the merger agreement, each outstanding B/E Aerospace RSU award that is granted by B/E Aerospace on or
following the date of the merger agreement other than the RSU awards described in the immediately preceding paragraph, pursuant to the
merger agreement, will upon the consummation of the merger be assumed by Rockwell Collins and converted into restricted stock unit
awards covering shares of Rockwell Collins common stock with performance-based B/E Aerospace RSU awards converting to time-based
restricted stock units of Rockwell Collins based on achievement of performance-based vesting conditions at 100% of target level.

        The following table provides information for each of the non-employee directors and executive officers of B/E Aerospace as of

Treatment of Non-Employee Director Stock Units

        As of January 18, 2017, non-employee directors of B/E Aerospace held an aggregate of 44,762 stock units under the B/E Aerospace
Amended and Restated Non-Employee Directors Stock and Deferred Compensation Plan, which is referred to as the non-employee
director plan. As described below under "—Treatment of B/E Aerospace Stock-Based Awards," beginning on page 118, each stock unit
payable in shares of B/E Aerospace common stock granted under the non-employee director plan that is outstanding immediately prior to
the effective time of the merger will be converted into the right to receive $34.10 per share in cash, without interest, from Rockwell
Collins and a number of validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of Rockwell Collins common stock equal to the exchange
ratio and, if applicable, cash in lieu of fractional shares of Rockwell Collins common stock.

        The following table provides information for each of the non-employee directors of B/E Aerospace as of January 18, 2017, regarding
the aggregate number of shares of B/E Aerospace common stock underlying outstanding stock units which will convert to a cash payment
and a number of shares of Rockwell Collins common stock pursuant to the merger agreement.

Potential Severance Payments in Connection with the Merger

        B/E Aerospace has entered into employment agreements with Amin J. Khoury, Werner Lieberherr, Joseph T. Lower, Sean J. Cromie,
Tommy G. Plant, and Ryan M. Patch, as well as two additional executive officers. The employment agreements for Messrs. Khoury,
Lieberherr, Lower, and Patch provide for automatic termination, severance payments, and certain other benefits in connection with a
change in control. Conversely, the employment agreements for Mr. Cromie and the two additional executive officers provide for certain
severance payments in the event of the executive's involuntary termination of employment in connection with a change in control, but do
not provide for automatic termination upon a change in control. The employment agreements generally provide for some variation of
termination payments equal to the executive's salary and certain other forms of

106

target. For each November 2016 B/E Aerospace RSU award subject to performance vesting conditions, the
amounts included in this column represent such award vesting at 200% of target for Messrs. Khoury,

consistent with past practice.

amount equal to a multiple of the executive's salary and/or other forms of compensation.

        In addition, pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, the existing employment agreements of Messrs. Cromie and Plant will be
amended to provide for severance payments equal to the greater of (1) two times the executive's 2017 base salary or (2) the termination
payments otherwise provided under the existing terms of the executive's employment agreement, subject to other terms and conditions
discussed below.

        The existing employment agreements of the two additional executive officers, whose employment will be terminated in connection
with the merger, will also be amended to provide for severance payments equal to the greater of (i) three times the executive's 2017 base
salary, as pursuant to a commitment in effect prior to the signing of the merger agreement, or (ii) the termination payments otherwise
provided under the existing terms of the executive's employment agreement, subject to other terms and conditions discussed below.

        Under the terms of Messrs. Khoury, Lieberherr, Lower, and Patch's employment agreements, upon the executive's termination, each
executive and B/E Aerospace will execute a mutual waiver and release of claims substantially in the form prescribed by their agreement.

        The merger will constitute a "change in control" under each employment agreement.

        The current employment agreements for Messrs. Khoury, Lieberherr, Lower, and Patch first became effective on September 15, 2014,
July 29, 2013, October 1, 2014, and July 29, 2013, respectively. The current agreements for Messrs. Cromie and Plant first became

merger and B/E Aerospace or its successor will pay Mr. Khoury a lump sum severance payment equal to the sum of the amounts provided
below:

• Any accrued and unpaid salary and benefits through the date of his termination;

periods of B/E Aerospace ending prior to the date of Mr. Khoury's termination; and 

• Payment of $11,870,000, which represents previously vested compensation which Mr. Khoury agreed to defer in
connection with the KLX spin-off until the termination of his employment.

        In addition, following any termination of his employment, Mr. Khoury and his spouse, for as long as they each may live, will be
entitled to (i) all medical, dental, and health benefits available from time to time to B/E Aerospace's executive officers and their spouses,
respectively, on similar terms and conditions as active employees are receiving on the date of Mr. Khoury's termination of employment
(provided that the level of such benefits is not less than the benefits available to Mr. Khoury on July 1, 2014, including, without limitation,
100% payment for or reimbursement of medical and dental services or costs incurred by Mr. Khoury and his family (i.e., his spouse, his
former spouse, his eligible dependents), the cost of which will be fully paid by B/E Aerospace) and (ii) the benefits available under B/E
Aerospace's executive medical reimbursement plan as of the date of Mr. Khoury's termination of employment, but in no event less than
those in effect as of July 1, 2014 (the "Post-Employment Benefits").

        Mr. Khoury's agreement provides that if his employment terminates at any time for any reason other than death or incapacity, B/E
Aerospace will retain him as a consultant for strategic planning, financial planning, and merger and acquisition advice as well as such
other services as may be mutually agreed by Mr. Khoury and B/E Aerospace for a five-year period. During the consulting term,

further provides that Mr. Khoury will also be entitled to continue to participate in all employee benefit plans, life insurance plans,
disability income plans, incentive compensation plans and other benefit plans, as may be from time to time in effect for executives of B/E
Aerospace generally, plus the Post-Employment Benefits.

        If any payments from B/E Aerospace to Mr. Khoury under the employment agreement or otherwise would be subject to an excise tax
under Section 4999 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, which is referred to as the Code (including any interest or
penalties), an accounting firm and a legal advisor to, or other advisor designated by, Mr. Khoury will determine whether to reduce those
payments so that they would not be subject to the excise tax. Such payments will be reduced only if doing so would result in greater net
after-tax proceeds being received by Mr. Khoury. B/E Aerospace will pay the expenses of the accounting firm, and will reimburse
Mr. Khoury for the fees of his legal or other advisor incurred in connection with such determination and any legal and accounting fees
incurred in connection with related disputes.

the effective time of the merger (including, without limitation, the benefit continuation, governing law, legal fees, and indemnification
provisions of Mr. Lieberherr's agreement with B/E Aerospace). The new agreement with Rockwell Collins also provides for the payment
of the severance amounts under Mr. Lieberherr's existing employment agreement pursuant to the terms of such agreement.

        Pursuant to the new employment agreement with Rockwell Collins, Mr. Lieberherr will serve as an Executive Vice President of
Rockwell Collins and Chief Operating Officer of Rockwell Collins' aircraft interior systems business unit for an indefinite employment
term. Mr. Lieberherr will receive an annual base salary of $875,000, which is subject to upward adjustment by the compensation

award, which will vest and become payable in a lump sum on the first anniversary of the effective date of the merger. In the event
Mr. Lieberherr's employment is terminated by Rockwell Collins without "cause" (as defined in his employment agreement with Rockwell
Collins) or he resigns for "good reason" (as defined in his employment agreement with Rockwell Collins), the retention award will vest
and be paid in a lump sum on the sixtieth day following the date of his termination, subject to Mr. Lieberherr's execution and non-
revocation of a mutual waiver and release of claims. Commencing in November 2017 and continuing throughout the term of his
employment, Mr. Lieberherr will be eligible to participate in any applicable equity compensation program of Rockwell Collins with terms
no less favorable than those provided to Rockwell Collins' other senior executives, provided that the grant date value of annual equity
awards granted by Rockwell Collins will have a target value of $1,300,000. Rockwell Collins will also make tax-deferred monthly
contributions equal to 7.5% of Mr. Lieberherr's monthly salary to the B/E Aerospace 2010 Deferred Compensation Plan (which is referred
to as the DCP). In addition, on January 1 of each year, Rockwell Collins will make a contribution to the DCP in an amount equal to 20%
of Mr. Lieberherr's salary in effect at that time. All contributions to the DCP will vest in full on the date of contribution.

        Mr. Lieberherr is subject to non-competition and non-solicitation obligations during his employment with Rockwell Collins and for
three years thereafter.

        Mr. Lieberherr's employment may be terminated by either himself or Rockwell Collins at any time and for any reason. In the event of
the termination of Mr. Lieberherr's employment due to his death or incapacity, Mr. Lieberherr or his designated beneficiary will receive
any accrued and unpaid salary, automobile allowance, vacation time, and benefits through the date of his termination (the "Lieberherr
Accrued Amounts") and any earned but unpaid bonuses payable, as determined by the compensation committee of Rockwell Collins, for
any fiscal periods ending prior to the termination. In the event of termination of Mr. Lieberherr's employment for any reason other than his
death or incapacity, Mr. Lieberherr will receive the Liberherr Accrued Amounts.

        If any payments from B/E Aerospace to Mr. Lower would be subject to an excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code, an accounting
firm and a legal or other advisor to Mr. Lower will determine whether to reduce those payments so that they would not be subject to the
excise tax. Such payments will be reduced only if doing so would result in greater net after-tax proceeds being received by Mr. Lower. B/E

        In addition, following any termination of his employment other than for cause, Mr. Patch, his spouse/domestic partner, and his
dependents, for a period of three years from his termination date, will be entitled to (i) all medical, dental, and health benefits available
from time to time to B/E Aerospace's executive officers on similar terms and conditions as active employees (provided that the level of
such benefits is not less than the benefits available to Mr. Patch on July 1, 2013), as well as 100% payment for and reimbursement of
medical and dental services and costs incurred by Mr. Patch, his spouse/domestic partner, and his dependents, the cost of which will be
fully paid by B/E Aerospace, and (ii) the benefits available under B/E Aerospace's executive medical reimbursement plan as of the date of
Mr. Patch's termination of employment, but in no event less than those in effect as of July 1, 2013.

        Should a dispute related to the payments due under Mr. Patch's employment agreement arise in connection with the consummation of
the merger, B/E Aerospace will pay all associated legal fees.

        If the severance payments and benefits provided under Mr. Patch's employment agreement would be subject to the excise taxes under
Section 409A of the Code, he is also entitled to receive (i) a payment sufficient to cover such excise taxes and (ii) an additional gross-up
payment sufficient to pay for the taxes arising as a result of that payment.

Grants of Retention Awards

        Pursuant to the merger agreement, Rockwell Collins will, upon consummation of the merger, make grants of Rockwell Collins cash
retention awards, which are referred to as parent retention awards, to Messrs. Cromie and Plant with a grant date value equal to 100% of,

Table of Contents

executive's continued employment through the date of the consummation of the merger. Each executive will be entitled to receive his
transaction bonus (contingent on the consummation of the merger on or before December 31, 2017), if his employment is terminated prior
to the consummation of the merger due to his death or disability, by B/E Aerospace for any reason or by the executive for "good reason"
(as defined in the executive's employment agreement). In addition, the transaction bonus agreements with Messrs. Lower and Patch
include a non-compete covenant covering the period during the executive's employment and 18 (for Mr. Lower) or 12 (for Mr. Patch)
months following the executive's termination.

        To the extent that any payments or benefits under the transaction bonus agreements, in combination with any other severance and
change in control payments and benefits, otherwise constitute "parachute payments" then such payments and benefits will be "cut-back" or
reduced to the extent necessary, such that no portion of the payments and benefits is subject to the imposition of excise taxes, but only if
the net amount of such payment and benefits, as so reduced (and after subtracting any additional taxes due on such reduced payments and
benefits) is greater than or equal to the net amount of such payments and benefits without such reduction (but after subtracting the net
amount of excise taxes and all additional taxes due on such unreduced payments and benefits).

Quantification of Potential Payments

        The severance payments and benefits to each executive officer (excluding the two additional executive officers) are set forth below in
"—Payments Upon a Change in Control and a Qualifying Termination," and assume the closing of the merger occurred on January 26,
2017, which is the latest practicable date prior to the filing of this proxy statement, and such executive officer's employment is terminated
by the executive officer for "good reason" (as defined in his November 2016 award agreement) or by the surviving corporation without
"cause" (as defined in the executive officer's employment agreement) (which we refer to as a qualifying termination), if applicable,
immediately after the closing of the merger. Payments included in "—Payments Upon a Change in Control and a Qualifying Termination"
assume that severance payments and benefits are provided under the applicable officer's employment agreement (which, in the case of
Mr. Lieberherr, refers to his new employment agreement with Rockwell Collins, and, in the case of Messrs. Cromie and Plant, will be the
executives' employment agreements, as such agreements will be amended in connection with the merger). The two additional executive
officers not covered under the table for "—Payments Upon a Change in Control and a Qualifying Termination" would be entitled to
receive an aggregate amount of approximately $3,017,122 pursuant to their employment agreements, as such agreements will be amended
in connection with the merger.

Indemnification and Insurance

        The merger agreement provides that, for six years following the effective time of the merger, Rockwell Collins or the surviving
corporation will provide current and former directors and officers of B/E Aerospace with exculpation, indemnification and advancement of
expenses no less favorable than currently provided by equivalent provisions of the B/E Aerospace's certificate of incorporation and
B/E Aerospace's bylaws as in effect immediately prior to the effective time of the merger. In addition, prior to the merger, B/E Aerospace
or Rockwell Collins will cause the surviving corporation as of or after the effective time, to purchase a six-year prepaid policy, with terms,
conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are no less favorable than the coverage provided under B/E Aerospace's existing policies
of directors' and officers' liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance, with respect to matters arising on or before the effective time,
including in connection with the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby (provided that B/E Aerospace will not pay,
and the surviving corporation will not be required to pay, in excess of 300% of the last annual premium paid by B/E Aerospace prior to the
date of the merger agreement in respect of such policy).

prior to, or upon the effectiveness of, the merger, assuming the closing of the merger occurred on January 18, 2017, which is the latest
practicable date prior to the filing of this proxy statement, (ii) that becomes payable upon the termination of employment of such NEO if
such termination is a qualifying termination and occurs immediately after the closing of the merger, as well as additional amounts payable
in connection with the termination or (iii) that otherwise relates to the merger. In connection with the merger, Mr. Lieberherr's existing
employment agreement with B/E Aerospace will be replaced by a new employment agreement with Rockwell Collins, pursuant to which
Rockwell Collins will continue to honor all the obligations of Mr. Lieberherr's existing agreement with B/E Aerospace that survive
following the effective time of the merger, as described more fully above under "—Severance Terms of Mr. Lieberherr's Employment
Agreement."

        The following table does not include any amount that would be payable upon any termination of service that is not in connection with
the merger.

        The payments described in the table below are made pursuant to the arrangements discussed in "—Potential Severance Payments in

        Rockwell Collins prepares its financial statements in accordance with GAAP. The transaction will be accounted for by applying the
acquisition method in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 805, Business Combinations, or ASC 805, which requires the
determination of the acquirer, the acquisition date, the fair value of assets and liabilities of the acquiree and the measurement of

115

target, equal to $491,877. For Mr. Patch, the amount in this column represents a cash severance payment equal to
$2,670,062 and a transaction bonus payment equal to $1,680,000. The transaction bonuses included in this column
are single-trigger benefits and all other cash amounts included in this column are double-trigger benefits and will be
paid upon termination of employment. However, pursuant to the employment agreements of Messrs. Khoury,
Lieberherr, Lower and Patch, termination will occur automatically upon consummation of the merger.

(2) Amounts shown reflect the value provided in respect of B/E Aerospace restricted stock awards and B/E Aerospace
RSU Awards, as more fully described above under "—Treatment of Restricted Stock Awards" and "—Treatment of
Restricted Stock Units." The amounts in this column are calculated based on a per share value of $59.53, which was
B/E Aerospace's average closing market price over the first five business days following the first public
announcement of the merger, as required by Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K, multiplied by the number of B/E
Aerospace restricted stock awards and B/E Aerospace RSU Awards outstanding on a presumed closing date of
January 18, 2017 and that would vest on a double trigger basis at the effective time of the merger. All amounts
included in this column are single-trigger benefits in that they will only be paid upon the consummation of the
merger. For Mr. Khoury, the amount in this column represents payments of $5,764,945 and $10,089,442 for his
unvested and accelerated B/E Aerospace restricted stock awards and B/E Aerospace RSU awards, respectively. For
Mr. Lieberherr, the amount in this column represents payments of $3,419,879 and $12,937,417 for his unvested and
accelerated B/E Aerospace restricted stock awards and B/E Aerospace RSU awards, respectively. For Mr. Lower, the
amount in this column represents payments of $1,597,071 and $5,277,632 for his unvested and accelerated B/E
Aerospace restricted stock awards and B/E Aerospace RSU awards, respectively. For Mr. Cromie, the amount in this
column represents payments of $829,789 and $2,244,757 for his unvested and accelerated B/E Aerospace restricted
stock awards and B/E Aerospace RSU awards, respectively. For Mr. Plant, the amount in this column represents
payments of $512,732 and $1,876,743 for his unvested and accelerated B/E Aerospace restricted stock awards and
B/E Aerospace RSU awards, respectively. For Mr. Patch, the amount in this column represents payments of $898,605
and $2,691,887 for his unvested and accelerated B/E Aerospace restricted stock awards and B/E Aerospace RSU
awards, respectively. 

(3) Amounts shown reflect continuation of all medical, dental and health benefits as well as the benefits under the
Amended and Restated Medical Care Reimbursement Plan for Executives of B/E Aerospace, Inc. The amounts
associated with the medical, dental and health benefits are calculated using 2016 enrollment rates and severance
agreement terms, and represent the value of coverage for one year post-termination. The amounts included in this
column are double-trigger benefits and will be paid upon termination of employment. However, pursuant to the
employment agreements of Messrs. Lieberherr and Patch, termination will occur automatically upon consummation
of the merger.

goodwill. The accounting guidance provides that in identifying the acquiring entity in a combination effected through an exchange of
equity interests, all pertinent facts and circumstances must be considered, including the relative voting rights of the stockholders of the
constituent companies in the combined entity, the composition of the board of directors and senior management of the surviving
corporation, the relative size of each company and the terms of the exchange of equity securities in the business combination, including
payment of any premium.

        Based on the fact that current Rockwell Collins Board members will represent a majority of the directors of the Rockwell Collins
Board immediately following completion of the transaction, Rockwell Collins stockholders will own approximately 80.8% of the stock of
the surviving corporation with B/E Aerospace stockholders receiving a premium (as of the date preceding the transaction announcement)
over the fair market value of their shares on such date, as well as other terms of the transaction, Rockwell Collins is considered to be the
acquirer of B/E Aerospace for accounting purposes.

        Accordingly, Rockwell Collins will allocate the purchase price to the fair value of B/E Aerospace's assets and liabilities at the
acquisition date. To the extent the net fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is less than the purchase price, goodwill will
be recognized for the difference. Currently, the preliminary purchase price allocation indicates that goodwill will be recognized because
the preliminary net fair value of the assets to be acquired and liabilities to be assumed is less than the preliminary purchase price.

        All unaudited pro forma condensed combined consolidated financial statements contained in this joint proxy statement/prospectus
were prepared using the acquisition method of accounting. The final allocation of the purchase price will be determined after the
transaction is completed and after completion of an analysis to determine the estimated net fair value of B/E Aerospace's assets and
liabilities. Accordingly, the final acquisition accounting adjustments may be materially different from the unaudited pro forma
adjustments. Any decrease in the estimated net fair value of the assets and liabilities of B/E Aerospace as compared to the unaudited pro
forma information included in this joint proxy statement/prospectus will have the effect of increasing the goodwill recognized related to
the transaction.

Regulatory Approvals Required for the Merger 

        To complete the merger, Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace must obtain approvals or consents from, or make filings with, a
number of United States federal, state and foreign antitrust regulators. We describe below the material United States federal, state and
foreign approvals. Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace are not currently aware of any other material governmental consents, approvals or
filings that are required prior to the parties' completion of the transaction other than those we describe below. If additional approvals,
consents and filings are required to complete the transaction, Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace intend to seek such consents and
approvals and make such filings.

        Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace expect to complete the transaction in the spring of 2017. Although Rockwell Collins and B/E
Aerospace believe that they will receive the required consents and approvals described below to complete the transaction, we cannot give
any assurance as to the timing of these consents and approvals or as to Rockwell Collins' and B/E Aerospace's ultimate ability to obtain
such consents or approvals (or any additional consents or approvals which may otherwise become necessary) or that we will obtain such
consents or approvals on terms and subject to conditions satisfactory to Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace. The receipt of the regulatory
approvals (as described hereinafter) is a condition to the obligation of each of Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace to complete the
merger. For more information about the receipt of regulatory approvals as a condition to closing under the merger agreement, see the
section entitled "The Merger Agreement—Covenants and Agreements—Appropriate Actions; Consents; Filings" beginning on page 139.

Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act

        The merger is subject to the requirements of the HSR Act and the related rules and regulations, which provide that certain
transactions may not be completed until required information has been furnished to the DOJ and the FTC and until certain waiting periods
have been terminated, have expired or approval has been obtained. The HSR Act requires Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace to observe
a 30-day waiting period after the submission of their HSR filings before consummating their transaction, unless the waiting period is
terminated early.

        On November 7, 2016, each of Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace filed a Notification and Report Form under the HSR Act with
the DOJ and the FTC, which filings started the initial 30-day waiting period required by the HSR Act. The required 30-day waiting period
expired at 11:59 Eastern time on December 7, 2016.

Other Regulatory Approvals

        The merger is also subject to antitrust review by governmental authorities in several foreign jurisdictions in which the companies
have a sufficient market presence to require filings. The parties are making filings in Europe, China, the Philippines, South Korea and
Turkey.

Europe

        Based on the businesses in which Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace are engaged, a merger filing with the European Commission,
which is referred to as the EC, and observation of the applicable review period under the EU Merger Regulation (Council Regulation (EC)
No. 139/2004) is required before the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby may close. The initial review period is
25 EC working days from filing of the EU notification, and can be extended to 35 EC working days if commitments are offered by the
parties (Phase I) or by an additional 20 EC working days at the request of Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace. The review period may be
further extended for an additional 90 EC working days or for an even longer period of time for an in-depth investigation (Phase II).

China

        Based on the businesses in which Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace are engaged, a merger notification will be made to the Anti-
Monopoly Bureau of the Ministry of Commerce of China. Under the anti-monopoly law, the transactions may not be consummated until
the expiration of a 30 calendar day review period following the complete filing of a notification concerning the merger agreement and the
transactions contemplated thereby (Phase I). The review period may be extended for an additional 90 calendar days (Phase II) and further
for an additional 60 calendar days in the event of an in-depth investigation (Phase III).

South Korea

        Based on the businesses in which Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace are engaged, an antitrust notification is required to the Korea
Fair Trade Commission, which is referred to as the KFTC, Under the Monopoly Regulation and Fair Trade Act, the transactions may not
be consummated until the expiration of a 30 calendar day review period following the complete filing of a notification concerning the
merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby (Phase I). The review period may be extended for an additional 90 calendar
days at the KFTC's discretion (Phase II).

Philippines

        Based on the businesses in which Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace are engaged, a merger notification must be made to the
Philippine Competition Commission. Under the Philippine Competition Act, the transactions may not be consummated until the expiration
of a 30 calendar day review period following the complete filing of a notification concerning the merger agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby (Phase I). The review period may be extended for an additional 60 calendar days for an in-depth investigation
(Phase II).

Turkey

        Based on the businesses in which Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace are engaged, Turkish competition law requires notification of
and approval by the Turkish Competition Authority because the merger exceeds certain thresholds. The transactions may not be
consummated until the expiration of a 30 calendar day review period following receipt of the complete notification (Phase I). The review
period may be extended for an additional 6 months at the Authority's discretion (Phase II).

Treatment of B/E Aerospace's Existing Debt; Financing

        In connection with the merger, the parties intend to terminate B/E Aerospace's existing revolving credit facility and term loan facility.
Rockwell Collins' obligation to complete the merger is not conditioned upon its obtaining financing. Rockwell Collins anticipates that
approximately $3.6 billion will be required to pay the aggregate cash portion of the merger consideration to the B/E Aerospace
stockholders. Rockwell Collins intends to fund the cash component of the merger through sources of debt financing.

        For a more complete description of sources of funding for the merger, see "—Source of Funding for the Merger" beginning on page
123.

Treatment of B/E Aerospace Stock-Based Awards 

Treatment of B/E Aerospace Restricted Stock Awards and RSU Awards

        Upon completion of the merger, each outstanding award of B/E Aerospace restricted stock and each B/E Aerospace restricted stock
unit award that in each case was granted prior to the date of the merger agreement will (i) become fully vested and, to the extent such
award is subject to performance conditions, such performance conditions will be deemed satisfied at the maximum level and (ii) be
cancelled and converted into the right to receive a lump sum cash payment per share of B/E Aerospace common stock underlying such
award equal to the value of the per share merger consideration less any applicable withholding taxes. Upon completion of the merger,
except for outstanding restricted stock unit awards granted to the executive officers of B/E Aerospace in November 2016, consistent with
past practice, which will be cancelled and converted into a cash payment pursuant to their terms, each outstanding award of B/E Aerospace
restricted stock and each B/E Aerospace restricted stock unit award that in each case was granted on or following the date of the merger
agreement will be assumed by Rockwell Collins and converted into a Rockwell Collins award of restricted stock or restricted stock unit
award, as applicable, which will vest subject to the grantee's continued service with Rockwell Collins or its affiliates through each
applicable vesting date (with any performance conditions that were applicable to the B/E Aerospace award deemed satisfied at target level
performance and following the closing, the converted Rockwell Collins award subject only to time-based vesting) covering a number of
shares of Rockwell Collins common stock (rounded down to the nearest whole share) determined by multiplying the number of shares of
B/E Aerospace that were subject to the B/E Aerospace award by a ratio of the value of the merger consideration divided by the Rockwell
Collins stock price (with the value of the stock consideration portion of the merger consideration determined by multiplying the number of
such shares of Rockwell Collins common stock by the Rockwell Collins stock price).

Treatment of B/E Aerospace Stock Units

        Each stock unit credited to the account of any current or former director under the B/E Aerospace Amended and Restated Non-
Employee Directors Stock and Deferred Compensation Plan that is outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger,
which is referred to as the effective time, will be converted into the right to receive the merger consideration.

        For a more complete description of the treatment of outstanding restricted stock unit awards granted to the executive officers of B/E
Aerospace in November 2016, see "—Interests of Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger" beginning on page 102.

        Any applicable withholding taxes resulting from this treatment will be satisfied by reducing the amount of cash, if any, that would
otherwise be provided to holders of such awards. If no cash is to be provided to a holder of such an award or if the amount of cash that
would otherwise be provided to a holder of such awards is not sufficient to cover the applicable withholding taxes, then the number of
shares of Rockwell Collins common stock that would otherwise be provided to the holder in accordance with the terms described above
will be reduced to the extent necessary to cover the shortfall.

Appraisal Rights 

Rockwell Collins Stockholders Appraisal Rights

        Under Delaware law, Rockwell Collins stockholders will not be entitled to any appraisal rights in connection with the merger or any
other transactions described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

B/E Aerospace Stockholders Appraisal Rights

        Record holders of B/E Aerospace common stock who comply with the procedures summarized below will be entitled to appraisal
rights if the merger is completed. Under Section 262 of the General Corporation Law, which is referred to as Section 262, holders of shares
of B/E Aerospace common stock with respect to which appraisal rights are properly demanded and perfected and not withdrawn or lost are
entitled, in lieu of receiving the merger consideration, to have the "fair value" of their shares (exclusive of any element of value arising
from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger) at the effective time, judicially determined and paid to them in cash by complying
with the provisions of Section 262. B/E Aerospace is required to send a notice to that effect to each stockholder not less than 20 days prior
to the B/E Aerospace special meeting. This joint proxy statement/prospectus constitutes that notice to the record holders of B/E Aerospace
common stock.

        The following is a brief summary of Section 262, which sets forth the procedures for demanding statutory appraisal rights. This
summary, however, is not a complete statement of the applicable requirements, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to Section 262,
a copy of the text of which is attached to this joint proxy statement/prospectus as Annex E. If you wish to consider exercising your
appraisal rights, you should carefully review the text of Section 262 contained in Annex E. Failure to comply timely and properly with the
requirements of Section 262 may result in the loss of your appraisal rights under the DGCL. The following summary does not constitute
any legal or other advice nor does it constitute a recommendation that stockholders exercise their appraisal rights under Section 262.

        Stockholders of record who desire to exercise their appraisal rights must do all of the following: (i) not vote in favor of the adoption
of the merger agreement, (ii) deliver in the manner set forth below a written demand for appraisal of the stockholder's shares to the
Secretary of B/E Aerospace before the vote on the adoption of the merger agreement at the B/E Aerospace special meeting,
(iii) continuously hold the shares of record from the date of making the demand through completion of the merger and (iv) otherwise
comply with the requirements of Section 262.

Table of Contents

        Only a holder of record of B/E Aerospace common stock is entitled to demand an appraisal of the shares registered in that holder's
name. A demand for appraisal must be executed by or for the stockholder of record. The demand should set forth, fully and correctly, the
stockholder's name as it appears on the certificates representing shares. If shares are owned of record in a fiduciary capacity, such as by a
trustee, guardian or custodian, such demand must be executed by the fiduciary. If shares are owned of record by more than one person, as
in a joint tenancy or tenancy in common, the demand must be executed by or on behalf of all joint owners. An authorized agent, including
an agent of two or more joint owners, may execute the demand for appraisal for a stockholder of record; however, the agent must identify
the record owner and expressly disclose that, in exercising the demand, the agent is acting as agent for the record owner.

        A record owner, such as a broker, who holds shares as a nominee for others may exercise appraisal rights with respect to the shares
held for all or less than all beneficial owners of shares as to which the holder is the record owner. In that case, the written demand must set
forth the number of shares covered by the demand. Where the number of shares is not expressly stated, the demand will be presumed to
cover all shares outstanding in the name of the record owner.

        Beneficial owners who are not record owners and who intend to exercise appraisal rights should consult with the record owner to
determine the appropriate procedures for having the record holder make a demand for appraisal with respect to the beneficial owner's
shares. Any holder of shares held in "street name" who desires appraisal rights with respect to those shares must take such actions as may
be necessary to ensure that a timely and proper demand for appraisal is made by the record owner of the shares. Shares held through
brokerage firms, banks and other financial institutions are frequently deposited with and held of record in the name of a nominee of a
central security depository, such as Cede & Co., The Depository Trust Company's nominee. A demand for appraisal with respect to such
shares must be made by or on behalf of the depository nominee and it must identify the depository nominee as the record owner. Any
beneficial holder of shares desiring appraisal rights with respect to such shares which are held through a brokerage firm, bank or other
financial institution is responsible for ensuring that the demand for appraisal is made by the record holder.

        As required by Section 262, a demand for appraisal must be in writing and must reasonably inform B/E Aerospace of the identity of
the record holder (which might be a nominee as described above) and of such holder's intention to seek appraisal of the holder's shares.

        Stockholders of record who elect to demand appraisal of their shares must mail or deliver their written demand to: B/E
Aerospace, Inc., 1400 Corporate Center Way, Wellington, Florida 33414, Attention: Ryan M. Patch, Vice President—Law, General
Counsel and Secretary. The written demand for appraisal should specify the stockholder's name and mailing address. The written demand
must reasonably inform B/E Aerospace that the stockholder intends thereby to demand an appraisal of his, her or its shares. The written
demand must be received by B/E Aerospace prior to the vote on the Merger proposal at the B/E Aerospace special meeting. Neither voting
(in person or by proxy) against, abstaining from voting on or failing to vote on the adoption of the merger agreement will alone suffice to
constitute a written demand for appraisal within the meaning of Section 262. In addition, the stockholder must not vote its shares of B/E
Aerospace common stock in favor of adoption of the merger agreement. An executed proxy that does not contain voting instructions will,
unless revoked, be voted in favor of adoption of the merger agreement and will cause the stockholder's right of appraisal to be lost.
Therefore, a stockholder who desires to exercise appraisal rights should either (i) refrain from executing and submitting the enclosed proxy
card or (ii) vote by proxy against the adoption of the merger agreement or affirmatively register an abstention with respect thereto.

        Notwithstanding a stockholder's compliance with the foregoing requirements, Section 262 provides that, because immediately prior to
the merger B/E Aerospace common stock was listed on a national securities exchange, the Delaware Chancery Court will dismiss the
proceedings as to all holders of

shares of B/E Aerospace common stock who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless (i) the total number of shares of B/E
Aerospace common stock entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of B/E Aerospace common stock or (ii) the value of
the consideration provided in the merger for such total number of shares of B/E Aerospace common stock entitled to appraisal exceeds
$1 million.

        Within 120 days after completion of the merger, but not thereafter, either the surviving corporation in the merger or any stockholder
who has timely and properly demanded appraisal of such stockholder's shares and who has complied with the requirements of Section 262
and is otherwise entitled to appraisal rights, or any beneficial owner for which a demand for appraisal has been properly made by the
record holder, may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery, with a copy served on the
surviving corporation in the case of a petition filed by a stockholder, demanding a determination of the fair value of the shares of all
stockholders who have properly demanded appraisal. There is no present intent on the part of B/E Aerospace as the surviving corporation
to file an appraisal petition and stockholders seeking to exercise appraisal rights should not assume that the surviving corporation will file
such a petition or that the surviving corporation will initiate any negotiations with respect to the fair value of such shares. Accordingly,
stockholders who desire to have their shares appraised should initiate any petitions necessary for the perfection of their appraisal rights
within the time periods and in the manner prescribed in Section 262.

        Within 120 days after completion of the merger, any stockholder who has complied with the applicable provisions of Section 262 will
be entitled, upon written request, to receive from the surviving corporation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares of B/E
Aerospace common stock not voting in favor of the merger and with respect to which demands for appraisal were received by the
surviving corporation and the number of holders of such shares. A person who is the beneficial owner of shares held in a voting trust or by
a nominee on behalf of such person may, in such person's own name, file a petition or request from the surviving corporation for the
statement described in the previous sentence. Such statement must be mailed within 10 days after the written request therefor has been
received by the surviving corporation.

        If a petition for appraisal is duly filed by a B/E Aerospace stockholder and a copy of the petition is delivered to the surviving
corporation, then the surviving corporation will be obligated, within 20 days after receiving service of a copy of the petition, to file with
the Delaware Register in Chancery a duly verified list containing the names and addresses of all stockholders who have demanded an
appraisal of their shares of B/E Aerospace common stock and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares of B/E Aerospace
common stock have not been reached. After notice to stockholders who have demanded appraisal, if such notice is ordered by the
Delaware Court of Chancery, the Delaware Court of Chancery will conduct a hearing upon the petition and determine those stockholders
who have complied with Section 262 and who have become entitled to appraisal rights. The Delaware Court of Chancery may require the
stockholders who have demanded an appraisal for their shares and who hold stock represented by certificates to submit their certificates of
stock to the Delaware Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings; and if any stockholder fails
to comply with such direction, the Delaware Court of Chancery may dismiss the proceedings as to such stockholder. Where proceedings
are not dismissed, the appraisal proceeding will be conducted, as to the shares of B/E Aerospace common stock owned by such
stockholders, in accordance with the rules of the Delaware Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically governing appraisal
proceedings.

        After a hearing on such petition, the Delaware Court of Chancery will determine which stockholders are entitled to appraisal rights
and thereafter will appraise the shares owned by those stockholders, determining the fair value of the shares exclusive of any element of
value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, together with interest to be paid, if any, upon the amount determined
to be the fair value. Unless the Delaware Court of Chancery in its discretion

determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest from the date the merger is completed through the date of payment of the judgment
will be compounded quarterly and will accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharges) as established from
time to time during the period between the date the merger is completed and the date of payment of the judgment. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, at any time before the entry of judgment in the proceedings, the surviving corporation may pay to each stockholder entitled to
appraisal an amount in cash (which will be treated as an advance against the payment due to such stockholder), in which case interest shall
accrue after such payment only upon the sum of (i) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair value of the shares as
determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery and (ii) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time. When the fair value is
determined, the Delaware Court of Chancery will direct the payment of such value, together with interest, if any, on the amount
determined to be fair value, to the stockholders entitled to receive the same upon the surrender by such holders of the certificates
representing their shares, if any, or, immediately in the case of any uncertificated shares. The parties have made no determination as to
whether such a payment will be made if the merger is consummated, and B/E Aerospace reserves the right to make such a payment upon
the consummation of the merger.

        In determining fair value, the Delaware Court of Chancery is to take into account all relevant factors. In Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., et
al., the Delaware Supreme Court stated that "proof of value by any techniques or methods which are generally considered acceptable in
the financial community and otherwise admissible in court" should be considered in an appraisal proceeding and that "[f]air price
obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of a company." The Delaware Supreme Court has stated that in
making this determination of fair value the court must consider market value, asset value, dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the
enterprise and any other facts which could be ascertained as of the date of the merger which throw any light on future prospects of the
merged corporation. Section 262 provides that fair value is to be determined "exclusive of any element of value arising from the
accomplishment or expectation of the merger." In Cede & Co. v. Technicolor,  Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court stated that such exclusion
is a "narrow exclusion [that] does not encompass known elements of value," but which rather applies only to the speculative elements of
value arising from such accomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger, the Delaware Supreme Court construed Section 262 to mean that
"elements of future value, including the nature of the enterprise, which are known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the merger and
not the product of speculation, may be considered."

        Stockholders considering seeking appraisal should bear in mind that the fair value of their shares determined under Section 262 could
be more than, the same as, or less than the merger consideration they are entitled to receive pursuant to the merger agreement if they do not
seek appraisal of their shares, and that opinions of investment banking firms as to the fairness from a financial point of view of the
consideration payable in a transaction are not opinions as to fair value under Section 262. Each of Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace
reserves the right to assert, in any appraisal proceeding, that for purposes of Section 262, the "fair value" of a share of B/E Aerospace
common stock is less than the applicable merger consideration.

        The cost of the appraisal proceeding may be determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery and charged upon the parties as the
Delaware Court of Chancery deems equitable in the circumstances. However, costs do not include attorneys' and expert witness fees. The
Delaware Court of Chancery may order that all or a portion of the expenses incurred by such stockholder in connection with the appraisal
proceeding, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and the fees and expenses of experts, be charged pro rata against the
value of all shares entitled to appraisal. In the absence of such a determination of assessment, each party bears its own expenses.

        From and after the date of completion of the merger, any stockholder who has duly demanded appraisal in compliance with
Section 262 will not, after completion of the merger, be entitled to vote

for any purpose any shares subject to such demand or to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on such shares, except for
dividends or distributions payable to stockholders of record at a date prior to completion of the merger.

        Within 10 days after the effective time, the surviving corporation must give notice of the date that the merger became effective to
each of B/E Aerospace's stockholders who has properly filed a written demand for appraisal, who did not vote in favor of the proposal to
adopt the merger agreement and who has otherwise complied with Section 262. At any time within 60 days after completion of the merger,
any stockholder who has demanded appraisal and who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named
party will have the right to withdraw such stockholder's demand for appraisal and to accept the cash and Rockwell Collins common stock
to which the stockholder is entitled pursuant to the merger. After this period, the stockholder may withdraw such stockholder's demand for
appraisal only with the written approval of the surviving corporation. If no petition for appraisal is filed with the Delaware Court of
Chancery within 120 days after completion of the merger, stockholders' rights to appraisal will cease and all stockholders will be entitled
only to receive the merger consideration as provided for in the merger agreement. No petition timely filed in the Delaware Court of
Chancery demanding appraisal will be dismissed as to any stockholders without the approval of the Delaware Court of Chancery, and that
approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems just. However, the preceding sentence will not
affect the right of any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined the proceeding as a named party to withdraw
such stockholder's demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the merger within 60 days after completion of the merger.

        The foregoing is a brief summary of Section 262 that sets forth the procedures for demanding statutory appraisal rights. This
summary, however, is not a complete statement of all applicable requirements and is qualified in its entirety by reference to Section 262, a
copy of the text of which is attached as Annex E to this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

        Failure to comply strictly with all the procedures set forth in Section 262 may result in the loss of a stockholder's statutory
appraisal rights. Consequently, if you wish to exercise your appraisal rights, you are strongly urged to consult a legal advisor
before attempting to exercise your appraisal rights.

Source of Funding for the Merger 

        Rockwell Collins' obligation to complete the merger is not conditioned upon its obtaining financing.

        Rockwell Collins anticipates that approximately $3.6 billion will be required to pay the aggregate cash portion of the merger
consideration to the B/E Aerospace stockholders. Rockwell Collins expects to issue up to $4.35 billion in aggregate principal amount of its
senior unsecured notes in one or more public offerings or private placements and borrow up to $1.5 billion under a new senior unsecured
syndicated term loan facility. Rockwell Collins has entered into a committed bridge loan credit facility of $4.35 billion that would be
funded only to the extent some or all of the senior unsecured notes described above are not issued prior to the consummation of the
acquisition. Rockwell Collins expects to fund approximately $3.6 billion (based on the outstanding shares of B/E Aerospace common
stock on January 26, 2017) for the aggregate cash portion of the merger consideration payable to the B/E Aerospace stockholders through
the debt financing described above.

NYSE Listing of Rockwell Collins Common Stock; Delisting and Deregistration of B/E Aerospace Common Stock 

        Prior to the completion of the merger, Rockwell Collins has agreed to use its reasonable best efforts to cause the shares of Rockwell
Collins common stock to be issued in connection with the merger to be approved for listing on the NYSE. The listing of the shares of
Rockwell Collins common

stock on the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance, is also a condition to completion of the merger.

        If the merger is completed, B/E Aerospace common stock will cease to be listed on the NASDAQ and B/E Aerospace common stock
will be deregistered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which is referred to as the Exchange Act.

Litigation Relating to the Merger 

        In connection with the merger, two purported B/E Aerospace stockholders filed two putative class action complaints in the Court of
Chancery in the State of Delaware seeking to enjoin the merger and other relief and, at the same time, moved to expedite proceedings. The
lawsuits were captioned The Vladimir Gusinsky Living Trust v. B/E Aerospace, et. al., C.A. No. 12957-VCS (Del. Ch.) (filed December 1,
2016) and Sharon Klein v. B/E Aerospace, et. al., C.A. No. 12969-VCS (Del. Ch.) (filed December 8, 2016). On December 21, 2016, the
two lawsuits were consolidated under the caption In re B/E Aerospace, Inc. Stockholder Litigation, Consol. C.A. No. 12957-VCS, with the
complaint filed on December 1, 2016 in the Gusinsky action as the operative complaint. The defendants in the consolidated action are
B/E Aerospace, the members of the B/E Aerospace Board, Rockwell Collins and Merger Sub. The defendants filed motions to dismiss on
December 23, 2016. On January 9, 2017, following Rockwell Collins' and B/E Aerospace's agreement to make certain supplemental
disclosures, plaintiffs informed the Court of Chancery that they were withdrawing their motion to expedite proceedings.

        The complaint in the consolidated action alleges, among other things, that the directors of B/E Aerospace breached their fiduciary
duties by misstating and/or omitting material information from the Form S-4 filed by Rockwell Collins on November 23, 2016, and that
the corporate defendants aided and abetted such alleged breaches of fiduciary duties.

        In connection with the merger, one purported B/E Aerospace stockholder filed one putative class action lawsuit in the United States
District Court for the Southern District of Florida seeking to enjoin the merger and other relief. The lawsuit is captioned Kipp Dodds v. B/E
Aerospace, et. al., Case 1:16-cv-25038-KMM (S.D. Fla.) (filed December 5, 2016). The defendants are B/E Aerospace and the members
of the B/E Aerospace Board. The defendants have not yet responded to the complaint in this lawsuit.

        The complaint in the Dodds action alleges, among other things, that the Form S-4 filed by Rockwell Collins on November 23, 2016
misstates and/or omits material information under Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, SEC Rule 14a-9
and 17 C.F.R. § 244.100. On January 5, 2017, plaintiff filed a motion for preliminary injunction to enjoin the B/E Aerospace shareholder
vote on the merger. On January 20, 2017, following Rockwell Collins' and B/E Aerospace's agreement to make certain supplemental
disclosures, plaintiff withdrew his motion for preliminary injunction on the basis that the supplemental disclosures mooted the disclosure
claims asserted in the Dodds action, and the court entered an electronic order denying the motion for preliminary injunction as moot.

        The outcome of these lawsuits and any additional lawsuits filed in the future is uncertain. One of the conditions to the closing of the
merger is that no governmental authority has issued or entered any order after the date of the merger agreement having the effect of
enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the merger or the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, and
these lawsuits seek an order enjoining consummation of the merger. If the cases are not resolved, these lawsuits could prevent or delay
completion of the merger and result in substantial costs to Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace, including, but not limited to, costs
associated with the indemnification of directors and officers. The defense or settlement of any lawsuit or claim that remains unresolved at

U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences 

Tax Consequences of the Merger

        The following is a general discussion of the United States federal income tax consequences of the merger to U.S. holders and non-
U.S. holders (each as defined below) of B/E Aerospace common stock who hold their stock as a capital asset within the meaning of
Section 1221 of the Code. The summary is based on the Code, the U.S. Treasury Regulations issued under the Code, and administrative
rulings and court decisions in effect as of the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, all of which are subject to change at any time,
possibly with retroactive effect. Because holders of Rockwell Collins common stock will retain their shares of Rockwell Collins common
stock in the merger, the transaction should have no tax consequences for such stockholders.

        For purposes of this discussion, the term "U.S. holder" means a beneficial owner of B/E Aerospace common stock that is for U.S.
federal income tax purposes (1) a citizen or individual resident of the United States, (2) a corporation (or other entity taxable as a
corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) created or organized in the United States, (3) an estate the income of which is includible
in gross income for U.S. federal income tax purposes regardless of its source or (4) a trust if (A) a court within the United States is able to
exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial
decisions of the trust, or (B) the trust has a valid election in effect under applicable Treasury regulations to be treated as a U.S. person for
U.S. federal income tax purposes. A "non-U.S. holder" means a beneficial owner of B/E Aerospace common stock that is neither a U.S.
holder nor a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

        This summary is not a complete description of all the tax consequences of the merger and, in particular, may not address United
States federal income tax considerations applicable to holders of B/E Aerospace common stock who are subject to special treatment under
U.S. federal income tax law (including, for example, partnerships (or an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal
income tax purposes) and partners therein, financial institutions, dealers in securities, insurance companies or tax-exempt entities, U.S.
expatriates, former long-term residents of the United States, holders who acquired B/E Aerospace common stock pursuant to the exercise
of an employee stock option or right or otherwise as compensation, and holders who hold B/E Aerospace common stock as part of a
hedge, straddle or conversion transaction). Also, this summary does not address U.S. federal income tax considerations applicable to
holders of options or warrants to purchase B/E Aerospace common stock, or holders of debt instruments convertible into B/E Aerospace
common stock. In addition, no information is provided with respect to the tax consequences of the merger under the U.S. federal estate,
gift, Medicare, and alternative minimum tax laws, or any applicable state, local, or foreign tax laws. This summary does not address the
tax consequences of any transaction other than the merger.

        The tax consequences of the merger will depend on your specific situation. You should consult your own tax advisor as to the
tax consequences of the merger in your particular circumstances, including the applicability and effect of the alternative minimum
tax and any state, local, non-U.S. or other tax laws and of changes in those laws.

Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders

        The receipt of the merger consideration by U.S. holders in exchange for shares of B/E Aerospace common stock pursuant to the
merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, a U.S. holder
who receives the merger

consideration in exchange for shares of B/E Aerospace common stock pursuant to the merger will recognize gain or loss in an amount
equal to the difference, if any, between (1) the sum of the amount of cash, including cash received in lieu of fractional shares, and the fair
market value of Rockwell Collins common stock received in the merger and (2) the U.S. holder's adjusted tax basis in its B/E Aerospace
common stock exchanged therefor.

        If a U.S. holder's holding period in the shares of B/E Aerospace common stock surrendered in the merger is greater than one year as
of the date of the merger, the gain or loss will be long-term capital gain or loss. Long-term capital gains of certain non-corporate holders,
including individuals, are generally subject to U.S. federal income tax at preferential rates. The deductibility of a capital loss recognized
on the exchange is subject to limitations. If a U.S. holder acquired different blocks of B/E Aerospace common stock at different times or
different prices, such U.S. holder must determine its adjusted tax basis and holding period separately with respect to each block of B/E
Aerospace common stock.

        A U.S. holder's aggregate tax basis in Rockwell Collins common stock received in the merger will equal the fair market value of the
Rockwell Collins common stock as of the effective time. The holding period of the Rockwell Collins common stock received in the
merger will begin on the day after the merger.

Tax Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders

        Payments made to a non-U.S. holder in exchange for shares of B/E Aerospace common stock pursuant to the merger generally will
not be subject to U.S. federal income tax unless:

• the gain, if any, on such shares of B/E Aerospace common stock is effectively connected with a trade or business of the
non-U.S. holder in the United States (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to the non-U.S.
holder's permanent establishment in the United States); 

• the non-U.S. holder is an individual who is present in the U.S. for 183 days or more in the taxable year of the exchange of
shares of B/E Aerospace common stock for the merger consideration pursuant to the merger and certain other conditions
are met; or 

• the non-U.S. holder owned, directly or under certain constructive ownership rules of the Code, more than 5% of B/E
Aerospace common stock at any time during the five-year period preceding the merger, and B/E Aerospace is or has been a
"U.S. real property holding corporation" within the meaning of Section 897(c)(2) of the Code for U.S. federal income tax
purposes at any time during the shorter of the five-year period preceding the merger or the period that the non-U.S. holder
held B/E Aerospace common stock.

        Gain described in the first bullet point above will be subject to tax at generally applicable U.S. federal income tax rates. Any gain
described in the first bullet point above of a non-U.S. holder that is a corporation may also be subject to an additional "branch profits tax"
at a 30% rate (or lower applicable treaty rate). A non-U.S. holder described in the second bullet point immediately above will be subject to
tax at a rate of 30% (or a lower applicable treaty rate) on any gain realized, which may be offset by U.S.-source capital losses recognized
in the same taxable year. If the third bullet point above applies to a non-U.S. holder, gain recognized by such holder will be subject to tax
at generally applicable U.S. federal income tax rates. B/E Aerospace believes that it has not been a "U.S. real property holding
corporation" for U.S. federal income tax purposes at any time during the five-year period preceding the merger.

Information Reporting and Backup Withholding

        Payments made in exchange for shares of B/E Aerospace common stock pursuant to the merger may be subject, under certain
circumstances, to information reporting and backup withholding. To avoid backup withholding, a U.S. holder that does not otherwise
establish an exemption should complete and return an Internal Revenue Service Form W-9, certifying under penalties of perjury that such
U.S. holder is a "United States person" (within the meaning of the Code), that the taxpayer identification number provided is correct and
that such U.S. holder is not subject to backup withholding.

        A non-U.S. holder may be subject to information reporting and backup withholding on the merger consideration received in exchange
for B/E Aerospace common stock unless the Non-U.S. Holder establishes an exemption, for example, by properly certifying its non-U.S.
status on an appropriate version of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8.

        Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be refunded or credited
against a holder's U.S. federal income tax liability, if any, provided that such holder furnishes the required information to the Internal
Revenue Service in a timely manner.

        Holders of B/E Aerospace common stock are urged to consult their own tax advisors with respect to the tax consequences of
the merger in their particular circumstances, including the applicability and effect of the alternative minimum tax and any state,
local, non-U.S. or other tax laws and of changes in those laws.

Restrictions on Sales of Shares of Rockwell Collins Common Stock Received in the Merger 

        All shares of Rockwell Collins common stock received by B/E Aerospace stockholders in the merger will be freely tradable for
purposes of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, except for shares of Rockwell Collins common stock received by any B/E Aerospace
stockholder who becomes an "affiliate" of Rockwell Collins after completion of the merger (such as B/E Aerospace directors or executive
officers who become directors or executive officers of Rockwell Collins after the merger). This joint proxy statement/prospectus does not
cover resales of shares of Rockwell Collins common stock received by any person upon completion of the merger, and no person is
authorized to make any use of this joint proxy statement/prospectus in connection with any resale.

THE MERGER AGREEMENT 

        This section of this joint proxy statement/prospectus describes the material provisions of the merger agreement, but does not describe
all of the terms of the merger agreement and may not contain all of the information about the merger agreement that is important to you.
The following summary is qualified by reference to the complete text of the merger agreement, which is attached as Annex A to this joint
proxy statement/prospectus and incorporated by reference herein. The rights and obligations of Rockwell Collins, B/E Aerospace and the
Merger Sub are governed by the express terms and conditions of the merger agreement and not by this summary or any of the other
information contained in this joint proxy statement/prospectus. You are urged to read the full text of the merger agreement because it is the
legal document that governs the merger.

        The merger agreement contains representations, warranties and covenants by each of the parties thereto, which were made only for
purposes of the merger agreement, as of specified dates. The representations, warranties and covenants in the merger agreement were
made solely for the benefit of the parties thereto; may be subject to limitations agreed upon by the contracting parties, including being
qualified by confidential disclosures made for the purposes of allocating contractual risk between the parties to such agreement instead of
establishing these matters as facts; and may be subject to standards of materiality applicable to the contracting parties that differ from
those applicable to investors. Investors should not rely on representations, warranties and covenants or any descriptions thereof as
characterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of Rockwell Collins, Merger Sub, B/E Aerospace or any of their respective
subsidiaries or affiliates. Investors are not entitled to rely on the representations and warranties, which are only for the benefit of the
parties to the merger agreement. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the representations, warranties and covenants
may change after the date of the merger agreement, which subsequent information may or may not be fully reflected in Rockwell Collins'
or B/E Aerospace's public disclosures. Each such agreement should not be read alone, but should instead be read in conjunction with the
other information regarding the merger agreement, the merger, Rockwell Collins, B/E Aerospace and their respective affiliates and
businesses, which is contained in or incorporated by reference into this joint proxy statement/prospectus, as well as in the Forms 10-K,
Forms 10-Q and other filings that each of Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace have made or will make with the SEC.

Structure of the Merger 

        The merger agreement provides that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the merger agreement, and in
accordance with the DGCL, at the effective time, Merger Sub will be merged with and into B/E Aerospace. As a result of the merger, the
separate corporate existence of Merger Sub will cease, and B/E Aerospace will continue as the surviving corporation and a direct or
indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of Rockwell Collins. The certificate of incorporation of B/E Aerospace, as in effect immediately prior to
the effective time, will be amended in its entirety as set forth in Exhibit A to the merger agreement and, as so amended will be the
certificate of incorporation of the surviving corporation. The bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the effective time,
will be the bylaws of the surviving corporation, except as to the name of the surviving corporation, which shall be "B/E Aerospace, Inc."

Merger Consideration to be Received by B/E Aerospace Stockholders 

        At the effective time, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the merger agreement, each share of B/E Aerospace
common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time (other than (i) shares of B/E Aerospace common stock that
are owned, directly or indirectly, by Rockwell Collins, B/E Aerospace (including as treasury stock) or Merger Sub, which will be cancelled
immediately prior to the effective time, and (ii) shares of B/E Aerospace common stock with respect to which appraisal rights are properly
demanded and not withdrawn under Section 262 of

the DGCL, both of which are collectively referred to as the B/E Aerospace excluded shares) will be converted into the right to receive the
merger consideration, which is:

• $34.10 in cash, without interest, from Rockwell Collins; and 

• a fraction of a validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of Rockwell Collins common stock, having a value equal
to $27.90, subject to adjustment based upon a two-way collar mechanism described below.

        The exchange ratio will be calculated based upon the volume-weighted average price per share of Rockwell Collins common stock on
the NYSE (as reported by Bloomberg L.P. or, if not reported on Bloomberg L.P., in another authoritative source mutually selected by
Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace) on each of the 20 consecutive trading days ending with the trading day immediately prior to the
closing date, which is referred to as the Rockwell Collins stock price. If the Rockwell Collins stock price is greater than or equal to $77.41
and less than or equal to $89.97, the exchange ratio will be equal to the quotient of (i) $27.90 divided by (ii) the Rockwell Collins stock
price, which, in each case, will result in the stock consideration having a value equal to $27.90. If the Rockwell Collins stock price is less
than $77.41 or greater than $89.97, then a two-way collar mechanism will apply pursuant to which, (a) if the Rockwell Collins stock price
is greater than $89.97, the exchange ratio will be fixed at 0.3101 and the value of the stock consideration will be more than $27.90, and
(b) if the Rockwell Collins stock price is less than $77.41, the exchange ratio will be fixed at 0.3604 and the value of the stock
consideration will be less than $27.90.

        The following table sets forth an illustrative range of the potential merger consideration based on various Rockwell Collins stock
prices, ranging from $65.00 to $110.00, which reflect the 52-week stock price range for Rockwell Collins common stock as of January 26,
2017, plus or minus approximately 10 percent, as applicable. The highlighted rows represent the Rockwell Collins stock price values that
are within the two-way collar mechanism described above.

        The examples above are illustrative only. It is impossible to accurately predict the market price of Rockwell Collins common stock at
the effective time or during the period over which the Rockwell Collins stock price is calculated, and therefore impossible to accurately
predict the number or value of the shares of Rockwell Collins common stock that B/E Aerospace stockholders will receive in the merger.
You should obtain current market quotations for shares of Rockwell Collins common stock.

        All fractional shares of Rockwell Collins common stock that would otherwise be issued to a B/E Aerospace stockholder as part of the
merger consideration will be aggregated to create whole shares of Rockwell Collins common stock that will be issued to B/E Aerospace
stockholders as part of the merger consideration. If a fractional share of Rockwell Collins common stock remains payable to a
B/E Aerospace stockholder after aggregating all fractional shares of Rockwell Collins common stock payable to such B/E Aerospace
stockholder, then such B/E Aerospace stockholder will be paid, in lieu of such remaining fractional share of Rockwell Collins common
stock, an amount in cash, without interest, rounded down to the nearest cent, equal to the product of (x) the amount of the fractional share
interest in a share of Rockwell Collins common stock to which such holder would otherwise be entitled (rounded to three decimal places)
and (y) the Rockwell Collins stock price.

        Rockwell Collins stockholders will continue to own their existing shares of common stock of Rockwell Collins, the form of which
will not be changed by the transaction.

Treatment of B/E Aerospace Stock-Based Awards 

B/E Aerospace

Treatment of B/E Aerospace Restricted Stock Awards and RSU Awards

        Upon completion of the merger, each outstanding award of B/E Aerospace restricted stock and each B/E Aerospace restricted stock
unit award that in each case was granted prior to the date of the merger agreement will (i) become fully vested and, to the extent such
award is subject to performance conditions, such performance conditions will be deemed satisfied at the maximum level and (ii) be
cancelled and converted into the right to receive a lump sum cash payment per share of B/E Aerospace common stock underlying such
award equal to the value of the per share merger consideration less any applicable withholding taxes. Upon completion of the merger,
except for outstanding restricted stock unit awards granted to the executive officers of B/E Aerospace in November 2016, consistent with
past practice, which will be cancelled and converted into a cash payment pursuant to their terms, each outstanding award of B/E Aerospace
restricted stock and each B/E Aerospace restricted stock unit award that in each case was granted on or following the date of the merger
agreement will be assumed by Rockwell Collins and converted into a Rockwell Collins award of restricted stock or restricted stock unit
award, as applicable, which will vest subject to the grantee's continued service with Rockwell Collins or its affiliates through each
applicable vesting date (with any performance conditions that were applicable to the B/E Aerospace award deemed satisfied at target level
performance and following the closing, the converted Rockwell Collins award subject only to time-based vesting) covering a number of
shares of Rockwell Collins common stock (rounded down to the nearest whole share) determined by multiplying the number of shares of
B/E Aerospace that were subject to the B/E Aerospace award by a ratio of the value of the merger consideration divided by the Rockwell
Collins stock price (with the value of the stock consideration portion of the merger consideration determined by multiplying the number of
such shares of Rockwell Collins common stock by the Rockwell Collins stock price).

Treatment of B/E Aerospace Stock Units

        Each stock unit credited to the account of any current or former director under the B/E Aerospace Amended and Restated Non-
Employee Directors Stock and Deferred Compensation Plan that is outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger,
which is referred to as the effective time, will be converted into the right to receive the merger consideration.

Table of Contents

        For a more complete description of the treatment of outstanding restricted stock unit awards granted to the executive officers of B/E
Aerospace in November 2016, see "The Merger—Interests of Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger" beginning on page 102.

        Any applicable withholding taxes resulting from this treatment will be satisfied by reducing the amount of cash, if any, that would
otherwise be provided to holders of such awards. If no cash is to be provided to a holder of such an award or if the amount of cash that
would otherwise be provided to a holder of such awards is not sufficient to cover the applicable withholding taxes, then the number of
shares of Rockwell Collins common stock that would otherwise be provided to the holder in accordance with the terms described above
will be reduced to the extent necessary to cover the shortfall.

Closing 

        Unless another time, date or place is agreed to in writing by Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace, the closing of the merger will
occur on a date to be specified by Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace, but no later than the second business day after the satisfaction or
waiver of the closing conditions set forth in the merger agreement (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the
closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions).

Effective Time 

        The merger will become effective at the time the certificate of merger has been duly filed with the Delaware Secretary of State or at
such other date and time as is agreed between Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace and specified in the certificate of merger.

Conversion of Shares; Exchange of Certificates; No Fractional Shares 

Conversion and Exchange of B/E Aerospace Common Stock

        The conversion of shares of B/E Aerospace common stock, other than the B/E Aerospace excluded shares, into the right to receive the
merger consideration will occur automatically at the effective time. As promptly as practicable after the effective time, but in no event later
than 5 business days after such time, Rockwell Collins' exchange agent will mail a letter of transmittal to each holder of record of a
certificate or book-entry share, in each case, representing shares of B/E Aerospace common stock, whose shares of B/E Aerospace
common stock were converted into the right to receive the merger consideration. The letter of transmittal will specify that delivery will be
effected and risk of loss and title to such certificates or book-entry shares, as applicable, will pass only upon proper delivery of such
certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of such certificates) or book-entry shares to the exchange agent. The letter of transmittal will be
accompanied by instructions for surrendering such certificates or book-entry shares in exchange for the merger consideration, any
dividends or distributions payable pursuant to the merger agreement and cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Rockwell Collins common
stock payable as part of the merger consideration. No interest will be paid or will accrue on any cash payable upon surrender of a
certificate or book-entry share. B/E Aerospace stockholders should not return stock certificates with the enclosed proxy card.

        At the effective time, shares of B/E Aerospace common stock will no longer be outstanding, will be automatically cancelled and will
cease to exist, and each certificate or book-entry share that represented shares of B/E Aerospace common stock immediately prior to the
effective time will cease to have any rights with respect to such B/E Aerospace common stock other than the right to receive, upon
surrender of such certificate or book-entry share, the merger consideration as described above and subject to the terms and conditions set
forth in the merger agreement.

        Following surrender by holders of certificates or book-entry shares previously representing B/E Aerospace common stock to the
exchange agent for exchange, such holders will receive any

dividends or other distributions with a record date after the effective time and a payment date on or prior to the date of such surrender with
respect to shares of Rockwell Collins common stock they receive as merger consideration, without interest.

        Rockwell Collins and the exchange agent will be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any
person under the merger agreement such amounts as Rockwell Collins and the exchange agent are required to deduct and withhold from
such consideration under the Code or under any provision of state, local or foreign tax law.

        All shares of Rockwell Collins common stock issued pursuant to the merger agreement will be issued in book-entry form unless a
physical certificate is requested.

operations of the referenced party and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, except that, for purposes of the definition of "material adverse

effect has occurred:

• changes in general economic, financial market, regulatory, business, financial, political, geopolitical, credit or capital
market conditions, including interest or exchange rates; 

• general changes or developments in any of the industries or markets, or in the business conditions in the geographic

Stockholder Meetings and Board Recommendations

        The merger agreement requires each of Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace to, as promptly as practicable following effectiveness of

        Each of the parties to the merger agreement agreed to, in consultation and cooperation with the other parties and as promptly as
reasonably practicable (and in no event later than 10 business days after the date of the merger agreement), make its respective filings
under the HSR Act (which the parties filed on November 7, 2016) and to thereafter make any other applications and filings as reasonably
determined by Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace under other applicable U.S. or foreign antitrust laws with respect to the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement as promptly as practicable, but in no event later than as required by law.

        Notwithstanding the parties' obligations summarized above in this section, (i) neither B/E Aerospace nor its subsidiaries or affiliates
will grant or offer to grant any accommodation or concession (financial or otherwise), or make any payment, to any third party in
connection with seeking or obtaining its consent to the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and (ii) neither Rockwell
Collins nor any of its affiliates will be required to agree to or proffer to sell, divest, lease, license, transfer, dispose of or otherwise
encumber or impair Rockwell Collins' or any of its affiliates' ability to own or operate any assets or properties of Rockwell Collins or any
of its affiliates (including any equity or other interests in B/E Aerospace) or any assets or properties of B/E Aerospace or any of its
affiliates if such action would require the divestiture or holding separate (or any other remedy) of or with respect to any assets of Rockwell
Collins, B/E Aerospace or any of their affiliates or subsidiaries representing, in the aggregate, more than $175 million of annual revenue
generated between January 1, 2015 and December 31, 2015.

        Each of the parties has agreed to (i) furnish to the other such necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other may

administrative or other similar proceeding or action initiated by a private party, to any other person or entity.

        Each of the parties has also agreed to give reasonable prior notice to and consult with the other in advance of any meeting, conference
or substantive communication with any governmental authority, or, in connection with any legal or administrative proceeding by a private
party, with any other person or entity, and to the extent not prohibited by applicable law or by the applicable governmental authority or
other person or entity, and to the extent reasonably practicable, not participate or attend any meeting or conference, or engage in any
substantive communication, with any governmental authority or such other person or entity in respect of the transactions contemplated by
the merger agreement without the other party, and in the event one party is prohibited from, or unable to participate, attend or engage in,
any such meeting, conference or substantive communication, keep such party apprised with respect thereto.

        Each party has agreed to furnish to the other copies of all substantive filings, submissions, correspondence and communications

personally sensitive information; (ii) remove references concerning valuation, (iii) comply with contractual arrangements, (iv) address
legal privilege or other confidentiality concerns, or (v) comply with applicable law.

        Between the date of the merger agreement and the effective time or the termination of the merger agreement in accordance with its
terms, each of Rockwell Collins and Merger Sub will not, and will ensure that their subsidiaries do not, consummate, or enter into any
agreement providing for any acquisition, divestiture or merger that would reasonably be expected to materially delay or prevent the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

No Solicitation

        Each of Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace has agreed:

• to immediately cease and terminate, and to use reasonable best efforts to cause its officers, directors and other
representatives to cease and terminate, all existing discussions, negotiations and communications with any person or entity
with respect to any acquisition proposal, such term referring to a proposal or offer from any person or entity providing for
any (i) merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination, recapitalization or similar transaction involving
Rockwell Collins or B/E Aerospace, as applicable, pursuant to which any such person or entity would own or control,
directly or indirectly, 20% or more of the voting power of the referenced party, (ii) sale or other disposition, directly or
indirectly, of assets of the referenced party (including the capital stock or other equity interests of any of its subsidiaries) or
any subsidiary of the referenced party representing 20% or more of the consolidated assets, revenues or net income of the
referenced party and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, (iii) issuance or sale or other disposition of capital stock or other
equity interests representing 20% or more of the voting power of the referenced party, (iv) tender offer, exchange offer or
any other transaction or series of transactions in which any person or entity will acquire, directly or indirectly, beneficial
ownership or the right to acquire beneficial ownership of capital stock or other equity interests representing 20% or more of
the voting power of the referenced party or (v) any related combination of the foregoing; provided that, with respect to
Rockwell Collins, such a proposal will only be deemed an acquisition proposal if it is conditioned upon or requires for its
completion the failure of the merger to occur; 

• not to, and not to authorize any of its representatives to, directly or indirectly (i) initiate, seek, solicit, knowingly encourage
or knowingly induce or take any other action reasonably expected to lead to an acquisition proposal, (ii) engage in
negotiations or discussions with or provide any non-public information to any person or entity relating to an acquisition
proposal or grant any waiver or release under any standstill or other agreement (unless either party's board of directors
determines in good faith that refusing to grant such waiver or release would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable law, in which case such party may waive such standstill provision in order to permit a third party to make an
acquisition proposal) or (iii) resolve to do any of the foregoing; 

• not to provide access (and within one business day of the date of the merger agreement, to terminate any such access) to
any third party to any data room (virtual or actual) containing any of such party's information; and 

• within two business days of the date of the merger agreement, to demand the return or destruction of all confidential, non-
public information and materials and all other information and materials related to any acquisition proposal that have been
provided to third parties that have entered into confidentiality agreements relating to a possible acquisition proposal with
the referenced party or any of its subsidiaries.

        Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to obtaining stockholder approval with regard to the merger agreement and the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement, if either party receives a bona fide written acquisition proposal that was not initiated, sought,
solicited, knowingly encouraged, knowingly induced or otherwise procured in violation of the merger agreement, then such party may:

• contact the person or entity who has made such acquisition proposal in order to clarify the terms of such acquisition
proposal so that such party's board of directors (or any committee thereof) may inform itself about such acquisition
proposal; 

• furnish information concerning its business, properties or assets to such person or entity pursuant to a confidentiality
agreement with confidentiality terms that, taken as a whole, are not materially less favorable to such party than those
contained in the confidentiality agreement, dated as of July 7, 2016, between Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace; and 

• negotiate and participate in discussions and negotiations with such person or entity concerning such acquisition proposal;

if, in the case of the circumstances described in the immediately preceding two bullet points, the party's board of directors determines in
good faith that such acquisition proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to constitute or result in a superior proposal, such term
referring to a bona fide written acquisition proposal (provided that for purposes of the definition of superior proposal, references to 20% in
the definition of acquisition proposal will be deemed to be references to 50%) that the referenced party's board of directors determines in
good faith (i) to be reasonably likely to be consummated if accepted and (ii) to be more favorable to the referenced party's stockholders
from a financial point of view than the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, in each case, taking into
account at the time of determination all relevant circumstances, including the various legal, financial and regulatory aspects of the
proposal, all the terms and conditions of such proposal and the merger agreement, and any changes to the terms of the merger agreement
offered by the other party to the merger agreement in response to such acquisition proposal.

        Each of Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace will (i) promptly (and in any case within 24 hours) provide the other party notice (a) of
the receipt of any acquisition proposal, which notice will include a complete, unredacted copy of such acquisition proposal, and (b) of any
inquiries, proposals or offers received by, any requests for non-public information from, or any discussions or negotiations initiated or
continued (or sought to be initiated or continued) with, the party or any of its representatives concerning an acquisition proposal, and
disclose the identity of the other party (or parties) and the material terms of such inquiry, offer, proposal or request and, in the case of
written materials, provide copies of such materials, (ii) promptly (and in any case within 24 hours) make available to the other party copies
of all written materials provided by the referenced party to the proposing party but not previously made available to the other party and
(iii) keep the other party informed on a reasonably prompt basis (and, in any case, within 24 hours of any significant development) of the
status and material details (including amendments and proposed amendments) of any such acquisition proposal or other inquiry, offer,
proposal or request.

Adverse Recommendation Change and Termination

        Except as permitted by the merger agreement in the case of a superior proposal or an intervening event (in each case, as described
immediately below), neither the Rockwell Collins Board, the B/E Aerospace Board, nor any committee thereof will (i) make an adverse
recommendation change or (ii) adopt or approve, or publicly propose to adopt or approve, or allow such party to execute or enter into, any
binding or non-binding letter of intent, agreement in principle, memorandum of understanding, merger agreement, acquisition agreement,
option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or other agreement, commitment, arrangement or understanding

or otherwise in connection with, or that is intended to or would reasonably be expected to lead to, any acquisitions proposal.

Superior Proposal 

        Subject to the non-solicitation obligations described above and the obligations further described in this paragraph, if, prior to receipt
of the approval of their respective stockholders, either party receives an acquisition proposal that its respective board of directors
determines in good faith constitutes a superior proposal that was not initiated, sought, solicited, knowingly encouraged, knowingly induced
or otherwise procured in violation of the merger agreement, such party's board of directors may (i) effect an adverse recommendation
change or (ii) terminate the merger agreement pursuant to the termination provisions as described below in order to enter into a definitive
agreement providing for such superior proposal if (a) such party's board of directors determines in good faith that the failure to take such
action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law; (b) such party has notified the other party in writing that it
intends to effect an adverse recommendation change or terminate the merger agreement pursuant to the termination provisions as described
below in order to enter into a definitive agreement providing for such superior proposal; (c) if applicable, such party has provided the other
party a copy of the proposed definitive agreements between such party and the person or entity making such superior proposal; (d) for a
period of four days following the notice delivered pursuant to clause (b) above, such party will have discussed and negotiated in good faith
and made its representatives available to discuss and negotiate in good faith (in each case to the extent the other party desires to negotiate)
with the other party's representatives any proposed modifications to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement or the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement so that the failure to take such action would no longer be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of
such party's board of directors under applicable law (it being understood and agreed that any amendment to any material term or condition
of any superior proposal will require a new notice and a new negotiation period that will expire on the later to occur of (1) two days
following delivery of such new notice from such party to the other party and (2) the expiration of the original four-day period described in
clause (d) above); and (e) no earlier than the end of such negotiation period, such party's board of directors will have determined in good
faith, after considering the terms of any proposed amendment or modification to the merger agreement, that (x) the acquisition proposal
that is the subject of the notice described in clause (b) above still constitutes a superior proposal and (y) the failure to take such action
would still be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law.

Intervening Event 

        Subject to the non-solicitation obligations described above and the obligations further described in this paragraph, other than in
connection with a superior proposal and prior to receipt of the approval of their respective stockholders, each of the board of directors of
Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace may, in response to an intervening event, withdraw, qualify, or modify, or publicly propose to
withdraw, qualify or modify, the Rockwell Collins Recommendation or the B/E Aerospace Recommendation, as applicable, only if (i) such
party's board of directors determines in good faith that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable law; (ii) such party has notified the other party in writing that it intends to effect such adverse recommendation change (which
notice will specify the facts and circumstances providing the basis of the intervening event and for the determination of such party's board
of directors to effect such adverse recommendation change in reasonable detail); (iii) for a period of four days following the notice
delivered pursuant to clause (ii) above, such party will have discussed and negotiated in good faith and made its representatives available
to discuss and negotiate in good faith (in each case to the extent the other party desires to negotiate) with the other party's representatives
any proposed modifications to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement or the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement

will require a new notice and a new negotiation period that will expire on the later to occur of (a) two days following delivery of such new
notice from such party to the other party and (b) the expiration of the original four-day period described above in this clause (iii)); and
(iv) no earlier than the end of such negotiation period, the board of directors of such party will have determined in good faith, after
considering the terms of any proposed amendment or modification to the merger agreement, that the failure to take such action would still
be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law.

        Subject to Rockwell Collins' and B/E Aerospace's obligations with respect to their merger recommendations, as summarized in the
section above, their obligations with respect to effecting an adverse recommendation change as summarized immediately above, and their
obligations with respect to publicity related to the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, nothing in the merger agreement
prohibits Rockwell Collins or B/E Aerospace or either of their respective boards of directors, as applicable, from (i) disclosing to its
stockholders a position contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act, or from issuing a "stop, look and
listen" statement pending disclosure of its position thereunder or (ii) making any disclosure to its stockholders if the applicable board of
directors determines in good faith that its failure to make such disclosure would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable
law; provided, however, that the obligations with respect to the adverse recommendation change and termination provisions described
above will not be affected by this provision and any such disclosure (other than issuance by the applicable party of a "stop, look and listen"
or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) that addresses or relates to the approval,
recommendation or declaration of advisability by the applicable board of directors with respect to the merger agreement or an acquisition
proposal will be deemed to be an adverse recommendation change unless the applicable board of directors in connection with such
communication publicly states that its recommendation with respect to the merger agreement has not changed or refers to its prior
recommendation without disclosing any adverse recommendation change.

Employee Benefits Matters

        For the period beginning at the effective time and ending on December 31, 2018 employees who are actively employed by
B/E Aerospace or any of its subsidiaries immediately prior to the effective time, who are referred to as covered employees, will be
provided by Rockwell Collins or any of its subsidiaries, for so long as such covered employees remain employees of Rockwell Collins or
any of its subsidiaries, with compensation (including salary or base rate of compensation, annual cash bonus opportunities, commissions
and severance) and benefits that are in the aggregate, no less favorable than the compensation (excluding any equity or equity-based
compensation, retention, change of control, transaction or similar bonuses and nonqualified deferred compensation) and benefits
(excluding any defined benefit pension plan or retiree medical benefits) being provided by B/E Aerospace or its subsidiaries to covered
employees immediately prior to the effective time.

        If any covered employee first becomes eligible to participate under any Rockwell Collins benefit plan, following the effective time,
Rockwell Collins will, for covered employees who become eligible during 2017, use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) waive any
preexisting condition exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to any covered
employee under any Rockwell Collins benefit plan providing medical, dental or vision benefits to the same extent such limitation would
have been waived or satisfied under any similar material employee benefit plan of B/E Aerospace, which is referred to as a B/E Aerospace
benefit plan, that the covered employee participated in immediately prior to coverage under the Rockwell Collins benefit plan and
(ii) provide each covered employee with credit for any copayments and deductibles paid prior to the covered employee's coverage under
any Rockwell Collins benefit plan during the plan year in which the

effective time occurs, to the same extent such credit was given under any similar B/E Aerospace benefit plan that covered employee
participated in immediately prior to coverage under the Rockwell Collins benefit plan, in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-
pocket requirements under the Rockwell Collins benefit plan for the plan year in which the effective time occurs.

        As of the effective time, Rockwell Collins will recognize all service of each covered employee prior to the effective time, to
B/E Aerospace (or any of its predecessor entities or subsidiaries) for vesting and eligibility purposes (but not for benefit accrual purposes
under any defined benefit pension plan) and for purposes of determining future vacation accruals and severance amounts to the same
extent as such covered employee received, immediately before the effective time, credit for such service under any similar B/E Aerospace
benefit plan in which such covered employee participated immediately prior to the effective time; provided that service of each covered
employee prior to the effective time will not be recognized for the purpose of any entitlement to participate in, or receive benefits with
respect to, any (i) non-elective employer contributions under any plan of Rockwell Collins under Section 401(k) of the Code or
(ii) Rockwell Collins retiree medical program in which any covered employee participates after the effective time. In no event will there be
any duplication of benefits for the same period of service.

        B/E Aerospace and its subsidiaries will satisfy all legal or contractual requirements to provide notice to, or to carry out any
consultation procedure with, any employee or groups of employees of B/E Aerospace or any of its subsidiaries, or any labor or trade union,
labor organization or works council, which is representing any employee of B/E Aerospace or any of its subsidiaries, in connection with
the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

Financing

        The merger is not conditioned upon Rockwell Collins obtaining financing. If Rockwell Collins fails to obtain financing for the
merger, it will still be required to fulfill its obligations under the merger agreement, including, subject to provisions related to termination
and fulfillment or waiver of the conditions to closing, its obligation to consummate the merger and the other transactions contemplated by
the merger agreement.

        Rockwell Collins has agreed to keep B/E Aerospace reasonably informed on a reasonably current basis of material developments in
respect of obtaining financing for the merger. B/E Aerospace has agreed to use reasonable best efforts to provide reasonable cooperation
that is customary in connection with the arrangement of debt or equity financing that Rockwell Collins deems reasonably necessary in
connection with the merger and that is consistent with transactions substantially similar to the merger.

Designation of Directors

        The merger agreement provides that Rockwell Collins will take all necessary corporate action so that, upon the effective time, the size
of the Rockwell Collins Board will be increased by two members to a total of eleven members, and two individuals selected by B/E
Aerospace who meet Rockwell Collins' independence criteria and are otherwise reasonably acceptable to Rockwell Collins will be
appointed to the Rockwell Collins Board. One such individual will serve as a member of the class of directors of the Rockwell Collins
Board with terms expiring in 2018, and the other will serve as a member of the class of directors of the Rockwell Collins Board with terms
expiring in 2020. Pursuant to this provision of the merger agreement, John T. Whates and Richard G. Hamermesh, both members of the
B/E Aerospace Board, were selected by B/E Aerospace to be appointed to the Rockwell Collins Board and are expected to serve as
members of the class of directors of the Rockwell Collins Board with terms expiring in 2018 and 2020, respectively. Other than such
additional directors, no changes to the Rockwell Collins Board are expected in connection with the consummation of the merger.

Other Covenants and Agreements

        The merger agreement contains additional agreements relating to, among other matters:

Directors' and Officers' Indemnification and Insurance

        The parties have agreed that all rights, existing at the time of the merger agreement, to indemnification and exculpation from
liabilities (including advancement of expenses) for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the effective time, in favor of the current or
former directors or officers of B/E Aerospace as provided in the certificate of incorporation or the by-laws of B/E Aerospace or in any
indemnification contract between such directors or officers and B/E Aerospace will survive the merger and will continue in full force and
effect.

        For 6 years after the effective time, Rockwell Collins will maintain in effect the exculpation, indemnification and advancement of
expenses equivalent to the provisions of the certificate of incorporation or the by-laws of B/E Aerospace as in effect immediately prior to
the effective time with respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to the effective time and will not amend, repeal or otherwise modify
any such provisions in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any of the current or former directors or officers of
B/E Aerospace; provided that all rights to indemnification in respect of any action pending or asserted or any claim made within such 6-
year period will continue until the disposition of such action or resolution of such claim.

        Prior to the effective time, B/E Aerospace will (or, if B/E Aerospace is unable to, after the effective time, Rockwell Collins will),
purchase a 6-year prepaid "tail" policy, with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are no less favorable than the coverage
provided under B/E Aerospace's existing policies of directors' and officers' liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance, with respect
to matters arising on or before the effective time (including in connection with the merger agreement and the transactions or actions
contemplated by the merger agreement), and Rockwell Collins will maintain such policy in full force and effect, for its full term, and no
other party will have any further obligation to purchase or pay for insurance; provided that B/E Aerospace will not pay, and Rockwell
Collins will not be required to pay, in excess of 300% of the last annual premium paid by B/E Aerospace prior to the date of the merger
agreement in respect of such "tail" policy. If B/E Aerospace for any reason fails to obtain such "tail" insurance policies prior to, as of or
after the effective time, Rockwell Collins will, for 6 years from the effective time, maintain in effect the current policies of directors' and
officers' liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by B/E Aerospace with respect to matters arising on or before the
effective time, again without being required to pay annual premiums in excess of 300% of the last annual premium paid by B/E Aerospace
prior to the date of the merger agreement in respect of the coverage required to be obtained, but in such case Rockwell Collins will
purchase as much coverage as reasonably practicable for such amount.

Certain Tax Matters

        Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace have agreed to use reasonable best efforts to obtain from their respective legal advisors the
opinions related to the KLX spin-off tax treatment that are required as conditions to the closing of the merger, as described above.

        In addition, Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace have each agreed to deliver tax representation letters similar to the Rockwell
Collins Signing Representation Letter and the B/E Aerospace Signing Representation Letter, respectively, immediately prior to the closing,
and covenanted that neither knew of any reason that it would not be able to deliver their respective tax representation letters at the closing.
Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace each agree to use their respective reasonable best efforts not to take any action what would cause any
of the representations, warranties and covenants in their respective tax representation letters that were delivered at signing to become
untrue.

Table of Contents

        Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace represented that they had each received opinions as of the date of the merger agreement from
their respective tax counsels to the effect that the merger will not cause the KLX spin-off to fail to qualify for the KLX spin-off tax
treatment.

        Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace agreed to use reasonable best efforts to jointly engage promptly after the date of the merger
agreement a nationally recognized law firm to serve as additional tax counsel in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement.

Section 16 Matters

        Prior to the effective time, the parties will take all such steps as may be reasonably necessary or advisable to cause any dispositions of
B/E Aerospace common stock (including derivative securities) or acquisitions of Rockwell Collins common stock (including derivative
securities) resulting from the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement by each individual who is subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to B/E Aerospace or will become subject to such reporting requirements
with respect to Rockwell Collins, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act, to the extent permitted by law.

Public Disclosure

        While the merger agreement is in effect, neither Rockwell Collins, B/E Aerospace nor any of their affiliates will disseminate any
press release or other public announcement concerning the merger agreement, the merger or the other transactions contemplated by the
merger agreement without the prior written consent of the other parties to the merger agreement (which consent will not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), except (i) as required by law or the rules of a national securities exchange, (ii) to the extent disclosed in
or consistent with a press release or other document previously approved for external distribution by the other parties to the merger
agreement or the registration statement on Form S-4, of which this joint proxy statement/prospectus forms a part, (iii) and to the extent the
information included therein is not confidential information of any other party, a party may communicate to financial analysts, investors
and media representatives in a manner consistent with its past practice in compliance with applicable law. In addition, such obligation to
obtain prior written consent of the other parties to the merger agreement will not apply to press releases or public announcements if
B/E Aerospace or Rockwell Collins has effected an adverse recommendation change, to any disclosures in connection with either a
determination by B/E Aerospace or Rockwell Collins, in accordance with their respective obligations under the non-solicitation provisions
of the merger agreement, that an acquisition proposal is a superior proposal or to any disclosures in connection with any dispute between
the parties regarding the merger agreement, the merger or the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

Stock Exchange Listing

        Rockwell Collins has agreed to use reasonable best efforts to cause the shares of Rockwell Collins common stock to be issued in
connection with the merger to be approved for listing on the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the effective time.

Dividend Record Dates

        B/E Aerospace will coordinate with Rockwell Collins to designate the record dates and payment dates for B/E Aerospace's quarterly
dividends to coincide with the record dates and payment dates for Rockwell Collins' quarterly dividends, it being the intention of the
parties that holders of B/E Aerospace common stock and Rockwell Collins common stock will not receive dividends twice for a
corresponding fiscal quarter of either B/E Aerospace or Rockwell Collins.

Effect of Termination 

        If the merger agreement is terminated as described above and the merger is abandoned, the terminating party must provide written
notice to the other party specifying the provisions of the merger agreement pursuant to which the termination is being made and the merger
agreement will be null and void and of no effect, without liability on the part of any party to the merger agreement, and the rights and
obligations of any party to the merger agreement will cease, except that, obligations with respect to certain provisions of the merger
agreement will survive the termination of the merger agreement, including the following:

• no termination will relieve any party of any liability or damages resulting from any intentional breach of the merger
agreement prior to such termination or fraud, in which case the aggrieved party will be entitled to all remedies available at
law or in equity, including liability for damages (taking into account all relevant factors, including the loss of the benefit of
the merger, any lost stockholder premium, any lost synergies, the time value of money and any benefit to the breaching
party or its stockholders arising from such intentional breach or fraud); and 

• the confidentiality agreement entered into by Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace in connection with entering into the
merger and the provisions of the merger agreement with respect to the effect of termination, termination fees, and general
provisions of interpretation and construction will survive any termination of the merger agreement.

        Under the merger agreement, intentional breach means an action or omission taken or omitted to be taken that the breaching party
intentionally takes (or fails to take) and knows (or should reasonably have known) would, or would reasonably be expected to, cause a
material breach of the merger agreement.

Termination Fees and Expense Reimbursements

• on the date of the consummation of the applicable acquisition proposal, if Rockwell Collins terminates the merger
agreement pursuant to the Rockwell Collins Breach Termination Right on the basis of a breach of a covenant or
agreement contained in the merger agreement or either party terminates the agreement pursuant to the End Date
Termination Right or failure of B/E Aerospace to obtain the B/E Aerospace Stockholder Approval, and, in any such
case, prior to the termination of the merger agreement (or prior to the Rockwell Collins special meeting in the event
of failure of B/E Aerospace to obtain the B/E Aerospace Stockholder Approval), an acquisition proposal (with
regard to 50% of the voting power, consolidated assets, revenues or net income of the applicable party) made

Termination Right or failure of Rockwell Collins to obtain the Rockwell Collins Stockholder Approval, and, in any
such case, prior to the termination of the merger agreement (or prior to the B/E Aerospace special meeting in the
event of failure of Rockwell Collins to obtain the Rockwell Collins Stockholder Approval), an acquisition proposal
(with regard to 50% of the voting power, consolidated assets, revenues or net income of the applicable party) made

agreement pursuant to the B/E Aerospace Recommendation Change Termination Right.

        In no event will Rockwell Collins or B/E Aerospace be required to pay a termination fee if such party has already paid a termination
fee, and no termination fee will be payable more than once.

        In addition to the termination fees described above, the merger agreement provides for expense reimbursements in connection with
the termination of the merger agreement under the following circumstances:

B/E Aerospace Tax Advisor Opinion or the opinion of the additional tax counsel is not delivered for any reason) or
(2) B/E Aerospace fails to comply with its obligations under the covenant in the merger agreement related to certain
tax matters.

• Rockwell Collins will reimburse B/E Aerospace for reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred
by B/E Aerospace, including all fees and expenses of advisors incurred by B/E Aerospace in connection with the merger
agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, in an amount not to exceed $56 million: 

• If the merger agreement is terminated by either Rockwell Collins or B/E Aerospace due to failure of Rockwell
Collins to obtain the Rockwell Collins Stockholder Approval.

        Payment of the expense reimbursements by either party does not affect the other party's right to receive any applicable termination
fees, but does reduce on a dollar-for-dollar basis any termination fee that becomes due and payable to such other party under the terms of
the merger agreement.

        The right of either party to receive the applicable termination fee and expense reimbursement, in circumstances in which the
applicable termination fee or expense reimbursement is owed, is the sole and exclusive monetary remedy of the receiving party against the
other party and its subsidiaries and representatives for all losses and damages suffered as a result of the failure of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement to be consummated or failure to perform under the merger agreement or otherwise,
except (i) in the event of (a) termination due to failure of a party to include its required recommendation under the merger agreement in
this joint proxy statement/prospectus or due to breach of such party's non-solicitation obligations, (b) intentional breach of the covenant in
the merger agreement related to certain tax matters or fraudulent breach of either party's representations and warranties under the merger
agreement related to their respective tax representation letters or (c) the right of each party to receive the applicable termination fee less
the applicable expense reimbursement under certain circumstances and (ii) that any party that fails to timely pay any termination fee or
expense reimbursement due pursuant to the merger agreement will be obligated to pay any costs and expenses in connection with any suit
brought by the other party that results in a judgment against the delinquent party for the payment of such termination fee and expense
reimbursement.

Expenses 

        Except as otherwise described under "Termination Fees and Expense Reimbursements" above, all expenses incurred in connection
with the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such expenses,
whether or not the merger is consummated.

Amendment and Waiver 

Amendment

        The merger agreement may be amended by mutual agreement of the parties in writing at any time before or after receipt of the
respective stockholder approvals of Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace, except that no amendment may be made (i) after receipt of
either of the respective stockholder approvals of Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace if such amendment would require, in accordance
with applicable law or the rules of any stock exchange, further approval of the parties' respective stockholders, (ii) that is not permitted
under applicable law or (iii) that would adversely affect the rights of Rockwell Collins' financing sources under the merger agreement
relating to amendment, status as third-party beneficiaries, waiver of jury trial or governing law and liability with regard to legal,

failing to take such actions as are required of such party to consummate the merger agreement) in accordance with the specified terms of
the merger agreement or otherwise breach the provisions of the merger agreement. Accordingly, the parties acknowledged and agreed that,

in equity. Any party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of the merger agreement and to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions of the merger agreement will not be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such order or

        The special meeting of Rockwell Collins stockholders will be held at the Cedar Rapids Marriott, 1200 Collins Road NE, Cedar

enclosed form of proxy to its stockholders entitled to vote at the Rockwell Collins special meeting on or about February 6, 2017.

Purpose of the Rockwell Collins Special Meeting 

        At the Rockwell Collins special meeting, Rockwell Collins stockholders will be asked to consider and vote on the following:

• a proposal to issue Rockwell Collins common stock pursuant to the merger agreement, which is further described in the
sections titled "The Merger" and "The Merger Agreement," beginning on page 57 and page 128, respectively, and a copy of
which is attached as Annex A to the joint proxy statement/prospectus accompanying this notice, which is referred to as the

        Completion of the merger is conditioned on the approval of the Share Issuance proposal.

Recommendation of the Rockwell Collins Board 

        On October 21, 2016, the Rockwell Collins Board adopted the merger agreement, declared the merger agreement advisable and
determined that the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement are in the best interests of Rockwell Collins
and its stockholders. Accordingly, the Rockwell Collins Board unanimously recommends that Rockwell Collins stockholders vote
"FOR" the Share Issuance proposal and "FOR" the Rockwell Collins Adjournment proposal.

Rockwell Collins common stock or approximately less than 1% of the shares of Rockwell Collins common stock outstanding on that date.
Rockwell Collins currently expects its directors and executive officers to vote their shares in favor of all Rockwell Collins proposals, but

Plan for which votes were cast.

        If you hold shares of Rockwell Collins common stock through the Rockwell Collins 401(k) Plan, you may attend the Rockwell
Collins special meeting. However, shares held through the Rockwell Collins 401(k) Plan can only be voted as described above, and cannot
be voted in person at the Rockwell Collins special meeting.

holders may use their discretion to vote on other matters relating to the Rockwell Collins special meeting. In addition, as noted above, if
you hold shares through the Rockwell Collins 401(k) Plan, you may attend the Rockwell Collins special meeting, but those shares can only
be voted as described above, and cannot be voted at the Rockwell Collins special meeting.

Treatment of Abstentions; Failure to Vote 

        For purposes of the Rockwell Collins special meeting, an abstention occurs when a Rockwell Collins stockholder attends the
Rockwell Collins special meeting, either in person or by proxy, but abstains from voting.

• For the Share Issuance proposal, if a Rockwell Collins stockholder present in person at the Rockwell Collins special
meeting abstains from voting, or responds by proxy with an "abstain" vote, it will have the effect of a vote cast
"AGAINST" such proposal. If a Rockwell Collins stockholder is not present in person at the Rockwell Collins special
meeting and does not respond by proxy, it will have no effect on the vote count for such proposal (assuming a quorum is
present). 

• For the Rockwell Collins Adjournment proposal, if a Rockwell Collins stockholder present in person at the Rockwell
Collins special meeting abstains from voting, or responds by proxy with an "abstain" vote, it will have the effect of a vote
cast "AGAINST" such proposal. If a Rockwell Collins stockholder is not present in person at the Rockwell Collins special
meeting and does not respond by proxy, it will have no effect on the vote count for such proposal (assuming a quorum is
present).

Shares Held in Street Name 

        If you are a Rockwell Collins stockholder and your shares are held in "street name" through a broker, bank or other nominee, you
must provide the record holder of your shares with instructions on how to vote the shares. Please follow the voting instructions provided
by the bank or broker. You may not vote shares held in street name by returning a proxy card directly to Rockwell Collins or by voting in
person at the Rockwell Collins special meeting unless you provide a "legal proxy," which you must obtain from your broker, bank or other
nominee. Further, brokers, banks or other nominees who hold shares of Rockwell Collins common stock on behalf of their customers may
not give a proxy to Rockwell Collins to vote those shares with respect to the Share Issuance proposal and the Rockwell Collins
Adjournment proposal without specific instructions from their customers, as brokers, banks and other nominees do not have discretionary
voting power on these "non-routine" matters. Broker non-votes occur when a broker or nominee is not instructed by the beneficial owner
of shares to vote on a particular proposal for which the broker does not have discretionary voting power. Therefore, if you are a Rockwell
Collins stockholder and you do not instruct your broker, bank or other nominee on how to vote your shares:

• your broker, bank or other nominee may not vote your shares on the Share Issuance proposal, which broker non-votes, if
any, will have no effect on the vote count for such proposal (assuming a quorum is present); and 

• your broker, bank or other nominee may not vote your shares on the Rockwell Collins Adjournment proposal, which broker
non-votes, if any, will have no effect on the vote count for such proposal (regardless of whether a quorum is present).

Attendance at the Rockwell Collins Special Meeting and Voting in Person 

        Stockholders who wish to attend the Rockwell Collins special meeting will be required to present verification of ownership of
Rockwell Collins common stock, such as a bank or brokerage firm account statement, and will be required to present a valid government-
issued picture identification, such as a driver's license or passport, to gain admittance to the Rockwell Collins special meeting.

        If you are a stockholder of record and plan to attend the Rockwell Collins special meeting and wish to vote in person, you will be
given a ballot at the Rockwell Collins special meeting. Please note, however, that if your shares are held of record by a broker, bank or
other nominee, and you wish to

vote in person at the Rockwell Collins special meeting, you must bring to the Rockwell Collins special meeting a legal proxy from the
record holder of the shares (your broker, bank or other nominee) authorizing you to vote at the Rockwell Collins special meeting.

        No cameras, recording equipment, electronic devices, large bags, briefcases or packages will be permitted in the Rockwell
Collins special meeting.

Revocability of Proxies 

        Any stockholder giving a proxy has the power to revoke it at any time before the proxy is voted at the Rockwell Collins special
meeting. If you are a stockholder of record, you may revoke your proxy in any of the following ways:

• By delivering, before 11:59 p.m. (Central time) on March 8, 2017, to Rockwell Collins' Corporate Secretary or Assistant
Secretary (at Rockwell Collins' executive offices at 400 Collins Road NE, Cedar Rapids, Iowa) a signed written notice of
revocation bearing a later date than the proxy, stating that the proxy is revoked; 

• By duly executing a subsequently dated proxy relating to the same shares of Rockwell Collins common stock and
delivering it to Rockwell Collins' Corporate Secretary or Assistant Secretary at the address in the bullet above before 11:59
p.m. (Central time) on March 8, 2017; 

• By duly submitting a subsequently dated proxy relating to the same shares of Rockwell Collins common stock by
telephone or via the Internet (i.e., your most recent duly submitted voting instructions will be followed) before 11:59 p.m.
(Central time) on March 8, 2017; or 

• By attending the Rockwell Collins special meeting in person and voting such shares during the Rockwell Collins special
meeting as described above, although attendance at the Rockwell Collins special meeting will not, by itself, revoke a proxy.

        If you hold shares of Rockwell Collins common stock through the Rockwell Collins 401(k) Plan, you may revoke your proxy using
any of the above methods (other than as described in the 4th bullet above), but must do so before 11:59 p.m. (Central time) on March 5,
2017 if you vote by telephone or via the Internet and your revocation must be received by March 5, 2017 if you vote by mail.

        If your shares are held by a broker, bank or other nominee or through the Rockwell Collins 401(k) Plan, you may change your vote by
submitting new voting instructions to your broker, bank or other nominee. You must contact your broker, bank or other nominee, or
Rockwell Collins 401(k) Plan administrator to find out how to do so.

Solicitation 

        The Rockwell Collins Board is soliciting proxies for the Rockwell Collins special meeting from its stockholders. Rockwell Collins
will bear the entire cost of the solicitation of proxies, including preparation, assembly and delivery, as applicable, of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus, the proxy card and any additional materials furnished to stockholders. Proxies may be solicited by directors, officers
and a small number of Rockwell Collins' regular employees personally or by mail, telephone or facsimile, but such persons will not be
specially compensated for such service. Rockwell Collins has retained Innisfree M&A Incorporated, a proxy solicitation firm, to assist in
the solicitation of proxies for a fee of approximately $23,000 plus reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses. As appropriate, copies of
solicitation material will be furnished to brokerage houses, fiduciaries and custodians that hold shares of Rockwell Collins common stock
of record for beneficial owners for forwarding to such beneficial owners. Rockwell Collins may also reimburse persons representing
beneficial owners for their costs of forwarding the solicitation material to such owners.

ROCKWELL COLLINS PROPOSALS 

Item 1.    The Share Issuance Proposal 

        (Item 1 on Rockwell Collins Proxy Card)

        In the Share Issuance proposal, Rockwell Collins is asking its stockholders to approve the issuance of Rockwell Collins common
stock pursuant to the merger agreement. Approval of the Share Issuance proposal by Rockwell Collins stockholders is required for
completion of the merger.

        The Rockwell Collins Board unanimously recommends a vote "FOR" the Share Issuance proposal (Item 1).

Item 2.    The Rockwell Collins Adjournment Proposal 

        (Item 2 on Rockwell Collins Proxy Card)

        The Rockwell Collins special meeting may be adjourned to another time or place from time to time, if necessary or appropriate, to
permit further solicitation of proxies in the event there are not sufficient votes at the time of the Rockwell Collins Special Meeting to
approve the Share Issuance proposal.

        If, at the Rockwell Collins special meeting, the number of shares of Rockwell Collins common stock present or represented and
voting in favor of the Share Issuance proposal is insufficient to approve the Share Issuance proposal, Rockwell Collins intends to adjourn
the Rockwell Collins special meeting in order to enable the Rockwell Collins Board to solicit additional proxies for approval of the Share
Issuance proposal.

        In the Rockwell Collins Adjournment proposal, Rockwell Collins is asking its stockholders to authorize the holder of any proxy
solicited by the Rockwell Collins Board to vote in favor of granting authority to the proxy holders, and each of them individually, to
adjourn the Rockwell Collins special meeting to another time and place for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies. If the Rockwell
Collins stockholders approve the Rockwell Collins Adjournment proposal, Rockwell Collins could adjourn the Rockwell Collins special
meeting and any adjourned session of the Rockwell Collins special meeting and use the additional time to solicit additional proxies,
including the solicitation of proxies from Rockwell Collins stockholders who have previously voted.

        The Rockwell Collins Board unanimously recommends a vote "FOR" the Rockwell Collins Adjournment proposal (Item 2).

B/E AEROSPACE SPECIAL MEETING 

        This joint proxy statement/prospectus is being provided to the B/E Aerospace stockholders as part of a solicitation of proxies by the
B/E Aerospace Board for use at the B/E Aerospace special meeting to be held at the time and place specified below and at any properly
convened meeting following an adjournment or postponement thereof. This joint proxy statement/prospectus provides B/E Aerospace
stockholders with information they need to know to be able to vote or instruct their vote to be cast at the B/E Aerospace special meeting.

Date, Time and Place 

        The special meeting of B/E Aerospace stockholders will be held at the Hilton Palm Beach Airport, 150 Australian Avenue, West Palm
Beach, Florida, 33406-1473, on March 9, 2017, at 10:00 a.m. (Eastern time) B/E Aerospace intends to mail this joint proxy
statement/prospectus and the enclosed form of proxy to its stockholders entitled to vote at the B/E Aerospace special meeting on or about
February 6, 2017.

Purpose of the B/E Aerospace Special Meeting 

        At the B/E Aerospace special meeting, B/E Aerospace stockholders will be asked to consider and vote on the following:

• a proposal to adopt the merger agreement, which is further described in the sections titled "The Merger" and "The Merger
Agreement," beginning on page 57 and page 128, respectively, and a copy of which is attached as Annex A to the joint
proxy statement/prospectus accompanying this notice, which is referred to as the Merger proposal; 

• an advisory (non-binding) proposal to approve the compensation that may be paid or become payable to B/E Aerospace's
named executive officers that is based on or otherwise related to the proposed transactions, which is referred to as the
Merger-Related Compensation proposal; and 

• a proposal to approve the adjournment of the B/E Aerospace special meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary or
appropriate, to solicit additional proxies in the event there are not sufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to
approve the Merger proposal, which is referred to as the B/E Aerospace Adjournment proposal.

        Completion of the merger is conditioned on the approval of the Merger proposal.

Recommendation of the B/E Aerospace Board 

        On October 23, 2016, the B/E Aerospace Board adopted the merger agreement, declared the merger agreement advisable and
determined that the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement are in the best interests of B/E Aerospace and
its stockholders. Accordingly, the B/E Aerospace Board unanimously recommends that B/E Aerospace stockholders vote "FOR"
the Merger proposal, "FOR" the Merger-Related Compensation proposal and "FOR" the B/E Aerospace Adjournment proposal.

        B/E Aerospace stockholders should carefully read this joint proxy statement/prospectus, including any documents incorporated by
reference, and the annexes in their entirety for more detailed information concerning the merger and the other transactions contemplated
by the merger agreement.

B/E Aerospace Record Date; Stockholders Entitled to Vote 

        Only holders of record of B/E Aerospace common stock at the close of business on January 18, 2017 will be entitled to notice of, and
to vote at, the B/E Aerospace special meeting or any adjournments or postponements thereof.

Table of Contents

        As of the record date, there were 101,515,298 shares of B/E Aerospace common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the B/E
Aerospace special meeting. Each share of B/E Aerospace common stock outstanding on the B/E Aerospace record date entitles the holder
thereof to one vote on each proposal to be considered at the B/E Aerospace special meeting, in person or by proxy through the Internet or
by telephone or by a properly executed and delivered proxy with respect to the B/E Aerospace special meeting.

        A complete list of stockholders entitled to vote at the B/E Aerospace special meeting will be available for examination by any B/E
Aerospace stockholder in the Investor Relations department at B/E Aerospace's corporate office at 1400 Corporate Center Way,
Wellington, Florida, for purposes pertaining to the B/E Aerospace special meeting, between the hours of 9:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. (Eastern
time) for a period of 10 days before the B/E Aerospace special meeting, and at the time and place of the B/E Aerospace special meeting.

Voting by B/E Aerospace's Directors and Executive Officers 

        As of the record date, B/E Aerospace directors and executive officers and their affiliates were entitled to vote 269,296 shares of
B/E Aerospace common stock or less than 1% of the shares of B/E Aerospace common stock outstanding on that date. B/E Aerospace
currently expects its directors and executive officers to vote their shares in favor of all B/E Aerospace proposals, but no director or
executive officer has entered into any agreement obligating him or her to do so. The number of shares reflected above does not include
shares subject to outstanding unvested restricted stock awards or shares underlying unvested restricted stock units. For information with
respect to restricted stock awards and restricted stock units, please see "—Treatment of Restricted Stock Awards" and "—Treatment of
Restricted Stock Units" beginning on page 103 and page 104, respectively.

Quorum 

        The B/E Aerospace by-laws require that the holders of a majority of the votes entitled to be cast be present in person or by proxy in
order for the business of the B/E Aerospace special meeting to be transacted.

        Abstentions will count for the purpose of determining the presence of a quorum for the transaction of business at the B/E Aerospace
special meeting.

        Broker non-votes, if any, will not be counted for the purpose of determining the presence of a quorum for the transaction of business
at the B/E Aerospace special meeting.

Required Vote 

        The required votes to approve the B/E Aerospace proposals are as follows:

• The Merger proposal requires the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of B/E
Aerospace common stock. 

• The Merger-Related Compensation proposal requires the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the votes cast by
stockholders entitled to vote on the proposal that are present in person or represented by proxy, assuming a quorum.
Because the vote on the Merger-Related Compensation proposal is advisory only, it will not be binding on either B/E
Aerospace or Rockwell Collins. Accordingly, if the Merger proposal is approved and the merger is completed, the merger-
related compensation will be payable to B/E Aerospace's named executive officers, subject only to the conditions
applicable thereto, regardless of the outcome of the approval of the Merger-Related Compensation proposal.

Table of Contents

General 

        Please be aware that any costs related to voting via the Internet, such as Internet access charges, will be your responsibility.

        All properly signed proxies that are timely received and that are not revoked will be voted at the B/E Aerospace special meeting
according to the instructions indicated on the proxies or, if no direction is indicated, they will be voted as recommended by the B/E
Aerospace Board. Unless a B/E Aerospace stockholder checks the box on its proxy card to withhold discretionary authority, the proxy
holders may use their discretion to vote on other matters relating to the B/E Aerospace special meeting.

Treatment of Abstentions; Failure to Vote 

        For purposes of the B/E Aerospace special meeting, an abstention occurs when a B/E Aerospace stockholder attends the B/E
Aerospace special meeting, either in person or by proxy, but abstains from voting.

• For the Merger proposal, if a B/E Aerospace stockholder present in person at the B/E Aerospace special meeting abstains
from voting, or responds by proxy with an "abstain" vote, it will have the effect of a vote cast "AGAINST" such proposal.
If a B/E Aerospace stockholder is not present in person at the B/E Aerospace special meeting and does not respond by
proxy, it will have the effect of a vote cast "AGAINST" such proposal. 

• For the Merger-Related Compensation proposal, if a B/E Aerospace stockholder present in person at the B/E Aerospace
special meeting abstains from voting, or responds by proxy with an "abstain" vote, it will have no effect on the vote count
for such proposal. If a B/E Aerospace stockholder is not present in person at the B/E Aerospace special meeting and does
not respond by proxy, it will have no effect on the vote count for such proposal (assuming a quorum is present). 

• For the B/E Aerospace Adjournment proposal, if a B/E Aerospace stockholder present in person at the B/E Aerospace
special meeting abstains from voting, or responds by proxy with an "abstain" vote, it will have no effect on the vote count
for such proposal. If a B/E Aerospace stockholder is not present in person at the B/E Aerospace special meeting and does
not respond by proxy, it will have no effect on the vote count for such proposal (assuming a quorum is present).

Shares Held in Street Name 

        If you are a B/E Aerospace stockholder and your shares are held in "street name" through a broker, bank or other nominee, you must
provide the record holder of your shares with instructions on how to vote the shares. Please follow the voting instructions provided by the
bank or broker. You may not vote shares held in street name by returning a proxy card directly to B/E Aerospace or by voting in person at
the B/E Aerospace special meeting unless you provide a "legal proxy," which you must obtain from your broker, bank or other nominee.
Further, brokers, banks or other nominees who hold shares of B/E Aerospace common stock on behalf of their customers may not give a
proxy to B/E Aerospace to vote those shares with respect to the Merger proposal, the Merger-Related Compensation proposal and the B/E
Aerospace Adjournment proposal without specific instructions from their customers, as brokers, banks and other nominees do not have
discretionary voting power on these "non-routine" matters. Broker non-votes occur when a broker or nominee is not instructed by the
beneficial owner of shares to vote on a particular proposal for which the broker does not have discretionary voting power.

169



8/28/2019 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/861361/000104746917000512/a2230778zdefm14a.htm

Table of Contents

Therefore, if you are a B/E Aerospace stockholder and you do not instruct your broker, bank or other nominee on how to vote your shares:

• your broker, bank or other nominee may not vote your shares on the Merger proposal, which broker non-votes, if any, will
have the same effect as a vote AGAINST such proposal; 

• your broker, bank or other nominee may not vote your shares on the Merger-Related Compensation proposal, which broker
non-votes, if any, will have no effect on the vote count for such proposal (assuming a quorum is present); and 

• your broker, bank or other nominee may not vote your shares on the B/E Aerospace Adjournment proposal, which broker
non-votes, if any, will have no effect on the vote count for such proposal (regardless of whether a quorum is present).

Attendance at the B/E Aerospace Special Meeting and Voting in Person 

        Stockholders who wish to attend the B/E Aerospace special meeting will be required to present verification of ownership of B/E
Aerospace common stock, such as a bank or brokerage firm account statement, and will be required to present a valid government-issued
picture identification, such as a driver's license or passport, to gain admittance to the B/E Aerospace special meeting.

        If you are a stockholder of record and plan to attend the B/E Aerospace special meeting and wish to vote in person, you will be given
a ballot at the B/E Aerospace special meeting. Please note, however, that if your shares are held of record by a broker, bank or other
nominee, and you wish to vote in person at the B/E Aerospace special meeting, you must bring to the B/E Aerospace special meeting a
legal proxy from the record holder of the shares (your broker, bank or other nominee) authorizing you to vote at the B/E Aerospace special
meeting. In addition, as noted above, if you hold shares through the B/E Aerospace 401(k) Plan, you may attend the B/E Aerospace special
meeting, but those shares can only be voted as described above, and cannot be voted at the B/E Aerospace special meeting.

        No cameras, recording equipment, electronic devices, large bags, briefcases or packages will be permitted in the B/E
Aerospace special meeting.

Revocability of Proxies 

        Any stockholder giving a proxy has the power to revoke it at any time before the proxy is voted at the B/E Aerospace special meeting.
If you are a stockholder of record, you may revoke your proxy in any of the following ways:

• By delivering, before 6:00 p.m. (Eastern time) on March 8, 2017, to B/E Aerospace's Corporate Secretary, or Assistant
Secretary, (at B/E Aerospace's executive offices at 1400 Corporate Center Way, Wellington, Florida) a signed written notice
of revocation bearing a later date than the proxy, stating that the proxy is revoked; 

• By duly executing a subsequently dated proxy relating to the same shares of B/E Aerospace common stock and delivering
it to B/E Aerospace's Corporate Secretary, or Assistant Secretary, at the address in the bullet above before 12:00 p.m.
(Eastern time) on March 8, 2017; 

• By duly submitting a subsequently dated proxy relating to the same shares of B/E Aerospace common stock by telephone
or via the Internet (i.e., your most recent duly submitted voting instructions will be followed) before 11:59 p.m. (Eastern
time) on March 8, 2017; or 

• By attending the B/E Aerospace special meeting in person and voting such shares during the B/E Aerospace special
meeting as described above, although attendance at the B/E Aerospace special meeting will not, by itself, revoke a proxy.

Table of Contents

        If you hold shares of B/E Aerospace common stock through the B/E Aerospace 401(k) Plan, you may revoke your proxy using any of
the above methods (other than (4) above), but must do so before 11:59 p.m. (Eastern time) on March 6, 2017 if you vote by telephone or
via the Internet and your revocation must be received before 6:00 p.m. (Eastern time) on March 6, 2017 if you vote by mail.

        If your shares are held by a broker, bank or other nominee or through the B/E Aerospace 401(k) Plan, you may change your vote by
submitting new voting instructions to your broker, bank or other nominee. You must contact your broker, bank or other nominee, or B/E
Aerospace 401(k) Plan administrator to find out how to do so.

Solicitation 

        The B/E Aerospace Board is soliciting proxies for the B/E Aerospace special meeting from its stockholders. B/E Aerospace will bear
the entire cost of the solicitation of proxies, including preparation, assembly and delivery, as applicable, of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus, the proxy card and any additional materials furnished to stockholders. Proxies may be solicited by directors, officers
and a small number of B/E Aerospace's regular employees personally or by mail, telephone or facsimile, but such persons will not be
specially compensated for such service. B/E Aerospace has retained Georgeson LLC to assist in the solicitation of proxies for a fee of
approximately $15,000 plus reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses. As appropriate, copies of solicitation material will be furnished
to brokerage houses, fiduciaries and custodians that hold shares of B/E Aerospace common stock of record for beneficial owners for
forwarding to such beneficial owners. B/E Aerospace may also reimburse persons representing beneficial owners for their costs of
forwarding the solicitation material to such owners.

        If you need assistance with voting via the Internet, voting by telephone or completing your proxy card, or have questions regarding
the B/E Aerospace special meeting, please contact B/E Aerospace's Investor Relations department at (561) 791-5000.

        Your vote is very important regardless of the number of shares of B/E Aerospace common stock that you own. Please vote
your shares via the Internet or by telephone, or sign, date and return a proxy card promptly to ensure that your shares can be
represented, even if you otherwise plan to attend the B/E Aerospace special meeting in person.

Tabulation of Votes 

        B/E Aerospace has appointed Computershare Trust Company, N.A., which is referred to as Computershare to serve as the Inspector
of Election for the B/E Aerospace special meeting. Computershare will independently tabulate affirmative and negative votes and
abstentions.

Adjournments 

        The B/E Aerospace special meeting may be adjourned to allow additional time for obtaining additional proxies. No notice of an
adjourned meeting need be given if the time and place thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment was taken unless:

• the adjournment is for more than 30 days, in which case a notice of the adjourned meeting will be given to each
stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting; or 

• if after the adjournment, a new record date for determination of stockholders entitled to vote is fixed for the adjourned
meeting, in which case the B/E Aerospace Board will fix as the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice
of such adjourned meeting the same or an earlier date as that fixed for determination of stockholders entitled to vote at the
adjourned meeting, and will give notice of the adjourned meeting to each stockholder of record as of such record date.

        At any adjourned meeting, all proxies will be voted in the same manner as they would have been voted at the original convening of
the special meeting, except for any proxies that have been effectively revoked or withdrawn prior to the adjourned meeting.

Table of Contents

B/E AEROSPACE PROPOSALS 

Item 1.    The Merger Proposal 

        (Item 1 on B/E Aerospace Proxy Card)

        In the Merger proposal, B/E Aerospace is asking its stockholders to adopt the merger agreement. Approval of the Merger proposal by
B/E Aerospace stockholders is required for completion of the merger.

The B/E Aerospace Board unanimously recommends a vote "FOR" the Merger proposal (Item 1).

Item 2.    The Merger-Related Compensation Proposal 

        (Item 2 on B/E Aerospace Proxy Card)

        In the Merger-Related Compensation proposal, B/E Aerospace is asking its stockholders to approve, on an advisory basis, the merger-
related compensation arrangements of B/E Aerospace's named executive officers.

        Because the vote on the Merger-Related Compensation proposal is advisory only, it will not be binding on either B/E Aerospace or
Rockwell Collins. Accordingly, if the Merger proposal is approved and the merger is completed, the merger-related compensation will be
payable to B/E Aerospace's named executive officers, subject only to the conditions applicable thereto, regardless of the outcome of the
approval of the Merger-Related Compensation proposal.

        The B/E Aerospace Board unanimously recommends a vote "FOR" the Merger-Related Compensation proposal (Item 2).

Item 3.    The B/E Aerospace Adjournment Proposal 

        (Item 3 on B/E Aerospace Proxy Card)

        The B/E Aerospace special meeting may be adjourned to another time or place from time to time, if necessary or appropriate, to
permit further solicitation of proxies in the event there are not sufficient votes at the time of the B/E Aerospace Special Meeting to approve
the Merger proposal.

        If, at the B/E Aerospace special meeting, the number of shares of B/E Aerospace common stock present or represented and voting in
favor of the Merger proposal is insufficient to approve the Merger proposal, B/E Aerospace intends to adjourn the B/E Aerospace special
meeting in order to enable the B/E Aerospace Board to solicit additional proxies for approval of the Merger proposal.

        In the B/E Aerospace Adjournment proposal, B/E Aerospace is asking its stockholders to authorize the holder of any proxy solicited
by the B/E Aerospace Board to vote in favor of granting authority to the proxy holders, and each of them individually, to adjourn the B/E
Aerospace special meeting to another time and place for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies. If the B/E Aerospace stockholders
approve the B/E Aerospace Adjournment proposal, B/E Aerospace could adjourn the B/E Aerospace special meeting and any adjourned
session of the B/E Aerospace special meeting and use the additional time to solicit additional proxies, including the solicitation of proxies
from B/E Aerospace stockholders who have previously voted.

        The B/E Aerospace Board unanimously recommends a vote "FOR" the B/E Aerospace Adjournment proposal (Item 3).

UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

        The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements have been prepared to illustrate the estimated effects of
the merger and the related financing transactions. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as of September 30, 2016 is
based on the individual historical consolidated balance sheets of Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace, and has been prepared to reflect the
merger as if it occurred on September 30, 2016, which was the end of Rockwell Collins 2016 fiscal year. The unaudited pro forma
condensed combined statement of income for the year ended September 30, 2016 combines the historical results of operations of Rockwell
Collins and B/E Aerospace, and has been prepared to reflect the merger as if it occurred on October 1, 2015, the first day of Rockwell
Collins 2016 fiscal year.

        Rockwell Collins operates on a 52/53 week fiscal year ending on the Friday closest to September 30. Fiscal year 2016 was a 52-week
year. For ease of presentation, September 30 is utilized consistently throughout these unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial
statements and notes to represent the fiscal year-end date. All date references contained herein relate to Rockwell Collins' fiscal year
unless otherwise stated. B/E Aerospace's fiscal year ends on December 31. As a result of Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace's different
fiscal years:

• The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as of September 30, 2016 combines Rockwell Collins'
historical consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2016, which was the end of Rockwell Collins' 2016 fiscal year,
and B/E Aerospace's historical unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2016, which was the
end of its third fiscal quarter; and 

• The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of income for the year ended September 30, 2016 combines
Rockwell Collins' historical results of operations for the year ended September 30, 2016, which was the end of Rockwell
Collins' 2016 fiscal year, and B/E Aerospace's historical unaudited results of operations for the 12 months ended
September 30, 2016, which have been derived from B/E Aerospace's condensed consolidated statement of operations for
the three months ended December 31, 2015 and from B/E Aerospace's condensed consolidated statement of operations for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016.

        The historical consolidated financial information in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements has been
adjusted to give effect to pro forma events that are (1) directly attributable to the merger, (2) factually supportable and (3) with respect to
the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of income, expected to have a continuing impact on the combined results of
Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements do not give effect to any cost
savings, operating synergies or revenue synergies that may result from the merger or the costs to achieve any such cost savings, operating
synergies and revenue synergies, except for adjustments to reflect the net decrease in compensation expense related to certain B/E
Aerospace executives and B/E Aerospace Board members for whom employment terminates immediately upon change in control in
accordance with existing employment arrangements.

        The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements are for informational purposes only and are not necessarily
indicative of what the actual financial results of Rockwell Collins would have been had the merger occurred on the dates or for the periods
indicated, nor do they purport to project the financial results of Rockwell Collins for any future periods or as of any date. The unaudited
pro forma combined financial statements contain estimated adjustments, which are based on information available to management;
accordingly, such adjustments are subject to change and the impact of such changes may be material. Although Rockwell Collins and
B/E Aerospace have entered into the merger agreement, there is no guarantee that the merger will be completed on the terms set forth
therein or at all.

NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

NOTE 1: Description of the Transaction and Basis of Presentation 

        On October 23, 2016, Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace announced that the board of directors of both companies reached an
agreement under which Rockwell Collins will acquire B/E Aerospace. Upon completion of the merger, each issued and outstanding share
of B/E Aerospace common stock will be converted into the right to receive the $62.00 per share merger consideration, including $34.10 in
cash and a number of Rockwell Collins shares equal to the exchange ratio, which depends on the Rockwell Collins stock price. If the
Rockwell Collins stock price is greater than or equal to $77.41 and less than or equal to $89.97 per share, the exchange ratio will be the
quotient of $27.90 divided by the Rockwell Collins stock price. If the Rockwell Collins stock price is greater than $89.97, the exchange
ratio will be 0.3101. If the Rockwell Collins stock price is less than $77.41, the exchange ratio will be 0.3604. Accordingly, the actual
number of shares and the value of Rockwell Collins common stock delivered to B/E Aerospace stockholders will depend on the Rockwell
Collins stock price, and the value of the shares of Rockwell Collins common stock delivered for each such share of B/E Aerospace
common stock may be greater than, less than or equal to $27.90. A 10% increase or decrease in the price of Rockwell Collins common
stock from the closing price of Rockwell Collins common stock as of January 26, 2017 of $91.26 per share would increase the value of
merger consideration to be paid by approximately $283 million or decrease the value of merger consideration to be paid by approximately
$40 million, respectively.

        Rockwell Collins anticipates that approximately $3.560 billion will be required to pay the aggregate cash portion of the merger
consideration to the B/E Aerospace stockholders. Rockwell Collins expects to issue up to $4.35 billion in aggregate principal amount of its
senior unsecured notes in one or more public offerings and/or private placements and borrow up to $1.5 billion under a new senior
unsecured syndicated term loan facility. Rockwell Collins has obtained a bridge loan commitment of $4.35 billion that would be funded
only to the extent some or all of the senior unsecured notes described above are not issued prior to the consummation of the acquisition.
There can be no assurance that Rockwell Collins will finance the merger in the manner and amount as anticipated.

        The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements were prepared using the acquisition method of accounting in
accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 805, Business Combinations, or ASC 805, which requires the determination of the
acquirer, the acquisition date, the fair value of assets and liabilities of the acquiree and the measurement of goodwill. Rockwell Collins is
considered to be the acquirer of B/E Aerospace for accounting purposes.

        To prepare the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements, Rockwell Collins adjusted B/E Aerospace's assets and
liabilities to their estimated fair values based on preliminary valuation work. As of the date of this joint proxy statement/ prospectus,
Rockwell Collins has not completed the detailed valuation work necessary to finalize the required estimated fair values of the B/E
Aerospace assets to be acquired and liabilities to be assumed and the related allocation of purchase price. The final allocation of the
purchase price will be determined after the transaction is completed and after completion of an analysis to determine the estimated net fair
value of B/E Aerospace's assets and liabilities. Accordingly, the final acquisition accounting adjustments may be materially different from
the unaudited pro forma adjustments. Also, as of the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, Rockwell Collins has not identified all
adjustments necessary to conform B/E Aerospace's accounting policies to Rockwell Collins accounting policies. Rockwell Collins will
conduct a final review of B/E Aerospace's accounting policies as of the date of the completion of the merger in an effort to determine if
differences in accounting policies require adjustment or reclassification of B/E Aerospace's results of operations or reclassification of
assets or liabilities to conform to Rockwell Collins' accounting policies and classifications. As a result of this review, the final acquisition
accounting adjustments may be materially different from the unaudited pro forma

adjustments. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements do not give effect to any cost savings, operating synergies
or revenue synergies that may result from the merger or the costs to achieve any such cost savings, operating synergies and revenue
synergies, except for adjustments to reflect the net decrease in compensation expense related to certain B/E Aerospace executives and
B/E Aerospace Board members for whom employment terminates immediately upon change in control in accordance with existing
employment arrangements. There were no material transactions between Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace during the periods
presented in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements that would need to be eliminated except as detailed in
Note 3p below.

NOTE 2: Preliminary Consideration Transferred and Preliminary Fair Value of Net Assets Acquired 

        The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet has been adjusted to reflect the estimated fair values of the
B/E Aerospace identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The excess of consideration over these fair values is recorded to
goodwill. The preliminary unaudited pro forma purchase price allocation was based on discussions with B/E Aerospace's management,
Rockwell Collins historical experience, data that was available through the public domain, Rockwell Collins due diligence review of
B/E Aerospace's business, and reviews of publicly disclosed allocations for other acquisitions in the industry. Until the merger is
completed, Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace are limited in their ability to share information with each other. Upon completion of the
merger, additional valuation work will be performed and any increases or decreases in the fair value of assets acquired or liabilities
assumed will result in adjustments to the balance sheet and/or statement of income until the purchase price allocation is finalized. The
following tables represent the estimated consideration transferred and preliminary allocation of total estimated consideration transferred as
if the merger occurred on September 30, 2016:

c. Inventories, net

        The adjustments reflect the reclassification of $97 million of percentage of completion program costs and estimated earnings in
excess of billings (see Note 3b) and the elimination of $507 million of B/E Aerospace capitalized development costs on long-term seller
furnished equipment (SFE) contracts. Revenue for the SFE contracts is recognized on percentage of completion (units of delivery) basis by
B/E Aerospace but is expected to be recognized when realizable and earned, consistent with the guidance in Staff Accounting Bulletin 104
(SAB 104), after the merger in order to conform with Rockwell Collins' accounting policies. The transition from percentage of completion
to SAB 104 revenue recognition for the SFE programs is not expected to have a material impact on the timing of revenue recognition
related to those programs, but will have an impact on the timing of costs as reflected in Note 3r.

d. Goodwill

        The adjustment reflects the elimination of $814 million of historical B/E Aerospace goodwill, offset by the addition of new goodwill
resulting from the merger. The $6.146 billion of estimated merger-related goodwill is based on the preliminary estimates and information
summarized in Note 2.

e. Intangible assets

        The adjustment reflects the elimination of $221 million of historical B/E Aerospace intangible assets, offset by a preliminary fair
value estimate of identifiable intangible assets acquired. The intangible assets to be acquired primarily consist of the following:

f. Deferred income taxes

        The net adjustment of $733 million, comprised of a $219 million reduction of deferred tax assets and a $514 million increase in
deferred tax liabilities, is primarily due to recording the deferred tax impact of the acquired intangibles which are not tax deductible and
the impact of the inventory adjustments related to the SFE contracts.

g. Other assets

        Adjustments reflect changes in capitalized debt issuance costs due to the following:

        See Note 3h for additional discussion of the related changes in short and long-term debt associated with the merger.

h. Short-term debt and Long-term debt, net

        Adjustments to Short-term debt and Long-term debt, net include the following:

        Rockwell Collins expects to fund the cash component of the acquisition consideration and refinance debt acquired with the
transaction by issuing up to $4.35 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes in one or more public offerings and/or
private placements and borrowing up to $1.5 billion under a new senior unsecured syndicated term loan facility. Rockwell Collins has
obtained a bridge loan commitment of $4.35 billion that would be drawn only to the extent some or all of the senior unsecured notes
described above are not issued prior to consummation of the acquisition. Rockwell Collins also plans to enter into an agreement to extend
the duration of its current five-year revolving credit facility by approximately three years and increase the amount available under the
facility to $1.5 billion from $1.2 billion currently available under its five-year and 364-day facilities. There can be no assurance that
Rockwell Collins will finance the merger in the manner and amounts as anticipated.

        Rockwell Collins has assumed, for purposes of the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements, that it will borrow
$4.35 billion under the bridge facility and $1.5 billion under a new term loan facility. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined
balance sheet as of September 30, 2016 has been adjusted to reflect the merger as if it occurred on September 30, 2016, and consequently,
in connection with obtaining the committed debt financing on such date, approximately $28 million of financing costs were recorded in
Other Assets on the unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet.

        As noted above, Rockwell Collins anticipates that some or all of the bridge facility will be replaced prior to funding by the issuance
of debt securities. Further, at or shortly after completion of the merger, Rockwell Collins expects to repay the outstanding $2.064 billion
principal amount of B/E Aerospace's existing term loan facility, which includes $28 million unamortized issuance costs. Based on this
anticipated debt financing and repayment of debt, Rockwell Collins estimates that the debt issuance costs (including underwriting fees and
related expenses) related to the $4.35 billion senior unsecured notes, rather than the bridge facility, would increase from $22 million to
approximately $40 million, and that the amortization, recorded as interest expense, would decrease from $22 million to approximately
$4 million for the year ended September 30, 2016. Actual amounts could differ from these assumptions.

i. Accounts payable

        The adjustments reflect the accrual of $33 million of Rockwell Collins estimated transaction related costs and $65 million of
B/E Aerospace estimated transaction costs.

j. Current liabilities

        The adjustments reflect the reclassification of $563 million of B/E Aerospace current liabilities from Accrued liabilities to
Compensation and benefits ($83 million), Advance payments from customers

Adjustments to Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Statement of Income 

        The following pro forma adjustments have been reflected in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of income:

p. Revenues, Product sales and Service sales

        The adjustments reflect reclassifications to reflect the segmentation of $2.862 billion of B/E Aerospace Revenues into Product sales
($2.793 billion) and Service sales ($69 million) in order to conform to Rockwell Collins presentation. In addition, the adjustments reflect
the elimination of $2 million of product sales between Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace.

q. Cost of sales, Product cost of sales and Service cost of sales

        The adjustments reflect reclassifications to reflect the segmentation of $1.739 billion of B/E Aerospace Cost of sales into Product cost
of sales ($1.707 billion) and Service cost of sales ($32 million) in order to conform to Rockwell Collins presentation.

r. Product cost of sales

        Adjustments to Product cost of sales include the following:

        The amortization expense of new acquired intangible assets reflects straight-line amortization utilizing the asset values and useful
lives described in Note 3e. The elimination of net costs capitalized for program assets represents the net increase in capitalized program
assets during the 12 months ended September 30, 2016.

s. Selling, general and administrative expenses

        Adjustments reflect the net decrease in compensation expense related to certain B/E Aerospace executives and Board members for
whom employment terminates immediately upon change in control in accordance with existing employment arrangements.

t. Research, development and engineering

        The adjustment reflects the reclassification of $275 million of B/E Aerospace research, development and engineering costs from
Research, development and engineering to Product cost of sales in order to conform to Rockwell Collins presentation.

185

(in millions)  Amount  
Reclassification of B/E Aerospace Cost of sales (see Note 3q)  $ 1,707 
Reclassification of B/E Aerospace Research, development and engineering costs

Table of Contents

u. Interest expense

        Adjustments reflect the net increase in interest expense and debt issuance cost amortization related to new debt to finance a portion of
the acquisition and the repayment of the existing debt of B/E Aerospace as presented below:

        A 0.125 percent variance in the variable interest rate for the bridge facility would change interest expense for the year ended
September 30, 2016 by approximately $5 million. A 0.125% variance in the variable interest rate for the term loan would change interest
expense for the year ended September 30, 2016 by approximately $2 million.

        As described in Note 3h, Rockwell Collins anticipates that some or all of the bridge facility will be replaced prior to funding by
proceeds from the issuance of new debt securities. Based on this anticipated debt financing and loan repayment, Rockwell Collins
estimates that interest expense related to the $4.35 billion senior unsecured notes, rather than the bridge facility, would increase from
$101 million to approximately $166 million, and that the amortization, recorded as interest expense, would decrease from $22 million to
approximately $4 million for the year ended September 30, 2016. Further, Rockwell Collins would incur additional post-funding fees
under the bridge facility which would be avoided by issuing debt securities. These post-funding fees have not been reflected as an
adjustment to the unaudited pro forma income statement, as these fees would not have a continuing impact on the combined results of
Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace.

v. Income tax expense

        Adjustment reflects the applicable tax provision on the pro forma adjustments presented in the unaudited pro forma condensed
combined statement of income. The pro forma adjustments pertain primarily to the U.S. tax jurisdiction, and are subject to a 35% federal
tax rate, plus applicable state taxes.

186

(in millions)  Amount  
For new debt related to the acquisition:     

Bridge loan interest expense  $ 101 
Term loan interest expense   38 
Bridge loan issuance cost amortization   22 
Term loan issuance cost amortization   1 
Credit facility issuance cost amortization   3 

For debt expected to be repaid pursuant to the acquisition:     
B/E Aerospace term loan interest expense   (87)
B/E Aerospace term loan issuance cost amortization   (4)
Rockwell Collins credit facility issuance cost amortization   (2)

Pro forma adjustment, Interest expense  $ 72

is not permitted under the DGCL as in effect at the
time such liability is determined.

Indemnification of
Directors and Officers

 Under the DGCL, a Delaware corporation must indemnify its present or former directors and officers
against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred to the extent that the officer or
director has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit or proceeding brought
against him or her by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director or officer of the corporation.

  Delaware law provides that a corporation may indemnify its present and former directors, officers,
employees and agents, as well as any individual serving with another corporation in that capacity at the
corporation's request against expenses (including attorney's fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in
settlement of actions taken, if the individual acted in good faith and in a manner reasonably believed to be
in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the corporation and, in the case of a criminal proceeding, the
individual had no reasonable cause to believe the individual's conduct was unlawful; except that no
indemnification may be paid for judgments and settlements in actions by or in the right of the corporation.

  A corporation may not indemnify a current or former director or officer of the corporation against expenses
to the extent the person is adjudged to be liable to the corporation unless a court approves the indemnity.

director, officer, employee or agent of Rockwell
Collins or any of its majority-owned subsidiaries
(or any other entity at Rockwell Collins' request)
against expenses, judgments, fines and amounts
paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred
by such person in connection with such action, suit
or proceeding if such person acted in good faith
and in a manner such person reasonably believed
to be in or not opposed to the best interests of
Rockwell Collins and, with respect to any criminal
action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to
believe his or her conduct was unlawful; except,
with regard to actions or suits by or in the right of
Rockwell Collins to procure a judgment, no
indemnification will be made in respect of any
claim, issue or matter as to which the claimant has
been adjudged to be liable to Rockwell Collins,
unless the Court of Chancery of Delaware or the
court in which the action or suit was brought
determines that, despite the adjudication of such
liability, that claimant is fairly and reasonably
entitled to indemnity for the expenses which such
court deems proper.

 The B/E Aerospace certificate of incorporation
requires B/E Aerospace to indemnify any person
who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a
party to any threatened, pending or completed
action, suit or proceeding by reason of the fact that
such person is or was a director or officer of B/E
Aerospace against expenses, judgments, fines and
amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably
incurred by such person in connection with such
action, suit or proceeding to the fullest extent
permitted by Delaware law, as long as the action,
suit, proceeding, claim or counterclaim was not
initiated by or on behalf of such person. B/E
Aerospace is also required under its certificate of
incorporation to advance, to the maximum extent
permitted by Delaware, expenses incurred in
connection with any such action, suit or
proceeding.

  In the case of indemnification pursuant to the
above described provisions, indemnification will
be made only as authorized in the specific case
upon a determination that indemnification is
proper in accordance with the standards described
above.

 Any person seeking indemnification under the
provision described above will be deemed to have
met the standard of conduct required for such
indemnification unless the contrary is established.

Amendments to
Certificate of
Incorporation

 Under the DGCL, an amendment to the certificate of incorporation generally requires (i) the approval of the
board of directors, (ii) the approval of a majority of the voting power of the outstanding stock entitled to
vote upon the proposed amendment and (iii) the approval of the holders of a majority of the outstanding
stock of each class entitled to vote thereon as a class, if any.

  Rockwell Collins' certificate of incorporation
provides that the affirmative vote of the holders of
at least 80% of the voting power of the then
outstanding voting stock of Rockwell Collins is
required to amend, alter, change or repeal, or adopt
any provision of the certificate of incorporation
inconsistent with, certain designated provisions
relating to (i) the number and classification of the
Rockwell Collins Board, removal of Rockwell
Collins directors, filling vacancies on the Rockwell
Collins Board and the exemption of members of
the Rockwell Collins Board for monetary damages
related to breaches of fiduciary duty in certain
circumstances and (ii) amendment of the
certificate of incorporation.

 B/E Aerospace's certificate of incorporation
provides that the affirmative vote of not less than
two-thirds of the total number of votes of the then
outstanding shares of capital stock of B/E
Aerospace entitled to vote generally in the election
of directors is required to amend or repeal, or
adopt any provision inconsistent with the purpose
or intent of, the provision in the certificate of
incorporation relating to the classification of the
B/E Aerospace Board and removal of B/E
Aerospace directors.

  In all other instances, the DGCL standard for
amendment to the certificate of incorporation
described above applies.

 In all other instances, the DGCL standard for

  Rights of Rockwell Collins Stockholders  Rights of B/E Aerospace Stockholders
Amendments to
Bylaws

 Rockwell Collins' certificate of incorporation and
by-laws provide that the Rockwell Collins Board
may make, alter, amend and repeal the Rockwell
Collins by-laws, subject to the power of the
holders of capital stock of Rockwell Collins to
alter or repeal the by-laws made by the Rockwell
Collins Board; however, any such amendment or
repeal by stockholders of Rockwell Collins will
require the affirmative vote of the holders of at
least 80% of the voting power of the then
outstanding voting stock of Rockwell Collins,
voting together as a single class.

 B/E Aerospace's by-laws provide that the by-laws
may be adopted, amended or repealed by a vote of
a majority of the directors then in office or by vote
of a majority of the stock outstanding and entitled
to vote. Any by-law, whether adopted, amended or
repealed by the stockholders or directors, may be
amended or reinstated by the stockholders or the
directors.

Certain Business
Combinations

 Section 203 of the DGCL prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with a
stockholder acquiring more than 15% but less than 85% of the corporation's outstanding voting stock for
three years following the time that person becomes an "interested stockholder," unless prior to such date the
board of directors approves either the business combination or the transaction which resulted in the
stockholder becoming an interested stockholder or the business combination is approved by the board of
directors and by the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the outstanding voting stock that is not owned
by the interested stockholder or certain other exceptions are met. The DGCL allows a corporation's
certificate of incorporation to contain a provision expressly electing not to be governed by Section 203.

  Rockwell Collins' certificate of incorporation
includes restrictions on certain business
combinations (discussed further below) in addition
to the protections of the provisions of Section 203
of the DGCL discussed above. Because Rockwell
Collins has not opted out of Section 203 of the
DGCL, it remains subject to such provision.

 B/E Aerospace's certificate of incorporation does
not contain a provision electing not to be governed
by Section 203 of the DGCL, and so B/E
Aerospace is subject to such provision.

HOUSEHOLDING OF JOINT PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS 

        The SEC has adopted rules that permit companies and intermediaries such as brokers to satisfy delivery requirements for proxy
statements and annual reports with respect to two or more stockholders sharing the same address by delivering a single proxy statement or
annual report, as applicable, addressed to those stockholders. As permitted by the Exchange Act, only one copy of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus is being delivered to stockholders residing at the same address, unless stockholders have notified the company whose
shares they hold of their desire to receive multiple copies of the joint proxy statement/prospectus. This process, which is commonly
referred to as "householding," potentially provides extra convenience for stockholders and cost savings for companies. If, at any time, you
no longer wish to participate in householding and would prefer to receive a separate joint proxy statement/prospectus, or if you are
receiving multiple copies of this joint proxy statement/prospectus and wish to receive only one, please contact the company whose shares
you hold at their address identified below. Each of Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace will promptly deliver, upon oral or written
request, a separate copy of this joint proxy statement/prospectus to any stockholder residing at an address to which only one copy was
mailed. Requests for additional copies should be directed to: Rockwell Collins, Inc., 400 Collins Road NE, Cedar Rapids, Iowa 52498,
Attn: Shareowner Relations, or contact Rockwell Collins by telephone at (319) 295-4045, or to B/E Aerospace, Inc., 1400 Corporate

        (b)    Adjustments.     Without limiting the other provisions of this Agreement, if at any time during the period between the
date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the number or type of outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock
or Company Common Stock shall occur as a result of a reclassification, recapitalization, exchange, stock split (including a reverse
stock split), combination or readjustment of shares or any stock dividend or stock distribution with a record date during such
period, the Merger Consideration and any other similarly dependent items, as the case may be, shall be appropriately adjusted to
provide the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event. Nothing in this Section 2.1(b) shall be
construed to permit any party to take any action that is otherwise prohibited or restricted by any other provision of this Agreement.

        (c)    Fractional Shares.     No certificate or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon
the conversion of Company Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.1(a)(ii), and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the
owner thereof to any Parent Common Stock or to vote or to any other rights of a holder of Parent Common Stock. All fractional
shares that a single record holder of Company Common Stock would be otherwise entitled to receive shall be aggregated and
calculations shall be rounded to three (3) decimal places. In lieu of any such fractional shares, each holder of Company Common
Stock who would otherwise be entitled to such fractional shares shall be entitled to an amount in cash, without interest, rounded
down to the nearest cent, equal to the product of (i) the amount of the fractional share interest in a share of Parent Common Stock
to which such holder would, but for this Section 2.1(c), be entitled under Section 2.1(a)(ii) and (ii) the Parent Stock Price. As soon
as practicable after the determination of the amount of cash, if any, to be paid to holders of Company Common Stock in lieu of any
fractional share interests in Parent Common Stock, the Exchange Agent shall make available such amount, without interest, to the
holders of Company Common Stock entitled to receive such cash. The payment of cash in lieu of fractional share interests
pursuant to this Section 2.1(c) is not a separately bargained-for consideration.

        Section 2.2    Exchange of Certificates.     

        (a)    Designation of Exchange Agent; Deposit of Exchange Fund.     Prior to the Closing, Parent shall enter into a customary
exchange agreement with a nationally recognized financial institution designated by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the
Company (the "Exchange Agent") for the payment of the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.1(a)(ii). At or prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall deposit or cause to be deposited with the Exchange Agent, for exchange in accordance with this
Article II through the Exchange Agent, (i) book-entry shares (or certificates if requested) representing the full number of whole
shares of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to Section 2.1(a)(ii) in exchange for outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock and (ii) cash in an aggregate amount necessary to pay the Cash Consideration portion of the Merger Consideration, and
Parent shall, after the Effective Time on the appropriate payment date, if

applicable, provide or cause to be provided to the Exchange Agent any dividends or other distributions payable on such shares of
Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.2(d) (such shares of Parent Common Stock and Cash Consideration provided to the
Exchange Agent, together with any dividends or other distributions with respect thereto, the "Exchange Fund"). For purposes of
the deposit, Parent shall assume that there will not be any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock. Parent shall make available
to Exchange Agent, for addition to the Exchange Fund, from time to time as needed, cash sufficient to pay cash in lieu of fractional
shares in accordance with Section 2.1(c). In the event the Exchange Fund shall at any time be insufficient to make the payments
contemplated by Section 2.1(a)(ii), Parent shall promptly deposit, or cause to be deposited, additional funds with the Exchange
Agent in an amount which is equal to the deficiency in the amount required to make such payment. The Exchange Fund shall not
be used for any purpose other than to fund payments pursuant to Section 2.1, except as expressly provided for in this Agreement.

        (b)   As promptly as practicable following the Effective Time and, in no event later than the fifth (5th) Business Day thereafter,
Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share that immediately prior
to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, shall pass only upon
proper delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent, and which
shall be in the form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions (which instructions shall
be in the form and have such other provisions as Parent and Company may reasonably specify) for use in effecting the surrender of
the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for (A) cash in an amount equal to the Cash Consideration multiplied by the
number of shares of Company Common Stock previously represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, (B) the number
of shares of Parent Common Stock (which shall be in book-entry form unless a certificate is requested) representing, in the
aggregate, the whole number of shares that such holder has the right to receive in respect of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
pursuant to Section 2.1(a)(ii), (C) any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.2(d) and (D) cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock payable pursuant to Section 2.1(c).

        (c)   Upon surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Share for cancellation to the Exchange
Agent, together with a letter of transmittal duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and
such other documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor, and Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to pay and deliver in exchange therefor as
promptly as reasonably practicable, (i) cash in an amount equal to the Cash Consideration multiplied by the number of shares of
Company Common Stock previously represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares, (ii) the number of shares of Parent
Common Stock (which shall be in book-entry form unless a certificate is requested) representing, in the aggregate, the whole
number of shares that such holder has the right to receive in respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to
Section 2.1(a)(ii), (iii) any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.2(d) and (iv) cash in lieu of fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock payable pursuant to Section 2.1(c), and the Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-
Entry Share so surrendered shall be forthwith canceled. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2(c), each Certificate
(or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Share shall be deemed, from and after the Effective Time, to represent only the
right to receive the applicable Merger Consideration as contemplated by this Section 2.2(c) and any dividends or other distributions
payable pursuant to Section 2.2(d). The Exchange Agent shall accept such Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or
Book-Entry Shares upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Exchange Agent may impose to

effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices. No interest shall be paid or accrued for the
benefit of holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the cash payable upon the surrender of the Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares.

        (d)    Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares.     Subject to applicable Law, following surrender of a Certificate (or
affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, there shall be paid to the holder of
the Parent Common Stock issued in exchange for such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares, without interest, (i) at the time of delivery
of such Parent Common Stock by the Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 2.2(c), the amount of dividends or other distributions
with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such shares of Parent Common Stock and (ii) at the
appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to
such delivery of such Parent Common Stock by the Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 2.2(c), and a payment date subsequent to
such delivery of such Parent Common Stock by the Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 2.2(c), payable with respect to such shares
of Parent Common Stock.

        (e)   In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of the
Company, payment of the appropriate amount of Merger Consideration (and any dividends or other distributions with respect to
Parent Common Stock as contemplated by Section 2.2(d)) may be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the
Certificate or Book-Entry Share so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in
proper form for transfer (and accompanied by all documents reasonably required by the Exchange Agent) or such Book-Entry
Share shall be properly transferred and the Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required by
reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share or establish to the
satisfaction of Parent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable.

        (f)    Termination of Exchange Fund.     Any portion of the Exchange Fund which remains undistributed to the holders of the
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for one (1) year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent or its designee upon
demand, and any such holders prior to the Merger who have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only
to Parent as general creditor thereof for payment of their claims for Merger Consideration and any dividends or distributions with
respect to Parent Common Stock as contemplated by Section 2.2(d).

        (g)    No Liability.     None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect
of any shares of Parent Common Stock (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or cash held in the Exchange Fund
delivered to a Governmental Authority pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate or
Book-Entry Share shall not have been surrendered immediately prior to the date on which any Merger Consideration in respect of
such Certificate or Book-Entry Share would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Authority, any such
Merger Consideration in respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become
the property of Parent free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

        (h)    Investment of Exchange Fund.     The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed
by Parent; provided that no such investment shall relieve Parent or the Exchange Agent from making the payments required by this
Article II, and following any losses Parent shall promptly provide additional funds to the Exchange Agent for the benefit of the
holders of Company Common Stock in the amount of such losses. Any interest or income produced by such investments will be
payable to Parent or its designee as directed by Parent.

shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Company RSU Award, less any applicable withholding or other
Taxes or other amounts required by applicable Law to be withheld; provided, further, that notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, any payment in respect of any such Company RSU Award which immediately prior

thereof administering the Company ESPP) shall adopt such resolutions or take such other necessary actions such that (i) with
respect to any Option Period(s) (as such term is defined in the Company ESPP) outstanding as of the date of this Agreement under

deemed to have been exercised upon the earlier to occur of (A) the day that is four (4) complete Trading Days prior to the Effective
Time or (B) the date on which such Option Period(s) would otherwise end, and no additional Option Period(s) shall commence
under such Company ESPP after the date of this Agreement; (ii) no individual participating in the Company ESPP shall be
permitted to (A) increase the amount of his, her or its rate of payroll contributions thereunder from the rate in effect as of the date

contemplated herein. To the extent such notice or actions are required, the Company shall provide Parent with documentation

approval by Parent, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) not later than the Business Day
preceding the Effective Time.

        Section 2.4    Lost Certificates.     If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, then upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a
bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such

rights under Section 262 of the DGCL and not effectively withdrawn or lost such holder's rights to appraisal (the "Dissenting Shares"),
shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, but the holders of such Dissenting Shares shall be entitled to
receive such consideration as shall be determined pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL (it being understood and

acknowledged that at the Effective Time, such Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding, shall automatically be canceled and shall
cease to exist and such holder shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto other than the right to receive the "fair value" of such
Dissenting Shares as determined in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL); provided, however, that if any such holder shall have
failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost his, her or its right to appraisal and payment under the DGCL (whether
occurring before, at or after the Effective Time), such holder's shares of Company Common Stock shall thereupon be deemed to have been
converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon, and such shares shall
not be deemed to be Dissenting Shares. The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of any demands for appraisal of any shares of
Company Common Stock, withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL received by the
Company relating to appraisal demands, and Parent shall have the right to participate in all negotiations and Proceedings with respect to
such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with
respect to or settle or compromise or offer to settle or compromise any such demand or Proceeding, or agree to do any of the foregoing.

        Section 2.6    Transfers; No Further Ownership Rights.     After the Effective Time, there shall be no registration of transfers on the
stock transfer books of the Company of shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.
If Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Exchange Agent for transfer following the
Effective Time, they shall be canceled against delivery of the applicable Merger Consideration, as provided for in Section 2.1(a)(ii), for
each share of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares.

        Section 2.7    Further Action.     If, at any time after the Effective Time any further action is determined by Parent or the Surviving
Corporation to be necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation or Parent with
full right, title and possession of and to all rights and property of Merger Sub and the Company with respect to the Merger, the officers and
managers of Parent shall be fully authorized (in the name of Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation and otherwise) to take
such action.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

        Except (i) as disclosed in the Company SEC Documents filed with (or furnished to) the SEC by the Company on or after
December 31, 2014 and prior to the date of this Agreement (but in each case excluding any risk factor disclosure contained under the
heading "Risk Factors" (other than any factual information contained therein) or in any "forward-looking statements" legend or in any
similarly non-specific, predictive or forward-looking statements) and to the extent publicly available on the SEC's Electronic Data
Gathering Analysis and Retrieval System ("EDGAR") or (ii) as disclosed in the Company Disclosure Letter, the Company hereby
represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as follows:

        Section 3.1    Organization; Qualification.     Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is a legal entity duly organized and validly

similar power and authority to conduct its business as it is now being conducted and to own, lease and operate its properties and assets in
the manner in which its properties and assets are currently operated, except where the failure to be so validly existing and authorized has
not been, and would not reasonably be expected to be, individually or in the aggregate, materially adverse to the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in good

operated by it or the nature of the business conducted by it makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except where the failure to be
so duly qualified or licensed and in good standing has not had, and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the "Certificate of
Incorporation") and Amended and Restated Bylaws (the "Bylaws"), each as amended as of the date of this Agreement, have been made
available to Parent and are currently in effect, and the Company is not in violation of any of the provisions thereof, and the organizational
or governing documents of each of the Company's Subsidiaries, each as amended as of the date of this Agreement, are currently in effect,
and none of such Subsidiaries is in violation of any of the respective provisions thereof, except, in each case, where such failure or
violation has not been, and would not reasonably be expected to be, individually or in the aggregate, materially adverse to the Company
and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

        Section 3.2    Capitalization; Subsidiaries.     

        (a)   As of the close of business on October 17, 2016 (the "Capitalization Date"), the authorized capital stock of the

officer of the Company required under the Exchange Act with respect to such reports.

life insurance benefits under any Company Benefit Plan (other than for continuation coverage required to be provided pursuant to

former employee's eligible dependents or beneficiaries).

the Exchange Act. All of the audited financial statements and unaudited interim financial statements of Parent included in Parent
SEC Documents (i) comply in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements and with the published rules and
regulations of the SEC with respect thereto; (ii) have been prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis during
the periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto and except, in the case of the unaudited interim statements, as
may be permitted under Form 10-Q of the Exchange Act); and (iii) fairly present in all material respects the financial position, the
stockholders' equity, the results of operations and cash flows of Parent and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the times and for the
periods referred to therein (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto and subject, in the case of unaudited interim financial
statements, to normal and recurring year-end adjustments).

        (b)   Parent has heretofore furnished to the Company complete and correct copies of all comment letters from the SEC since
December 31, 2014 through the date of this Agreement with respect to any of the Parent SEC Documents, together with all written
responses of Parent thereto. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no outstanding or unresolved comments in comment letters
received from the SEC staff with respect to any of Parent SEC Documents, and, to the Knowledge of Parent, none of Parent SEC
Documents are subject to ongoing SEC review.

        (c)   Parent is in compliance in all material respects with the applicable provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the
applicable listing and governance rules and regulations of the NYSE.

        (d)   Parent maintains a system of internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the
Exchange Act) designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of Parent's financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes in conformity with GAAP. Parent has evaluated the effectiveness of Parent's internal
control over financial reporting and, to the extent required by applicable Law, presented in any applicable Parent SEC Document
that is a report on Form 10-K or Form 10-Q or any amendment thereto its conclusions about the effectiveness of the internal
control over financial reporting as of the end of the period covered by such report or amendment based on such evaluation. Based

"significant deficiencies" or "material weaknesses" (as such terms are defined in Auditing Standard No. 5 of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board, as in effect on the date of this Agreement) in the design or operation of internal control over financial
reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely affect Parent's ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
information and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role
in Parent's internal control over financial reporting.

        (e)   Parent maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act)
designed to ensure that all information required to be disclosed by Parent in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange
Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that
all such information is accumulated and communicated to Parent's management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure and to make the certifications of the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of Parent required under
the Exchange Act with respect to such reports.

        (f)    To the Knowledge of Parent, as of the date of this Agreement, there are no SEC inquiries or investigations, other
inquiries or investigations by Governmental Authorities or internal investigations pending or threatened, in each case regarding
any accounting practices of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any malfeasance by any director or executive officer of Parent or

executive officer of Parent and each former principal financial officer of Parent, as applicable) has made all certifications required
by Rule 13a-14 or 15d-14 under the Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act with respect to Parent SEC
Documents, and the statements contained in such certifications are true and accurate. For purposes of this Agreement, "principal
executive officer" and "principal financial officer" shall have the meanings given to such terms in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Parent

procedures, methodologies or methods of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, or unlawful accounting or auditing matters with respect
to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries and (ii) no attorney representing Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a violation of securities Laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar

or any committee thereof or to the general counsel or chief executive officer of Parent pursuant to the rules of the SEC adopted
under Section 307 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, except, in each case, as has not been, and would not reasonably be expected to be,
individually or in the aggregate, materially adverse to Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

therein).

Governmental Authority in a jurisdiction where Parent or any of its Subsidiaries does not currently file a Tax Return that it is or

has any such assertion been threatened or proposed in writing and received by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries.

        (d)   All Taxes that Parent or any of its Subsidiaries are or were required by Law to withhold or collect have been duly and
timely withheld or collected in all material respects on behalf of its respective employees, independent contractors or other third

purpose.

(other than such a group the common parent of which is Parent or any of its Subsidiaries), and neither Parent nor any of its
Subsidiaries has any liability for Taxes of any other Person (other than Taxes of Parent or any Subsidiary) under Treasury

aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect, none of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is in breach of or default (or, with the giving of
notice or lapse of time or both, would be in default) under the terms of, and none has taken any action resulting in the termination of,
acceleration of performance required by, or resulting in a right of termination or acceleration under, any Contract material to Parent and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (each a "Parent Material Contract"). As of the date of this Agreement, to the Knowledge of Parent, no
other party to any Parent Material Contract is in breach of or default (or, with the giving of notice or lapse of time or both, would be in
default) under the terms of, and none has taken any action resulting in the termination of, acceleration of performance required by, or
resulting in a right of termination or acceleration under, any Parent Material Contract. Each Parent Material Contract is (a) a valid and
binding obligation of Parent or its Subsidiary that is a party thereto, as applicable, and, to the Knowledge of Parent, the other parties
thereto, (provided that (i) such enforcement may be subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency (including all Laws related to fraudulent
transfers), reorganization, moratorium or other similar Laws, now or hereafter in effect, relating to creditors' rights and remedies generally
and (ii) the remedies of specific performance and injunctive and other forms of equitable relief may be subject to equitable defenses and to

Statement to be mailed to its respective stockholders. No filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the Form S-4 will be made by
Parent, and no filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the Joint Proxy Statement will be made by Parent or the Company, in
each case without providing the other party with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon. If, at any time prior to
the Effective Time, any information relating to Parent of the Company or any of their respective Affiliates, directors or officers,

any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not

practicable following the effectiveness of the Form S-4, duly call, give notice of, convene (on a date selected by the Company in
consultation with Parent, which date is intended to be the date of the Parent Stockholders' Meeting) and hold a meeting of its
stockholders (the "Company Stockholders' Meeting") for the purpose of seeking the Company Stockholder Approval, and shall
submit such proposal to such holders at the Company Stockholders' Meeting and shall not submit any other proposal to such
holders in connection with the Company Stockholders' Meeting without the prior written consent of Parent. The Company in
consultation with Parent shall set a record date for Persons entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the Company Stockholders' Meeting
and shall not change such record date without the prior written consent of Parent and shall not adjourn or otherwise postpone or
delay such Company Stockholders' Meeting without the prior written consent of Parent. If the Company Board has not made a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change, the Company shall, through the Company Board, make the Company
Recommendation, and shall include such Company Recommendation in the Joint Proxy Statement, and use its reasonable best
efforts to (i) solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and (ii) take all other action necessary
or advisable to secure the Company Stockholder Approval. Notwithstanding any Company Adverse Recommendation Change,
unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, the obligations of the parties hereunder shall continue in full
force and effect and such obligations shall not be affected by the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or
communication to the Company of any Company Acquisition Proposal (whether or not a Company Superior Proposal).

Affiliates' ability to own or operate any assets or properties of Parent or any of its Affiliates (including for the avoidance of doubt,
any equity or other interests in the Company) or any assets or properties of the Company or any of its Affiliates if such action

privilege; provided, further, however, that in each such case, the Company shall cooperate with Parent to enable Parent and
Parent's Representatives to enter into appropriate confidentiality, joint defense or similar documents or arrangements so that Parent

non-public information or non-public data to, any Person (other than Parent or any of its Affiliates or Representatives) relating to
any Company Acquisition Proposal or grant any waiver or release under any standstill or other agreement (except that if the
Company Board determines in good faith that the failure to grant any waiver or release would be inconsistent with its fiduciary

subject to this Section 5.6(e)), prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval the Company Board may take any action in
response to a Company Intervening Event prohibited by clause (i) of Section 5.6(c), only if (i) the Company Board determines in
good faith that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; (ii) the
Company has notified Parent in writing that it intends to effect such a Company Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to this
Section 5.6(e) (which notice shall specify the facts and circumstances providing the basis of the Company Intervening Event and

period of four (4) days following the notice delivered pursuant to clause (ii) of this Section 5.6(e), the Company shall have
discussed and negotiated in good faith and made the Company's Representatives available to discuss and negotiate in good faith (in
each case to the extent Parent desires to negotiate), with Parent's Representatives any proposed modifications to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement so that the failure to take such action would no
longer be inconsistent with the Company Board's fiduciary duties under applicable Law (it being understood and agreed that any
material change to the relevant facts and circumstances shall require a new notice and a new negotiation period that shall expire on
the later to occur of (A) two (2) days following delivery of such new notice from the Company to Parent and (B) the expiration of
the original four (4)-day period described above in this clause (iii)); and (iv) no earlier than the end of such negotiation period, the
Company Board shall have determined in good faith, after considering the terms of any proposed amendment or modification to
this Agreement, that the failure to take such action would still be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

look and listen" statement pending disclosure of its position thereunder or (ii) making any disclosure to its stockholders if the
Company Board determines in good faith that the failure of the Company Board to make such disclosure would be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; provided, however, that (1) in no event shall this Section 5.6(f) affect the obligations
specified in Section 5.6(d) or 5.6(e) and (2) any such disclosure (other than issuance by the Company of a "stop, look and listen" or
similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) that addresses or relates to the
approval, recommendation or declaration of advisability by the Company Board with respect to this Agreement or a Company
Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be a Company Adverse Recommendation Change unless the Company Board in
connection with such communication publicly states that its recommendation with respect to this Agreement has not changed or
refers to the prior recommendation of the Company Board, without disclosing any Company Adverse Recommendation Change.

any Person (other than the Company or any of its Affiliates or Representatives) relating to any Parent Acquisition Proposal or grant
any waiver or release under any standstill or other agreement (except that if the Parent Board determines in good faith that the

foregoing; (iii) Parent shall not provide and shall, within one (1) Business Day of the date of this Agreement, terminate access of

materially less favorable to Parent than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement and (iii) negotiate and participate in

reasonably be expected to lead to, any Parent Acquisition Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement pursuant to
Section 5.7(b)) (any action described in clauses (i) and (ii) of this sentence being referred to as a "Parent Adverse
Recommendation Change").

        (d)   If, at any time prior to the receipt of Parent Stockholder Approval, the Parent Board receives a Parent Acquisition
Proposal that the Parent Board determines in good faith constitutes a Parent Superior Proposal that was not initiated, sought,
solicited, knowingly encouraged, knowingly induced or otherwise procured in violation of this Agreement, the Parent Board may
(i) effect a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change or (ii) cause Parent to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(d)(iii)

good faith that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; (B) Parent has
notified the Company in writing that it intends to effect a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement;
(C) if applicable, Parent has provided the Company a copy of the proposed definitive agreements between Parent and the Person

and negotiate in good faith (in each case to the extent Company desires to negotiate) with the Company's Representatives any
proposed modifications to the terms and conditions of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement so that
the failure to take such action would no longer be inconsistent with the Parent Board's fiduciary duties under applicable Law (it
being understood and agreed that any amendment to any material term or condition of any Parent Superior Proposal shall require a
new notice and a new negotiation period that shall expire on the later to occur of (1) two (2) days following delivery of such new
notice from Parent to the Company and (2) the expiration of the original four (4)-day period described in clause (D) above); and

terms of any proposed amendment or modification to this Agreement, that (x) the Parent Acquisition Proposal that is the subject of
the notice described in clause (B) above still constitutes a Parent Superior Proposal and (y) the failure to take such action would
still be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

subject to this Section 5.7(e)), prior to obtaining Parent Stockholder Approval the Parent Board may take any action in response to
a Parent Intervening Event prohibited by clause (i) of Section 5.7(c), only if (i) the Parent Board determines in good faith that the
failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; (ii) Parent has notified the
Company in writing that it intends to effect such a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to this Section 5.7(e) (which

        (f)    Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit Parent or the Parent Board from (i) disclosing to its stockholders a
position contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act, or from issuing a "stop, look and listen"

the Parent Board, without disclosing any Parent Adverse Recommendation Change.

        Section 5.8    Directors' and Officers' Indemnification and Insurance.     

        (a)   Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities, including advancement of
expenses, for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time now existing in favor of the current or former directors
or officers of the Company (the "D&O Indemnified Parties") as provided in the Certificate of Incorporation, the Bylaws or any
indemnification Contract between such directors or officers and the Company (in each case, as in effect on the date of this

Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain in effect the exculpation,
indemnification and advancement of expenses equivalent to the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time with respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time and shall not

D&O Indemnified Parties; provided, however, that all rights to indemnification in respect of any action pending or asserted or any
claim made within such period shall continue until the disposition of such action or resolution of such claim. From and after the
Effective Time, Parent shall guarantee and stand surety for, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to honor, in accordance with
their respective terms, each of the covenants contained in this Section 5.8.

        (b)   Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall or, if the Company is unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation as of or after the Effective Time to, purchase a six (6)-year prepaid "tail" policy, with terms, conditions, retentions and
limits of liability that are no less favorable than the coverage provided under the Company's existing policies of directors' and
officers' liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance, with respect to matters arising on or before the Effective Time
(including in connection with this Agreement and the transactions or actions contemplated by this Agreement), and Parent shall
cause such policy to be maintained in full force and effect, for its full term, and cause all obligations thereunder to be honored by
the Surviving Corporation, and no other party shall have any further obligation to purchase or pay for insurance hereunder;
provided, however, that the Company shall not pay, and the Surviving Corporation shall not be required to pay, in excess of 300%
of the last annual premium paid by the Company prior to the date of this Agreement in respect of such "tail" policy. If the
Company or the Surviving Corporation for any reason fail to obtain such "tail" insurance policies prior to, as of or after the
Effective Time, Parent shall, for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain in
effect the current policies of directors' and officers' liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by the Company

required to pay annual premiums in excess of 300% of the last annual premium paid by the Company prior to the date of this
Agreement in respect of the coverage required to be obtained pursuant hereto, but in such case shall purchase as much coverage as
reasonably practicable for such amount.

        (c)   The covenants contained in this Section 5.8 are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the
D&O Indemnified Parties and their respective heirs and shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which any such
Person is entitled, whether pursuant to Law, contract or otherwise.

        (d)   In the event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with
or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors or assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume
the obligations set forth in this Section 5.8.

        Section 5.9    Notification of Certain Matters.     Subject to applicable Law, the Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and
Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, of (a) the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event whose occurrence or non-
occurrence, as the case may be, would reasonably be expected to cause, in the case of the Company, any condition set forth in Section 6.2
not to be satisfied, or in the case of Parent, any condition set for the in Section 6.3 not to be satisfied, at any time from the date of this
Agreement to the Effective Time; (b) any notice or other communication received by such party from any Governmental Authority in

respective Affiliates, will disseminate any press release or other public announcement concerning this Agreement, the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except as may be required by Law or the rules of a national securities exchange or to the
extent disclosed in or consistent with the Joint Proxy Statement or Form S-4, without the prior consent of each of the other parties hereto,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. The parties have agreed to the text of the joint press release
announcing the execution of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, without prior consent of the other parties, each party (a) may
communicate information that is not confidential information of any other party to financial analysts, investors and media representatives

by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time; and (ii) the term "Continuation Period" shall
mean the period beginning at the Effective Time and ending on December 31st of the year following the year in which the
Effective Time occurs.

        (b)   During the Continuation Period, Parent shall, or shall cause a Subsidiary of Parent to, provide to the Covered Employees
for so long as such Covered Employees remain employees of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries during the Continuation Period,
compensation (such term to include salary or base rate of compensation, annual cash bonus opportunities, commissions and
severance) and benefits that are in the aggregate, no less favorable than the compensation (excluding any equity or equity-based
compensation, retention, change of control, transaction or similar bonuses and nonqualified deferred compensation) and benefits
(excluding any defined benefit pension plan or retiree medical benefits) being provided by the Company or its Subsidiaries to
Covered Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time.

        (c)   In the event any Covered Employee first becomes eligible to participate under any Parent Benefit Plan following the
Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause a Subsidiary of Parent to, for Covered Employees who become eligible during the
calendar year including the Effective Time, use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) waive any preexisting condition exclusions
and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to any Covered Employee under any Parent
Benefit Plan providing medical, dental or vision benefits to the same extent such limitation would have been waived or satisfied
under any similar Company Benefit Plan the Covered Employee participated in immediately prior to coverage under the Parent
Benefit Plan; and (ii) provide each Covered Employee with credit for any copayments and deductibles paid prior to the Covered
Employee's coverage under any Parent Benefit Plan during the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs, to the same extent
such credit was given under any similar Company Benefit Plan that Covered Employee participated in immediately prior to
coverage under the Parent Benefit Plan, in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under the Parent
Benefit Plan for the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs.

        (d)   As of the Effective Time, Parent shall recognize, or shall cause a Subsidiary of Parent to recognize, all service of each
Covered Employee prior to the Effective Time, to the Company (or any predecessor entities of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries) for vesting and eligibility purposes (but not for benefit accrual purposes under any defined benefit pension plan) and
for purposes of determining future vacation accruals and severance amounts to the same extent as such Covered Employee
received, immediately before the Effective Time, credit for such service under any similar Company Benefit Plan in which such
Covered Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time; provided that service of each Covered Employee prior to
the Effective Times shall not be recognized for the purpose of any entitlement to participate in, or receive benefits with respect to,
any (i) non-elective employer contributions under any plan of Parent under Section 401(k) of the Code or (ii) Parent retiree
medical program in which any Covered Employee participates after the Effective Times. In no event shall anything contained in
this Section 5.11 result in any duplication of benefits for the same period of service.

the Company and its Subsidiaries are included for the sole benefit of the respective parties hereto and shall not create any right
(i) in any other Person, including employees, former employees, any participant or any beneficiary thereof, in any Company
Benefit Plan, or (ii) to continued employment with the Company, Parent or their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates.

Section 6.1 or Section 6.3 to be satisfied if such failure was primarily caused by its failure to perform any of its material obligations under

Parent Termination Fee that becomes due and payable under Section 7.3(b).

        (e)   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the parties agree that in no event shall either the
Company or Parent be required to pay the Company Termination Fee or the Parent Termination Fee, as applicable, on more than
one occasion.

        (f)    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, Parent's right to receive payment from the

pursuant to Section 7.3(c), shall, in circumstances in which the Company Termination Fee or Parent Expenses (as applicable) are
owed, constitute the sole and exclusive monetary remedy (other than (i) in the event of a termination pursuant to Section 7.1(d)(ii)
(B) and (C), (ii) in the event of an intentional breach by the Company of Section 5.15 or a fraudulent breach of Section 3.27 and

transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (ii) without these agreements, the parties would not enter into this Agreement;
accordingly, if the Company or Parent, as applicable, fails to timely pay any amount due pursuant to this Section 7.3 and, in order
to obtain such payment, Parent or the Company, as applicable, commences a suit that results in a judgment against the other for the
payment of any amount set forth in this Section 7.3, the Company or Parent, as applicable, shall pay the other its costs and
expenses in connection with such suit (including reasonable attorneys' fees), together with interest on such amount at an annual

        Section 7.4    Amendment.     This Agreement may be amended by mutual agreement of the parties hereto in writing at any time
before or after receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval or Parent Stockholder Approval; provided, however, that after the Company
Stockholder Approval or Parent Stockholder Approval has been obtained, there shall not be any amendment that by applicable Law or in
accordance with the rules of any stock exchange requires further approval by the stockholders of the Company or Parent, as applicable,
without such further approval of such stockholders nor any amendment or change not permitted under applicable Law; provided, further,
that no amendment to this Agreement shall be made that would adversely affect the rights of the Financing Sources as set forth in this
Section 7.4 or Sections 8.8, 8.13 or 8.14 without the prior written consent of the Financing Sources.

(a) extend the time for the performance of any obligation or other act of any other party hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracy in the
representations and warranties of the other party contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive compliance
with any agreement or condition contained herein. Any such extension or waiver shall only be valid if set forth in an instrument in writing
signed by the party or parties to be bound thereby. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay by the Company, Parent or Merger
Sub in exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or
further exercise of any other right hereunder. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid
only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party.

October 23, 2016

The Board of Directors
Rockwell Collins, Inc.
400 Collins Road N.E.
Cedar Rapids, Iowa 52498

Members of the Board of Directors:

        You have requested our opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to Rockwell Collins, Inc. (the "Company") of the
consideration to be paid by the Company in the proposed merger (the "Transaction") of Quarterback Merger Sub Corp., a wholly-owned
subsidiary of the Company (the "Merger Subsidiary"), with B/E Aerospace, Inc. (the "Merger Partner"). Pursuant to the Agreement and
Plan of Merger (the "Agreement"), among the Company, the Merger Subsidiary and the Merger Partner, the Merger Partner will become a
wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, and each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Merger Partner (the "Merger
Partner Common Stock") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Transaction (other than Canceled Shares (as
defined in the Agreement) and Dissenting Shares (as defined in the Agreement)), will be converted into the right to receive consideration
per share equal to $34.10 in cash, without interest (the "Cash Consideration"), and that number of shares of common stock, par value $0.01
per share, of the Company (the "Company Common Stock") equal to the Exchange Ratio (and, if applicable, cash in lieu of fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock (as defined in the Agreement) payable in accordance with the Agreement) (such number of shares of
Company Common Stock and any such cash in lieu of fractional shares, together with the Cash Consideration, the "Consideration"). For
purposes of the Agreement, the Exchange Ratio means the following (in each case rounded to four decimal places): (i) if the Parent Stock
Price (as defined in the Agreement) is an amount greater than $89.97, then the Exchange Ratio is 0.3101; (ii) if the Parent Stock Price (as
defined in the Agreement) is an amount greater than or equal to $77.41 but less than or equal to $89.97, then the Exchange Ratio shall be
an amount equal to the quotient obtained by dividing $27.90 by the Parent Stock Price (as defined in the Agreement); and (iii) if the Parent
Stock Price (as defined in the Agreement) is less than $77.41, then the Exchange Ratio is 0.3604.

        In connection with preparing our opinion, we have (i) reviewed a draft dated October 23, 2016 of the Agreement; (ii) reviewed
certain publicly available business and financial information concerning the Merger Partner and the Company and the industries in which
they operate; (iii) compared the proposed financial terms of the Transaction with the publicly available financial terms of certain
transactions involving companies we deemed relevant and the consideration received for such companies; (iv) compared the financial and
operating performance of the Merger Partner and the Company with publicly available information concerning certain other companies we

        In addition, we have held discussions with certain members of the management of the Merger Partner and the Company with respect
to certain aspects of the Transaction, the past and current business operations of the Merger Partner and the Company, the financial
condition and future prospects and operations of the Merger Partner and the Company, the effects of the Transaction on the financial
condition and future prospects of the Company, and certain other matters we believed necessary or appropriate to our inquiry.

        In giving our opinion, we have relied upon and assumed the accuracy and completeness of all information that was publicly available
or was furnished to or discussed with us by the Merger Partner and the Company or otherwise reviewed by or for us. We have not
independently verified any such information or its accuracy or completeness and, pursuant to our engagement letter with the Company, we
did not assume any obligation to undertake any such independent verification. We have not conducted or been provided with any valuation
or appraisal of any assets or liabilities, nor have we evaluated the solvency of the Merger Partner or the Company under any state or
federal laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. In relying on financial analyses and forecasts provided to us or derived
therefrom, including the Synergies, we have assumed that they have been reasonably prepared based on assumptions reflecting the best
currently available estimates and judgments by management as to the expected future results of operations and financial condition of the
Merger Partner and the Company to which such analyses or forecasts relate. We express no view as to such analyses or forecasts
(including the Synergies) or the assumptions on which they were based. We have also assumed that the Transaction and the other
transactions contemplated by the Agreement will have the tax consequences described in discussions with, and materials furnished to us
by, representatives of the Company, and will be consummated as described in the Agreement, and that the definitive Agreement will not
differ in any material respects from the draft thereof furnished to us. We have also assumed that the representations and warranties made
by the Company and the Merger Partner in the Agreement and the related agreements are and will be true and correct in all respects
material to our analysis. We are not legal, regulatory or tax experts and have relied on the assessments made by advisors to the Company
with respect to such issues. We have further assumed that all material governmental, regulatory or other consents and approvals necessary
for the consummation of the Transaction will be obtained without any adverse effect on the Merger Partner or the Company or on the
contemplated benefits of the Transaction.

        Our opinion is necessarily based on economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to us
as of, the date hereof. It should be understood that subsequent developments may affect this opinion and that we do not have any
obligation to update, revise, or reaffirm this opinion. Our opinion is limited to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the
Consideration to be paid by the Company in the proposed Transaction and we express no opinion as to the fairness of the Consideration to
the holders of any class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of the Company or as to the underlying decision by the Company to
engage in the Transaction. Furthermore, we express no opinion with respect to the amount or nature of any compensation to any officers,
directors, or employees of any party to the Transaction, or any class of such persons relative to the Consideration to be paid by the
Company in the Transaction or with respect to the fairness of any such compensation. We are expressing no opinion herein as to the price
at which the Company Common Stock or the Merger Partner Common Stock will trade at any future time.

        We have acted as financial advisor to the Company with respect to the proposed Transaction and will receive a fee from the Company
for our services, a substantial portion of which will become payable only if the proposed Transaction is consummated. In addition, the
Company has agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities arising out of our engagement. During the two years preceding the date of this
letter, we and our affiliates have had commercial or investment banking relationships with the Company and the Merger Partner for which
we and such affiliates have received customary

compensation. Such services during such period have included acting as joint bookrunner and joint lead arranger on the Company's
revolving credit facility in February 2016; as joint lead arranger and joint bookrunner on the Merger Partner's credit facilities in December
2014 and in May 2016; as lead arranger and lead-left bookrunner on credit facilities of KLX Inc., an entity that was spun out of the Merger
Partner in December 2014 ("KLX"), in December 2014 and May 2015; as lead bookrunner on an offering of debt securities of KLX in
November 2014; and as financial advisor to the Merger Partner in connection with the spin-off of KLX in December 2014. We and our
affiliates also provided asset management services to the Company during such period. In addition, our commercial banking affiliate is an
agent bank and a lender under outstanding credit facilities of the Company, the Merger Partner and of KLX, for which it receives
customary compensation or other financial benefits. We anticipate that we and our affiliates will arrange and/or provide financing to the
Company in connection with the Transaction for customary compensation. In addition, we and our affiliates hold, on a proprietary basis,
less than 1% of the outstanding common stock of each of the Company and the Merger Partner. In the ordinary course of our businesses,
we and our affiliates may actively trade the debt and equity securities or financial instruments (including derivatives, bank loans or other
obligations) of the Company or the Merger Partner for our own account or for the accounts of customers and, accordingly, we may at any
time hold long or short positions in such securities or other financial instruments.

        On the basis of and subject to the foregoing, it is our opinion as of the date hereof that the Consideration to be paid by the Company
in the proposed Transaction is fair, from a financial point of view, to the Company.

        The issuance of this opinion has been approved by a fairness opinion committee of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC. This letter is
provided to the Board of Directors of the Company (in its capacity as such) in connection with and for the purposes of its evaluation of the
Transaction. This opinion does not constitute a recommendation to any shareholder of the Company as to how such shareholder should
vote with respect to the Transaction or any other matter. This opinion may not be disclosed, referred to, or communicated (in whole or in
part) to any third party for any purpose whatsoever except with our prior written approval. This opinion may be reproduced in full in any
registration, proxy or information statement relating to the Transaction which the Company must, under any applicable law, file with any
government agency or distribute to its shareholders and where such filing must include this opinion. This opinion may not otherwise be
disclosed publicly in any manner without our prior written approval.

The Board of Directors
B/E Aerospace, Inc.

Wellington, FL 33414

Members of the Board:

        You have requested our opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of the common stock of B/E
Aerospace, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Company"), of the Merger Consideration (defined below) to be received by such holders
pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of October 23, 2016 (the
"Merger Agreement"), among Rockwell Collins, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Parent"), Quarterback Merger Sub Corp., a Delaware
corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"), and Company. As more fully described in the Merger Agreement,
(i) Merger Sub will be merged with and into Company (the "Merger") and (ii) each outstanding share of the common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of Company ("Company Common Stock"), other than shares of Company Common Stock held by holders who are
entitled to and properly demand appraisal of their shares of Company Common Stock and shares of Company Common Stock that are
owned, directly or indirectly, by Parent, Company (as treasury shares or otherwise) or Merger Sub (such holders, collectively, "Excluded
Holders"), will be converted into the right to receive $34.10 in cash (the "Cash Consideration") and that number of shares (and cash in lieu
of any fraction thereof) of common stock, par value $0.01 per share ("Parent Common Stock"), of Parent equal to (a) if the Parent Stock
Price (as defined in the Merger Agreement) is greater than $89.97, 0.3101; (b) if the Parent Stock Price is greater than or equal to $77.41
but less than or equal to $89.97, the quotient (rounded to four decimal places) obtained by dividing (x) $27.90 by (y) the Parent Stock
Price; and (c) if the Parent Stock Price is less than $77.41, 0.3604 (the "Stock Consideration"; together with the Cash Consideration, the
"Merger Consideration").

        In arriving at our opinion, we reviewed the Merger Agreement and held discussions with certain senior officers, directors and other
representatives and advisors of Company and certain senior officers and other representatives and advisors of Parent concerning the
businesses, operations and prospects of Company and Parent. We examined certain publicly available business and financial information
relating to Company and Parent as well as certain financial forecasts and other information and data relating to Company and Parent which
were provided to or discussed with us by the respective managements of Company and Parent, including information relating to the
potential strategic implications and operational benefits (including the amount, timing and achievability thereof) anticipated by the
managements of Company and Parent to result from the Merger. We reviewed the financial terms of the Merger as set forth in the Merger
Agreement in relation to, among other things: current and historical market prices and trading volumes of Company Common Stock and
Parent Common Stock; the historical and projected earnings and other operating data of Company and Parent; and the capitalization and
financial condition of Company and Parent. We considered, to the extent publicly available, the financial terms of certain other
transactions which we considered relevant in

evaluating the Merger and analyzed certain financial, stock market and other publicly available information relating to the businesses of
other companies whose operations we considered relevant in evaluating those of Company and Parent. We also evaluated certain potential
pro forma financial effects of the Merger on Parent. In addition to the foregoing, we conducted such other analyses and examinations and
considered such other information and financial, economic and market criteria as we deemed appropriate in arriving at our opinion. The
issuance of our opinion has been authorized by our fairness opinion committee.

        In rendering our opinion, we have assumed and relied, without independent verification, upon the accuracy and completeness of all
financial and other information and data publicly available or provided to or otherwise reviewed by or discussed with us and upon the
assurances of the managements of Company and Parent that they are not aware of any relevant information that has been omitted or that
remains undisclosed to us. With respect to financial forecasts and other information and data relating to Company and Parent provided to
or otherwise reviewed by or discussed with us, we have been advised by the respective managements of Company and Parent that such
forecasts and other information and data were reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments
of the managements of Company and Parent as to the future financial performance of Company and Parent, the potential strategic
implications and operational benefits anticipated to result from the Merger and the other matters covered thereby, and have assumed, with
your consent, that the financial results (including the potential strategic implications and operational benefits anticipated to result from the
Merger) reflected in such forecasts and other information and data will be realized in the amounts and at the times projected.

        We have assumed, with your consent, that the Merger will be consummated in accordance with its terms, without waiver,
modification or amendment of any material term, condition or agreement and that, in the course of obtaining the necessary regulatory or
third party approvals, consents and releases for the Merger, no delay, limitation, restriction or condition will be imposed that would have
an adverse effect on Company, Parent or the contemplated benefits of the Merger. Our opinion, as set forth herein, relates to the relative
values of Company and Parent. We are not expressing any opinion as to what the value of the Parent Common Stock actually will be when
issued pursuant to the Merger or the price at which the Parent Common Stock will trade at any time. We have not made or been provided
with an independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of Company or Parent nor have we made
any physical inspection of the properties or assets of Company or Parent. Our opinion does not address the underlying business decision of
Company to effect the Merger, the relative merits of the Merger as compared to any alternative business strategies that might exist for
Company or the effect of any other transaction in which Company might engage. We also express no view as to, and our opinion does not
address, the fairness (financial or otherwise) of the amount or nature or any other aspect of any compensation to any officers, directors or
employees of any parties to the Merger, or any class of such persons, relative to the Merger Consideration. Our opinion is necessarily
based upon information available to us, and financial, stock market and other conditions and circumstances existing, as of the date hereof.

        Citigroup Global Markets Inc. has acted as financial advisor to Company in connection with the proposed Merger and will receive a
fee for such services, a significant portion of which is contingent upon the consummation of the Merger. We also will receive a fee in
connection with the delivery of this opinion. We and our affiliates in the past have provided, and currently provide, services to Company
unrelated to the proposed Merger, for which services we and such affiliates have received and expect to receive compensation, including,
without limitation, during the two year period prior to the date hereof, having acted or acting (i) as financial advisor to Company in
connection with Company's spin-off of KLX Inc. in December 2014, and (ii) as lender, syndication agent, joint lead arranger and joint
book-runner in connection with a term loan and revolving credit facility of Company. We and our affiliates in the past have also provided,
and currently provide, services to

including, without limitation, during the two year period prior to the date hereof, acting as lender, syndication agent, joint lead arranger
and joint book-runner in connection with two revolving credit facilities of Parent, as well as acting as lender in connection with certain
committed corporate credit card facilities of Parent. In the ordinary course of our business, we and our affiliates may actively trade or hold
the securities of Company and Parent for our own account or for the account of our customers and, accordingly, may at any time hold a
long or short position in such securities. In addition, we and our affiliates (including Citigroup Inc. and its affiliates) may maintain
relationships with Company, Parent and their respective affiliates.

        Our advisory services and the opinion expressed herein are provided for the information of the Board of Directors of Company in its
evaluation of the proposed Merger, and our opinion is not intended to be and does not constitute a recommendation to any stockholder as
to how such stockholder should vote or act on any matters relating to the proposed Merger.

        Based upon and subject to the foregoing, our experience as investment bankers, our work as described above and other factors we
deemed relevant, we are of the opinion that, as of the date hereof, the Merger Consideration to be received by the holders of Company
Common Stock (other than Excluded Holders) in the Merger is fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.

Ladies and Gentlemen:

        You have requested our opinion as to the fairness from a financial point of view to the holders (other than Rockwell Collins Inc.

(the "Company") of the Merger Consideration (as defined below) to be paid to such holders pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of

December 2014; and as a participant in the Company's revolving credit facility (aggregate principal amount of $600,000,000) put in place
in December 2014. We may also in the future provide financial advisory and/or underwriting services to the Company, Parent and their
respective affiliates for which our Investment Banking Division may receive compensation.

        In connection with this opinion, we have reviewed, among other things, the Agreement; annual reports to stockholders and Annual
Reports on Form 10-K of the Company and Parent for the five fiscal years ended December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2015,
respectively; certain interim reports to stockholders and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q of the Company and Parent; certain other
communications from the Company and Parent to their respective stockholders; certain publicly available research analyst reports for the
Company and for Parent; and certain internal financial analyses and forecasts for the Company prepared by its management and for Parent
prepared by its management, in each case, as approved for our use by the Company (the "Forecasts"), and certain operating synergies
projected by the managements of the Company and Parent to result from the Transaction, as approved for our use by the Company (the
"Synergies"). We have also held discussions with members of the senior managements of the Company and Parent regarding their
assessment of the strategic rationale for, and the potential benefits of, the Transaction and the past and current business operations,
financial condition and future prospects of the Company and Parent; reviewed the reported price and trading activity for the Shares and
shares of Parent Common Stock; compared certain financial and stock market information for the Company and Parent with similar
information for certain other companies the securities of which are publicly traded; reviewed the financial terms of certain recent business
combinations in the aerospace and defense industry and in other industries; and performed such other studies and analyses, and considered
such other factors, as we deemed appropriate.

        For purposes of rendering this opinion, we have, with your consent, relied upon and assumed the accuracy and completeness of all of
the financial, legal, regulatory, tax, accounting and other information provided to, discussed with or reviewed by, us, without assuming any
responsibility for independent verification thereof. In that regard, we have assumed with your consent that the Forecasts and the Synergies
have been reasonably prepared on a basis reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the management of the
Company. We have not made an independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets and liabilities (including any contingent, derivative or
other off-balance-sheet assets and liabilities) of the Company or Parent or any of their respective subsidiaries and we have not been
furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal. We have assumed that all governmental, regulatory or other consents and approvals
necessary for the consummation of the Transaction will be obtained without any adverse effect on the Company or Parent or on the
expected benefits of the Transaction in any way meaningful to our analysis. We have assumed that the Transaction will be consummated
on the terms set forth in the Agreement, without the waiver or modification of any term or condition the effect of which would be in any
way meaningful to our analysis.

        Our opinion does not address the underlying business decision of the Company to engage in the Transaction, or the relative merits of
the Transaction as compared to any strategic alternatives that may be available to the Company; nor does it address any legal, regulatory,
tax or accounting matters. This opinion addresses only the fairness from a financial point of view to the holders (other than Parent and its

Section 262 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware

8 Del.C. § 262
§ 262. Appraisal rights

        (a)   Any stockholder of a corporation of this State who holds shares of stock on the date of the making of a demand pursuant to
subsection (d) of this section with respect to such shares, who continuously holds such shares through the effective date of the merger or
consolidation, who has otherwise complied with subsection (d) of this section and who has neither voted in favor of the merger or
consolidation nor consented thereto in writing pursuant to § 228 of this title shall be entitled to an appraisal by the Court of Chancery of
the fair value of the stockholder's shares of stock under the circumstances described in subsections (b) and (c) of this section. As used in
this section, the word "stockholder" means a holder of record of stock in a corporation; the words "stock" and "share" mean and include
what is ordinarily meant by those words; and the words "depository receipt" mean a receipt or other instrument issued by a depository
representing an interest in 1 or more shares, or fractions thereof, solely of stock of a corporation, which stock is deposited with the
depository.

        (b)   Appraisal rights shall be available for the shares of any class or series of stock of a constituent corporation in a merger or
consolidation to be effected pursuant to § 251 (other than a merger effected pursuant to § 251(g) of this title and, subject to paragraph (b)
(3) of this section, § 251(h) of this title), § 252, § 254, § 255, § 256, § 257, § 258, § 263 or § 264 of this title:

        (1)   Provided, however, that, except as expressly provided in § 363(b) of this title, no appraisal rights under this section shall
be available for the shares of any class or series of stock, which stock, or depository receipts in respect thereof, at the record date
fixed to determine the stockholders entitled to receive notice of the meeting of stockholders to act upon the agreement of merger or
consolidation, were either: (i) listed on a national securities exchange or (ii) held of record by more than 2,000 holders; and further
provided that no appraisal rights shall be available for any shares of stock of the constituent corporation surviving a merger if the
merger did not require for its approval the vote of the stockholders of the surviving corporation as provided in § 251(f) of this title.

        (2)   Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1) of this section, appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the shares of
any class or series of stock of a constituent corporation if the holders thereof are required by the terms of an agreement of merger
or consolidation pursuant to §§ 251, 252, 254, 255, 256, 257, 258, 263 and 264 of this title to accept for such stock anything

        (4)   In the event of an amendment to a corporation's certificate of incorporation contemplated by § 363(a) of this title,
appraisal rights shall be available as contemplated by § 363(b) of this title, and the procedures of this section, including those set
forth in subsections (d) and (e) of this section, shall apply as nearly as practicable, with the word "amendment" substituted for the
words "merger or consolidation," and the word "corporation" substituted for the words "constituent corporation" and/or "surviving
or resulting corporation."

        (c)   Any corporation may provide in its certificate of incorporation that appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the
shares of any class or series of its stock as a result of an amendment to its certificate of incorporation, any merger or consolidation in
which the corporation is a constituent corporation or the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the corporation. If the certificate of
incorporation contains such a provision, the provisions of this section, including those set forth in subsections (d), (e), and (g) of this
section, shall apply as nearly as is practicable.

        (d)   Appraisal rights shall be perfected as follows:

        (1)   If a proposed merger or consolidation for which appraisal rights are provided under this section is to be submitted for
approval at a meeting of stockholders, the corporation, not less than 20 days prior to the meeting, shall notify each of its
stockholders who was such on the record date for notice of such meeting (or such members who received notice in accordance
with § 255(c) of this title) with respect to shares for which appraisal rights are available pursuant to subsection (b) or (c) of this
section that appraisal rights are available for any or all of the shares of the constituent corporations, and shall include in such notice
a copy of this section and, if 1 of the constituent corporations is a nonstock corporation, a copy of § 114 of this title. Each
stockholder electing to demand the appraisal of such stockholder's shares shall deliver to the corporation, before the taking of the
vote on the merger or consolidation, a written demand for appraisal of such stockholder's shares. Such demand will be sufficient if
it reasonably informs the corporation of the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to demand the
appraisal of such stockholder's shares. A proxy or vote against the merger or consolidation shall not constitute such a demand. A
stockholder electing to take such action must do so by a separate written demand as herein provided. Within 10 days after the
effective date of such merger or consolidation, the surviving or resulting corporation shall notify each stockholder of each
constituent corporation who has complied with this subsection and has not voted in favor of or consented to the merger or
consolidation of the date that the merger or consolidation has become effective; or

        (2)   If the merger or consolidation was approved pursuant to § 228, § 251(h), § 253, or § 267 of this title, then either a
constituent corporation before the effective date of the merger or consolidation or the surviving or resulting corporation within
10 days thereafter shall notify each of the holders of any class or series of stock of such constituent corporation who are entitled to
appraisal rights of the approval of the merger or consolidation and that appraisal rights are available for any or all shares of such
class or series of stock of such constituent corporation, and shall include in such notice a copy of this section and, if 1 of the
constituent corporations is a nonstock corporation, a copy of § 114 of this title. Such notice may, and, if given on or after the
effective date of the merger or consolidation, shall, also notify such stockholders of the effective date of the merger or
consolidation. Any stockholder entitled to appraisal rights may, within 20 days after the date of mailing of such notice or, in the
case of a merger approved pursuant to § 251(h) of this title, within the later of the consummation of the offer contemplated by
§ 251(h) of this title and 20 days after the date of mailing of such notice, demand in writing from the surviving or resulting
corporation the appraisal of such holder's shares. Such demand will be sufficient if it reasonably informs the corporation of the
identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to demand the appraisal of such holder's shares. If such notice
did not notify stockholders of the effective date of the merger or consolidation, either (i) each such

constituent corporation shall send a second notice before the effective date of the merger or consolidation notifying each of the
holders of any class or series of stock of such constituent corporation that are entitled to appraisal rights of the effective date of the
merger or consolidation or (ii) the surviving or resulting corporation shall send such a second notice to all such holders on or
within 10 days after such effective date; provided, however, that if such second notice is sent more than 20 days following the
sending of the first notice or, in the case of a merger approved pursuant to § 251(h) of this title, later than the later of the
consummation of the offer contemplated by § 251(h) of this title and 20 days following the sending of the first notice, such second
notice need only be sent to each stockholder who is entitled to appraisal rights and who has demanded appraisal of such holder's
shares in accordance with this subsection. An affidavit of the secretary or assistant secretary or of the transfer agent of the
corporation that is required to give either notice that such notice has been given shall, in the absence of fraud, be prima facie
evidence of the facts stated therein. For purposes of determining the stockholders entitled to receive either notice, each constituent
corporation may fix, in advance, a record date that shall be not more than 10 days prior to the date the notice is given, provided,
that if the notice is given on or after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, the record date shall be such effective date. If
no record date is fixed and the notice is given prior to the effective date, the record date shall be the close of business on the day
next preceding the day on which the notice is given.

        (e)   Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, the surviving or resulting corporation or any stockholder
who has complied with subsections (a) and (d) of this section hereof and who is otherwise entitled to appraisal rights, may commence an
appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Court of Chancery demanding a determination of the value of the stock of all such
stockholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, any
stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party shall have the right to withdraw
such stockholder's demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the merger or consolidation. Within 120 days after the
effective date of the merger or consolidation, any stockholder who has complied with the requirements of subsections (a) and (d) of this
section hereof, upon written request, shall be entitled to receive from the corporation surviving the merger or resulting from the
consolidation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the merger or consolidation and with respect to
which demands for appraisal have been received and the aggregate number of holders of such shares. Such written statement shall be
mailed to the stockholder within 10 days after such stockholder's written request for such a statement is received by the surviving or
resulting corporation or within 10 days after expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal under subsection (d) of this
section hereof, whichever is later. Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, a person who is the beneficial owner of shares of such
stock held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person may, in such person's own name, file a petition or request from
the corporation the statement described in this subsection.

        (f)    Upon the filing of any such petition by a stockholder, service of a copy thereof shall be made upon the surviving or resulting
corporation, which shall within 20 days after such service file in the office of the Register in Chancery in which the petition was filed a
duly verified list containing the names and addresses of all stockholders who have demanded payment for their shares and with whom
agreements as to the value of their shares have not been reached by the surviving or resulting corporation. If the petition shall be filed by
the surviving or resulting corporation, the petition shall be accompanied by such a duly verified list. The Register in Chancery, if so
ordered by the Court, shall give notice of the time and place fixed for the hearing of such petition by registered or certified mail to the
surviving or resulting corporation and to the stockholders shown on the list at the addresses therein stated. Such notice shall also be given
by 1 or more publications at least 1 week before the day of the hearing, in a newspaper of general circulation published in the City of
Wilmington, Delaware or such

publication as the Court deems advisable. The forms of the notices by mail and by publication shall be approved by the Court, and the
costs thereof shall be borne by the surviving or resulting corporation.

        (g)   At the hearing on such petition, the Court shall determine the stockholders who have complied with this section and who have
become entitled to appraisal rights. The Court may require the stockholders who have demanded an appraisal for their shares and who hold
stock represented by certificates to submit their certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the
appraisal proceedings; and if any stockholder fails to comply with such direction, the Court may dismiss the proceedings as to such
stockholder. If immediately before the merger or consolidation the shares of the class or series of stock of the constituent corporation as to
which appraisal rights are available were listed on a national securities exchange, the Court shall dismiss the proceedings as to all holders
of such shares who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless (1) the total number of shares entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the
outstanding shares of the class or series eligible for appraisal, (2) the value of the consideration provided in the merger or consolidation for
such total number of shares exceeds $1 million, or (3) the merger was approved pursuant to § 253 or § 267 of this title.

        (h)   After the Court determines the stockholders entitled to an appraisal, the appraisal proceeding shall be conducted in accordance
with the rules of the Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings. Through such proceeding the
Court shall determine the fair value of the shares exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the
merger or consolidation, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. In determining such fair
value, the Court shall take into account all relevant factors. Unless the Court in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown,
and except as provided in this subsection, interest from the effective date of the merger through the date of payment of the judgment shall
be compounded quarterly and shall accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time
to time during the period between the effective date of the merger and the date of payment of the judgment. At any time before the entry of
judgment in the proceedings, the surviving corporation may pay to each stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which case
interest shall accrue thereafter as provided herein only upon the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair
value of the shares as determined by the Court, and (2) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time. Upon application by the
surviving or resulting corporation or by any stockholder entitled to participate in the appraisal proceeding, the Court may, in its discretion,
proceed to trial upon the appraisal prior to the final determination of the stockholders entitled to an appraisal. Any stockholder whose
name appears on the list filed by the surviving or resulting corporation pursuant to subsection (f) of this section and who has submitted
such stockholder's certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery, if such is required, may participate fully in all proceedings until it is
finally determined that such stockholder is not entitled to appraisal rights under this section.

        (i)    The Court shall direct the payment of the fair value of the shares, together with interest, if any, by the surviving or resulting
corporation to the stockholders entitled thereto. Payment shall be so made to each such stockholder, in the case of holders of uncertificated
stock forthwith, and the case of holders of shares represented by certificates upon the surrender to the corporation of the certificates
representing such stock. The Court's decree may be enforced as other decrees in the Court of Chancery may be enforced, whether such
surviving or resulting corporation be a corporation of this State or of any state.

        (j)    The costs of the proceeding may be determined by the Court and taxed upon the parties as the Court deems equitable in the
circumstances. Upon application of a stockholder, the Court may order all or a portion of the expenses incurred by any stockholder in
connection with the appraisal proceeding, including, without limitation, reasonable attorney's fees and the fees and expenses of experts, to
be charged pro rata against the value of all the shares entitled to an appraisal.

        (k)   From and after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, no stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights as provided
in subsection (d) of this section shall be entitled to vote such stock for any purpose or to receive payment of dividends or other
distributions on the stock (except dividends or other distributions payable to stockholders of record at a date which is prior to the effective
date of the merger or consolidation); provided, however, that if no petition for an appraisal shall be filed within the time provided in
subsection (e) of this section, or if such stockholder shall deliver to the surviving or resulting corporation a written withdrawal of such
stockholder's demand for an appraisal and an acceptance of the merger or consolidation, either within 60 days after the effective date of the
merger or consolidation as provided in subsection (e) of this section or thereafter with the written approval of the corporation, then the
right of such stockholder to an appraisal shall cease. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no appraisal proceeding in the Court of Chancery
shall be dismissed as to any stockholder without the approval of the Court, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the
Court deems just; provided, however that this provision shall not affect the right of any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal
proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such stockholder's demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered
upon the merger or consolidation within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, as set forth in subsection (e) of this
section.

        (l)    The shares of the surviving or resulting corporation to which the shares of such objecting stockholders would have been
converted had they assented to the merger or consolidation shall have the status of authorized and unissued shares of the surviving or
resulting corporation.
