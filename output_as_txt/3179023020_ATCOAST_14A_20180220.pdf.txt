TABLE OF CONTENTS

MERGER PROPOSED — YOUR VOTE IS VERY IMPORTANT
To the Stockholders of Atlantic Coast Financial Corporation:

On November 16, 2017, Atlantic Coast Financial Corporation, or “Atlantic,” and Ameris Bancorp, or “Ameris,” entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger,
which we refer to as the “Merger Agreement.” The Merger Agreement provides for the merger of Atlantic with and into Ameris, with Ameris as the surviving company,
which transaction we refer to as the “merger.” Immediately after the merger, Atlantic Coast Bank, a Florida state-chartered bank and a wholly owned subsidiary of
Atlantic, will merge with and into Ameris Bank, a Georgia state-chartered bank and a wholly owned subsidiary of Ameris, with Ameris Bank as the surviving bank,
which we refer to as the “bank merger.” Before the merger can be completed, Atlantic stockholders must approve the Merger Agreement and the transactions provided
for therein, which we refer to as the “merger proposal.”

In the merger, each share of Atlantic common stock will be converted into the right to receive: (i) $1.39 in cash, without interest; and (ii) 0.17 shares of Ameris
common stock, plus cash in lieu of fractional shares. Based on the $47.30 closing price of Ameris common stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market on
November 16, 2017, the last trading day before public announcement of the merger, the 0.17 exchange ratio, together with the $1.39 cash consideration, represented
$9.43 in value for each share of Atlantic common stock and approximately $146.7 million in aggregate value. Based on the $52.60 closing price of Ameris common
stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market on February 12, 2018, the latest practicable date before the date of this proxy statement/prospectus, the 0.17 exchange
ratio, together with the $1.39 cash consideration, represented approximately $10.33 in value for each share of Atlantic common stock and approximately $160.7 million
in aggregate value.

Ameris common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol “ABCB.” Atlantic common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Global
Market under the symbol “ACFC.” On February 12, 2018, the latest practicable date before the date of this proxy statement/prospectus, the closing price of Ameris
common stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market was $52.60 and the closing price of the Atlantic common stock on the NASDAQ Global Market was $10.17. The
market prices for both Ameris common stock and Atlantic common stock will fluctuate before the merger. Based on the 0.17 exchange ratio and the number of shares of
Atlantic common stock outstanding as of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus, and assuming no adjustment to the stock portion of the merger consideration paid
by Ameris, the maximum number of shares of Ameris common stock issuable in the merger is 2,644,131.

The completion of the merger is subject to a price floor. If the average closing price of one share of Ameris common stock during a specified determination period
has declined by more than 15% from its price on November 15, 2017, of  $46.95 per share, and the Ameris common stock underperforms the KBW Nasdaq Regional
Banking Index (KRX) by more than 15% during such period, then Atlantic may terminate the Merger Agreement unless Ameris offsets such reduction in the value of
Ameris common stock by increasing the number of shares of Ameris common stock to be issued, or paying additional cash consideration, to Atlantic stockholders.

Atlantic will hold a special meeting of its stockholders to approve the merger proposal. The special meeting of stockholders is scheduled to be held on March 21,
2018, at 10:00 a.m., local time, at the Jacksonville Marriott, 4670 Salisbury Road, Jacksonville, FL 32256. No vote of Ameris shareholders is required to complete the
merger. This document, which serves as Atlantic’s proxy statement for the special meeting of its stockholders and as a prospectus for the shares of Ameris common
stock to be issued in the merger to Atlantic stockholders, gives you detailed information about the special meeting and the merger. The merger cannot be completed
unless all closing conditions have been met, including receipt of required regulatory approvals and approval of the merger proposal by the Atlantic stockholders.
Approval of the merger proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of the majority of the outstanding shares of Atlantic common stock.

Atlantic is asking its stockholders to consider and vote on the merger proposal at the special meeting of stockholders and also to vote on: (i) a proposal to approve,
on a non-binding advisory basis, the compensation that certain executive officers of Atlantic will receive under existing agreements with Atlantic in connection with the
merger, which we refer to as the “merger-related compensation proposal;” and (ii) a proposal to adjourn the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to permit
further solicitation of proxies if there are not sufficient votes to approve the merger proposal at the time of the special meeting, which we refer to as the “adjournment
proposal.” Approval, on a non-binding advisory basis, of the merger-related compensation proposal, and approval of the adjournment proposal, each requires the
affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of Atlantic common stock represented in person or by proxy at the special meeting.

Even if you plan to attend the special meeting, to ensure a quorum is present to hold the special meeting, we would ask you to complete and return the proxy card
in the enclosed prepaid envelope. If you sign, date and mail your proxy card without indicating how you want to vote, then your proxy will be counted as a vote “FOR”
the merger proposal, “FOR” the merger-related compensation proposal and “FOR” the adjournment proposal. Failing to instruct your broker how to vote shares held
by you in “street name,” will have the same effect as a vote against the merger proposal, but will have no effect on the outcome of the merger-related compensation
proposal or the adjournment proposal.

The board of directors of Atlantic unanimously recommends that Atlantic stockholders vote “FOR” the merger proposal, “FOR” the merger-related
compensation proposal and “FOR” the adjournment proposal.

You should read carefully this entire proxy statement/prospectus, including the appendices hereto and the documents incorporated by reference herein, because it
contains important information about the merger and the related transactions. You may also find this proxy statement/prospectus posted on the Internet at
http://www.irinfo.com/acfc/acfc.html. In particular, you should read carefully the information set forth under “Risk Factors” beginning on page 29 of this proxy
statement/prospectus, which discusses the risks relating to the merger.

On behalf of the board of directors of Atlantic, thank you for your prompt consideration to this important matter.
By Order of the Board of Directors of Atlantic,
  
Tracy L. Keegan
Executive Vice President, 
Chief Financial Officer and
Corporate Secretary

Neither the Securities and Exchange Commission nor any state securities commission has approved or disapproved the securities to be issued in the

Q: What am I being asked to vote on?

A: You are being asked to vote to approve the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated November 16, 2017,
between Ameris and Atlantic, pursuant to which Atlantic will merge with and into Ameris with Ameris as
the surviving company subject to the terms and conditions contained in the Merger Agreement, including
the transactions provided for in the Merger Agreement, a copy of which is included in this proxy
statement/prospectus as Appendix A.

Q: Why do Ameris and Atlantic want to merge?

A: We believe the combination of Ameris and Atlantic will create one of the leading community banking
franchises in the Jacksonville, Florida market, providing our customers with additional branch locations and
market share in such market. The board of directors of Atlantic has determined that the merger is in the best
interests of Atlantic and its stockholders, and unanimously recommends that Atlantic stockholders vote
“FOR” the merger proposal. For more information about the reasons for the merger, see “The Merger — 
Atlantic’s Reasons for the Merger and the Recommendation of the Atlantic Board of Directors” and “The
Merger — Ameris’s Reasons for the Merger.”

Q: What will I receive in the merger?

A: Unless adjusted pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, each share of Atlantic common stock
outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger will be converted into the right to receive:
(i) $1.39 in cash, without interest (the “cash consideration”); and (ii) 0.17 shares (the “exchange ratio”) of
Ameris common stock, plus cash in lieu of fractional shares (the “stock consideration”). We refer to the cash
consideration and the stock consideration to be received for each share of Atlantic common stock as the “per
share purchase price.”

Q: What happens if I am entitled to receive a fractional share of Ameris common stock as part of the
stock consideration?

A: Ameris will not issue fractional shares in the merger. Rather, Atlantic stockholders who would otherwise be
entitled to receive a fractional share of Ameris common stock upon the completion of the merger will
instead receive an amount in cash (computed to the nearest cent) equal to such fractional part of a share of
Ameris common stock multiplied by the exchange ratio multiplied by the average Ameris stock price (as
defined under “The Merger Agreement — Merger Termination; Merger Consideration Adjustments”).

TABLE OF CONTENTS

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE MERGER 
AND THE SPECIAL MEETING

The following are some answers to certain questions that you may have about the special meeting of
Atlantic stockholders, which we refer to as the “special meeting,” and the merger. We urge you to read carefully
the remainder of this proxy statement/prospectus (including “Risk Factors” beginning on page 29) because the
information in this section does not provide all of the information that might be important to you with respect to
the special meeting and the merger. You may also find this proxy statement/prospectus posted on the Internet at
http://www.irinfo.com/acfc/acfc.html. Additional important information is also contained in the appendices to,
and the documents incorporated by reference into, this proxy statement/ prospectus. See “Where You Can Find
More Information” and “Certain Documents Incorporated by Reference.”

Atlantic stockholders also are being asked to approve: (i) on a non-binding advisory basis, the compensation
that certain executive officers of Atlantic will receive under existing agreements with Atlantic in connection
with the merger; and (ii) a proposal providing for one or more adjournments or postponements of the special
meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to permit further solicitation of proxies if there are not sufficient votes
at the time of the special meeting to approve the merger proposal.

Q: Under what circumstances may the merger consideration be adjusted?
A: The completion of the merger is subject to a price floor. If the average closing price of one share of Ameris

common stock during a specified determination period has declined by more than 15% from its price on
November 15, 2017, of  $46.95 per share, and Ameris common stock underperforms the KBW Nasdaq
Regional Banking Index (KRX) by more than 15% during such period, then Atlantic may terminate the
Merger Agreement unless Ameris offsets such reduction in the value of Ameris common stock by:

• increasing the number of shares of Ameris common stock to be issued to Atlantic stockholders: or

• paying additional cash consideration (provided that doing so would not prevent the merger from
qualifying as a tax-free reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”)) to Atlantic stockholders.

Q: Will the value of the merger consideration change between the date of this proxy statement/prospectus
and the time the merger is completed?

A: The value of the merger consideration will fluctuate between the date of this proxy statement/ prospectus and
the completion of the merger based upon the market value of Ameris common stock. Any fluctuation in the
market price of Ameris common stock after the date of this proxy statement/ prospectus will change the
value of the shares of Ameris common stock that Atlantic stockholders will receive, and will therefore
change the value of the merger consideration. Based on the 0.17 exchange ratio and the closing price of
Ameris common stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market of  $47.30 on November 16, 2017, the last
full trading day before the public announcement of the merger, the value of the merger consideration was
$9.43 for each share of Atlantic common stock and approximately $146.7 million in the aggregate. Based on
the 0.17 exchange ratio and the closing price of Ameris common stock on the NASDAQ Global Select
Market on February 12, 2018, the latest practicable date before the date of this proxy statement/prospectus,
the value of the merger consideration was $10.33 for each share of Atlantic common stock and
approximately $160.7 million in the aggregate. The market prices of both Ameris common stock and
Atlantic common stock will fluctuate before the merger is completed. We encourage you to obtain current
market prices for Ameris common stock and Atlantic common stock.

Q: How will the merger impact Atlantic restricted share awards?
A: At the effective time of the merger, each outstanding award of shares of Atlantic common stock subject to

vesting, repurchase or other lapse restriction granted pursuant to Atlantic’s equity-based compensation plans
(each, an “Atlantic restricted share award”), will fully vest and be converted automatically into the right to
receive the merger consideration.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Also, if the June 30, 2018 termination date of the Merger Agreement is extended by either party as
contemplated in the Merger Agreement and described under “The Merger Agreement — Termination;
Merger Consideration Adjustments,” then provided that it will not cause the merger to fail to qualify as a
tax-free reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, the aggregate cash consideration
to be received by Atlantic stockholders in the merger will be increased by the amount of Atlantic’s after-tax
net income for the period from January 1, 2018 through June 30, 2018.

Subject to certain exceptions specified in the Merger Agreement, if prior to the effective time of the merger
the number of outstanding shares of Ameris common stock or Atlantic common stock is changed as a result
of a stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, reclassification or similar transaction
with respect to such shares, then the stock consideration will be proportionately and appropriately adjusted.

We refer to the aggregate per share purchase price payable in the merger, as may be adjusted as
contemplated by the Merger Agreement, as the “merger consideration.”

As of the date of the Merger Agreement, there were outstanding Atlantic restricted share awards with respect
to 44,648 shares of Atlantic common stock.

Q: Do any of Atlantic’s directors or executive officers have interests in the merger that may differ from
those of Atlantic stockholders?

A: Atlantic’s directors and executive officers have interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition
to, those of Atlantic stockholders generally. The board of directors of Atlantic was aware of and considered
these interests, among other matters, in evaluating the merger proposal, and in recommending that Atlantic
stockholders approve the merger proposal. For a description of these interests, see “The Merger — Interests
of Atlantic Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger.”

Q: Why am I being asked to cast an advisory (non-binding) vote to approve the compensation payable to
certain Atlantic executive officers in connection with the merger?

A: The SEC, in accordance with the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the
“Dodd Frank Act”), adopted rules that require Atlantic to seek an advisory (non-binding) vote with respect
to certain payments that may be made to certain of Atlantic’s executive officers in connection with the
merger.

Q: What will happen if Atlantic stockholders do not approve the merger-related compensation proposal?

A: Certain of Atlantic’s executive officers are entitled, pursuant to the terms of their existing employment
agreements with Atlantic, to receive certain payments in connection with the merger. If the merger is
completed, Atlantic is contractually obligated to make these payments to these executive officers under
certain circumstances.

Q: What will happen to Atlantic as a result of the merger?

A: If the merger is completed, then Atlantic will be merged with and into Ameris, with Ameris as the surviving
company. As a result of the merger, Atlantic will cease to exist, and Atlantic Coast Bank, a Florida state-
charted bank and a wholly owned subsidiary of Atlantic, will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Ameris.
See “— What will happen to Atlantic Coast Bank following the merger?”

Q: What will happen to Atlantic Coast Bank following the merger?

A: Immediately after the merger, Atlantic Coast Bank will merge with and into Ameris Bank, a Georgia state-
charted bank and a wholly owned subsidiary of Ameris, with Ameris Bank as the surviving bank (the “bank
merger”).

Q: Does the board of directors of Atlantic support the merger?

A: Yes. The board of directors of Atlantic has determined that the Merger Agreement is in the best interests of
Atlantic stockholders and unanimously recommends that Atlantic stockholders vote “FOR” the merger
proposal. Additionally, the directors and certain executive officers of Atlantic have entered into a Voting and
Support Agreement (the “Voting Agreement”) with Ameris and Atlantic pursuant to which they have agreed,
among other things, to vote all of the shares of Atlantic common stock they beneficially own in favor of the
merger proposal and the adjournment proposal. A total of 1,702,982 shares of Atlantic common stock,
representing approximately 10.9% of the outstanding shares of Atlantic common stock entitled to vote at the
special meeting, are subject to the Voting Agreement.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Atlantic stockholder approval of the compensation payable to these executive officers in connection with the
merger is not a condition to completion of the merger. The vote on the merger-related compensation
proposal is advisory and will not be binding on Atlantic (or the combined company that results from the
merger) regardless of whether the merger is approved. Accordingly, because the compensation to be paid to
certain of Atlantic’s executive officers in connection with the merger is contractual, the compensation will
be payable if the merger is completed regardless of the outcome of the non-binding, advisory vote on the
merger-related compensation proposal.

In addition, if the merger is completed, then Atlantic common stock will be delisted from the NASDAQ
Global Market and deregistered under the Exchange Act.

Q: When do you expect the merger to be completed?

A: Ameris and Atlantic expect the merger to be completed in the second quarter of 2018 and are working
towards completing the merger as quickly as possible. To do so, the Atlantic stockholders must approve the
merger proposal, Ameris must obtain all regulatory approvals necessary to complete the merger, and other
customary closing conditions must be satisfied. See “The Merger Agreement — Conditions to Completion
of the Merger.” However, it is possible that factors outside the control of both companies could result in the
merger being delayed or not completed at all.

Q: Are there risks associated with the merger that I should consider in deciding how to vote?

A: Yes. There are a number of risks related to the merger and the other transactions provided for in the Merger
Agreement that are discussed in this proxy statement/prospectus, in the appendices to this proxy
statement/prospectus and the documents incorporated by reference into this proxy statement/prospectus.

A: Approval of the merger proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of
Atlantic common stock outstanding on the record date. We refer to this as the “requisite Atlantic stockholder
approval.”

Q: What vote is required to approve, on a non-binding advisory basis, the merger-related compensation
proposal?

by proxy at the special meeting.

Q: What vote is required to approve the adjournment proposal?

A: Approval of the adjournment proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares

A: Yes. Participants in the Atlantic Coast Financial Corporation Employee Stock Ownership Plan (the “Atlantic
ESOP”) will each receive a Voting Instruction Form that reflects all of the shares that the participant may
direct the Atlantic ESOP trustee to vote on his or her behalf under the Atlantic ESOP. Under the terms of the
Atlantic ESOP, the Atlantic ESOP trustee votes all shares held by the Atlantic ESOP, but each Atlantic
ESOP participant may direct the trustee how to vote the shares of Atlantic

Q: What do I need to do now?

A: Please read this proxy statement/prospectus and decide how you wish to vote your shares and then indicate
that vote on the proxy card included with this proxy statement/prospectus. Sign and return the proxy card in
the enclosed prepaid return envelope as soon as possible, so that your shares may be represented and voted
at the special meeting to be held on March 21, 2018.

Q: What if I do not vote?

A: If you do not vote, then it will have the same effect as voting your shares against the merger proposal;
however, it will have no effect on the outcome of the merger-related compensation proposal or the
adjournment proposal.

Q: If my shares are held in “street name” by my broker, will my broker vote my shares for me?

A: No. Your broker will not be able to vote your shares without instructions from you. You should instruct your

Q: Can I change or revoke my vote after I have mailed my signed proxy card?

A: Yes. There are three ways in which you may revoke your proxy and change your vote.

Q: Can I exercise dissenters’ rights in connection with the merger?

A: No, under Maryland law Atlantic stockholders are not eligible to exercise dissenters’ rights in connection
with the merger.

stock certificate(s) along with the completed letter of transmittal. The letter of transmittal will be
accompanied by instructions explaining how to complete the letter of transmittal and deliver it and your
stock certificate(s) or book-entry shares to the exchange agent for the merger.

Q: What are the material United States federal income tax consequences of the merger to Atlantic
stockholders?

A: The merger is intended to qualify as a tax-free reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code, and it is a condition to the respective obligations of Ameris and Atlantic to complete the merger that
each of Ameris and Atlantic receives a legal opinion to that effect. Accordingly, an Atlantic stockholder
generally will recognize gain, but not loss, in an amount equal to the lesser of: (i) the amount of gain
realized (i.e., the excess of the sum of the amount of cash and the fair market value of the Ameris common
stock received pursuant to the merger over that holder’s adjusted tax basis in its shares of Atlantic common
stock surrendered); and (ii) the amount of cash received pursuant to the merger. Further, an Atlantic
stockholder generally will recognize gain or loss with respect to cash received in lieu of fractional shares of
Ameris common stock that the Atlantic stockholder would otherwise be entitled to receive. For further
information, see “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences.”

Atlantic common stock held by the Atlantic ESOP and allocated shares for which no voting instructions are
received in the same proportion as shares for which it has received timely voting instructions.

First, you may send a written notice to Atlantic’s Corporate Secretary stating that you would like to revoke
your proxy. Second, you may complete and submit a new proxy card. Third, you may attend the special
meeting and vote in person. Simply attending the special meeting, however, will not revoke your proxy.

Q: Ameris has also entered into an agreement to acquire Hamilton State Bancshares, Inc. What impact
will Ameris’s merger with Hamilton have on Ameris’s merger with Atlantic?

A: On January 25, 2018, Ameris and Hamilton State Bancshares, Inc., a Georgia corporation (“Hamilton”),
entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Hamilton Merger Agreement”) pursuant to which
Hamilton will merge with and into Ameris, with Ameris as the surviving entity (the “Hamilton merger”).
The Hamilton merger is expected to close in the third quarter of 2018. The completion of the Atlantic
merger is not conditioned upon or subject to the completion of the Hamilton merger. Also see “Risk Factors
— If the Atlantic merger and the Hamilton merger were to occur, the pro forma combined company would
exceed $10 billion in assets, which would result in increased costs and/or reduced revenues to the resulting
entity and subject it to increased regulatory scrutiny by its primary federal regulators with respect to its risk
management and other activities.”

The Companies (see page 44)

Ameris Bancorp
310 First Street, S.E. 
Moultrie, Georgia 31768 
(229) 890-1111

Ameris Bancorp, a Georgia corporation incorporated in 1980, is a bank holding company headquartered in
Moultrie, Georgia. Ameris’s business is conducted primarily through Ameris Bank, a Georgia state-chartered
bank and a wholly owned subsidiary of Ameris. At September 30, 2017, Ameris had total consolidated assets of 
$7.6 billion, total loans (net of allowance for loan losses) of  $5.9 billion, total deposits of  $5.9 billion and
shareholders’ equity of  $801.9 million.

Through Ameris Bank, Ameris provides a full range of banking services to its retail and commercial
customers through 97 branches primarily concentrated in select markets in Georgia, Alabama, Northern Florida
and South Carolina. These branches serve distinct communities in Ameris’s business areas with autonomy but do
so as one bank, leveraging Ameris’s favorable geographic footprint in an effort to acquire more customers.

The Ameris common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol “ABCB.”

Atlantic Coast Financial Corporation 
4655 Salisbury Road, Suite 110 
Jacksonville, Florida 32256 
(800) 342-2824

Atlantic Coast Financial Corporation, a Maryland corporation incorporated in 2007, is a bank holding
company headquartered in Jacksonville, Florida. Through its principal wholly owned subsidiary, Atlantic Coast
Bank, Atlantic serves the Northeast Florida, Central Florida and Southeast Georgia markets. At September 30,
2017, Atlantic had total consolidated assets of  $921.9 million, total loans (net of allowance for loan losses) of 
$785.5 million, total deposits of  $676.4 million, and shareholders’ equity of $91.4 million.

Atlantic Coast Bank was established in 1939 as a credit union to serve the employees of the Atlantic Coast
Line Railroad. On November 1, 2000, after receiving the necessary regulatory and membership approvals,
Atlantic Coast Federal Credit Union converted to a federal mutual savings bank (and subsequently a federally-
chartered savings bank) known as Atlantic Coast Bank. The conversion allowed the bank to diversify its
customer base by marketing products and services to individuals and businesses in its market areas and make
loans to customers who did not have a deposit relationship with the bank. On December 27, 2016, Atlantic Coast
Bank consummated the conversion of its charter from that of a federally-chartered savings bank to that of a
Florida state-chartered commercial bank supervised by the Florida Office of Financial Regulation and the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”).

Atlantic Coast Bank offers a variety of deposit accounts having a wide range of interest rates and terms,
which generally include noninterest-bearing and interest-bearing demand, savings and money market demand,
and time deposit accounts with terms ranging from three months to five years. Deposits are primarily solicited in
Atlantic Coast Bank’s market areas of Northeast Florida and Southeast Georgia to fund loan demand and other
liquidity needs; however, late in 2015, Atlantic Coast Bank also started soliciting deposits in Central Florida.

The Atlantic common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Global Market under the symbol “ACFC.”

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Pending Acquisition of Hamilton State Bancshares, Inc. (see page 44)

On January 25, 2018, Ameris and Hamilton entered into the Hamilton Merger Agreement pursuant to which
Hamilton will merge into Ameris, with Ameris as the surviving entity. The Hamilton Merger Agreement provides
that, immediately following the Hamilton merger, Hamilton State Bank, a Georgia bank wholly owned by
Hamilton, will be merged into Ameris Bank, with Ameris Bank as the surviving bank.

Under the terms and subject to the conditions of the Hamilton Merger Agreement, Hamilton shareholders
will receive $0.93 in cash and 0.16 shares of Ameris common stock for each share of Hamilton voting common
stock and non-voting common stock that they hold (collectively, the “Hamilton common stock”), which equates
to an aggregate value of approximately $405.7 million based on the $53.45 closing price of Ameris common
stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market as of January 25, 2018.

The Hamilton Merger Agreement has been unanimously approved by the boards of directors of each of
Ameris and Hamilton and is expected to close in the third quarter of 2018. The closing of the Hamilton merger is
subject to the required approval of Hamilton shareholders, requisite regulatory approvals, the effectiveness of the
registration statement to be filed by Ameris with respect to the shares of Ameris common stock to be issued in the
Hamilton merger and other customary closing conditions.

The completion of the Atlantic merger is not conditioned upon or subject to the completion of the Hamilton
merger, and the completion of the Hamilton merger is not conditioned upon or subject to the completion of the
Atlantic merger.

Atlantic Special Meeting (see page 38)

The special meeting will be held on March 21, 2018, at 10:00 a.m., local time, at the Jacksonville Marriott,
4670 Salisbury Road, Jacksonville, FL 32256. At the special meeting, holders of Atlantic common stock will be
asked to:

You can vote at the special meeting if you owned Atlantic common stock as of the close of business on
February 12, 2018, which is the record date for the special meeting. On that date, there were 15,553,709 shares of
Atlantic common stock outstanding and entitled to vote, approximately 10.9% of which were owned and entitled
to be voted by Atlantic’s directors and executive officers and their affiliates. As of the record date, neither Ameris
nor any of its directors or executive officers owned or had the right to vote any of the outstanding shares of
Atlantic common stock. You can cast one vote for each share of Atlantic common stock you owned on that date.

Approval of the merger proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the issued and
outstanding shares of Atlantic common stock entitled to vote. Approval, on a non-binding advisory basis, of the
merger-related compensation proposal, and approval of the adjournment proposal, each requires the affirmative
vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of Atlantic common stock represented in person or by proxy at the
special meeting.

The directors and certain executive officers of Atlantic have entered into a Voting Agreement with Ameris
and Atlantic under which they have agreed, among other things, to vote all of the shares they beneficially own for
approval of the merger proposal and the adjournment proposal. A total of 1,702,982 shares of Atlantic common
stock, representing approximately 10.9% of the outstanding shares of Atlantic common stock entitled to vote at
the special meeting, are subject to the Voting Agreement.

The Merger (see page 65)

The terms and conditions of the merger are contained in the Merger Agreement, a copy of which is included
as Appendix A to this proxy statement/prospectus and is incorporated by reference into this proxy
statement/prospectus. You should read the Merger Agreement carefully and in its entirety, as it is the legal
document governing the merger.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

In the merger, Atlantic will merge with and into Ameris, with Ameris as the surviving company. It is
expected that immediately after the merger, Atlantic Coast Bank will merge into Ameris Bank, with Ameris Bank
as the surviving bank.

Closing and Effective Time of the Merger (see page 65)

The completion of the merger is expected to occur during the second quarter of 2018. Unless both Ameris
and Atlantic agree to a later date, the closing of the merger will take place no later than five business days after
all of the conditions to the closing of the merger have been satisfied or waived in accordance with their terms. We
refer to the date on which the closing of the merger occurs as the “closing date.”

On the closing date, Ameris will file a certificate of merger with the Georgia Secretary of State and articles
of merger with the Maryland State Department of Assessments and Taxation. The merger will be effective upon
the later of: (i) the filing of the certificate of merger with the Georgia Secretary of State and the articles of merger
with the Maryland State Department of Assessments and Taxation; and (ii) such later date and time to which
Ameris and Atlantic agree and as may be specified in accordance with the Georgia Business Corporation Code.
We refer to the date and time at which the merger is effective as the “effective time.”

The Merger Consideration; Merger Consideration Adjustments (see pages 66 and 76)

If the merger is completed and unless adjusted pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, each share of
Atlantic common stock outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger will be converted into
the right to receive: (i) $1.39 in cash, without interest; and (ii) 0.17 shares of Ameris common stock, plus cash in
lieu of fractional shares.

Ameris will not issue fractional shares in the merger. Rather, Atlantic stockholders who would otherwise be
entitled to receive a fractional share of Ameris common stock upon the completion of the merger will instead
receive an amount in cash (computed to the nearest cent) equal to such fractional part of a share of Ameris
common stock multiplied by the exchange ratio multiplied by the average Ameris stock price (as defined under
“The Merger Agreement — Termination; Merger Consideration Adjustments”).

The completion of the merger is subject to a price floor. If the average closing price of one share of Ameris
common stock during a specified determination period has declined by more than 15% from its price on
November 15, 2017, of  $46.95 per share, and Ameris common stock underperforms the KBW Nasdaq Regional
Banking Index (KRX) by more than 15% during such period, then Atlantic may terminate the Merger Agreement
unless Ameris offsets such reduction in the value of Ameris common stock by increasing the number of shares of
Ameris common stock to be issued, or paying additional cash consideration (provided that doing so would not
prevent the merger from qualifying as a tax-free reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code), to the Atlantic stockholders.

If the June 30, 2018 termination date of the Merger Agreement is extended by either party as contemplated
in the Merger Agreement and described under “The Merger Agreement — Termination; Merger Consideration
Adjustments,” then provided that it does not prevent the merger from qualifying as a tax-free reorganization
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, the aggregate cash consideration to be received by Atlantic
stockholders in the merger will be increased by the amount of Atlantic’s after-tax net income for the period from
January 1, 2018 through June 30, 2018.

Subject to certain exceptions specified in the Merger Agreement, if prior to the effective time of the merger
the number of outstanding shares of Ameris common stock or Atlantic common stock is changed as a result of a
stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, reclassification or similar transaction with respect
to such shares, then the stock consideration will be proportionately and appropriately adjusted.

The value of the shares of Ameris common stock to be issued in the merger will fluctuate between now and
the closing date of the merger. The market price of Ameris common stock at closing will not be known at the
time of the special meeting and may be more or less than the current market price of Ameris

common stock or the price of Ameris common stock at the time of the special meeting. You should obtain current
market prices for Ameris common stock and Atlantic common stock prior to voting. The Ameris common stock
is traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol “ABCB.” The Atlantic common stock is
traded on the NASDAQ Global Market under the symbol “ACFC.”

Equivalent Atlantic Per Share Value (see page 36)
The following table presents the closing price of Ameris common stock on November 16, 2017, the last full

trading day before the public announcement of the merger, and February 12, 2018, the latest practicable date
before the date of this proxy statement/prospectus. The table also presents the equivalent value of the per share
purchase price on those dates, calculated by multiplying the closing price of Ameris common stock on those dates
by the exchange ratio of 0.17 and then adding to such product the cash consideration of  $1.39.

Date

Closing Price

Per Share Value

November 16, 2017 $47.30 0.17 $ 9.43
February 12, 2018 $52.60 0.17 $ 10.33

The value of the merger consideration will fluctuate between the date of this proxy statement/prospectus and
the completion of the merger based upon the market price of Ameris common stock. Any fluctuation in the
market price of Ameris common stock after the date of this proxy statement/prospectus will change the value of
the shares of Ameris common stock that Atlantic stockholders will receive, and will therefore change the value of
the merger consideration. You should obtain current market prices for shares of Ameris common stock and
Atlantic common stock.

Treatment of Atlantic Equity Awards (see page 66)
At the effective time of the merger, each Atlantic restricted share award will fully vest and be converted

automatically into the right to receive the merger consideration.

Each outstanding option to acquire shares of Atlantic common stock issued pursuant to Atlantic’s equity-
based compensation plans (each, an “Atlantic stock option”) has an exercise price of  $14.95 per share. Because
this exercise price is expected to be well in excess of the merger consideration price (as defined below), it is
likely that each Atlantic stock option will be canceled without consideration. If, however, the exercise price is
less than the merger consideration price at the effective time of the merger, then each Atlantic stock option will
fully vest and be cancelled and converted automatically into the right to receive a cash payment from Ameris or
Ameris Bank (the “cash-out amount”) in an amount equal to the product of: (i) the excess, if any, of the merger
consideration price over the exercise price of each such Atlantic stock option; and (ii) the number of shares of
Atlantic common stock subject to such Atlantic stock option to the extent not previously exercised.

The term “merger consideration price” means the sum of: (i) the exchange ratio multiplied by the average
Ameris stock price (as defined under “The Merger Agreement — Termination; Merger Consideration
Adjustments”); and (ii) $1.39.

Surrender of Stock Certificates (see page 67)
Shortly after the effective time of the merger, the exchange agent for the merger will mail to each holder of

record of Atlantic common stock a letter of transmittal and instructions for the surrender of the holder’s Atlantic
stock certificate(s) or book-entry shares for the merger consideration and any dividends or distributions to which
such holder may be entitled to pursuant to the Merger Agreement.

Please do not send in your stock certificates until you receive the letter of transmittal.

Recommendation of the Board of Directors of Atlantic (see pages 50 and 74)
The board of directors of Atlantic has approved and adopted the Merger Agreement, and determined that the

merger is in the best interests of Atlantic and its stockholders, and unanimously recommends that Atlantic
stockholders vote “FOR” the merger proposal, “FOR” the merger-related compensation proposal and “FOR”
the adjournment proposal.

On November 15, 2017, Hovde Group, LLC (“Hovde”) delivered to the board of directors of Atlantic a
written opinion regarding the fairness of the merger consideration to be received by Atlantic stockholders from a
financial point of view.

The Hovde opinion was directed to the board of directors of Atlantic and relates only to the fairness of the
merger consideration to be received by Atlantic stockholders from a financial point of view. Hovde’s opinion
does not address any other aspect of the merger and is not a recommendation to any Atlantic stockholder as to
how such stockholder should vote at the special meeting.

The full text of Hovde’s November 15, 2017 opinion is included as Appendix C in this proxy statement/ 
prospectus and is incorporated by reference into this proxy statement/prospectus. The opinion outlines the
procedures followed, assumptions made, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the review
undertaken by Hovde in rendering its opinion. The description of the opinion is qualified in its entirety by
reference to the opinion. Atlantic stockholders are urged to read the entire opinion carefully in connection with
their consideration of the merger proposal.

Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger (see page 80)

The merger is intended to qualify as a tax-free reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code. It is a condition to the respective obligations of Ameris and Atlantic to complete the merger that each of
Ameris and Atlantic receives a legal opinion to that effect. Accordingly, a, Atlantic stockholder generally will
recognize gain, but not loss, in an amount equal to the lesser of: (i) the amount of gain realized (i.e., the excess of
the sum of the amount of cash and the fair market value of the Ameris common stock received pursuant to the
merger over that holder’s adjusted tax basis in its shares of Atlantic common stock surrendered); and (ii) the
amount of cash received pursuant to the merger. Further, an Atlantic stockholder generally will recognize gain or
loss with respect to cash received instead of fractional shares of Ameris common stock that the Atlantic
stockholder would otherwise be entitled to receive.

The United States federal income tax consequences described above may not apply to all holders of
Atlantic common stock. Your tax consequences will depend on your individual situation. Accordingly, we
urge you to consult your tax advisor for a full understanding of the particular tax consequences of the
merger to you.

Interests of Atlantic Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger (see page 62)

Some of Atlantic’s executive officers and directors have interests in the merger that are in addition to, or
different from, the interests of Atlantic stockholders generally. These interests include the following:

• receipt of the requisite Atlantic stockholder approval;

• receipt of all regulatory authorizations, consents, orders or approvals required to complete the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the merger and the bank merger (the
“required regulatory approvals”), without them containing or resulting in the imposition of any
materially burdensome regulatory condition (as defined under “— Regulatory Approvals”);

• no order, injunction or legal restraint preventing the completion of the merger or the other transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement, and no law prohibiting or making illegal the completion of the
merger;

• the effectiveness of the registration statement of which this proxy statement/prospectus forms a part,
and no stop order being entered with respect thereto;

• the accuracy of the representations and warranties in the Merger Agreement, without giving effect to
any limitation as to materiality or material adverse effect described in the Merger Agreement;

• the performance in all material respects by Ameris and Atlantic of their respective agreements and
covenants under the Merger Agreement; and

• receipt by each of Ameris and Atlantic of an opinion of its respective legal counsel as to certain tax
matters related to the merger.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

The board of directors of Atlantic was aware of these interests and considered them, among other matters, in
approving and adopting the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement,
including the merger.

Conditions to Completion of the Merger (see page 75)

The completion of the merger depends on a number of customary conditions being satisfied or, where
permitted, waived, including:

No assurance is given as to when, or if, the conditions to the merger will be satisfied or waived, or that the
merger will be completed.

Regulatory Approvals (see page 64)

Under applicable law, the merger must be approved by The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
System (the “Federal Reserve”) and the bank merger of the two bank subsidiaries must be approved by the FDIC.
In addition, the Georgia Department of Banking and Finance (the “GDBF”) must also approve the merger and the
bank merger of the two bank subsidiaries.

All of the regulatory applications for the required regulatory approvals from the foregoing banking
regulators have been filed and are pending as of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus. There is no
assurance as to whether all required regulatory approvals will be obtained or as to the dates of the approvals. We
make no assurance that the required regulatory approvals can be obtained or that any conditions regarding such
regulatory approvals would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the surviving
company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole (a “materially burdensome regulatory condition”).

Limitations on Discussions With Third Parties (see page 73)

Atlantic has agreed to a number of limitations with respect to soliciting, negotiating and discussing, or
accepting acquisition proposals (as defined under “The Merger Agreement — Limitations on Discussions With
Third Parties”) involving persons other than Ameris, and to certain related matters. The Merger Agreement does
not, however, prohibit Atlantic from considering prior to the special meeting an unsolicited, bona fide acquisition
proposal from a third party if certain conditions specified in the Merger Agreement are met.

• by either party if, under certain circumstances, the merger is not completed by June 30, 2018 (unless
such termination date is extended by either party as provided in the Merger Agreement);

• by either party, if events that have had, or would reasonably be expected to have, a material adverse
effect on the other party have occurred and are continuing;

material adverse effect on Ameris or Atlantic and which Atlantic was required, but failed, to disclose;

• by either party, if any required regulatory approval has been denied or any governmental authority of
competent jurisdiction has issued a final, nonappealable injunction permanently enjoining or
prohibiting the completion of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the
merger or the bank merger of the two bank subsidiaries;

• by either party, if the requisite Atlantic stockholder approval is not obtained; and

• by Atlantic, prior to obtaining the requisite Atlantic stockholder approval, to enter into another
proposed offer.

• by either party because the merger is not completed on or before June 30, 2018; or

• by Atlantic other than because (i) events have occurred and are continuing that have had, or would
reasonably be expected to have, a material adverse effect on Ameris, or (ii) Ameris has materially
breached any covenant, obligation or agreement in the Merger Agreement, subject to the cure
provisions provided therein.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Termination Rights; Termination Fee (see pages 76 and 78)

Ameris and Atlantic may mutually agree to terminate the Merger Agreement and abandon the merger at any
time prior to the effective time. Subject to conditions and circumstances described in the Merger Agreement, the
Merger Agreement may be terminated prior to the effective time as follows:

In addition, if the average closing price of one share of Ameris common stock during the determination
period has declined by more than 15% from its price on November 15, 2017, of  $46.95 per share, and Ameris
common stock underperforms the KBW Nasdaq Regional Banking Index (KRX) by more than 15% during such
period, then Atlantic may terminate the Merger Agreement unless Ameris increases the exchange ratio or
contributes sufficient additional cash consideration (provided that doing so would not prevent the merger from
qualifying as a tax-free reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code) for payment to Atlantic
stockholders to offset any reduction in the value of the stock consideration attributable to such decline.

Atlantic must pay to Ameris a termination fee equal to $5.75 million if an acquisition proposal (as defined
under “The Merger Agreement — Limitations on Discussions With Third Parties”) is outstanding, or has been
accepted by Atlantic, and the Merger Agreement is terminated:

Atlantic also must pay to Ameris the termination fee of  $5.75 million if Ameris terminates the Merger
Agreement after an adverse Atlantic recommendation change (as defined under “The Merger Agreement — 
Atlantic Board Recommendation”) by the board of directors of Atlantic.

generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”).

Ameris Bancorp 2017 Financial Results

On January 26, 2018, Ameris announced preliminary, unaudited earnings and operating results for the
quarter and twelve months ended December 31, 2017. Ameris reported net income of  $73.5 million, or $1.98 per
diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with $72.1 million, or $2.08 per diluted share, for
2016. For the quarter ended December 31, 2017, reported results include net income of $9.2 million, or $0.24 per
diluted share, compared with $18.2 million, or $0.52 per diluted share, for the same period in 2016. The financial
results include a charge of  $13.4 million to income tax expense related to the valuation of Ameris’s deferred tax
asset, due to the recent tax legislation that reduces the future corporate tax rate for Ameris.

Ameris reported adjusted operating net income of  $92.3 million, or $2.48 per diluted share, for the year
ended December 31, 2017, compared with $80.6 million, or $2.32 per diluted share, for 2016. Adjusted operating
net income for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $23.6 million, or $0.63 per diluted share, compared with
$22.2 million, or $0.63 per diluted share, for the same quarter of 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2017,
Ameris’s adjusted operating return on average assets was 1.26%, compared with 1.31% for 2016. For the fourth
quarter of 2017, Ameris’s adjusted operating return on average assets was 1.20%, compared with 1.34% in the
same quarter of 2016.

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures. This “— Ameris Bancorp 2017 Financial Results”
contains certain financial information determined by methods other than in accordance with GAAP. Ameris’s
management uses these non-GAAP measures in its analysis of Ameris’s performance. These measures are useful
when evaluating the underlying performance and efficiency of Ameris’s operations and balance sheet. Ameris’s
management believes that these non-GAAP measures provide a greater understanding of ongoing operations,
enhance comparability of results with prior periods and demonstrate the effects of significant gains and charges in
the current period. Ameris’s management believes that investors may use these non-GAAP financial measures to
evaluate Ameris’s financial performance without the impact of unusual items that may obscure trends in Ameris’s
underlying performance. These disclosures should not be viewed as a substitute for financial measures
determined in accordance with GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures
that may be presented by other companies.

The following information reconciles adjusted operating net income, a non-GAAP financial measure, as of
the dates presented to Ameris’s net income, a financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with
GAAP, as of the dates presented.

Increase in Net Interest Income.   Net interest income on a tax-equivalent basis increased 19.4% in 2017 to
$267.1 million, up from $223.6 million for 2016. Growth in earning assets from internal sources contributed to
the increase. Average earning assets increased 20.7% in 2017 to $6.76 billion, compared with $5.60 billion for
2016. Although Ameris’s net interest income increased, net interest margin for 2017, including accretion,
declined to 3.95%, compared with 3.99% for 2016. Yields on earning assets in 2017 were 4.46%, compared with
4.35% in 2016.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Accretion income for 2017 decreased to $10.6 million, or 2.9% of total revenue, compared with
$14.1 million, or 4.3%, respectively, for 2016. Excluding the effect of accretion, Ameris’s margin for 2017 was
3.79%, compared with 3.74% for 2016. Yields on all loans, excluding the effect of accretion, increased to 4.63%
in 2017, compared with 4.50% in 2016.

Ameris’s net interest margin was 3.94% for the fourth quarter of 2017, down slightly from 3.95% reported
for both the third quarter of 2017 and for the fourth quarter of 2016. Accretion income for the fourth quarter of
2017 decreased to $2.2 million, compared with $2.7 million for the third quarter of 2017, and from $3.4 million
reported for the fourth quarter of 2016. Excluding the effect of accretion, Ameris’s margin for the fourth quarter
of 2017 was 3.82%, an improvement compared with 3.80% for the third quarter of 2017 and 3.73% for the fourth
quarter of 2016.

Yields on all loans, excluding the effect of accretion, increased to 4.70% during the fourth quarter of 2017,
compared with 4.65% in the third quarter of 2017. Loan production in the banking division during the fourth
quarter of 2017 totaled $419.8 million, with weighted average yields of 4.89%, compared with $409.2 million
and 4.74%, respectively, in the third quarter of 2017 and $498.7 million and 4.37%, respectively, in the fourth
quarter of 2016. Loan production in the lines of business (to include retail mortgage, warehouse lending, Small
Business Administration (“SBA”) and premium finance) amounted to an additional $1.5 billion during the fourth
quarter of 2017, compared with $1.3 billion during the fourth quarter of 2016.

Total interest expense for 2017 was $34.2 million, compared with $19.7 million for 2016. Deposit costs
increased during 2017 to 0.34%, compared with 0.24% for 2016. Noninterest-bearing deposits represented 28.6%
of the total average deposits for 2017, compared with 29.1% for 2016.

Noninterest Income. Noninterest income decreased 1.3% in 2017 to $104.5 million, compared with
$105.8 million for 2016, the result of flat mortgage and service charges during 2017. Noninterest retail mortgage
revenues were essentially flat during the year at $48.5 million despite an increase in mortgage volume of
approximately $93.7 million, or 6.7%. Gain on sale margins tightened during 2017, as they moved from 3.36% in
the fourth quarter of 2016 to 3.17% in the fourth quarter of 2017 because of more industry focus on purchase
business and higher rates to borrowers. Ameris increased volume sufficient to make up for the tighter gains on
sale, but late season hiring of mortgage bankers impacted profitability which increased by only 10.8%. During
2017, Ameris originated approximately $547 million of government loans with only 11.9% being Ameris’s own
Government National Mortgage Association securities.

Service charges for the year were also flat, coming in at $42.1 million compared with $42.7 million for
2016. Declining counts of consumer oriented accounts with the associated balances and revenues were offset by
larger commercial accounts, generally with enough balances to offset the analysis charges.

Revenues from Ameris’s warehouse lending division decreased slightly during the year, from $7.8 million
for 2016 to $7.6 million for 2017, while net income for the division increased 4.8%, from $4.1 million for 2016
to $4.3 million for 2017. Net income for Ameris’s retail mortgage division was $2.2 million for the fourth quarter
of 2017, compared with $3.0 million in the third quarter of 2017 and $1.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2016.
Net income for Ameris’s warehouse lending division was $1.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared
with $1.1 million for the third quarter of 2017 and $904,000 for the fourth quarter of 2016.

Revenues from Ameris’s SBA division continued to increase during 2017, rising from $8.9 million for 2016
to $10.0 million for 2017. Net income for the division increased to $3.9 million for 2017, compared with
$2.8 million for 2016.

Noninterest Expense. Noninterest expense increased $16.1 million, or 7.5%, to $231.9 million for the year
ended December 31, 2017, compared with $215.8 million for the year 2016. However, Ameris incurred various
expenses related to the new premium finance division that was added late in 2016, compliance-related charges
due to exiting the Consent Order (as defined under “The Companies — Ameris Bancorp”), losses on the sale of
bank premises, merger-related charges and Hurricane Irma expenses. Excluding these amounts, expenses in 2017
increased by only $7.5 million, or 3.7%, compared with 2016

Balance Sheet Trends.   Total assets increased $964.2 million, or 14.0%, during 2017. Total loans, including
loans held for sale, purchased loans and purchased loan pools, were $6.24 billion at the end of 2017, compared
with $5.37 billion at the end of 2016. Organic growth in loans totaled $941.0 million, or 20.3%, during 2017,
compared with $660.4 million, or 20.8%, in 2016. As expected, loan growth rates in the fourth quarter of 2017
slowed to 10.1% on an annualized basis, compared with 12.1% on an annualized basis in the same quarter of
2016.

During the quarter, Ameris sold or reclassified to loans held for sale approximately $119.5 million of
mortgage loans from purchased loan pools, reducing the investment in purchased loan pools to $328.2 million,
down 42% compared with the same period in the year ago period.

Loans outstanding for the new premium finance division grew $112.0 million, or 30.2%, from
$370.6 million at the end of 2016 to $482.5 million at the end of 2017.

Deposits increased $1.05 billion during 2017 to end the year at $6.63 billion, from $5.58 billion at the end of
2016. At December 31, 2017, noninterest-bearing deposit accounts were $1.78 billion, or 26.8% of total deposits,
compared with $1.57 billion, or 28.2% of total deposits, at December 31, 2016. Non-rate sensitive deposits grew
$342.4 million, or 10.8%, to $3.52 billion at December 31, 2017, compared with $3.17 billion at the end of 2016.
These funds represented 53.1% of Ameris’s total deposits at the end of 2017, compared with 56.9% at the end of
2016.

Growth in deposits at the end of the year, along with Ameris’s sale of mortgage loans from purchased loan
pools lowered the loan to deposit ratio from 101.0% at the end of the third quarter of 2017 to 91.3% at
December 31, 2017.

Stockholders’ equity at December 31, 2017 totaled $804.5 million, an increase of  $158.0 million, or 24.4%,
from December 31, 2016. The increase in stockholders’ equity was the result of the issuance of shares of Ameris
common stock in a public offering in the first quarter of 2017, plus earnings of

• Net interest income was $7.2 million and $27.0 million for the three and twelve months ended
December 31, 2017, respectively, compared with $7.1 million and $26.5 million for the three and
twelve months ended December 31, 2016, respectively. Net interest margin was 3.24% and 3.20% for
the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017, respectively, compared with 3.30% and 3.12%
for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2016, respectively.

• Total loans (including portfolio loans, loans held-for-sale, and warehouse loans held-for-investment)
increased 16% to $842.8 million at December 31, 2017, from $727.0 million at December 31, 2016.
Atlantic’s loan growth since December 31, 2016, was driven primarily by increased commercial real
estate lending in all of its markets. This growth was somewhat offset by lower mortgage loan sales as
part of Atlantic’s interest rate risk and balance sheet management strategies as well as decreases in
warehouse loans held-for-investment.

• Deposits increased 8% to $675.8 million at December 31, 2017, from $628.4 million at December 31,
2016. Deposits, excluding brokered certificates of deposit, increased 15% to $639.8 million at
December 31, 2017, from $558.0 million at December 31, 2016. Wholesale funding, which includes
brokered certificates of deposit and Federal Home Loan Bank advances, decreased 4% to
$249.5 million at December 31, 2017, from $259.2 million at December 31, 2016. The increase in non-
brokered deposits and resulting reduced reliance on wholesale funding was driven primarily by
Atlantic’s commercial deposit strategies put in place during 2016.

• Total assets increased to $983.3 million at December 31, 2017, from $907.5 million at December 31,
2016, primarily due to increases in portfolio loans and warehouse loans held-for-investment, which
were partially offset by a decrease in cash and cash equivalents, investment securities and loans held-
for-sale.

• Nonperforming assets, as a percentage of total assets, declined to 0.97% at December 31, 2017, from
1.44% at December 31, 2016. Due to Atlantic’s generally stable credit quality during 2016 and
continuing throughout 2017, reflecting an overall slowing pace of loan reclassifications to
nonperforming, Atlantic’s loan loss provision remained at a low level for both the three and
twelve months ended December 31, 2017, while maintaining, in management’s view, an adequate ratio
of allowance for portfolio loan losses to total portfolio loans.

• Atlantic Coast Bank’s ratios of total risk-based capital to risk-weighted assets and Tier 1 (core) capital
to adjusted total assets were 12.53% and 9.66%, respectively, at December 31, 2017, and each
continued to exceed the levels required by regulation, currently 10% and 5%, respectively, for a bank to
be considered well-capitalized.

Atlantic Coast Financial Corporation 2017 Financial Results

On January 23, 2018, Atlantic announced preliminary, unaudited earnings and operating results for the
quarter and twelve months ended December 31, 2017.

Atlantic reported a loss per diluted share of  $0.04 and earnings per diluted share of  $0.21 for the three and
twelve months ended December 31, 2017, respectively, compared with earnings of  $0.13 and $0.42 for the three
and twelve months ended December 31, 2016, respectively. The results for the three and twelve months ended
December 31, 2017, included a charge of  $1.6 million, or $0.11 per diluted share, related to a reduction in the
valuation of Atlantic’s net deferred tax assets caused by the recently enacted tax legislation, which reduces the
future statutory corporate income tax rate, and $0.4 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, of merger-related costs.

Other significant highlights of Atlantic’s fourth quarter of 2017 and the full year included:

(1) Includes $5.9 million and $7.9 million of nonperforming loans at December 31, 2017 and 2016,
respectively.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Bank Regulatory Capital
At December 31,

Key Capital Measures 2017 2016

Total risk-based capital ratio (to risk-weighted assets) 12.53 14.83
Common equity tier 1 (core) risk-based capital ratio (to risk-weighted assets) 11.43 13.58
Tier 1 (core) risk-based capital ratio (to risk-weighted assets) 11.43 13.58
Tier 1 (core) capital ratio (to adjusted total assets) 9.67 9.44

The decrease in risk-weighted capital ratios at December 31, 2017, compared with December 31, 2016,
reflected an increase in risk-weighted assets due to growth in portfolio loans and a decrease in cash and cash
equivalents and investment securities, as well as an increase in the risk weighting of certain portfolio loan
categories, partially offset by an increase in equity due to accumulated earnings. The charge to remeasure net
deferred tax assets, together with merger related expenses, reduced Atlantic’s Tier 1 (core) capital ratio as of
December 31, 2017, by approximately 20 basis points.

Credit Quality
At December 31,

2017 2016

(Dollars in millions)

Nonperforming loans $ 7.8 $10.1
Nonperforming loans to total portfolio loans 1.02 1.57
Other real estate owned $ 1.7 $ 2.9
Nonperforming assets $ 9.5 $13.0
Nonperforming assets to total assets 0.97 1.44
Troubled debt restructurings performing for less than 12 months 

under terms of modification $15.2 $14.6
Troubled debt restructurings performing for more than 12 months 

under terms of modification $15.7 $20.3

Nonperforming assets have declined for five consecutive quarters as Atlantic’s overall credit quality
remained stable and the general pace of loans reclassified to nonperforming remained slow during the last
twelve months. Importantly, OREO declined significantly as of December 31, 2017, compared with that at
December 31, 2016, primarily due to the sale of a $2.4 million foreclosed property in the second quarter of 2017,
partially offset by the foreclosure of a $1.6 million property in the fourth quarter of 2017, which was expected to
occur and had been fully reserved for prior to the foreclosure.

Net charge-offs totaled $39,000 and $38,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016,
respectively, while net recoveries totaled $18,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2017. This reflects a
trend of solid economic conditions across Atlantic’s markets, which has led to continued low levels of net charge-
offs during the last twelve months.

Atlantic’s provision for portfolio loan losses has remained within a relatively narrow range over the past
year. However, it was up $185,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared with the fourth
quarter last year, and was up $74,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, versus full year 2016. The
increase in the allowance for portfolio loan losses at December 31, 2017, compared with that at December 31,
2016, was attributable primarily to loan growth, which reflected organic growth supplemented by strategic loan
purchases that were offset partially by loan sales, principal amortization, and increased prepayments of one- to
four-family residential mortgages and home equity loans. Management believes the allowance for portfolio loan
losses at December 31, 2017, is sufficient to absorb losses in portfolio loans as of the end of the period.

The slight decrease in net interest margin during the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared with
net interest margin for the three months ended December 31, 2016, reflected an increase in rates paid on deposits
and borrowed funds, with little to no change in rates on new loans due to highly competitive lending conditions.
In addition, margin remains relatively stable given the improved mix in core deposits and growth in noninterest-
bearing accounts. The increase in net interest margin during the twelve months ended December 31, 2017,
compared with net interest margin for the twelve months ended

TABLE OF CONTENTS

December 31, 2016, primarily reflected a decrease in rates paid on funds due to an increase in noninterest-bearing
deposits, and an increase in higher-margin interest-earning assets outstanding, reflecting Atlantic’s ongoing
redeployment of excess liquidity to grow its portfolio loans, loans held-for-sale, and warehouse loans held-for-
investment.

Noninterest expense $6.4 $6.1 $6.0 $25.6 $25.1
Income tax expense $2.5 $0.6 $1.0 $ 4.6 $ 3.6

The decrease in noninterest income for the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared with that of
the three months ended December 31, 2016, primarily reflected lower gains on the sale of portfolio loans and
loans held-for-sale, as well as reduced service charges and fees. The decrease in noninterest income for the
twelve months ended December 31, 2017, compared with that of the twelve months ended December 31, 2016,
primarily reflected lower gains on the sale of investment securities, lower gains on the sale of portfolio loans,
reduced service charges and fees, and a decrease in miscellaneous operating income related to an escrow account
that was forfeited in 2016 in connection with an OREO sale, partially offset by higher gains on the sale of loans
held-for-sale.

The increase in noninterest expense during the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared with that
of the three months ended December 31, 2016, primarily reflected an increase in compensation and benefits,
occupancy and equipment expense, and merger-related costs associated with the proposed merger with Ameris,
partially offset by reduced foreclosed asset expense and a decrease in data processing expenses. The increase in
noninterest expense during the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, compared with that of the
twelve months ended December 31, 2016, primarily reflected an increase in compensation and benefits, increased
data processing expenses associated with efforts to improve Atlantic’s IT infrastructure, an increase in occupancy
and equipment expense, and the aforementioned merger-related costs, partially offset by the positive impact of an
adjustment to the rate of accrual for FDIC insurance premiums, reducing the amount accrued for the full year, and
a decrease in collection expense.

The increase in income tax expense for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017, compared
with that of the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2016, primarily reflected the impact of newly
enacted tax legislation, partially offset by a decline in income before income tax expense.

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.   A non-GAAP financial measure is generally defined as
a numerical measure of a company’s historical or future financial performance, financial position, or cash flows
that either excludes or includes amounts, or is subject to adjustments, so as to be different from the most directly
comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Core earnings and core earnings per
diluted share exclude the effects of certain transactions that occurred during the period, as detailed in the
following reconciliation of these measures.

Core earnings and core earnings per diluted share should be viewed in addition to, and not as a substitute for
or superior to, net income and income per diluted share on a GAAP basis. Atlantic’s management believes that
the non-GAAP financial measures, when considered together with GAAP financial measures, provide
information that is useful to investors in understanding period-over-period operating results separate and apart
from items that may, or could, have a disproportionately positive or negative impact on results in any particular
period. Atlantic’s management also believes that the non-GAAP financial measures aid investors in analyzing
Atlantic’s business trends and in understanding Atlantic’s performance. In addition, Atlantic may utilize non-
GAAP financial measures as guides in forecasting, budgeting and long-term planning processes and to measure
operating performance for some management compensation purposes.

SELECTED HISTORICAL CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL DATA OF AMERIS

The following selected historical consolidated financial data as of and for the year ended December 31,
2016, 2015, 2014, 2013, and 2012, is derived from the audited consolidated financial statements of Ameris. The
following selected historical consolidated financial data as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2017,
and 2016, is derived from the unaudited consolidated financial statements of Ameris and has been prepared on
the same basis as the selected historical consolidated financial data derived from the audited consolidated
financial statements and, in the opinion of Ameris’s management, reflects all adjustments, consisting only of
normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of this data for those dates.

The results of operations as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2017, are not necessarily
indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ended December 31, 2017 or any future period. You
should read the following selected historical consolidated financial data in conjunction with: (i) the section
entitled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Ameris’s
audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Ameris’s Annual Report on Form
10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016; and (ii) the section entitled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Ameris’s unaudited consolidated financial statements and
accompanying notes included in Ameris’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30,
2017, both of which are incorporated by reference into this proxy statement/prospectus. See “Certain Documents
Incorporated by Reference.”

Ameris’s “tangible book value per common share” is determined by methods other than in accordance with
GAAP. See “— Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for a reconciliation of Ameris’s
tangible book value per common share, a non-GAAP financial measure, to book value per common share, a

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

This proxy statement/prospectus and certain documents filed by Ameris with the SEC and incorporated by
reference into this proxy statement/prospectus contain financial information determined by methods other than in
accordance with GAAP. Ameris’s management uses these non-GAAP measures in its analysis of Ameris’s
performance. These measures are useful when evaluating the underlying performance and efficiency of Ameris’s
operations and balance sheet. Ameris’s management believes that these non-GAAP measures provide a greater
understanding of ongoing operations, enhance comparability of results with prior periods and demonstrate the
effects of significant gains and charges in the current period. Ameris’s management believes that investors may
use these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate Ameris’s financial performance without the impact of
unusual items that may obscure trends in Ameris’s underlying performance. These disclosures should not be
viewed as a substitute for financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP, nor are they necessarily
comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other companies. Non-GAAP
measures include tangible common equity and tangible book value per common share. Ameris calculates the
regulatory capital ratios using current regulatory report instructions. Ameris’s management uses these measures
to assess the quality of capital and believes that investors may find them useful in their evaluation of Ameris.
These capital measures may or may not be necessarily comparable to similar capital measures that may be
presented by other companies.

The following information reconciles Ameris’s tangible book value per common share, a non-GAAP
financial measure, as of the dates presented to Ameris’s book value per common share, a financial measure
calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, as of the dates presented.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

RISK FACTORS

In deciding how to vote, you should consider carefully all of the information included in this proxy
statement/prospectus and its appendices and all of the information incorporated by reference and the risk factors
identified by Ameris and Atlantic with respect to their operations included in their respective filings with the SEC,
including, in each case, the Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 and the
Quarterly Reports on Form 10-K for the quarter ended September 30, 2017. See “Where You Can Find More
Information” and “Certain Documents Incorporated by Reference.” In addition, you should consider the
following risk factors.

Because the market price of the Ameris common stock may fluctuate, Atlantic stockholders cannot be sure of
the market value of the merger consideration that they will receive in the merger until the closing.

Upon completion of the merger, each share of Atlantic common stock outstanding immediately prior to the
effective time of the merger will be converted into the right to receive: (i) $1.39 in cash, without interest; and (ii)
0.17 shares of Ameris common stock, plus cash in lieu of fractional shares. The value of the shares of Ameris
common stock to be issued to Atlantic stockholders in the merger will fluctuate between now and the closing date
of the merger due to a variety of factors, including general market and economic conditions, changes in the
parties’ respective businesses, operations and prospects, and regulatory considerations. Many of these factors are
beyond the control of Ameris and Atlantic. Therefore, at the time of the special meeting, Atlantic stockholders
will not know or be able to calculate the market value of the Ameris common stock they will receive upon
completion of the merger. We make no assurances as to whether or when the merger will be completed.

Combining the two companies may be more difficult, costly or time consuming than expected, and Ameris may
fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of the merger.

Ameris and Atlantic have operated and, until the completion of the merger, will continue to operate,
independently. The success of the merger will depend on, among other things, Ameris’s ability to combine the
businesses of Ameris and Atlantic in a manner that does not materially disrupt the existing customer relationships
of either Ameris or Atlantic or result in decreased revenues from customers of either of them. Additionally,
Ameris may not be able to successfully achieve the level of cost savings, revenue enhancements and other
synergies that it expects. If Ameris is not able to successfully achieve these objectives, then the anticipated
benefits of the merger may not be realized fully, if at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. This could
have an adverse effect on Ameris’s business, results of operations and stock price.

It is possible that the integration process could take longer than anticipated, result in the loss of key
employees, disrupt either Ameris’s or Atlantic’s ongoing businesses or result in inconsistencies in standards,
controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect the ability of Ameris or Atlantic to maintain relationships
with their respective clients, customers, depositors and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the
merger.

If Ameris’s stock price decreases below specified thresholds, then Atlantic has the right to terminate the
Merger Agreement and the merger would not occur unless Ameris increases the merger consideration.

If the average closing price of one share of Ameris common stock during a specified determination period
has declined by more than 15% from its price on November 15, 2017, of  $46.95 per share, and Ameris common
stock underperforms the KBW Nasdaq Regional Banking Index (KRX) by more than 15% during such period,
then Atlantic may terminate the Merger Agreement unless Ameris offsets such reduction in the value of Ameris
common stock by increasing the number of shares of Ameris common stock to be issued, or paying additional
cash consideration, to the Atlantic stockholders.

As a result, even if Atlantic stockholders approve the Merger Agreement, the merger may ultimately not be
completed. Although the Ameris board of directors has the ability to increase the merger consideration, and the
board of directors of Atlantic has the power to choose not to terminate the Merger Agreement and proceed with
the merger if Ameris does not increase the merger consideration, there is no obligation of either board to exercise
such power.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

The merger is expected to, but may not, qualify as a tax-free reorganization under the Code.

The parties expect the merger to be treated as a tax-free reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a)
of the Code, and Ameris and Atlantic will receive United States federal income tax opinions to that effect from
their respective tax counsel. These tax opinions represent the legal judgement of counsel rendering the opinion
and are not binding on the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) or the courts. If the merger does not qualify as a
tax-free reorganization, then the Atlantic stockholders may be required to recognize any gain with respect to all
the consideration, including the shares of Ameris common stock and not just the cash, received in the merger. Tax
matters are very complicated and the consequences of the merger to any particular Atlantic stockholder will
depend on that stockholder’s particular facts and circumstances. You should consult your own tax advisor to
determine the particular tax consequences of the merger to you.

Negative or unexpected consequences of the 2017 Tax Act could adversely affect Ameris’s results of
operations.

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, signed into law on December 22, 2017 (the “2017 Tax Act”), will make
significant changes to the Code, including a reduction in the corporate tax rate and limitations on certain
corporate deductions and credits. The new tax law could have negative or unexpected consequences on Ameris’s
financial position. By way of example, the 2017 Tax Act will lead to changes in the valuation of certain deferred
tax assets and deferred tax liabilities on Ameris’s consolidated balance sheets, which could materially affect
Ameris’s results of operations. Further, the full extent of the impact of the 2017 Tax Act on the financial
statements of Ameris cannot reasonably be estimated at this time. No assurance is given that the new tax law will
not have an adverse effect on the market price of Ameris common stock after the merger.

The actual financial positions and results of operations of Ameris and Atlantic may differ materially from the
pro forma financial information included in this proxy statement/prospectus.

The pro forma financial information contained in this proxy statement/prospectus is presented for illustrative
purposes only and may not be an indication of what the combined company’s financial position or results of
operations would have been had the merger been completed on the dates indicated. The pro forma financial
information has been derived from the audited and unaudited historical financial statements of Ameris and
Atlantic and includes certain adjustments and assumptions regarding the combined businesses after giving effect
to the transactions. The assets and liabilities of Atlantic have been measured at fair value based on various
preliminary estimates using assumptions that management believes are reasonable utilizing information currently
available. The process for calculating the fair value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities requires the use of
estimates in determining the appropriate assumptions and estimates. These estimates may be revised as additional
information becomes available and as additional analyses are performed. Differences between preliminary
estimates in the pro forma financial information and the final acquisition accounting will occur and could have a
material impact on the pro forma financial information and the combined company’s financial position and future
results of operations. In addition, the assumptions used in preparing the pro forma financial information may not
prove to be accurate, and other factors may affect the combined company’s financial condition or results of
operations following the closing. See “Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Condensed Financial Information.”

The opinion that Atlantic has obtained from Hovde has not been, and is not expected to be, updated to reflect
any changes in circumstances that may have occurred since the signing of the Merger Agreement.

The opinion issued to the board of directors of Atlantic by Hovde, financial advisor to Atlantic, with respect
to the fairness of the merger consideration to be received by Atlantic stockholders from a financial point of view,
speaks only as of November 15, 2017. Changes in the operations and prospects of Ameris or Atlantic, general
market and economic conditions and other factors that may be beyond the control of Ameris and Atlantic, and on
which the opinion was based, may have altered the value of Ameris or Atlantic, or the price of Ameris common
stock as of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus, or may alter such values and prices by the time the merger
is completed. Hovde has no obligation to update, revise or reaffirm its opinion to reflect subsequent
developments and has not done so. Because Atlantic does not

TABLE OF CONTENTS

currently anticipate asking Hovde to update its opinion, the opinion will not address the fairness of the merger
consideration from a financial point of view as of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus or at the time the
merger is completed. See “The Merger — Opinion of Atlantic’s Financial Advisor” and Appendix C included in
this proxy statement/prospectus.

The merger and the bank merger are subject to the receipt of consents and approvals from regulatory
authorities that may impose conditions that could have an adverse effect on Ameris.

Before the merger and the bank merger can be completed, various approvals or consents or waivers must be
obtained from bank regulatory authorities. These authorities may impose conditions on the completion of the
merger or the bank merger or require changes to their terms not favorable to Ameris or Atlantic proceeding with
the merger. The required regulatory approvals may not be received at all, may not be received in a timely fashion,
or may contain conditions on the completion of the merger and the bank merger that are burdensome, not
anticipated or cannot be met. If the consummation of the merger is delayed, including by a delay in receipt of
required regulatory approvals, the business, financial condition and results of operations of each company may
also be materially adversely affected. See “The Merger — Regulatory Approvals” and “The Merger Agreement 
— Conditions to Completion of the Merger.”

If the merger is not completed, then the parties will have incurred significant expenses without realizing the
expected benefits of the merger and could be subject to additional risks.

Prior to completion of the merger, each of Atlantic and Ameris will incur or have incurred substantial
expenses in connection with the completion of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. If the
merger is not completed, then Ameris and Atlantic would have to recognize these expenses without realizing the
anticipated benefits of the merger. Ameris or Atlantic also could be subject to litigation related to any failure to
complete the merger or to proceedings commenced by Ameris or Atlantic against the other seeking damages or to
compel the other to perform its obligations under the Merger Agreement. These factors and similar risks could
have an adverse effect on the results of operations, business and stock prices of Ameris and Atlantic.

The market price of Ameris common stock after the merger may be affected by factors different from those
affecting the shares of Ameris or Atlantic currently.

Upon completion of the merger, holders of Atlantic common stock will become holders of Ameris common
stock. Ameris’s business differs from that of Atlantic, and accordingly, the results of operations of Ameris will be
affected by some factors that are different from those currently affecting the results of operations of Atlantic. For
a discussion of the businesses of Ameris and Atlantic and of some important factors to consider in connection
with those businesses, see “Certain Documents Incorporated by Reference,” including, in particular, in the section
entitled “Risk Factors” in each of Ameris’s and Atlantic’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2016, and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2017.

Atlantic stockholders will not be entitled to dissenters’ or appraisal rights in the merger.

Dissenters’ or appraisal rights are statutory rights that, if applicable under law, enable stockholders to dissent
from an extraordinary transaction, such as a merger, and to demand that the corporation pay the fair value for
their shares as determined by a court in a judicial proceeding instead of receiving the consideration offered to
stockholders in connection with the extraordinary transaction. Under the Maryland law, holders of Atlantic
common stock do not have the right to dissent from the Merger Agreement and seek an appraisal in connection
with the merger.

If the Atlantic merger and the Hamilton merger were to occur, the pro forma combined company would exceed
$10 billion in assets, which would result in increased costs and/or reduced revenues to the resulting entity and
subject it to increased regulatory scrutiny by its primary federal regulators with respect to its risk management
and other activities.

It is currently expected that, if the Atlantic merger and the Hamilton merger were both completed, the
pro forma combined company would exceed $10 billion in assets, resulting in the company being subject to

TABLE OF CONTENTS

additional regulation and oversight that could impact its revenues and/or expenses. Such regulation and oversight
include becoming subject to: (i)  under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, annual
stress testing (or DFAST), designed to assess the company’s capital adequacy and risk management practices in
the event of certain economic downturn scenarios; (ii) the examination and enforcement authority of the
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau with respect to consumer and small business products and services;
(iii) deposit insurance premium assessments based on an FDIC scorecard based on, among other things, Ameris
Bank’s CAMELS rating and results of asset-related stress testing and funding-related stress testing; and (iv) a cap
on interchange transaction fees for debit cards, as required by Federal Reserve regulations, which will
significantly reduce Ameris’s interchange revenue after the mergers. It is difficult to predict the overall
compliance cost of these provisions, which will become effective (with a phase-in period) when the combined
company surpasses $10 billion in consolidated assets as a result of the Atlantic merger and the Hamilton merger.
However, compliance with these provisions will likely require additional staffing, engagement of external
consultants and other operating costs that could have a material adverse effect on the future financial condition
and results of operations of the combined company.

There is no assurance that Ameris will complete the Hamilton merger.

The Hamilton merger is subject to customary conditions to closing, including the receipt of required
regulatory approvals and the approval of the Hamilton shareholders. If any conditions to the Hamilton merger are
not satisfied or waived, to the extent permitted by law, then the Hamilton merger will not be completed. In
addition, Ameris and Hamilton may terminate the Hamilton Merger Agreement under certain circumstances even
if it is approved by the Hamilton shareholders. If Ameris and Hamilton do not complete the Hamilton merger,
then Ameris would not realize any of the expected benefits of having completed the Hamilton merger. There is no
assurance that the Hamilton merger will be consummated, or if it is, the timing for its completion.

longer than anticipated to be realized;

• disruption caused by the merger with customers, suppliers or employees or other business relationships;

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

This proxy statement/prospectus, including information included in, or incorporated by reference into, this
proxy statement/prospectus, may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities
Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements include: (i) statements about the benefits of the
merger, including future financial and operating results and cost savings that may be realized from the merger;
(ii) statements about our respective plans, objectives, expectations and intentions and other statements that are not
historical facts; and (iii) other statements identified by words such as “expects,” “anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,”
“believes,” “seeks,” “estimates” or words of similar meaning. You should note that the discussion of the reasons
for the merger contain many forward-looking statements that describe beliefs, assumptions, expectations and
estimates of the board of directors or management of Ameris and Atlantic as of the indicated dates, and those
assumptions, expectations and estimates may have changed as of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus.
Forward-looking statements are based on current beliefs and expectations of management of Ameris and Atlantic,
and are inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies,
many of which are beyond the control of Ameris and Atlantic. In addition, these forward-looking statements are
subject to assumptions with respect to future business strategies and decisions that are subject to change.
Therefore, actual results may differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, the forward-looking
statements.

The ability to predict results or the actual effects of the combined company’s plans and strategies is
inherently uncertain. Some of the factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those
contemplated by the forward-looking statements include those identified under “Risk Factors” and the following:

Additional factors that may cause actual results or earnings to differ materially from those contemplated by
the forward-looking statements include those discussed in the filings of Ameris and Atlantic with the SEC that
are incorporated by reference into this proxy statement/prospectus. See “Where You Can Find More Information”
and “Certain Documents Incorporated by Reference.”

Because these forward-looking statements are subject to assumptions and uncertainties, Ameris’s and
Atlantic’s actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking
statements. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these statements, which speak only as of the date of
this proxy statement/prospectus or the date of any document incorporated by reference into this proxy
statement/prospectus.

All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements concerning the merger or other matters
addressed in this proxy statement/prospectus, and attributable to Ameris or Atlantic or any person acting on their
behalf, are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this
“Cautionary Statements Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.” Ameris and Atlantic undertake no obligation
to update these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this proxy
statement/prospectus or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events, unless obligated to do so under the

UNAUDITED COMPARATIVE PER COMMON SHARE DATA

The following table shows per common share data regarding basic and diluted net income, cash dividends
and book value for Ameris and Atlantic on a historical basis, Ameris and Atlantic on a pro forma combined basis,
and Atlantic on a pro forma equivalent basis. The pro forma information has been derived from and should be
read in conjunction with: (i) Ameris’s audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included
in Ameris’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, and Ameris’s unaudited
consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Ameris’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q
for the quarter ended September 30, 2017, both of which are incorporated by reference into this proxy
statement/prospectus; and (ii) Atlantic’s audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes
included in Atlantic’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, and Atlantic’s
unaudited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Atlantic’s Quarterly Report on
Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2017, both of which are incorporated by reference into this proxy
statement/prospectus. See “Where You Can Find More Information” and “Certain Documents Incorporated by
Reference.”

The pro forma information gives effect to the merger accounted for as a purchase and assumes that the
merger occurred as of the beginning of the fiscal year presented (or in the case of book value, as of the date
specified). This information is presented for illustrative purposes only. You should not rely on the pro forma
combined or pro forma equivalent amounts as they are not necessarily indicative of the operating results or
financial position that would have occurred if the merger had been completed as of the dates indicated, nor are
they necessarily indicative of the future operating results or financial position of the combined company. The
pro forma information, although helpful in illustrating the financial characteristics of the combined company
under one set of assumptions, does not reflect the benefits of expected cost savings, opportunities to earn
additional revenue, the impact of restructuring and merger-related costs, or other factors that may result as a
consequence of the merger and, accordingly, does not attempt to predict or suggest future results.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INFORMATION ABOUT THE SPECIAL MEETING

This section contains information for Atlantic stockholders about the special meeting that Atlantic has called
to allow stockholders to vote on the merger proposal, the merger-related compensation proposal and the
adjournment proposal. The board of directors of Atlantic is mailing this proxy statement/prospectus to you, as an
Atlantic stockholder, on or about February 20, 2018.

Time, Date and Place

The special meeting is scheduled to be held on March 21, 2018, at 10:00 a.m., local time, at the Jacksonville
Marriott, 4670 Salisbury Road, Jacksonville, FL 32256.

Matters to be Considered by Atlantic Stockholders at the Special Meeting

At the special meeting, holders of Atlantic common stock will be asked to:

At this time, the board of directors of Atlantic is unaware of any other matters that may be presented for
action at the special meeting. If any other matters are properly presented, however, and you have previously
voted, the person(s) named as proxy will have the authority to vote your shares in accordance with his or her
judgment with respect to such matters.

A copy of the Merger Agreement is included in this proxy statement/prospectus as Appendix A, and we
encourage you to read it carefully in its entirety.

Recommendation of the board of directors of Atlantic

The board of directors of Atlantic unanimously recommends that Atlantic stockholders vote “FOR” the
merger proposal, “FOR” the merger-related compensation proposal and “FOR” the adjournment proposal. See
“The Merger — Atlantic’s Reasons for the Merger and the Recommendation of the Atlantic Board of Directors.”

Record Date and Quorum

February 12, 2018 has been fixed as the record date for the determination of Atlantic stockholders entitled to
notice of, and to vote at, the special meeting and any adjournment or postponement thereof. At the close of
business on the record date, there were 15,553,709 shares of Atlantic common stock outstanding and entitled to
vote at the special meeting.

A quorum is necessary to transact business at the special meeting. The presence, in person or by proxy, of
the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Atlantic common stock entitled to vote at the special
meeting is necessary to constitute a quorum. Shares of Atlantic common stock represented at the special meeting
but not voted, including shares that a stockholder abstains from voting and shares held in “street name” and voted
by a bank, broker or other nominee even though a stockholder does not provide voting instructions, will be
counted for establishing a quorum. Once a share of Atlantic common stock is represented at the special meeting,
it will be counted for determining a quorum not only at the special meeting but also at any adjournment or
postponement of the special meeting. In the event that a quorum is not present at the special meeting, it is
expected that the special meeting will be adjourned or postponed.

Required Vote

Each share of Atlantic common stock you own as of the record date for the special meeting entitles you to
one vote at the special meeting on all matters properly presented at the meeting. The affirmative vote of the
holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Atlantic common stock entitled to vote at the special meeting is
necessary to approve the merger proposal. If you vote to abstain or if you fail to vote, then this will have the same
effect as voting against the merger proposal.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Approval of the non-binding merger-related compensation proposal and the adjournment proposal each
require the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of Atlantic common stock represented in
person or by proxy at the special meeting. Not voting or abstaining on either of these proposals will have no
effect on the outcome of the vote on these proposals.

Shares Subject to the Voting Agreement; Shares Held by Directors and Executive Officers

As of the record date, the directors and certain executive officers of Atlantic beneficially owned and were
entitled to vote approximately 1,702,982 shares of Atlantic common stock representing approximately 10.9% of
the shares of Atlantic common stock outstanding on that date. Ameris has entered into a Voting Agreement with
Atlantic and the directors and certain executive officers of Atlantic, pursuant to which these stockholders have
agreed, solely in their capacity as Atlantic stockholders, to vote their shares of Atlantic common stock in favor of
the merger proposal and the adjournment proposal, subject to certain exceptions. See “The Merger Agreement — 
Voting Agreement.” A copy of the Voting Agreement is included as Appendix B in this proxy
statement/prospectus.

How to Vote — Stockholders of Record

Voting in Person.   If you are a stockholder of record, then you can vote in person by submitting a ballot at
the special meeting. Nevertheless, we recommend that you vote by proxy as promptly as possible, even if you
plan to attend the special meeting. This will ensure that your vote is received. If you attend the special meeting,
then you may vote by ballot, thereby canceling any proxy previously submitted.

Voting by Proxy.   Your proxy card includes instructions on how to vote by mailing in the proxy card. If you
choose to vote by proxy, please mark each proxy card you receive, sign and date it, and promptly return it in the
envelope enclosed with the proxy card. If you sign and return your proxy without instruction on how to vote your
shares, then your shares will be voted “FOR” the merger proposal, “FOR” the merger-related compensation
proposal and “FOR” the adjournment proposal.

How to Vote — Shares Held in “Street Name”

If your shares of Atlantic common stock are held through a bank, broker or other nominee, then you are
considered the beneficial owner of such shares held in “street name.” In such case, this proxy
statement/prospectus has been forwarded to you by your bank, broker or other nominee. As the beneficial owner,
you have the right to direct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote the shares by following the voting
instructions that they have sent. Without specific instructions from you, your bank, broker or other nominee is not
empowered to vote your shares. Not voting these shares will have the effect of voting against the merger proposal
but will have no effect on the outcome of the merger-related compensation proposal or the adjournment proposal.
Alternatively, if you are a beneficial owner and wish to vote in person at the special meeting, then you must
provide a proxy executed in your favor by your bank, broker or other nominee.

How to Vote — Shares Held in the Atlantic ESOP

Participants in the Atlantic ESOP will each receive a Voting Instruction Form that reflects all of the shares
that the participant may direct the Atlantic ESOP trustee to vote on his or her behalf under the plan. Under the
terms of the Atlantic ESOP, the Atlantic ESOP trustee votes all shares held by the Atlantic ESOP, but each
Atlantic ESOP participant may direct the trustee how to vote the shares of Atlantic common stock allocated to his
or her account. The Atlantic ESOP trustee will vote all unallocated shares of Atlantic common stock held by the
Atlantic ESOP and allocated shares for which no voting instructions are received in the same proportion as shares
for which it has received timely voting instructions.

The deadline for returning your Atlantic ESOP Voting Instruction Form is March 14, 2018, at 5:00 p.m.,
Eastern Time.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Revocation of Proxies
You can revoke your proxy at any time before your shares are voted. If you are a stockholder of record, then

you can revoke your proxy by:

Attendance at the special meeting will not, in and of itself, constitute revocation of a proxy.
If you hold your shares in street name with a bank, broker or other nominee, then you must follow the

directions you receive from your bank, broker or other nominee to change your vote. Your last vote will be the
vote that is counted.

Solicitation of Proxies

The proxy for the special meeting is being solicited on behalf of the board of directors of Atlantic. Atlantic
will bear the entire cost of soliciting proxies. All other costs and expenses incurred in connection with the merger
and the transactions contemplated thereby are to be paid by the party incurring such expenses. See “The Merger
Agreement — Expenses.”

Proxies will be solicited principally by mail, but may also be solicited by the directors, officers, and other
employees of Atlantic in person or by telephone, facsimile or other means of electronic communication.
Directors, officers and employees will receive no compensation for these activities in addition to their regular
compensation, but may be reimbursed for out-of-pocket expenses in connection with such solicitation.

Attending the Special Meeting

All holders of Atlantic common stock, including stockholders of record and stockholders who hold their
shares in street name through banks, brokers or other nominees, are cordially invited to attend the special
meeting. You must bring a form of personal photo identification with you in order to be admitted at the special
meeting. We reserve the right to refuse admittance to anyone without proper proof of share ownership or without
proper photo identification. The use of cell phones, cameras, sound recording equipment, communications
devices or any similar equipment during the special meeting without Atlantic’s express written consent is
prohibited.

Adjournments and Postponements

Although it is not currently expected, the special meeting may be adjourned or postponed, including to
solicit additional proxies, if there are insufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the merger
proposal, or if a quorum is not present at the special meeting. Other than an announcement to be made at the
special meeting of the time, date and place of an adjourned meeting, an adjournment generally may be made
without notice. Any adjournment or postponement of the special meeting to solicit additional proxies will allow
the stockholders who have already sent in their proxies to revoke them at any time prior to their use at the special
meeting as adjourned or postponed.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PROPOSALS FOR THE SPECIAL MEETING

Proposal 1: Approval of the Merger Proposal

Holders of Atlantic common stock are being asked to approve the Merger Agreement, pursuant to which
Atlantic will merge with and into Ameris with Ameris as the surviving company. Approval of the merger
proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of Atlantic common stock
outstanding on the record date.

If your shares of Atlantic common stock are present at the special meeting but are not voted on the merger
proposal, or if you vote to abstain on the merger proposal, then it will have the same effect as a vote against the
merger proposal. If you fail to submit a proxy, or if your shares of Atlantic common stock are held through a
bank, broker or other nominee and you do not instruct your bank, broker or other nominee to vote your shares of
Atlantic common stock, then your shares of Atlantic common stock will not be voted, and it will have the same
effect as a vote against the merger proposal.

The board of directors of Atlantic unanimously recommends that Atlantic stockholders vote “FOR”
the merger proposal.

Proposal 2: Approval, on a Non-binding Advisory Basis, of the Merger-Related Compensation Proposal

Atlantic stockholders are being asked to approve, on a non-binding advisory basis, the compensation that
certain executive officers of Atlantic (“named executive officers”) will receive under existing agreements with
Atlantic in connection with the merger.

Section 951 of the Dodd-Frank Act and Rule 14a-21(c) under the Exchange Act require that Atlantic seek a
non-binding advisory vote from Atlantic stockholders to approve certain compensation that its named executive
officers will receive from Atlantic in connection with the merger.

Atlantic is presenting this proposal, which gives Atlantic stockholders the opportunity to express their views
on the merger-related compensation by voting “FOR” or “AGAINST” the following resolution:

“RESOLVED, that the compensation that will become payable to Atlantic’s named executive officers
in connection with the completion of the merger, as disclosed under “The Merger — Interests of Atlantic
Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger” and the related tables and narrative, is hereby approved.”

Approval, on a non-binding advisory basis, of the merger-related compensation proposal requires the
affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of Atlantic common stock represented in person or by
proxy at the special meeting.

If your shares of Atlantic common stock are present at the special meeting but are not voted on the proposal,
or if you vote to abstain on the proposal, then it will have no effect on the outcome of the vote on the merger-
related compensation proposal. If you fail to submit a proxy, or if your shares of Atlantic common stock are held
through a bank, broker or other nominee and you do not instruct your bank, broker or other nominee to vote your
shares of Atlantic common stock, then your shares of Atlantic common stock will not be voted.

Atlantic stockholder approval of the compensation payable to Atlantic’s named executive officers in
connection with the merger is not a condition to completion of the merger. The vote on the merger-related
compensation proposal is advisory and will not be binding on Atlantic (or the combined company that results
from the merger) regardless of whether the merger is approved. Accordingly, because the compensation to be
paid to Atlantic’s named executive officers in connection with the merger is contractual, the compensation will be
payable if the merger is completed regardless of the outcome of the non-binding, advisory vote on the merger-
related compensation proposal.

The board of directors of Atlantic unanimously recommends that Atlantic stockholders vote in favor
of the merger-related compensation arrangements described in this proxy statement/prospectus by voting
“FOR” the merger-related compensation proposal.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Proposal 3: Approval of the Adjournment Proposal

Atlantic stockholders are being asked to grant authority to proxy holders to vote in favor of one or more
adjournments or postponements of the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if
there are insufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the merger proposal.

If this proposal is approved, then the special meeting could be successively adjourned to any date. A vote on
adjournment of the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are
insufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the merger proposal may be taken in the absence
of a quorum. Atlantic does not currently intend to propose adjournment of the special meeting if there are
sufficient votes to approve the merger proposal. If approval of the adjournment proposal is submitted to the
Atlantic stockholders for approval, then the approval requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of
the shares of Atlantic common stock represented in person or by proxy at the special meeting.

If your shares of Atlantic common stock are present at the special meeting but are not voted on the
adjournment proposal, or if you vote to abstain on the adjournment proposal, then it will have no effect on the
outcome of the vote on the adjournment proposal. If you fail to submit a proxy, or if your shares of Atlantic
common stock are held through a bank, broker or other nominee and you do not instruct your bank, broker or
other nominee to vote your shares of Atlantic common stock, then your shares of Atlantic common stock will not
be voted, which will have no effect on the outcome of the vote on the adjournment proposal.

The board of directors of Atlantic unanimously recommends that Atlantic stockholders vote “FOR”
the adjournment proposal.

THE COMPANIES

Ameris Bancorp
Ameris Bancorp, a Georgia corporation incorporated in 1980, is a bank holding company headquartered in

Moultrie, Georgia. The Ameris common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol
“ABCB.” Ameris’s principal executive offices are located at 310 First Street, S.E., Moultrie, Georgia 31768, and
its telephone number is (229) 890-1111. Its website is www.amerisbank.com. The information on Ameris’s
website is not part of this proxy statement/prospectus, and the reference to Ameris’s website address does not
constitute incorporation by reference of any information on that website into this proxy statement/prospectus.

Ameris’s business is conducted primarily through Ameris Bank, a Georgia state-chartered bank and a wholly
owned subsidiary. At September 30, 2017, Ameris had total consolidated assets of $7.6 billion, total loans (net of
allowance for loan losses) of  $5.9 billion, total deposits of   $5.9 billion and shareholders’ equity of 
$801.9 million.

Through Ameris Bank, Ameris provides a full range of banking services to its retail and commercial
customers through 97 branches primarily concentrated in select markets in Georgia, Alabama, Northern Florida
and South Carolina. These branches serve distinct communities in Ameris’s business areas with autonomy but do
so as one bank, leveraging Ameris’s favorable geographic footprint in an effort to acquire more customers.

Ameris’s business model capitalizes on the efficiencies of a large financial services company while still
providing the community with the personalized banking service expected by its customers. As a bank holding
company, Ameris performs certain shareholder and investor relations functions and seeks to provide financial
support, if necessary, to Ameris Bank. Ameris Bank is managed through a balance of decentralized management
responsibilities and efficient centralized operating systems, products and loan underwriting standards. The
Ameris board of directors and senior managers establish corporate policy, strategy and administrative policies.
Within Ameris’s established guidelines and policies, the banker closest to the customer responds to the differing
needs and demands of his or her unique market.

Throughout Ameris’s history, the strategy has been focused on growing its franchise in its historical markets
and in select new markets that Ameris has entered through acquisitions. Ameris believes that this strategy has
resulted in a consistent record of strong growth over an extended period of time, as Ameris has grown from
$2.1 billion in total assets at December 31, 2007 to $7.6 billion in total assets at September 30, 2017.

On December 11, 2017, the FDIC terminated, effectively immediately, the Consent Order it issued to
Ameris Bank on December 16, 2016 (the “Consent Order”). The Consent Order was associated with certain
deficiencies in Ameris Bank’s Anti-Money Laundering and Bank Secrecy Act compliance program that arose out
of regulatory examinations conducted in 2016.

For a complete description of Ameris’s business, financial condition, results of operations and other
important information, please refer to Ameris’s filings with the SEC that are incorporated by reference into this
proxy statement/prospectus, including its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016,
and its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2017. See “Certain Documents
Incorporated By Reference.”

Pending Acquisition of Hamilton State Bancshares, Inc.
On January 25, 2018, Ameris and Hamilton entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger pursuant to

which Hamilton will merge into Ameris, with Ameris as the surviving entity. The Hamilton Merger Agreement
provides that, immediately following the Hamilton merger, Hamilton State Bank, a Georgia bank wholly owned
by Hamilton, will be merged into Ameris Bank, with Ameris Bank as the surviving bank (the “Hamilton bank
merger”).

Under the terms and subject to the conditions of the Hamilton Merger Agreement, Hamilton shareholders
will receive $0.93 in cash and 0.16 shares of Ameris common stock for each share of Hamilton common stock
that they hold, which equates to an aggregate value of approximately $405.7 million based on the $53.45 closing
price of Ameris common stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market as of January 25, 2018.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

The Hamilton Merger Agreement provides that at the effective time of the Hamilton merger, Hamilton’s
outstanding restricted stock units, to the extent then vested, will be converted into the right to receive the same
consideration per share in the Hamilton merger as the outstanding shares of Hamilton common stock. The
Hamilton Merger Agreement further provides that at the effective time of the Hamilton merger, Hamilton’s
outstanding stock options will fully vest and be cancelled and thereafter entitle the holders thereof to receive cash
consideration of  $9.06 for each share of Hamilton common stock issuable upon exercise of such options, less the
applicable per share exercise price of such options. Under the Hamilton Merger Agreement, the outstanding
warrants to acquire shares of Hamilton common stock will be also cancelled at the effective time of the Hamilton
merger, entitling the holders thereof to receive cash consideration of  $9.06 for each share of Hamilton common
stock issuable upon exercise of such warrants, less the applicable per share exercise price of such warrants.

The Hamilton Merger Agreement has been unanimously approved by the boards of directors of each of
Ameris and Hamilton and is expected to close in the third quarter of 2018. The closing of the Hamilton merger is
subject to the required approval of Hamilton shareholders, requisite regulatory approvals, the effectiveness of the
registration statement to be filed by Ameris with respect to the shares of Ameris common stock to be issued in the
Hamilton merger and other customary closing conditions.

The Hamilton Merger Agreement may be terminated in certain circumstances, including the following:
(i) by mutual written agreement of the parties; (ii) by either party in the event that, under certain circumstances,
the Hamilton merger shall not have been consummated by December 31, 2018; (iii) by either party in the event of
a breach by the other party of any representation, warranty or obligation contained in the Hamilton Merger
Agreement which has not been cured within thirty days and which breach would be reasonably likely to result in
a failure to satisfy any applicable closing condition; (iv) by either party if final action has been taken by a
regulatory agency whose approval is required for the Hamilton merger or the Hamilton bank merger, which final
action has become final and nonappealable and does not approve the Hamilton merger or the Hamilton bank
merger, or a governmental authority enacts a law or judgment which would make the Hamilton merger or the
Hamilton bank merger illegal; (v) by either party if the requisite Hamilton shareholder approval is not obtained;
(vi) by Ameris if the Hamilton board of directors fails to make recommendation to the Hamilton shareholders to
approve the Hamilton Merger Agreement, or Hamilton has materially breached its covenant not to solicit
alternative acquisition proposals; (vii) by Hamilton, prior to Hamilton shareholder approval, to enter into an
agreement relating to a superior proposal; or (viii) by Hamilton in the event that the price of Ameris common
stock decreases in comparison to the specified ratio provided in the Hamilton Merger Agreement and Ameris
elects not to increase the merger consideration to be received by the Hamilton shareholders. Upon termination of
the Hamilton Merger Agreement by Hamilton to enter into a superior proposal or by Ameris where the Hamilton
board of directors fails to make recommendation to the Hamilton shareholders to approve the Hamilton Merger
Agreement or Hamilton has materially breached its covenant not to solicit alternative acquisition proposals,
Hamilton will be required to pay Ameris a termination fee equal to $14.0 million.

In addition, if the Hamilton Merger Agreement is terminated due to a failure to obtain any regulatory
approval that is required for the consummation of the Hamilton merger or the Hamilton bank merger (provided
that such failure is not primarily related to the financial or regulatory condition of Hamilton) or due to a failure by
Ameris to satisfy any condition contained in any required regulatory approval, then Ameris will be required to
pay Hamilton $1.5 million as reimbursement for its transaction expenses.

consolidated assets of  $921.9 million, total loans (net of allowance for loan losses) of   $785.5 million, total
deposits of  $676.4 million and shareholders’ equity of  $91.4 million.

Atlantic Coast Bank was established in 1939 as a credit union serving the employees of the Atlantic Coast
Line Railroad. On November 1, 2000, Atlantic Coast Federal Credit Union converted to a federal mutual savings
bank (and subsequently a federally-chartered savings bank). The conversion allowed Atlantic Coast Bank to
diversify its customer base by marketing products and services to individuals and businesses in its market areas
and make loans to customers who did not have a deposit relationship with the bank. On December 27, 2016,
Atlantic Coast Bank consummated the conversion of its charter from that of a federally-chartered savings bank to
that of a Florida state-chartered commercial bank supervised by the Florida Office of Financial Regulation and
the FDIC.

Atlantic Coast Bank offers a variety of deposit accounts having a wide range of interest rates and terms,
which generally include noninterest-bearing and interest-bearing demand, savings and money market demand,
and time deposit accounts with terms ranging from three months to five years. Deposits are primarily solicited in
the bank’s market areas in Northeast Florida and Southeast Georgia to fund loan demand and other liquidity
needs; however, late in 2015, the bank also started soliciting deposits in Central Florida. Those funds are
primarily invested in loans, including commercial real estate loans, consumer loans, first mortgages on owner-
occupied one- to four-family residences, and home equity loans. Additionally, the bank invests funds in multi-
family residential loans, commercial business loans, and commercial and residential construction loans. The bank
also invests funds in investment securities, primarily those issued by U.S. government-sponsored agencies or
entities, including Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae.

Revenues are derived principally from interest on loans and other interest-earning assets, such as investment
securities, as well as from gains on the sale of loans. To a lesser extent, revenue is generated from service charges
and other income sources.

important information, please refer to Atlantic’s filings with the SEC that are incorporated by reference into this

THE MERGER

Background of the Merger

The board of directors of Atlantic has, on a regular basis, considered and deliberated over Atlantic’s long-
term objectives and strategies, including how Atlantic could increase stockholder value in light of economic,
regulatory and competitive factors, and strategies to enhance the profitability of Atlantic Coast Bank by
diversifying its asset portfolio and revenue streams. The deliberations of the board of directors have also taken
into consideration the possibility of engaging in a merger or acquisition transaction, as a buyer, a seller or a
participant in a “merger-of-equals.”

As a part of its deliberation process, the board of directors of Atlantic held a retreat on October 19 and 20,
2016. At this retreat, management of Atlantic presented its forecast for the remainder of 2016 and 2017, along
with a proposed strategic plan. The board of directors and management engaged in a lengthy discussion of
Atlantic’s liquidity needs to support projected loan growth and market conditions, as well as the associated risks
of effectively executing the strategic plan. On the second day of the retreat, representatives of Hovde made a
presentation regarding market conditions and Atlantic’s strategic options. The board of directors reviewed those
options and discussed different alternatives to achieve its objectives. John K. Stephens, Jr., President and Chief
Executive Officer of Atlantic and Atlantic Coast Bank, was instructed to reach out to potential “merger-of-
equals” partners and report his findings to Jay S. Sidhu, Vice Chairman of the board of directors.

From October 24 to November 3, 2016, Mr. Stephens contacted three Florida-based potential financial
institution partners and one out-of-state potential financial institution partner. None expressed any serious interest
in pursuing a “merger-of-equals” transaction. During this exploratory process, Mr. Stephens also contacted the
investment banking firm B. Riley FBR, Inc. (“FBR”) to discuss FBR’s perspective on acquisition market
conditions and prospective pricing. On November 6, 2016, Messrs. Stephens and Sidhu met to discuss
Mr. Stephens’s findings to determine what steps the board of directors of Atlantic should be considering.

On December 2 and 3, 2016, Messrs. Stephens and Sidhu met with representatives of FBR and discussed
market conditions, potential partners, pricing and different strategies to enhance Atlantic’s marketability. On
December 18, 2016, Messrs. Stephens and Sidhu, and John J. Dolan, Chairman of the board of directors of
Atlantic, as the Strategic Committee of the board of directors, met to discuss which investment banks might be
well suited to assist in analyzing options for Atlantic. The Strategic Committee recommended to the board of
directors that Atlantic retain FBR to market Atlantic for sale. That same day, the board of directors approved the
hiring of FBR for that purpose.

From December 21, 2016 to January 30, 2017, FBR and Atlantic’s management populated a due diligence
data room and drafted a confidential information memorandum to be used in marketing Atlantic. During that
period, Mr. Stephens also met with representatives of three Florida-based banks and one out-of-state bank that he
had not contacted earlier in 2016. At the January 23, 2017 meeting of the board of directors of Atlantic,
Mr. Stephens provided an update on his meetings and discussed progress on the confidential information
memorandum.

On January 30, 2017, FBR began marketing Atlantic to a number of in-state and out-of-state financial
institutions that had been active in acquisitions in the Florida market. As part of this process, the confidential
information memorandum and non-disclosure agreements were distributed with the request that recipients of the
confidential information memorandum provide an indication of their interest by March 1, 2017.

On February 15 and March 4, 2017, the board of directors of Atlantic met to discuss the status and progress
of the marketing process. FBR reported at each meeting that it had not received any viable indication of interest
from the list of potential acquirers. On March 10, 2017, the board of directors concluded that the marketing
process, and Atlantic’s engagement with FBR, should be terminated. As part of the termination of FBR’s
engagement, Atlantic and FBR agreed that FBR would be paid a reduced fee if a merger transaction was
consummated during the original term of FBR’s engagement.

On March 20, 2017, the board of directors of Atlantic met with representatives of Hovde, who presented an
update of market conditions and a review of current transactions in Florida. On March 24,

TABLE OF CONTENTS

2017, Mr. Stephens met again with a representative of one of the Florida-based institutions he had met with in
January 2017. On March 25, 2017, Mr. Stephens advised the board of directors that, based on his subsequent
discussions, he concluded that a “merger-of equals” transaction was unlikely to be successful. The board of
directors agreed with Mr. Stephens’ conclusion and discussed other strategic alternatives. One of those
alternatives was a possible strategic alignment with a potential spin-off of a deposit gathering subsidiary from
Customers Bancorp, Inc. Due to their affiliations with Customers Bancorp, Inc. and its subsidiary, Messrs. Sidhu
and Dolan recused themselves from any consideration of such a transaction.

Between April and June 2017, management and the board of directors of Atlantic evaluated the deposit
subsidiary alternative with input from Atlantic’s legal counsel, Igler and Pearlman, P.A (“Igler”) and the
investment banking firm, UBS AG. After a thorough evaluation of the merits of such a transaction and the fact
that the deposit subsidiary was still under contract with another financial institution, the board of directors
concluded that the regulatory, operational and economic risks associated with such a transaction made the
possibility of successful execution too remote for Atlantic to undertake the acquisition.

During that period, the board of directors of Atlantic continued to consider other alternatives. On May 10,
2017, Mr. Stephens met again with representatives of Hovde to discuss the prior marketing attempt, current
market conditions and the potential of Ameris being an interested acquiror. Following Atlantic’s annual meeting
of stockholders held on May 22, 2017, the board of directors met and again discussed Atlantic’s strategic plans
and alternatives.

At the Florida Bankers Association conference held during the week of June 11, 2017, Mr. Stephens met
with management representatives of a number of acquisition-minded financial institutions, including Ameris.
During such meetings, there was more interest in a transaction with Atlantic than Atlantic’s earlier efforts had
elicited. On July 7, 2017, Atlantic formally engaged Hovde to market the company for sale. On July 13, 2017,
Atlantic entered into a non-disclosure agreement with Ameris, thereby enabling its representatives to begin a due
diligence review of Atlantic. On July 24, 2017, Ameris contacted Mr. Stephens to advise that Ameris had an
interest in a possible acquisition. The Strategic Committee of the board of directors of Atlantic met the same day
and agreed to further explore the possibility of a merger transaction. The next day, the Strategic Committee met
with the board of directors to present Ameris’s interest in Atlantic. The board of directors instructed management
to continue the discussions with Ameris.

On August 4, 2017, Ameris submitted a draft letter of intent to Atlantic, which contemplated the merger
consideration to consist solely of Ameris common stock based on a valuation of Atlantic common stock at $10.00
per share. On August 7, 2017, the Strategic Committee of the board of directors of Atlantic and a representative
of Hovde met to discuss the letter of intent. The Strategic Committee instructed Hovde to make a counteroffer of 
$10.50 per share, with 15% of the consideration to be paid in cash.

On August 9, 2017, Ameris provided a new draft letter of intent to Atlantic. Among other customary
provisions, the draft contemplated merger consideration of  $10.00 per share of Atlantic common stock to be paid
15% in cash and 85% in Ameris common stock, based on the ten-day average closing price prior to the signing of
a definitive agreement with respect to the merger. On the same day, the Strategic Committee and representatives
of Igler and Hovde discussed the merits of the letter of intent, as well as next steps. On August 11, 2017, the
Strategic Committee had a conference call with Edwin W. Hortman, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer of
Ameris, and Dennis J. Zember Jr., Executive Vice President, Chief Operating Officer and then-Chief Financial
Officer of Ameris, to further discuss the terms of a potential transaction. The following day, the Strategic
Committee presented the letter of intent to the board of directors of Atlantic, which unanimously voted to accept
its terms and move forward with due diligence and transaction negotiations. On August 14, 2017, Ameris
formally presented the letter of intent, which was executed by Mr. Stephens on behalf of Atlantic.

On August 16, 2017, Atlantic convened a due diligence working group, which met to discuss the members’
roles and responsibilities. On August 28, 2017, Atlantic engaged Saltmarsh, Cleaveland & Gund, P.A.
(“Saltmarsh”) to assist in a reverse due diligence review of Ameris.

On September 5, 2017, Mr. Stephens and Tracy L. Keegan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial
Officer of Atlantic, met with Mr. Zember and James LaHaise, Executive Vice President/

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Corporate Banking Executive of Ameris and Ameris Bank, to discuss preliminary due diligence findings and a
proposed adjustment to the purchase price. The following day, the Strategic Committee of the board of directors
of Atlantic and a representative of Hovde met to discuss the preliminary findings and to evaluate the proposed
adjustment to the purchase price. On September 8, 2017, Mr. Stephens and Ms. Keegan had a conference call
with Messrs. Zember and LaHaise in which the parties agreed to continue the due diligence process.

On September 15, 2017, Ameris communicated to Hovde that, as a result of Ameris’s due diligence, it was
offering merger consideration of  $9.27 per share of Atlantic common stock, with the cash portion to be fixed at
$1.37 per share. Ameris preliminarily committed to an exchange ratio of 0.17 shares of Ameris common stock
per share of Atlantic common stock.

On September 25, 2017, the board of directors and management of Atlantic, and representatives of Igler and
Hovde, met to discuss the status of the transaction and pricing issues. The pricing issues were being driven partly
by recent fluctuations in the market price of Ameris common stock and Atlantic’s recent performance. Based on
this discussion, the board of directors directed management and Hovde to continue negotiations with Ameris to
increase the purchase price per share.

On September 28, 2017, Ameris’s legal counsel provided a draft merger agreement to Igler so that the
parties could begin negotiating the specific terms thereof.

On October 3, 2017, Mr. Stephens, Ms. Keegan, other members of Atlantic’s due diligence working group
(including representatives of Igler and Saltmarsh) met with Mr. LaHaise and other members of Ameris’s
management to conclude Atlantic’s reverse due diligence of Ameris.

On October 18, 2017, the board of directors of Atlantic met with the members of the due diligence working
group. At this meeting, a representative of Hovde provided an update on the status of the Consent Order issued
by the FDIC to Ameris Bank. A representative of Igler followed such update by stating that it would be very
unlikely that the merger would receive regulatory approval while the Consent Order was in effect.

On October 23, 2017, the board of directors of Atlantic met with representatives of Saltmarsh, Hovde and
Igler to review Saltmarsh’s final reverse due diligence report. Saltmarsh’s representative explained the purpose
for the reverse due diligence review of a prospective acquirer. Saltmarsh’s representative also discussed the
Consent Order, Ameris’s financial condition, performance and general loan portfolio, and other operational and
regulatory matters. The board of directors also requested Saltmarsh to provide additional clarification on some of
the loan portfolio data that had been presented.

On November 7, 2017, the board of directors of Atlantic and representatives of Igler and Hovde met to
discuss whether Atlantic should consider entering into a merger agreement before the Consent Order was
terminated. Mr. Stephens stated that, after discussions with a representative of the FDIC, Mr. Stephens felt
relatively confident that the Consent Order would be lifted in the near term.

On November 11, 2017, a similar meeting was held to discuss pricing and the proposed merger agreement.
The board of directors of Atlantic also reviewed the terms of the proposed voting agreement and non-solicitation
agreements and concluded that they were reasonable and appropriate given the terms and structure of the merger.
A representative of Hovde distributed its presentation and opinion to the board of directors and others present.
Hovde’s representative described the financial terms of the merger and the termination fee. Hovde’s
representative presented a valuation analysis of the merger, first from a market approach and then from an income
approach, and explained in detail the assumptions used in both approaches and answered questions from the
board of directors. Hovde’s representative concluded the presentation by stating that, in the firm’s opinion, the
merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to Atlantic stockholders.

A representative of Igler then discussed the fiduciary duties of the board of directors of Atlantic and
provided a summary of the material terms of the proposed merger agreement. Igler’s representative explained that
the proposed merger agreement included all of the technical information regarding the merger and reviewed the
representations and warranties to be made by Atlantic and Ameris, the covenants

• the value of the consideration to be received by Atlantic stockholders relative to recent trading prices,
book value and earnings per share of Atlantic common stock, including the relationship between the
consideration and Atlantic’s book value and earnings per share, and the book value and earnings per
share of Ameris;

• information about Ameris and Atlantic, including the business and financial condition, results of
operations, earnings, business prospects and financial obligations, including financial obligations to be
incurred in connection with the merger;

TABLE OF CONTENTS

of both parties, the conditions to closing and the termination provisions. Igler’s representative discussed in detail
Atlantic’s commitment not to market itself, its right to terminate the merger agreement if it received a superior,
unsolicited offer and the material terms of the termination fee.

Igler’s representative also covered with the board of directors of Atlantic the other agreements that Atlantic’s
directors and executive officers would be required to enter into in connection with the merger. Igler’s
representative discussed the terms and conditions of the voting agreement and non-solicitation agreements and
concluded his presentation by answering questions from the board of directors.

After a thorough review and evaluation of the proposed terms of the merger and merger agreement, as well
as Saltmarsh’s report and the fairness opinion from Hovde, the board of directors of Atlantic concluded that the
merger was in the best interests of Atlantic stockholders. The board of directors asked Mr. Sidhu to contact
Ameris’s representatives to finalize the terms of the proposed merger agreement and to see if there was a
possibility of a price adjustment if the merger did not close as expected by June 30, 2018.

On November 15, 2017, while at a banking industry conference, Mr. Sidhu met with Mr. Zember to discuss
the merger. The representatives of Ameris and Atlantic reaffirmed the merger consideration terms as discussed on
September 17, 2017, but agreed to increase the merger consideration if the merger did not close by June 30, 2018.
In such case, if the parties agreed to continue with the merger transaction, then the merger consideration would be
increased by the amount of Atlantic’s net earnings for the first six months of 2018. These final revisions were
ultimately included in the Merger Agreement.

On November 16, 2017, the board of directors of Atlantic reconvened to discuss the information presented
on November 11, 2017, and the final merger consideration terms contained in the Merger Agreement. Hovde
issued its formal opinion, which was consistent with its November 11, 2017 presentation to the board of directors.
The board of directors discussed the issues regarding the merger transaction at length and concluded that the
merger was in the best interests of Atlantic stockholders. The board of directors unanimously agreed to approve
the merger and authorized management to execute and deliver the Merger Agreement and ancillary documents.
Later that day, Atlantic and Ameris executed and delivered the Merger Agreement and the ancillary documents.

Before the opening of the market on November 17, 2017, Ameris issued a press release announcing the
execution of the Merger Agreement.

Atlantic’s Reasons for the Merger and the Recommendation of the Atlantic Board of Directors

The board of directors of Atlantic believes that the merger presents an opportunity for Atlantic and its
stockholders to become part of a strong, $8.6 billion commercial bank, operating in Northern Florida and
Southern Georgia, among other Southeastern markets. The board of directors of Atlantic believes that the merger
will also afford Ameris the opportunity to expand its revenue sources, provide for earnings per share accretion
due to cost savings opportunities, and sustain its robust loan and deposit origination trends in currents markets
served by Ameris and Atlantic.

The terms of the merger, including the merger consideration, are the result of arm’s-length negotiations
between representatives of Atlantic and Ameris, including their respective financial, accounting and legal
advisors. In reaching its decision to approve the merger, the board of directors of Atlantic consulted with its
advisors regarding the terms of the transaction and with management. In approving and adopting the Merger
Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the board of directors of Atlantic
considered, among other things, the following material factors:

• the fact that a portion of the merger consideration will consist of shares of Ameris common stock,
which will allow Atlantic stockholders to participate in the future performance of Ameris’s business
and synergies resulting from the merger and have greater liquidity for their investment;

• the fact that a portion of the merger consideration will be paid in cash, which will serve as a hedge
against the possibility that the market price of the Ameris common stock may decrease after the
merger;

• the prospects of the successful execution of the proposed transactions;

• the financial terms of recent merger and acquisition transactions involving banks and bank holding
companies, particularly in Florida, and a comparison of the financial metrics of such transactions with
the terms of the proposed merger with Ameris;

• the alternatives to the merger, including Atlantic’s prospects as an independent financial institution;

• the need for additional capital to support Atlantic’s future growth and operations, including the
expenses associated with raising such capital and the terms on, and prices at, which Atlantic could
obtain such capital;

• the fact that the merger will be structured as a tax-free reorganization, providing certain tax benefits to
the extent that Atlantic stockholders receive Ameris common stock in the merger;

• Ameris’s history of successful integration of other acquired financial institutions;

• Ameris’s larger size, which should allow it to compete more effectively through broader product
offerings and a larger legal lending limit;

• the potential that Ameris will receive greater attention from investors and potential strategic partners or
acquirers due to its larger size;

• the opinion of Atlantic’s financial advisor that the merger consideration is fair, from a financial point of
view, to the Atlantic stockholders; and

• the fact that, if the closing of the merger has not occurred by June 30, 2018, then the merger
consideration will be increased by the amount of Atlantic’s after-tax net income subject to Ameris or
Atlantic electing to extend the term of the Merger Agreement.

• the possibility that Ameris would not be able to obtain the required regulatory approval for the merger
in a prompt fashion, or at all, due to the Consent Order;

• the potential diversion of management attention and resources from the operation of Atlantic’s business
towards the completion of the merger;

• the requirement that Atlantic conduct its business in the ordinary course and subject to certain
restrictions prior to the completion of the merger, which may delay or prevent Atlantic from exploiting
business opportunities that may arise pending completion of the merger;

• the potential for other delays in receiving required regulatory approvals and in obtaining an order of
effectiveness for the registration statement of which this proxy statement/prospectus forms a part;

• the possibility that the $5.75 million termination fee will discourage other parties that might be
interested in a transaction with Atlantic from proposing such a transaction; and

• the impact Atlantic’s merger-related costs will have on its earnings if the merger is not consummated.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

The board of directors of Atlantic considered all of these factors and risks as a whole and believes that the
opportunities created by the merger cause the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement to be in the best interests of Atlantic and its stockholders.

The foregoing discussion of the factors and risks that were considered is not exhaustive, but includes the
material factors and risks considered by the board of directors of Atlantic. In view of the wide variety of factors
and risks considered by the board of directors of Atlantic in connection with its evaluation of the merger and the
complexity of those matters, the board of directors of Atlantic did not consider it practical to, nor did it attempt
to, quantify, rank or otherwise assign relative weights to the specific factors that it considered in reaching its
decision.

The decision to enter into the Merger Agreement was unanimously approved by the board of directors of
Atlantic on November 11, 2017.

Opinion of Atlantic’s Financial Advisor

The fairness opinion and a summary of the underlying financial analyses of Atlantic’s financial advisor,
Hovde Group, LLC, are described below. As a basis for its opinion, Hovde reviewed, among other things, the
draft of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, between Ameris and Atlantic, dated November 10, 2017, provided to
Hovde by Atlantic (the “Agreement”). The description contains projections, estimates and other forward-looking
statements about the future earnings or other measures of the future performance of Atlantic. The projections
were based on numerous variables and assumptions, which are inherently uncertain, including factors related to
general economic and competitive conditions. Accordingly, actual results could vary significantly from those set
forth in the projections. You should not rely on any of these statements as having been made or adopted by
Atlantic or Ameris. The full text of Hovde’s written opinion is included in this proxy statement/prospectus as
Appendix C and is incorporated herein by reference. You are urged to read the opinion in its entirety for a
description of the procedures followed, assumptions made, matters considered and qualifications and limitations
on the review undertaken by Hovde. The summary of Hovde’s opinion included in this proxy statement/prospectus
is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such opinion.

On July 6, 2017, Atlantic engaged Hovde to act as its advisor in connection with the proposed merger.
Hovde is a nationally recognized investment banking firm with substantial experience in transactions similar to
the merger and is familiar with Atlantic and its operations. As part of its investment banking business, Hovde is
continually engaged in the valuation of businesses and their securities in connection with, among other things,
mergers and acquisitions. Hovde has experience in, and knowledge of, banks, thrifts and their respective holding
companies. The board of directors of Atlantic selected Hovde to act as its financial advisor in connection with the
merger on the basis of the firm’s reputation and expertise in merger transactions.

Hovde reviewed the financial aspects of the proposed merger with the board of directors of Atlantic and, on
November 15, 2017, delivered a written opinion to the board of directors of Atlantic that the merger consideration
to be received by the Atlantic stockholders in connection with the merger is fair to the Atlantic stockholders from
a financial point of view. In requesting Hovde’s advice and opinion, no limitations were imposed by Atlantic
upon Hovde with respect to the investigations made or procedures followed by it in rendering its opinion.
Hovde’s opinion was directed to the board of directors of Atlantic and addresses only the fairness of the merger
consideration to be paid to Atlantic stockholders in connection with the merger. Hovde did not opine on any
individual stock, cash or other components of consideration payable in connection with the merger. Hovde’s
opinion does not address the underlying business decision to proceed with the merger and does not constitute a
recommendation to any of the Atlantic stockholders as to how such stockholder should vote at any meetings of
Atlantic stockholders on the merger or any related matter. Other than as specifically set forth in the opinion,
Hovde does not express any opinion with respect to the terms and provisions of the Agreement or the
enforceability of any such terms or provisions.

As part of its engagement, Hovde has received from Atlantic and Atlantic Coast Bank a fairness opinion fee
upon the delivery of the fairness opinion to the board of directors of Atlantic. Additionally, Hovde will receive a
completion fee that is contingent upon the consummation of the merger. The opinion fee will be credited in full
towards the portion of the completion fee which will become payable to Hovde

TABLE OF CONTENTS

upon the consummation of the merger. In addition to Hovde’s fees, and regardless of whether the merger is
consummated, Atlantic and Atlantic Coast Bank have agreed to reimburse Hovde for certain of its reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses. Atlantic and Atlantic Coast Bank have also agreed to indemnify Hovde and its affiliates
for certain liabilities that may arise out of the engagement. In the past two years, Hovde has not provided
investment banking or financial advisory services to Atlantic. During the past three years preceding the date of its
opinion, Hovde has provided investment banking services to, and received fees from, two banks in connection
with their respective sales to Ameris. During the past two years preceding the date of its opinion, Hovde has not
provided any investment banking or financial advisory services to Ameris. Hovde or its affiliates may presently
or in the future seek or receive compensation from Ameris in connection with future transactions, or in
connection with potential advisory services and corporate transactions, although to Hovde’s knowledge none are
expected at this time. In the ordinary course of its business as a broker/dealer, Hovde may from time to time
purchase securities from, and sell securities to, Atlantic or Ameris or their affiliates, and as a market maker in
securities, Hovde may from time to time have a long or short position in, and buy or sell, debt or equity securities
of Atlantic or Ameris for its own accounts and for the accounts of its customers. Except for the foregoing, during
the past two years there have not been, and there currently are no mutual understandings contemplating in the
future, any material relationships between Hovde and Atlantic or Ameris.

Pursuant and subject to the terms of the Agreement, at the effective time, each share of Atlantic common
stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time (other than treasury stock and certain shares
which are cancelled in accordance with the terms of the Agreement and as discussed under “The Merger
Agreement — The Merger Consideration”), shall be converted, in accordance with the terms of the Agreement,
into the right to receive the following consideration: (i) an amount of cash equal to $1.39, without interest; and
(ii) 0.17 validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of Ameris common stock, together with cash in lieu
of any fractional shares in accordance with the Agreement.

Pursuant to the Agreement, each Atlantic stock option, whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding as of
immediately prior to the effective time, shall become fully vested and shall be cancelled and converted
automatically into the right to receive a cash payment from Ameris or Ameris Bank in an amount equal to the
product of: (i) the excess, if any, of the merger consideration price over the exercise price of each such Atlantic
stock option; and (ii) the number of shares of Atlantic common stock subject to such Atlantic stock option to the
extent not previously exercised. After the effective time, any such cancelled Atlantic stock option shall no longer
be exercisable by the former holder thereof, but shall only entitle the holder to the cash-out amount, without
interest. In the event the exercise price per share of Atlantic common stock subject to an Atlantic stock option is
equal to or greater than the merger consideration price, such Atlantic stock option shall be cancelled without
consideration and have no further force or effect. Atlantic advised Hovde to assume for purposes of the opinion
that there are 20,776 Atlantic stock options outstanding with a weighted average exercise price of  $14.95 per
share as of November 13, 2017, and therefore, with Atlantic’s consent, Hovde assumed for purposes of the
opinion that all such outstanding options will be canceled and not entitled to receive the merger consideration
price.

Further, at the effective time, each Atlantic restricted share award granted pursuant to Atlantic’s equity-
based compensation plans, whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective
time, shall become fully vested and shall be converted automatically into the right to receive the merger
consideration in respect of each share of Atlantic common stock underlying such Atlantic restricted share award.
Atlantic advised Hovde to assume for purposes of the opinion that there are 63,475 unallocated shares of Atlantic
restricted stock outstanding held by the Atlantic ESOP as of November 13, 2017, all of which will be cancelled
for the repayment of the Atlantic ESOP Loan (as provided in the Agreement and discussed under “The Merger
Agreement — The Atlantic ESOP”). Accordingly, Atlantic advised Hovde that there are a total of 15,490,234
shares of Atlantic common stock outstanding as of November 13, 2017, eligible to receive the merger
consideration price, and therefore, based upon the closing price of Ameris common stock as of November 13,
2017, of  $46.75, Hovde assumed for purposes of the opinion that the aggregate merger consideration payable by
Ameris to the holders of Atlantic common stock is $144,640,060.

Pursuant to Section 7.8 of the Agreement, in the event that the average Ameris stock price (as defined in the
Agreement and discussed under “The Merger Agreement — Termination; Merger Consideration Adjustments”)
declines at any time during the determination period, the Agreement may be terminated by

• reviewed a draft of the Agreement;

• reviewed unaudited financial statements for Atlantic and Ameris as of September 30, 2017;

• reviewed certain historical annual reports of each of Atlantic and Ameris, including audited annual
reports for the year ended December 31, 2016;

• reviewed certain historical publicly available business and financial information concerning each of
Atlantic and Ameris;

• reviewed certain internal financial statements and other financial and operating data concerning
Atlantic;

• reviewed financial projections prepared by certain members of senior management of Atlantic over a
forward looking six-year period beginning with the year ending December 31, 2017, and ending with
the year ending December 31, 2022;

• discussed with certain members of senior management of Atlantic and Ameris the business, financial
condition, results of operations and future prospects of each entity; the history and past and current
operations of Atlantic and Ameris; Atlantic’s and Ameris’ historical financial performance; and their
assessment of the rationale for the merger;

• reviewed and analyzed materials detailing the merger prepared by Atlantic and Ameris and by their
respective legal and financial advisors, including the estimated amount and timing of the cost savings
and related expenses, purchase accounting adjustments and synergies expected to result from the
merger (the “Synergies”);

• analyzed the pro forma financial impact of the merger on the combined company’s earnings, tangible
book value, financial ratios and other such metrics Hovde deemed relevant, giving effect to the merger
based on assumptions relating to the Synergies;

• reviewed publicly available consensus mean analyst earnings per share estimates for Ameris for
the years ending December 31, 2017, December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2019;

• assessed current general economic, market and financial conditions;

• reviewed the terms of recent merger, acquisition and control investment transactions, to the extent
publicly available, involving financial institutions and financial institution holding companies that were
considered relevant;

• took into consideration Hovde’s experience in other similar transactions and securities valuations as
well as our knowledge of the banking and financial services industry;

Atlantic or, alternatively, either: (i) the exchange ratio may be increased by Ameris; or (ii) Ameris may pay as
part of the merger consideration additional cash consideration, provided that the additional cash consideration
complies with the provisions for such additional cash consideration set forth in the Agreement and discussed
under “The Merger Agreement — Termination; Merger Consideration Adjustments.” However, Atlantic advised
Hovde to assume for purposes of the opinion that the provisions of Section 7.8 will not be triggered and that the
exchange ratio, the per share purchase price, the merger consideration price and the aggregate merger
consideration will not be adjusted and will remain as set forth above.

Hovde’s opinion addresses only the fairness of the merger consideration to be paid in connection with the
merger and does not address any individual stock, cash, option or other components of the consideration.

The following is a summary of the analyses performed and matters considered by Hovde in connection with
its fairness opinion. The summary set forth below does not purport to be a complete description of the analyses
performed by Hovde in rendering its opinion, but it does summarize all of the material analyses performed by
Hovde.

During the course of its engagement and for the purpose of rendering its opinion, Hovde:

54



9/24/2019 tv486105-defm14a - none - 10.0374435s

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1404296/000114420418009679/tv486105-defm14a.htm 63/186

• reviewed historical market prices and trading volumes of the Ameris common stock;

• reviewed publicly available financial and stock market data relating to selected public companies that
Hovde deemed relevant to its analysis; and

• performed such other analyses and considered such other factors as Hovde deemed appropriate.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Hovde assumed, without investigation, that there have been, and from the date of the opinion through the
effective time, that there will be no material changes in the financial condition and results of operations of
Atlantic, Atlantic Coast Bank, Ameris or Ameris Bank since the date of the latest financial information described
above. Hovde assumed, without independent verification, that the representations as well as the financial and
other information provided to Hovde by Atlantic and Ameris or included in the Agreement, which has formed a
substantial basis for its opinion, are true and complete. Hovde relied upon the management of Atlantic and
Ameris as to the reasonableness and achievability of the financial forecasts and projections (and the assumptions
and bases therein) provided to Hovde by Atlantic and Ameris, and Hovde assumed such forecasts and projections
have been reasonably prepared by Atlantic and Ameris on a basis reflecting the best currently available
information and Atlantic’s and Ameris’ judgments and estimates. Hovde assumed that such forecasts and
projections would be realized in the amounts and at the times contemplated thereby, and did not, in any respect,
assume any responsibility for the accuracy or reasonableness thereof. Hovde has been authorized by Atlantic to
rely upon such forecasts and projections and other information and data, including the projections, and Hovde
expresses no view as to any such forecasts, projections or other forward-looking information or data, or the bases
or assumptions on which they were prepared.

In performing its review, Hovde relied upon the accuracy and completeness of all of the financial and other
information that was available to Hovde from public sources, that was provided by Atlantic and Ameris or their
respective representatives or that was otherwise reviewed by Hovde and assumed such accuracy and
completeness for purposes of rendering their opinion. Hovde further relied on the assurances of the respective
managements of Atlantic and Ameris that they are not aware of any facts or circumstances that would make any
of such information inaccurate or misleading. Hovde was not asked to and did not undertake an independent
verification of any of such information, and does not assume any responsibility or liability for the accuracy or
completeness thereof. Hovde assumed that each party to the Agreement would advise them promptly if any
information previously provided to them became inaccurate or was required to be updated during the period of
Hovde’s review.

Hovde is not expert in the evaluation of loan and lease portfolios for purposes of assessing the adequacy of
the allowances for losses with respect thereto. Hovde assumed that such allowances for Atlantic, Atlantic Coast
Bank, Ameris and Ameris Bank are, in the aggregate, adequate to cover such losses, and will be adequate on a
pro forma basis for the combined entity following the merger. Hovde was not requested to make, and did not
make, an independent evaluation, physical inspection or appraisal of the assets, properties, facilities, or liabilities
(contingent or otherwise) of Atlantic, Atlantic Coast Bank, Ameris and Ameris Bank, the collateral securing any
such assets or liabilities, or the collectability of any such assets, and Hovde was not furnished with any such
evaluations or appraisals nor did Hovde review any loan or credit files of Atlantic, Atlantic Coast Bank, Ameris
or Ameris Bank. Hovde did not conduct a review of any credit mark which may be taken in connection with the
merger nor has it evaluated the adequacy of any contemplated credit mark to be so taken.

Hovde’s opinion does not consider, include or address: (i) the legal, tax, accounting, or regulatory
consequences of the merger on Atlantic or its stockholders; (ii) any advice or opinions provided by any other
advisor to the board of directors of Atlantic; (iii) any other strategic alternatives that might be available to
Atlantic; or (iv) whether Ameris has sufficient cash or other sources of funds to enable it to pay any consideration
contemplated by the merger.

Hovde assumed that the merger will be consummated substantially in accordance with the terms set forth in
the Agreement, without any waiver of material terms or conditions by Atlantic or any other party to the
Agreement and that the final Merger Agreement will not differ materially from the draft Hovde reviewed. Hovde
assumed that the merger will be consummated in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. Atlantic
has advised Hovde that Atlantic is not aware of any factors that would impede any

TABLE OF CONTENTS

necessary regulatory or governmental approval of the merger. Hovde assumed that the necessary regulatory and
governmental approvals as granted will not be subject to any conditions that would be unduly burdensome on
Atlantic and Ameris or would have a material adverse effect on the contemplated benefits of the merger.
Additionally, Atlantic has advised Hovde to assume that the Consent Order issued by the FDIC will either be
removed by such regulatory authorities prior to the effective time, or in the absence of such regulatory action,
will not impede or prevent the consummation of the merger as set forth in the Agreement.

In performing its analyses, Hovde made numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance,
general business, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the
control of Hovde, Atlantic and Ameris. Hovde’s opinion was necessarily based on financial, economic, market
and other conditions and circumstances as they existed on, and on the information made available to Hovde as of,
the dates used in its opinion. Any estimates contained in the analyses performed by Hovde are not necessarily
indicative of actual values or future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by
these analyses. Additionally, estimates of the value of businesses or securities do not purport to be appraisals or to
reflect the prices at which such businesses or securities may be sold or the prices at which any securities may
trade at any time in the future. Accordingly, these analyses and estimates are inherently subject to substantial
uncertainty. Hovde’s opinion does not address the relative merits of the merger as compared to any other business
combination in which Atlantic might engage. In addition, Hovde’s fairness opinion was among several factors
taken into consideration by the board of directors of Atlantic in making its determination to approve the
Agreement and the merger. Consequently, the analyses described below should not be viewed as solely
determinative of the decision of the board of directors of Atlantic or Atlantic’s management with respect to the
fairness of the merger consideration to be received by the Atlantic stockholders in connection with the merger.

The following is a summary of the material analyses prepared by Hovde and delivered to the board of
directors of Atlantic on November 15, 2017, in connection with the delivery of its fairness opinion. This
summary is not a complete description of the analyses underlying the fairness opinion or the presentation
prepared by Hovde, but it summarizes the material analyses performed and presented in connection with such
opinion. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex analytical process involving various determinations as
to the most appropriate and relevant methods of financial analysis and the application of those methods to the
particular circumstances. Therefore, a fairness opinion is not readily susceptible to partial analysis or summary
description. In arriving at its opinion, Hovde did not attribute any particular weight to any analysis or factor that
it considered, but rather made qualitative judgments as to the significance and relevance of each analysis and
factor. The financial analyses summarized below include information presented in tabular format. The analyses
and the summary of the analyses must be considered as a whole and selecting portions of the analyses and factors
or focusing on the information presented below in tabular format, without considering all analyses and factors or
the full narrative description of the financial analyses, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying
the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the process underlying the analyses and opinion of
Hovde. The tables alone are not a complete description of the financial analyses.

Market Approach — Comparable Transactions.   As part of its analysis, Hovde reviewed publicly available
information related to two comparable groups (a “Regional Group” and a “Nationwide Group”) of select
acquisition transactions of banks. The Regional Group consisted of acquisition transactions where targets were
headquartered in Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee,
Virginia and West Virginia announced since January 1, 2015, in which the target’s total assets were between
$500 million and $1.5 billion, last-twelve-months (“LTM”) return on average assets (“ROAA”) were between
0.40% and 1.10%, and non-performing assets (“NPAs”) to total assets were greater than 1.00%. The Nationwide
Group consisted of acquisition transactions of banks in the United States announced since January 1, 2015, in
which the target’s total assets were between $500 million and $1.5 billion, last-twelve-months return on average
assets were between 0.50% and 1.00%, and non-performing assets to total assets were greater than 1.50%. In
each case, for which financial information was available, no transaction that fit the above selection criteria was
excluded. Information for the target institutions was based on balance sheet data as of, and income statement data
for, the twelve months preceding the most recent quarter prior to announcement of the transactions. The resulting
two groups consisted of the following transactions (13 transactions for the Regional Group and 14 transactions
for the Nationwide Group):

• the multiple of the purchase consideration to the acquired company’s tangible common book value (the
“Price-to-Tangible Common Book Value Multiple”);

• the multiple of the purchase consideration to the acquired company’s adjusted tangible common book
value (the “Price-to-Adjusted Tangible Common Book Value”);

• the multiple of the purchase consideration to the acquired company’s LTM net earnings per share (the
“Price-to-LTM Earnings Multiple”); and

book value to the acquired company’s core deposits (the “Premium-to-Core Deposits Multiple”).

For each precedent transaction, Hovde compared the implied ratio of the transaction value to certain
financial characteristics of Atlantic as follows:

The results of the analysis are set forth in the table below. Transaction multiples for the merger were based
upon the merger consideration of  $144,640,060 for Atlantic and were based on September 30, 2017, financial
results for Atlantic.

(1) Price-to-Adjusted Common Tangible Book Value equals the adjusted purchase price divided by core capital
where: (i) core capital equals total tangible assets multiplied by 8%; (ii) excess capital equals total tangible
book value less core capital; and (iii) adjusted purchase price equals implied value of the merger
consideration less excess capital (assumes dollar-for-dollar payment on excess capital).

(2) Price-to-LTM EPS multiples are considered non-meaningful for values greater than 40.0x.

(3) Core deposits are defined as total deposits less foreign deposits and time deposit accounts greater than
$100,000.

of these results is not strictly mathematical. Rather, it involves complex considerations and judgments concerning
differences in financial and operating characteristics of the companies. The resulting values of the Precedent

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Income Approach — Discounted Cash Flow Analysis.   Taking into account various factors, including
Atlantic’s recent performance, the current banking environment and the local economy in which Atlantic
operates, Hovde determined, in consultation with and based on information provided by management of Atlantic,
earnings estimates for Atlantic over a forward looking six-year period, and in consultation with Atlantic
management, developed the forward-looking projections and key assumptions which formed the basis for the
discounted cash flow analyses. The resulting projected Atlantic net income numbers used for the analysis were
calculated using an assumed effective tax rate of 35% and were $5.2 million for 2017, $6.6 million for 2018,
$7.7 million for 2019, $8.7 million for 2020, $9.9 million for 2021, and $11.3 million for 2022.

To determine present values of Atlantic based on these projections, Hovde utilized two discounted cash flow
models, each of which capitalized terminal values using a different methodology: (i) Terminal Price/ Earnings
Multiple (“DCF Terminal P/E Multiple”); and (ii) Terminal Price/Tangible Book Value Multiple (“DCF Terminal
P/TBV Multiple”).

In the DCF Terminal P/E Multiple analysis, an estimated value of the Atlantic common stock was calculated
based on the present value of Atlantic’s after-tax net income based on Atlantic management’s forward-looking
projections. Hovde utilized a terminal value at the end of 2022 by applying a five point range of price-to-earnings
multiples of 21.5x to 25.5x, which range is based around the median price-to-earnings multiple derived from
transactions in the Regional Group of 23.5x. The present value of Atlantic’s projected dividends, of which there
were none projected, plus the terminal value was then calculated assuming a range of discount rates between
12.40% and 14.40%, with a midpoint of 13.40% discounted over a period of 5.13 years. This range of discount
rates was chosen to reflect different assumptions regarding the required rates of return of holders or prospective
buyers of Atlantic common stock. The range of discount rates utilized the buildup method to determine such
required rates of return and was based upon the risk-free interest rate, an equity risk premium, an industry risk
premium, and a size premium which resulted in a discount rate of 13.4% used as the midpoint of the five point
range of discount rates of 12.40% to 14.40%. The resulting aggregate values of Atlantic common stock based on
the DCF Terminal P/E Multiple applied to the 2022 projected earnings of  $11.3 million and then discounted
utilizing the five point range of discount rates set forth above resulted in implied aggregate values between
$121.4 million and $157.7 million with a midpoint of  $138.9 million.

In the DCF Terminal P/TBV Multiple model, the same earnings estimates and projected net income were
used as in the preceding DCF Terminal P/E Multiple analysis to determine the projected tangible book value for
Atlantic as of December 31, 2022. In arriving at the terminal value at the end of 2022, Hovde applied a five point
range of price-to-tangible book value multiples of 1.51x to 1.71x utilizing as a midpoint of the range the median
price-to-tangible book value multiple derived from transactions in the Regional Group of 1.61x. The present
value of projected dividends, of which there were none projected, plus the terminal value was then calculated
assuming the range of discount rates between 12.40% and 14.40%, with a midpoint of 13.40% discounted over a
period of 5.13 years as was applied in the DCF Terminal P/E Multiple analysis set forth above. The resulting
implied aggregate values of Atlantic common stock based on the DCF Terminal P/TBV Multiple analysis ranged
between $103.8 million and $128.7 million with a midpoint of  $115.8 million.

These analyses and their underlying assumptions yielded a range of implied multiple values for Atlantic
common stock which are outlined in the table below:

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Hovde noted that while the discounted cash flow present value analysis is a widely used valuation
methodology, it relies on numerous assumptions, including asset and earnings growth rates, projected dividend
payouts, terminal values and discount rates. Hovde’s analysis does not purport to be indicative of the actual
values or expected aggregate values of Atlantic common stock.

Ameris Comparable Companies Analysis:   Hovde used publicly available information to compare selected
financial and trading information for Ameris and a group of 16 publicly-traded financial institutions selected by
Hovde based on publicly-traded banks headquartered in Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, North
Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia with total assets between $4.0 billion and
$12.0 billion and LTM ROAA greater than 0.75%.

The analysis compared publicly available financial and market trading information for Ameris and the data
for the 16 financial institutions identified above as of and for the most recent twelve-month period which was
publicly available. The table below compares the data for Ameris and the median data for the 16 financial
institutions identified above, with pricing data as of November 13, 2017.

Ameris fell within the range of pricing metrics of comparable companies. No company used as a comparison
in the above analysis is identical to Ameris. Accordingly, an analysis of these results is not strictly mathematical.
Rather, it involves complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and operating
characteristics of the companies.

Accretion/Dilution Analysis:   Hovde performed a pro forma merger analysis that combined projected
income statement and balance sheet information of Atlantic and Ameris. Assumptions regarding the accounting
treatment, acquisition adjustments, cost savings and synergies were used to calculate the financial impact that the
merger would have on certain projected financial results of Ameris. For purposes of this analysis, Hovde used the
S&P Cap IQ mean of analyst earnings estimates for Ameris for the years ended or ending December 31, 2017,
December 31, 2018, December 31, 2019, and an effective tax rate of 31% and an earnings growth rate of 10.0%
were assumed for December 31, 2020. Additionally, Hovde used

• each of Ameris’s, Atlantic’s and the combined company’s business, operations, financial condition,
earnings and prospects, taking into account the results of Ameris’s due diligence review of Atlantic,
which included financial, credit, legal, regulatory and operational due diligence, and the conclusion that
Atlantic’s financial condition, capital adequacy and asset quality were sound and would complement
those of Ameris;

• Ameris’s belief that Ameris and Atlantic share a compatible community banking model, including with
respect to strategic focus, client service, credit culture and risk profiles;

• the fact that that the merger would enable Ameris to continue its focus, and expand its existing
presence, in the high growth, attractive Jacksonville, Florida market by the addition of certain branches
operated by Atlantic;

• the belief that the merger would solidify Ameris’s position as the largest community bank by deposit
market share in the Jacksonville, Florida market;

• the belief that the merger will afford Ameris the opportunity to expand its revenue sources and sustain
its robust loan and deposit origination trends in Ameris’s and Atlantic’s current markets;

• Ameris and Atlantic have complementary footprints in both Northern Florida and Southern Georgia,
and Ameris’s management’s belief that that the significant market overlap will allow for considerable
operating efficiencies;

• the belief that that the merger will be financially accretive to Ameris’s earnings per share due to a
combination of revenue synergies, cost efficiencies and other cost savings opportunities for the
combined company;

• the Ameris board of director’s understanding of the current and prospective economic, interest rate,
regulatory and competitive environment in which Ameris and Atlantic operate, and the likely effect of
these factors on Ameris, both with and without the merger;

TABLE OF CONTENTS

earnings estimates provided by Atlantic’s management for Atlantic for the years ended or ending December 31,
2017, December 31, 2018, December 31, 2019, and December 31, 2020. This analysis indicated that the merger
is expected to be accretive by $0.09 per share to Ameris’ consensus estimated earnings per share of  $3.13 in
2018, accretive by $0.15 per share to Ameris’ consensus estimated earnings per share of  $3.61 in 2019, and
accretive by $0.15 per share to Ameris’ consensus estimated earnings per share of  $3.97 in 2020. The analysis
also indicated that the merger is expected to be accretive to tangible book value per share for Ameris by $0.21 per
share in 2018, accretive by $0.38 per share in 2019, and accretive by $0.55 per share in 2020 and that Ameris
would maintain capital ratios in excess of those required for Ameris to be considered well-capitalized under
existing regulations. For all of the above analyses, the actual results achieved by Atlantic and Ameris prior to and
following the merger may vary from the projected results, and the variations may be material.

Other Factors and Analyses.   Hovde took into consideration various other factors and analyses, including:
current market environment; merger and acquisition environment; movements in the common stock valuations of
selected publicly-traded banking companies; and movements in the S&P 500 Index.

Conclusion.   Based upon the foregoing analyses and other investigations and assumptions as set forth in its
opinion, without giving specific weightings to any one factor, analysis or comparison, Hovde determined that, as
of the date of the its opinion, the merger consideration to be paid in connection with the merger is fair to the
holders of Atlantic common stock from a financial point of view.

Ameris’s Reasons for the Merger

The Ameris board of directors has concluded that the merger is in the best interest of Ameris and its
shareholders. In reaching its decision to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement, the Ameris board of directors
evaluated the merger and the Merger Agreement in consultation with Ameris’s management, as well as Ameris’s
financial and legal advisors, and considered a number of factors in favor of the merger, including the following
material factors, which are not presented in order of priority:

• Ameris’s past record of integrating acquisitions and of realizing projected financial goals and benefits;

• the fact that Atlantic stockholders would own no more than 6.5% of the outstanding shares of Ameris
common stock immediately following the completion of the merger (assuming 2,644,131 shares of
Ameris common stock are issued in the merger and there are 38,208,129 shares of Ameris common
stock outstanding immediately before the effective time of the merger); and

• the financial and other terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, including provisions for the
payment by Atlantic to Ameris of a termination fee if the Merger Agreement is terminated under
certain circumstances and the fact that the exchange ratio and total number of shares of Ameris
common stock to be issued in the merger are essentially fixed.

• the need to obtain the requisite Atlantic stockholder approval to complete the merger and the risk that
that or other conditions would not be satisfied;

• the possibility that Ameris would not be able to obtain the required regulatory approvals for the merger
in a prompt fashion, or at all, due to the Consent Order (which has subsequently been terminated);

• the possibility that other merger and acquisition opportunities would be foregone while finalizing the
merger with Atlantic;

• the potential risks associated with integrating Atlantic’s business, operations and workforce with those
of Ameris, including the execution risk of data system conversion and the possible negative effect on
customer and employee relationships;

• that Ameris may not realize from the merger all of the anticipated cost synergies and savings in the
amounts estimated or in the time frame contemplated;

• the potential risk of diverting management attention and resources from the operation of the business of
Ameris and towards completion of the merger and integration of operations;

• approvals from regulatory authorities could impose conditions that could have the effect of delaying
completion of the merger or imposing additional costs; and

• the expenses to be incurred in working towards completion of the merger.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

The Ameris board of directors also considered potential risks relating to the merger, including the following:

The foregoing discussion of the factors considered by the Ameris board of directors is not intended to be
exhaustive, but rather includes the material factors considered by the Ameris board of directors. In reaching its
decision to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, the Ameris
board of directors did not quantify or assign any relative weights to the factors considered, and individual
directors may have given different weights to different factors. The Ameris board of directors considered the
foregoing factors as a whole, including discussions with, and questioning of, Ameris’s management and financial
and legal advisors, and unanimously concluded that the positive factors outweighed the negative factors and that
the factors as a whole supported a determination to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement.

The decision to enter into the Merger Agreement was unanimously approved by the Ameris board of
directors on October 17, 2017.

Interests of Atlantic Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger

Some of Atlantic’s executive officers participated in negotiations of the Merger Agreement with Ameris, and
the board of directors of Atlantic adopted the Merger Agreement and is recommending that Atlantic stockholders
vote “FOR” the Merger Agreement. In considering these facts and the other information contained in this proxy
statement/prospectus, you should be aware that Atlantic’s executive officers and directors have interests in the
merger that are in addition to, or different from, the interests of Atlantic stockholders generally.

Atlantic Executive Officer Executive Non-Competition Agreement.   Mr. Stephens and Ameris have entered
into an Executive Non-Competition Agreement, which will become effective at the time of the merger. Pursuant
to this agreement, Ameris will pay to Mr. Stephens, in 18 equal installments, the sum of $605,000, less any
withholding taxes and other deductions or withholdings required by law.

In exchange for such payment, Mr. Stephens has agreed that, for a period of six months following the
effective time of the merger, he will not engage in certain defined banking activities within the boundaries of each
county in Florida and Georgia where Atlantic Coast Bank operates a banking office at the effective time of the
merger and each county that is contiguous to each of such counties. Mr. Stephens has further agreed that for a
period of 18 months following the effective time of the merger, he shall not, without the prior written consent of
Ameris, directly or indirectly, on behalf of himself or any other person, solicit or attempt to solicit for the purpose
of providing prohibited banking activities any customer of Atlantic, Ameris or any of their affiliates, in each case,
with whom he had material contact on behalf of Atlantic or Atlantic Coast Bank in the course of his service as an
executive officer or director of Atlantic or Atlantic Coast Bank.

Indemnification and Directors’ and Officers’ Insurance.   For a period of six years after the effective time of
the merger, Ameris must indemnify and defend, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the present and
former directors and executive officers of Atlantic and its subsidiaries (each, an “indemnified party”) against all
liabilities arising out or related to any claim, action, suit, proceeding, investigation or other legal proceeding (a
“claim”) in which an indemnified party is or is threatened to be made a party or witness arising out of the fact that
such indemnified party is or was a director or officer of Atlantic or any of its subsidiaries (or was a director,
officer, manager or trustee with another Atlantic entity or benefit plan) prior to the effective time, if such claim
pertains to any matter of fact arising, existing or occurring on or prior to the effective time.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

In addition to indemnifying former directors and executive officers of Atlantic during the same six-year
period, Ameris will provide directors’ and officers’ liability insurance covering present and former directors and
officers of Atlantic and its subsidiaries who are covered by Atlantic’s policies, as of the date of the Merger
Agreement, on terms similar to such existing insurance.

These obligations are described in more detail under “The Merger Agreement — Indemnification and
Directors’ and Officers’ Insurance.”

Board of Directors and Management of Ameris Following the Merger

The directors and officers of Ameris immediately after the effective time of the merger will consist of the
directors and officers of Ameris immediately prior to the effective time of the merger. The directors and officers
of the surviving company will hold office until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, or their
earlier death, resignation or removal. Information regarding the executive officers and directors of Ameris is
contained in documents filed by Ameris with the SEC and incorporated by reference into this proxy
statement/prospectus, including Ameris’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016,
and its Definitive Proxy Statement on Schedule 14A for its 2017 annual meeting of shareholders, filed with the
SEC on April 3, 2017. See “Certain Documents Incorporated by Reference.”

The Hamilton Merger Agreement provides that the directors and officers of the surviving entity in the
Hamilton merger will be the directors and officers of Ameris immediately prior to the effective time of the
Hamilton merger. Accordingly, if the Hamilton merger is completed, there will be no change in the directors or
officers of Ameris.

Regulatory Approvals

The Federal Reserve and the GDBF must approve the merger of Ameris and Atlantic, and the FDIC and the
GDBF must approve the bank merger of the two bank subsidiaries. All of the regulatory applications for the
required regulatory approvals from the foregoing banking regulators have been filed and are pending as of the
date of this proxy statement/prospectus. In determining whether to grant its approval, the Federal Reserve will
consider the effect of the merger on the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the companies
and banks concerned and the convenience and needs of the communities to be served.

The review of the regulatory applications by the Federal Reserve, the FDIC and the GDBF will not include
an evaluation of the merger from the financial perspective of the individual Atlantic stockholders. Further, no
Atlantic stockholder should construe an approval of the regulatory applications by the Federal Reserve, the FDIC
or the GDBF to be a recommendation that the Atlantic stockholders vote to approve the merger proposal. Each
Atlantic stockholder entitled to vote should evaluate the merger proposal to determine the personal financial
impact of the completion of the merger.

Accounting Treatment

The merger will be accounted for as a purchase for financial reporting and accounting purposes under
GAAP. Ameris will be treated as the acquirer for accounting purposes. After the merger, the results of operations
of Atlantic will be included in the consolidated financial statements of Ameris. The merger consideration will be
allocated based on the fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. Any excess of cost over fair
value of the net tangible and identified intangible assets of Atlantic acquired will be recorded as goodwill. Any
identified intangible asset may be amortized by charges to operations under generally accepted accounting
principles in the United States.

Dissenters’ Rights for Atlantic Stockholders

Dissenters’ or appraisal rights are statutory rights that, if applicable under law, enable stockholders to dissent
from an extraordinary transaction, such as a merger, and to demand that the corporation pay the fair value for
their shares as determined by a court in a judicial proceeding instead of receiving the consideration offered to
stockholders in connection with the extraordinary transaction. Under Maryland law, holders of Atlantic common
stock do not have the right to dissent from the Merger Agreement and seek an appraisal in connection with the
merger.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE MERGER AGREEMENT

This is a summary of the material provisions of the Merger Agreement, which is qualified in its entirety by
reference to the Merger Agreement, a copy of which is included as Appendix A to this proxy statement/ prospectus
and is incorporated herein by reference.

The Merger

The boards of directors of Ameris and Atlantic have each unanimously approved and adopted the Merger
Agreement, which provides for the merger of Atlantic with and into Ameris, with Ameris as the surviving
company in the merger. Following the merger, the articles of incorporation, bylaws, corporate identity and
existence of Ameris will not be changed, and Atlantic will cease to exist as a separate entity.

Immediately after (and subject to) the completion of the merger, Atlantic Coast Bank will merge with and
into Ameris Bank, with Ameris Bank as the surviving bank. The terms and conditions of the bank merger are set
forth in a separate Merger Agreement (referred to as the “bank merger agreement”), which was executed by
Atlantic Coast Bank and Ameris Bank concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement and the form of
which is attached as an exhibit to the Merger Agreement.

As provided in the bank merger agreement, the bank merger agreement will be terminated, and the bank
merger will be abandoned automatically, without any further action by any party, if the Merger Agreement is
terminated. See “— Termination; Merger Consideration Adjustments.” The bank merger agreement otherwise
may be terminated, and the bank merger abandoned at any time prior to its effectiveness, by: (i) the mutual
consent of the board of directors of Ameris Bank and Atlantic Coast Bank; (ii) the board of directors of either
Ameris Bank or Atlantic Coast Bank if the bank merger is not completed by June 30, 2018; or (iii) the board of
directors of either Ameris Bank or Atlantic Coast Bank if any of the conditions to the completion of the bank
merger cannot be satisfied, through no fault of the terminating party, by June 30, 2018.

If Ameris deems desirable, then Ameris may, at any time and without the approval of Atlantic, change the
method of effecting the business combination contemplated by the Merger Agreement (including by providing
for the merger of Atlantic with a wholly owned subsidiary of Ameris). In no event shall such change: (i) alter or
change the amount or kind of the consideration to be issued to either the Atlantic stockholders or the holders of
Atlantic stock options as contemplated by the Merger Agreement; (ii) reasonably be expected to materially
impede or delay consummation of the merger; (iii) adversely affect the federal income tax treatment of Atlantic
stockholders in connection with the merger or adversely limit or impact the qualification of the merger as a tax-
free reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code; or (iv) require submission, to or approval
of, the Atlantic stockholders after the Merger Agreement has been approved by the Atlantic stockholders.

Closing and Effective Time of the Merger

Unless both Ameris and Atlantic agree to a later date, the closing of the merger will take place no later than
five business days after all of the conditions to the closing of the merger have been satisfied or waived in
accordance with their terms. On the closing date, Ameris will file a certificate of merger with the Georgia
Secretary of State and articles of merger with the Maryland State Department of Assessments and Taxation. The
merger will be effective upon the later of: (i) the filing of the certificate of merger with the Georgia Secretary of
State and the articles of merger with the Maryland State Department of Assessments and Taxation; and (ii) such
later date and time to which Ameris and Atlantic agree and as may be specified in accordance with the Georgia
Business Corporation Code.

The merger is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2018, subject to the receipt of the requisite
Atlantic stockholder approval, the receipt of all required regulatory approvals and the expiration of all regulatory
waiting periods and the satisfaction of other customary closing conditions. However, completion of the merger
could be delayed if there is a delay in obtaining the required regulatory approvals or in satisfying any other
conditions to the merger. No assurance is made as to whether, or when, Ameris and Atlantic will obtain the

TABLE OF CONTENTS

The Merger Consideration

If the merger is completed and unless adjusted pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, each share of
Atlantic common stock outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger (excluding treasury
stock and cancelled shares, as defined below) will be converted into the right to receive: (i) $1.39 in cash, without
interest; and (ii) 0.17 shares of Ameris common stock, plus cash in lieu of fractional shares.

Each share of Atlantic common stock owned by Ameris, Atlantic or any of their respective subsidiaries
(other than shares in trust accounts, managed accounts or other similar accounts for the benefit of customers or
shares held as collateral for outstanding debt previously contracted) immediately prior to the effective time, and
each share of Atlantic common stock that is remitted to Atlantic prior to the effective time for purposes of
repayment of the Atlantic ESOP Loan (as defined under “— The Atlantic ESOP”), will be cancelled at the
effective time without consideration (collectively, the “cancelled shares”).

Ameris will not issue fractional shares in the merger. Rather, Atlantic stockholders who would otherwise be
entitled to receive a fractional share of Ameris common stock upon the completion of the merger will instead
receive an amount in cash (computed to the nearest cent) equal to such fractional part of a share of Ameris
common stock multiplied by the exchange ratio multiplied by the average Ameris stock price (as defined in “— 
Termination; Merger Consideration Adjustments”).

The completion of the merger is subject to a price floor which, if reached prior to the completion of the
merger, could result in more shares of Ameris common stock being issued or more cash being paid, or the merger
being terminated. See “— Termination; Merger Consideration Adjustment” and “— Termination Fee.”

Subject to certain exceptions specified in the Merger Agreement, if prior to the effective time of the merger,
the number of outstanding shares of Ameris common stock or Atlantic common stock is changed as a result of a
stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, reclassification or similar transaction with respect
to such shares, then the stock consideration will be proportionately and appropriately adjusted.

The value of the shares of Ameris common stock to be issued to Atlantic stockholders in the merger will
fluctuate between now and the closing date of the merger. We make no assurances as to whether or when the
merger will be completed, and you are advised to obtain current market prices for the Ameris and Atlantic
common stock. See “Risk Factors — Because the market price of the Ameris common stock may fluctuate,
Atlantic stockholders cannot be sure of the market value of the merger consideration that they will receive in the
merger until the closing.”

Treatment of Atlantic Equity Awards

Atlantic Stock Options.   At the effective time of the merger, each Atlantic stock option, whether vested or
unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior to the effective time, will fully vest and be cancelled and
converted automatically into the right to receive a cash-out payment from Ameris or Ameris Bank in an amount
equal to the product of: (i) the excess, if any, of the merger consideration price over the exercise price of each
such Atlantic stock option; and (ii) the number of shares of Atlantic common stock subject to such Atlantic stock
option to the extent not previously exercised. After the effective time of the merger, any such canceled Atlantic
stock option will no longer be exercisable by the former holder thereof, but will only entitle the holder to the
cash-out payment, without interest. If the exercise price per share of Atlantic common stock subject to an Atlantic
stock option is equal to or greater than the merger consideration price, then such Atlantic stock option will be
canceled without consideration.

Atlantic Restricted Stock Awards.   At the effective time of the merger, each Atlantic restricted stock award,
whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior to the effective time, will fully vest and be
converted automatically into the right to receive the merger consideration in respect of each share of Atlantic
common stock underlying such Atlantic restricted stock award.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Delivery of Merger Consideration

Ameris will designate Computershare Inc. to act as the exchange agent in connection with the merger. Prior
to the effective time of the merger, Ameris will deposit with the exchange agent for the benefit of the Atlantic
stockholders sufficient cash and shares of Ameris common stock to satisfy the merger consideration payable
under the Merger Agreement.

No later than five business days after the effective time, Ameris will instruct the exchange agent to mail to
each record holder, as of the effective time, of Atlantic common stock, a letter of transmittal for use in connection
with the exchange and instructions for use in surrendering the applicable stock certificates or book-entry shares in
exchange for the merger consideration.

After the effective time, Atlantic stockholders who surrender their stock certificates or book-entry shares to
the exchange agent, together with a properly completed and duly executed letter of transmittal, and such other
documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, will receive the per share purchase price applicable
to each of their shares of Atlantic common stock. No interest will be paid or accrue on any merger consideration.
Until surrendered, each such stock certificate or book-entry share will represent after the effective time of the
merger only the right to receive the merger consideration, without interest, and any dividends or distributions to
which such holder is entitled.

No dividends or other distributions with respect to Atlantic common stock will be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Atlantic common stock with respect to the shares of Ameris common stock represented thereby
until such Atlantic common stock has been properly surrendered. Subject to applicable law, following the proper
surrender of previously unsurrendered Atlantic common stock, the record holder thereof will be entitled to
receive, without interest: (i) the amount of unpaid dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
effective time of the merger payable with respect to the whole shares of Ameris common stock represented by
such Atlantic common stock and paid prior to such surrender date; and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the
amount of dividends or other distributions payable with respect to shares of Ameris common stock represented by
such Atlantic common stock with a record date after the effective time of the merger (but before such surrender
date) and with a payment date after the issuance of the shares of Ameris common stock issuable in exchange for
such Atlantic common stock.

At the effective time of the merger, the stock transfer books of Atlantic will be closed and there will be no
further registration of transfers of Atlantic common stock on the records of Atlantic. The merger consideration
paid will be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Atlantic common stock.
After the effective time, the holders of Atlantic common stock outstanding immediately prior to the effective time
will cease to have any rights with respect to such stock, except as otherwise provided for in the Merger
Agreement or by applicable law.

Neither Ameris nor the exchange agent will be liable to any former Atlantic stockholder for any merger
consideration delivered in good faith to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar laws.

If any stock certificate is lost, stolen or destroyed, in order to receive the merger consideration, the holder of
that certificate must provide an affidavit of that fact and, if required by either Ameris or the exchange agent in its
reasonable discretion, deliver a customary indemnity agreement or post a bond in a customary amount with
respect to that certificate.

• any change in banking laws of general applicability (so long as Ameris and its subsidiaries, on the one
hand, or Atlantic and its subsidiaries, on the other, as the case may be, are not disproportionately
affected thereby);

• any change in GAAP or regulatory accounting principles applicable to banks or their holding
companies generally (so long as Ameris and its subsidiaries, on the one hand, or Atlantic and its

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Certain representations and warranties of Ameris and Atlantic are qualified as to “materiality” or “material
adverse effect.” For purposes of the Merger Agreement, a “material adverse effect,” when used in reference to
either Ameris and its subsidiaries, or Atlantic and its subsidiaries, means any change, event, occurrence,
development, violation, effect or circumstance which, individually or in the aggregate: (i) has, or is reasonably
likely to have, a material adverse effect on the business, operations, properties, assets, liquidity, deposit liabilities,
condition (financial or otherwise) or prospects of such party on a consolidated basis; or (ii) prevents or materially
impairs, or would be reasonably likely to prevent or materially impair, the ability of such party to timely
consummate the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement or the bank merger agreement or to perform
its agreements or covenants under the Merger Agreement. For purposes of the immediately preceding clause (i), a
material adverse effect specifically excludes any adverse effect attributable to or resulting from:

Regulatory Matters

Ameris has agreed to use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the registration statement of which
this proxy statement/prospectus forms a part to become effective and remain effective through the effective time
of the merger. Ameris has also agreed to take any action required to be taken under the applicable state securities
laws in connection with the issuance of shares of Ameris common stock upon completion of the merger. Atlantic
has agreed to provide Ameris reasonable assistance as necessary in the preparation of the registration statement,
including providing Ameris with information concerning Atlantic as and to the extent required for inclusion in
the registration statement.

Each of Ameris and Atlantic have agreed to use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain as promptly as
reasonable practicable all required regulatory approvals. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in the Merger
Agreement will be deemed to require Ameris, or require or permit Atlantic, to take any action, or commit to take
any action, or agree to any condition or restriction, in connection with obtaining the required regulatory approvals
that would constitute a burdensome regulatory condition.

Employee Matters

Following the closing date, Ameris or its applicable subsidiary shall provide to employees of Atlantic and its
subsidiaries who continue employment with Ameris or any of its subsidiaries following the closing date
(“continuing employees”) medical, dental, vacation and long-term disability benefits, medical and dependent care
flexible spending accounts, severance and life insurance (collectively, “Ameris employee benefits”) on terms and
conditions consistent in all material respects with those then currently provided by Ameris or its subsidiaries to
its other similarly-situated employees.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Ameris must give continuing employees credit for their prior service with Atlantic and its subsidiaries for
purposes of eligibility and vesting (but not benefit accruals) under any Ameris employee benefits to the extent
such service was counted under the similar plan of Atlantic or its subsidiaries. The continuing employees’ prior
service with Atlantic or any of its subsidiaries shall also be credited for purposes of all waiting periods for
participation in any Ameris employee benefits to the extent such service was counted under the similar plan of
Atlantic or its subsidiary. Ameris or its applicable subsidiary also: (i) will waive all restrictions and limitations for
preexisting conditions under Ameris employee benefits to the extent such restrictions or limitations would not
apply to the continuing employees under the similar plan of Atlantic or its subsidiary; and (ii) will use
commercially reasonable efforts to provide the continuing employees, in the plan year which includes the closing
date, with credit under Ameris’s group health employee benefits towards any applicable deductibles for the
aggregate amounts paid by such employees toward applicable deductibles under Atlantic’s group health
employee benefit plans for such plan year.

Subject to applicable legal requirements, Ameris and Atlantic will take such other commercially reasonable
actions as necessary to terminate or amend, effective as of the closing date, all existing employment agreements
and other Atlantic employee benefit plans or arrangements that Ameris directs Atlantic or Atlantic Coast Bank to
terminate or amend prior to the completion of the merger. Unless terminated prior to the closing date, Ameris has
agreed to honor the existing employment agreements with continuing employees in accordance with their terms
or as otherwise amended by the parties.

The Atlantic ESOP

The Atlantic ESOP is a tax-qualified plan that covers substantially all of the employees of Atlantic and its
subsidiaries. The Atlantic ESOP received a loan from Atlantic, the proceeds of which were used to acquire shares
of Atlantic common stock for the benefit of plan participants (the “Atlantic ESOP Loan”). The Atlantic ESOP has
pledged the shares acquired with the loan as collateral for the loan and holds them in a suspense account,
releasing them to participants’ accounts as the loan is repaid, using contributions received from Atlantic.

Prior to the effective time of the merger, the outstanding Atlantic ESOP Loan will be repaid by the Atlantic
ESOP by delivering a sufficient number of unallocated shares of Atlantic common stock to Atlantic and, if after
remitting such shares there remains any unpaid amount under the Atlantic ESOP Loan, such unpaid amount,
including any unpaid but accrued interest, will be forgiven by Atlantic at the effective time of the merger. Any
unallocated shares remaining in the Atlantic ESOP suspense account (after the repayment of the outstanding
Atlantic ESOP Loan) will be allocated to the active plan participants pro-rata as earnings. As of the effective time
of the merger, the ESOP will be terminated and all allocated shares of common stock held by the Atlantic ESOP
will be converted into the right to receive the merger consideration.

As soon as practicable following the receipt of a favorable determination letter from the IRS regarding the
qualified status of the Atlantic ESOP upon its termination, the account balances in the Atlantic ESOP shall either
be distributed to participants and beneficiaries or transferred to an eligible tax-qualified retirement plan or
individual retirement account as a participant or beneficiary may direct.

Indemnification and Directors’ and Officers’ Insurance

For a period of six years after the effective time of the merger, Ameris must indemnify and defend, to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the present and former directors and executive officers of Atlantic and
its subsidiaries against all liabilities arising out or related to any claim, action, suit, proceeding, investigation or
other legal proceeding in which an indemnified party is or is threatened to be made a party or witness arising out
of the fact that such indemnified party is or was a director or officer of Atlantic or any of its subsidiaries (or was a
director, officer, manager or trustee with another Atlantic entity or benefit plan) prior to the effective time, if such
claim pertains to any matter of fact arising, existing or occurring on or prior to the effective time.

Ameris shall promptly pay reasonable expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) in advance of the final
disposition of any such claim to each indemnified party to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law upon
receipt of an undertaking to repay such advance payments if such indemnified party is

• the acquisition proposal did not result from a breach of Atlantic’s obligations under the Merger
Agreement regarding limitations on discussions with third parties;

• the board of directors of Atlantic determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor
and outside legal counsel, that such acquisition proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to result in a
superior proposal (as defined below);

• the board of directors of Atlantic determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel, that a failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to result in a breach of the
fiduciary duties of the board of directors;

TABLE OF CONTENTS

adjudicated not to be entitled to indemnification under the Merger Agreement. Ameris will not have any
obligations to an indemnified party under the Merger Agreement if a federal or state banking agency or other
governmental authority determines that indemnification of the indemnified person as contemplated under the
Merger Agreement is prohibited by applicable law.

Ameris has agreed that it will not consolidate with or merge with any other corporation or entity where
Ameris is not the continuing or surviving entity, or transfer all or substantially all of Ameris’s property or assets,
unless proper provision is made so that the successors and assigns of Ameris assume the obligations of
indemnification under the Merger Agreement.

In addition to indemnifying former directors and executive officers of Atlantic during the same six-year
period, Ameris will provide directors’ and officers’ liability insurance covering present and former directors and
officers of Atlantic and its subsidiaries who are covered by Atlantic’s policies, as of the date of the Merger
Agreement, on terms similar to such existing insurance (a “tail insurance policy”). In no event shall Ameris be
obligated to make aggregate annual premium payments for such six-year period for the tail insurance policy
which exceed 200% of the annual premium payments on Atlantic’s policy in effect as of the date of the Merger
Agreement (the “maximum amount”). If premiums necessary to maintain or procure the tail insurance policy
exceed the maximum amount, then Ameris will use its reasonable best efforts to maintain the most advantageous
policies of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance obtainable for a premium equal to the maximum amount.

NASDAQ Listing

Ameris has agreed to list on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, by the closing date, the shares of Ameris
common stock to be issued to Atlantic stockholders in the merger.

Limitations on Discussion With Third Parties

Under the Merger Agreement, Atlantic may not, and may not permit any of its subsidiaries or
representatives, to solicit or entertain offers from, negotiate with or encourage, discuss, accept or consider an
acquisition proposal (as defined below) of any third party. Atlantic has agreed to immediately cease and cause to
be terminated any previously undertaken or ongoing activities, discussions or negotiations with any third party
with respect to any acquisition proposal. If Atlantic or any of its subsidiaries or representatives receives any
communication regarding an acquisition proposal before the closing date of the merger, then Atlantic shall
immediately notify Ameris of the receipt of such acquisition proposal.

An “acquisition proposal” means: (i) any proposal or offer with respect to a merger, joint venture,
partnership, consolidation, dissolution, liquidation, tender offer, recapitalization, reorganization, rights offering,
share exchange, business combination or similar transaction involving Atlantic or any of its subsidiaries; or (ii)
any acquisition by any third party resulting in, or proposal or offer, which, if consummated, would result in, any
such third party becoming the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of more than 20% of the total voting power
of any class of equity securities of Atlantic or any of its subsidiaries, or more than 20% of the consolidated total
assets of Atlantic or any of its subsidiaries.

However, prior to obtaining the requisite Atlantic stockholder approval, Atlantic may enter into discussions
or negotiations with a third party, or furnish Atlantic non-public information to a third party, in response to a bona
fide, unsolicited written acquisition proposal from such party if:

• Atlantic gives Ameris prompt notice of  (i) receipt by Atlantic or any of its subsidiaries or
representatives of any acquisition proposal (which notice shall include the identity of such third party
and the material terms and conditions of any proposals or offers), and (ii) Atlantic’s entering into
discussions or negotiations with, or furnishing Atlantic non-public information to, such third party;

• Atlantic receives from such third party an executed confidentiality agreement containing terms no less
favorable to Atlantic than the terms of the confidentiality agreement between Atlantic and Ameris
relating to the merger; and

• contemporaneously with, or promptly after, Atlantic furnishes any such nonpublic information to such
third party, Atlantic furnishes such nonpublic information to Ameris (if not previously furnished).

• the board of directors of Atlantic determines in good faith, after consultation with Atlantic’s financial
advisor and outside legal counsel, that it has received an acquisition proposal (not resulting from a
breach of Atlantic’s obligations under the Merger Agreement regarding limitations on discussions with
third parties) that is a superior proposal (and such superior proposal has not been withdrawn);

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Atlantic has agreed to keep Ameris reasonably informed on a prompt basis of the status and material terms
of any such acquisition proposal, including any material amendments or proposed amendments, and any change
in Atlantic’s intentions with respect to the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

A “superior proposal” means any bona fide written acquisition proposal: (i) that, if consummated, would
result in any a third party becoming the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of the total
voting power of any class of equity securities of Atlantic or any of its subsidiaries, or of more than 50% of the
consolidated total assets of Atlantic or any of its subsidiaries; and (ii) with respect to which the board of directors
of Atlantic (a) determines in good faith that such acquisition proposal, if accepted, is reasonably likely to be
consummated on a timely basis, taking into account all legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of the
acquisition proposal and the third party making such proposal, and (b) determines in good faith (based on, among
other things, the advice of Atlantic’s financial advisor) to be more favorable to the Atlantic stockholders than the
merger taking into account all relevant factors (including whether, in the good faith judgment of the board of
directors of Atlantic, after obtaining the advice of the Atlantic’s financial advisor, the third party making such
acquisition proposal is reasonably able to finance the transaction and close it timely, and any proposed changes to
the Merger Agreement that may be proposed by Ameris in response to such acquisition proposal).

Atlantic Board Recommendation

The Merger Agreement requires Atlantic to hold the special meeting, for purposes of submitting the Merger
Agreement and the merger to the Atlantic stockholders for approval, as promptly as reasonably practical after the
registration statement of which this proxy/statement forms a part is declared effective by the SEC. Atlantic must
use its reasonable best efforts to solicit from the Atlantic stockholders proxies in favor of the adoption of the
Merger Agreement and the approval of the merger and take all other action necessary or advisable to secure the
requisite Atlantic stockholder approval. To this end, the board of directors of Atlantic must communicate to the
Atlantic stockholders the board of directors of Atlantic’ recommendation that they adopt and approve the Merger
Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger (the “Atlantic board
recommendation”).

Except as described under “— Change in Atlantic Board Recommendation,” the board of directors of
Atlantic may not: (i) withdraw, qualify or modify, or propose publically to withdraw, qualify or modify, in a
manner adverse to Ameris or its subsidiaries, the Atlantic board recommendation; or (ii) approve or recommend,
or propose publically to approve or recommend, any acquisition proposal. We refer to any of the actions in clause
(i) and (ii) as an “adverse Atlantic recommendation change.”

Change in Atlantic Board Recommendation

Prior to obtaining the requisite Atlantic stockholder approval, the board of directors of Atlantic may make an
adverse Atlantic recommendation change if:

• the board of directors of Atlantic determines, in good faith, after consultation with Atlantic’s outside
legal counsel, that a failure to accept such superior proposal would be reasonably likely to result in a
breach of the fiduciary duties of the board of directors under applicable law;

• the board of directors of Atlantic delivers to Ameris written notice of its receipt of the superior
proposal and its intent to announce an adverse Atlantic recommendation change on the third business
day after such delivery, which notice shall specify the material terms and conditions of the superior
proposal;

• after providing such written notice, Atlantic negotiates in good faith with Ameris (if requested) and
provides Ameris reasonable opportunity during such three-business day period to adjust the terms and
conditions of the Merger Agreement as would enable the board of directors of Atlantic to proceed
without an adverse Atlantic recommendation change; and

• after such three-day period, the board of directors of Atlantic again determines in good faith, after
consultation with Atlantic’s financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that such acquisition proposal
nonetheless continues to constitute a superior proposal and that failure to make an adverse Atlantic
recommendation change would be reasonably likely to result in a breach of the fiduciary duties of the
board of directors under applicable law.

• receipt of the requisite Atlantic stockholder approval;

• receipt of all required regulatory approvals without them containing or resulting in the imposition of
any materially burdensome regulatory condition;

• no order, injunction, decree or judgment preventing the completion of the merger or the other
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement issued by any governmental authority of
competent jurisdiction, or other legal restraint or prohibition preventing the completion of the merger or
the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, is in effect;

• no law has been enacted or enforced by any governmental authority which prohibits or makes illegal
the completion of the merger;

• the registration statement of which this proxy statement/prospectus forms a part has been declared
effective by the SEC, and no stop order has been entered with respect thereto;

• the accuracy, in all respects, of the representations and warranties of each party in the Merger
Agreement, as of the date of the Merger Agreement and the closing date or such other date specified in
the Merger Agreement (without giving effect to any materiality or material adverse effect limitations),
except where the failure to be accurate is not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the
party to which such representation or warranty relates;

• the performance and compliance by each party in all material respects of all agreements and covenants
required to be performed by it at or prior to the closing date;

• the delivery of officers’ certificates, secretary’s certificates and certificates of valid existence to Ameris
and Atlantic by the other; and

• receipt by each of Ameris and Atlantic of an opinion of its respective legal counsel as to certain tax
matters.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

If the board of directors of Atlantic makes an adverse Atlantic recommendation change, then Atlantic could
be required to pay Ameris a termination fee of  $5.75 million in cash. See “— Termination Fee.”

Conditions to Completion of the Merger

The completion of the merger depends on a number of conditions being satisfied or, where permitted,
waived, including:

No assurance is given as to when, or if, the conditions to the merger will be satisfied or waived, or that the
merger will be completed.

• by either party, if events that have had, or would reasonably be expected to have, a material adverse
effect on the other party have occurred and are continuing;

• by either party, if the other party materially breaches any covenant, obligation or agreement in the
Merger Agreement, which breach has not been cured within 20 days after the giving of written notice

authority, or any governmental authority of competent jurisdiction has issued a final, nonappealable
injunction permanently enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the completion of the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement;

• by either party, if the closing date shall not have occurred on or before June 30, 2018 (subject to
extension of such termination date as described below), provided that neither party may terminate the
Merger Agreement if the failure of the closing to occur by such date is due to such party’s failure to
perform or observe its covenants and agreements under the Merger Agreement;

termination by Atlantic, it has complied with its obligations under the Merger Agreement regarding
convening the special meeting, soliciting proxies with respect thereto and taking all other actions
necessary or advisable to obtain such approval);

• by Atlantic if, prior to obtaining the requisite Atlantic stockholder approval, the board of directors of
Atlantic has made an adverse Atlantic recommendation change and Atlantic has complied with its
obligations under the Merger Agreement: (i) regarding convening the special meeting, soliciting
proxies with respect thereto and taking all other actions necessary or advisable to obtain the required
approval, and (ii) as described under “— Limitations on Discussions With Third Parties,” “— Atlantic
Board Recommendation” and “— Change in Atlantic Board Recommendation;” and

the closing price of Ameris common stock on November 15, 2017) is less than 85% of   the
quotient of  (x) the average daily current market price of the KBW Nasdaq Regional Banking
Index (KRX) during the determination period divided by (y) the daily current market price of the

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Termination; Merger Consideration Adjustments

Termination.   Ameris and Atlantic may mutually agree to terminate the Merger Agreement and abandon the
merger at any time prior to the effective time of the merger. Subject to conditions and circumstances described in
the Merger Agreement, the Merger Agreement also may be terminated as follows:

76

• the average Ameris stock price is less than $39.91;

• the quotient of the average Ameris stock price divided by $46.95 (which was the closing price of
Ameris common stock on November 15, 2017) is less than 85% of   the quotient of  (x) the average
daily current market price of the KBW Nasdaq Regional Banking Index (KRX) during the
determination period divided by (y) the daily current market price of the KBW Nasdaq Regional
Banking Index (KRX) for November 15, 2017;

• at any time during the four business-day period following the determination date, Atlantic provides
(and does not withdraw) written notice to Ameris of Atlantic’s intention to terminate the Merger
Agreement based on the two conditions described above being met; and

• during the three business-day period commencing with Ameris’s receipt of Atlantic’s written notice,
Ameris elects to increase the exchange ratio or (provided that it will not cause the merger to fail to
qualify as a tax-free reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code) to pay, as part of
the merger consideration, to each Atlantic stockholder, an additional cash payment (the “additional
cash consideration”), such that the value of the consideration to be received by each Atlantic
stockholder (calculated based on the average Ameris stock price and including any additional cash
consideration but excluding the cash consideration of  $1.39 per share of Atlantic common stock)
equals the minimum amount that, had the average Ameris stock price been equal to such amount, at
least one of the first two conditions described above would not have been met.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

The June 30, 2018 termination date may be extended by Ameris or Atlantic for a period of three
additional months, provided that neither party may extend the termination date if the failure of the closing to
occur by such date is due to such party’s failure to perform or observe its covenants and agreements under the
Merger Agreement. If the termination date is extended, then the aggregate cash consideration of the merger
consideration will be increased as discussed under “— Merger Consideration Adjustments” below.

“Average Ameris stock price” means the average of the closing sale prices of Ameris common stock during
the 20 consecutive full trading days (the “determination period”) preceding the later to occur of (such date, the
“determination date”) the effective date of the last required regulatory approval and the date of receipt of the
requisite Atlantic stockholder approval.

Merger Consideration Adjustments.   If the termination date is extended by either party as discussed under
“— Termination” above, then provided that it will not cause the merger to fail to qualify as a tax-free
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, the aggregate cash consideration payable as part
of the merger consideration to be received by Atlantic stockholders will be increased by the amount of Atlantic’s
after-tax net income for the period from January 1, 2018 through June 30, 2018.

The merger consideration may also be adjusted as a result of a decline in the Ameris stock price if:

Even if the first two conditions described above are met, the board of directors of Atlantic may elect not to
terminate the Merger Agreement. Any decision to terminate the Merger Agreement will be made by the board of
directors of Atlantic in light of all of the circumstances existing at the time. Prior to making any decision to
terminate the Merger Agreement, the board of directors of Atlantic would consult with its financial and other
advisors and would consider all financial and other information it deemed relevant to its decision, including
whether the then-current consideration to be received in the merger would deliver more value to the Atlantic
stockholders than the value that could be expected if Atlantic were to continue as an independent company
(which would occur if the board of directors of Atlantic were to elect to abandon the merger and Ameris
determined not to increase the exchange ratio or pay the additional cash consideration). In addition, the board of
directors of Atlantic would consider whether, in light of market and other industry conditions at the time of such
decision, the merger consideration continued to be fair from a financial point of view to Atlantic stockholders. If
Atlantic elected not to terminate the Merger Agreement, which it could do without any action on the part of
Atlantic stockholders, the exchange ratio would remain 0.17 and the cash consideration would remain $1.39 per
share of Atlantic common stock.

• by either party because the merger is not completed on or before June 30, 2018; or

• by Atlantic, other than due to a termination with respect to (i) a material adverse effect on Ameris, or
(ii) a material breach by Ameris of any covenant, obligation or agreement in the Merger Agreement
(subject to applicable cure provisions).

thereby;

• in favor of any proposal to adjourn or postpone the special meeting to a later date if there are not
sufficient votes to approve the Merger Agreement;

TABLE OF CONTENTS

If each of the first two conditions described above are met and the board of directors of Atlantic elected to
terminate the Merger Agreement, then Ameris would have the option of increasing the consideration payable to
Atlantic stockholders by either increasing the exchange ratio or paying the additional cash consideration as
described above. Ameris is under no obligation to increase the exchange ratio or to pay any such additional cash
consideration, and there can be no assurance that Ameris would elect to increase the exchange ratio or pay such
additional cash consideration to prevent the termination of the Merger Agreement. Any decision would be made
by Ameris in light of the circumstances existing at the time. If Ameris elected to increase the exchange ratio or to
pay the additional cash consideration as described above, then Atlantic could not terminate the Merger
Agreement as a result of the above-described circumstances.

Termination Fee

Atlantic must pay to Ameris a termination equal to $5.75 million if an acquisition proposal is outstanding, or
has been accepted by Atlantic, and the Merger Agreement is terminated:

Atlantic also must pay to Ameris the termination fee of  $5.75 million if Ameris terminates the Merger
Agreement as permitted under “Termination” after the board of directors of Atlantic makes an adverse Atlantic
recommendation change.

The termination fee will be the sole and exclusive remedy of Ameris for all claims under the Merger
Agreement, except that Atlantic shall not be relieved from liability arising from any willful breach of any
provision of the Merger Agreement.

Expenses

All expenses incurred by each party in connection with the merger, including all fees and expenses of its
agents, representatives, counsel and accountants, will be paid by such party.

Amendment and Modification

The Merger Agreement may be amended or modified by an agreement in writing by the parties, except that
after the requisite Atlantic stockholder approval has been obtained, no amendment may be made which reduces
or modifies the merger consideration.

Voting Agreement

In connection with entering into the Merger Agreement, Ameris and Atlantic entered into a Voting
Agreement with each of the directors and certain executive officers of Atlantic, all of whom are Atlantic
stockholders. The following summary of the Voting Agreement is subject to, and qualified in its entirety
by reference to, the full text of the Voting Agreement which is included in this proxy statement/prospectus as
Appendix B.

Pursuant to the Voting Agreement, each stockholder who is a party thereto, in its capacity as an Atlantic
stockholder, agreed to vote all shares of Atlantic common stock beneficially owned by such stockholder, as

• against any action or agreement that would be reasonably likely to impair the ability of either Ameris
or Atlantic to complete the merger or would otherwise be inconsistent with, prevent, impede or delay
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement; and

• against any proposal that relates to an acquisition proposal, other than the transactions contemplated by
the Merger Agreement, without regard to the terms of such proposal.

• sell, transfer, assign, tender in any tender or exchange offer, pledge, encumber, hypothecate or similarly
dispose of  (by merger, by testamentary disposition, by operation of law or otherwise), either
voluntarily or involuntarily, any such shares;

• enter into any swap or other arrangements that transfer to another, in whole or in part, any of the
economic consequences of ownership of any such shares; or

• enter into any contract, option or other arrangement or understanding with respect to the sale, transfer,
assignment, pledge, lien, hypothecation or other disposition of  (by merger, by testamentary disposition,
by operation of law or otherwise), or otherwise convey or dispose of, any such shares, or any interest
therein, including the right to vote any such shares.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

The Voting Agreement provides that each stockholder party will not, subject to certain exceptions, with
respect to any shares of Atlantic common stock owned by such stockholder:

The Voting Agreement applies to each stockholder party in such party’s capacity as an Atlantic stockholder
and does not apply in any manner to any such party’s capacity as a director or officer of Atlantic or its
subsidiaries or in any other capacity. The Voting Agreement will terminate upon the earlier of: (i) the effective
time of the merger; and (ii) the termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES

The following general discussion sets forth the anticipated material United States federal income tax
consequences of the merger to U.S. holders (as defined below) of Atlantic common stock. This discussion does
not address any tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or foreign jurisdiction, or under any
United States federal laws other than those pertaining to income tax. This discussion is based upon the Code, the
regulations promulgated under the Code and court and administrative rulings and decisions, all as in effect on the
date of this proxy statement/prospectus. These laws may change, possibly retroactively, and any change could
affect the accuracy of the statements and conclusions set forth in this discussion.

This discussion addresses only those Atlantic common stockholders that hold their shares of Atlantic
common stock as a capital asset within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for
investment). Further, this discussion does not address all aspects of United States federal income taxation that
may be relevant to you in light of your particular circumstances or that may be applicable to you if you are
subject to special treatment under the United States federal income tax laws, including if you are:

In addition, the discussion does not address any alternative minimum tax or any state, local or foreign tax
consequences of the merger, nor does it address any tax consequences arising under the unearned income
Medicare contribution tax pursuant to the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010. Determining
the actual tax consequences of the merger to you may be complex. They will depend on your specific situation
and on factors that are not within the control of Atlantic or Ameris. You should consult with your own tax advisor
as to the tax consequences of the merger in your particular circumstances.

For purposes of this discussion, the term “U.S. holder” means a beneficial owner of Atlantic common stock
that is for United States federal income tax purposes: (i) an individual citizen or resident of the United States; (ii)
a corporation, or entity treated as a corporation, organized in or under the laws of the United States or any state
thereof or the District of Columbia; (iii) a trust if  (a) a court within the United States is able to exercise primary
supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all
substantial decisions of the trust or (b) such trust has made a valid election to be treated as a U.S. person for U.S.
federal income tax purposes; or (iv) an estate, the income of which is includible in gross income for U.S. federal
income tax purposes regardless of its source.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

The United States federal income tax consequences to a partner in an entity or arrangement that is treated as
a partnership for United States federal income tax purposes and that holds Atlantic common stock generally will
depend on the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. Partners in a partnership holding Atlantic
common stock should consult their own tax advisors.

Tax Consequences of the Merger Generally

The parties intend for the merger to qualify as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of
the Code. It is a condition to Ameris’s obligation to complete the merger that Ameris receive an opinion from
Rogers & Hardin LLP (“Rogers & Hardin”), dated the closing date of the merger, to the effect that the merger
will qualify as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. It is a condition to Atlantic’s
obligation to complete the merger that Atlantic receive an opinion from Igler and Pearlman, P.A., dated the
closing date of the merger, to the effect that the merger will qualify as a “reorganization” within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code. These opinions will be based on representation letters provided by Ameris and
Atlantic and on customary factual assumptions. Neither of the opinions described above will be binding on the
IRS. Ameris and Atlantic have not sought and will not seek any ruling from the IRS regarding any matters
relating to the merger, and as a result, there is no assurance that the IRS will not assert, or that a court would not
sustain, a position contrary to any of the conclusions set forth below.

In addition, in connection with the effectiveness of this registration statement, each of Rogers & Hardin and
Igler has delivered its opinion to the effect that, on the basis of the facts, representations, assumptions and
exclusions set forth in such opinion and certificates obtained from officers of Ameris and Atlantic: (i) the merger
will qualify as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code; and (ii) the following
discussion constitutes their opinion as to the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger to
holders of Atlantic common stock. Neither of these opinions is binding on the IRS or the courts, and neither
Ameris nor Atlantic intends to request a ruling from the IRS regarding the United States federal income tax
consequences of the merger. Consequently, no assurance is given that the IRS will not assert, or that a court
would not sustain, a position contrary to any of those set forth below. In addition, if any of the representations or
assumptions upon which such opinions are based are inconsistent with the actual facts, the United States federal
income tax consequences of the merger could be adversely affected.

Upon exchanging your Atlantic common stock for Ameris common stock and cash (other than cash received
in lieu of a fractional share), you will recognize gain (but not loss) in an amount equal to the lesser of: (i) the
amount of gain realized (i.e., the excess of the sum of the amount of cash and the fair market value of the Ameris
common stock received pursuant to the merger over that holder’s adjusted tax basis in its shares of Atlantic
common stock surrendered); and (ii) the amount of cash received pursuant to the merger (excluding any cash
received in lieu of a fractional share). If you acquired different blocks of Atlantic common stock at different times
or different prices, you should consult your tax advisor regarding the manner in which gain or loss should be
determined. Any recognized gain will be long-term capital gain if, as of the effective date of the merger, your
holding period with respect to the Atlantic common stock surrendered exceeds one year. If, however, the cash
received has the effect of the distribution of a dividend, the gain will be treated as a dividend to the extent of the
holder’s ratable share of accumulated earnings and profits as calculated for United States federal income tax
purposes. See “— Possible Treatment of Cash as a Dividend” below.

The aggregate tax basis in the shares of Ameris common stock that you receive in the merger, including any
fractional share interests deemed received and sold as described below, will equal your aggregate adjusted tax
basis in the Atlantic common stock you surrender, reduced by the amount of cash received (excluding any cash
received in lieu of a fractional share) and increased by the amount of gain, if any recognized by you (excluding
any gain recognized with respect to cash received in lieu of a fractional share) on the exchange. Your holding
period for the shares of Ameris common stock that you receive in the merger (including a fractional share interest
deemed received and sold as described below) will include your holding period for the shares of Atlantic
common stock that you surrender in the exchange.

• furnish a correct taxpayer identification number, certify that you are not subject to backup withholding
on the substitute Form W-9 or successor form included in the election form/letter of transmittal you
will receive and otherwise comply with all the applicable requirements of the backup withholding
rules; or

• provide proof that you are otherwise exempt from backup withholding.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Possible Treatment of Cash as a Dividend

In general, the determination of whether the gain recognized in the exchange will be treated as capital gain
or has the effect of a distribution of a dividend depends upon whether and to what extent the exchange reduces
the holder’s deemed percentage stock ownership of Ameris. For purposes of this determination, the holder is
treated as if it first exchanged all of its shares of Atlantic common stock solely for Ameris common stock and
then Ameris immediately redeemed, which we refer to in this document as the “deemed redemption,” a portion of
the Ameris common stock in exchange for the cash the holder actually received. The gain recognized in the
deemed redemption will be treated as capital gain if the deemed redemption is: (i) “substantially
disproportionate” with respect to the holder; or (ii) “not essentially equivalent to a dividend.”

The deemed redemption will generally be “substantially disproportionate” with respect to a holder if
the percentage described in clause (ii) below is less than 80% of the percentage described in clause (i) below.
Whether the deemed redemption is “not essentially equivalent to a dividend” with respect to a holder will depend
upon the holder’s particular circumstances. At a minimum, however, in order for the deemed redemption to be
“not essentially equivalent to a dividend,” the deemed redemption must result in a “meaningful reduction” in the
holder’s deemed percentage stock ownership of Ameris. In general, that determination requires a comparison of:
(i) the percentage of the outstanding stock of Ameris that the holder is deemed actually and constructively to have
owned immediately before the deemed redemption; and (ii) the percentage of the outstanding stock of Ameris
that is actually and constructively owned by the holder immediately after the deemed redemption. In applying the
above tests, a holder may, under the constructive ownership rules, be deemed to own stock that is owned by other
persons or stock underlying a holder’s option to purchase in addition to the stock actually owned by the holder.

The IRS has ruled that a shareholder in a publicly held corporation whose relative stock interest is minimal
(e.g., less than 1%) and who exercises no control with respect to corporate affairs is generally considered to have
a “meaningful reduction” if that shareholder has a relatively minor (e.g., approximately 3%) reduction in
its percentage stock ownership under the above analysis; accordingly, the gain recognized in the exchange by
such a shareholder would be treated as capital gain.

These rules are complex and dependent upon the specific factual circumstances particular to each holder.
Consequently, each holder that may be subject to these rules should consult its tax advisor as to the application of
these rules to the particular facts relevant to such holder.

Cash Instead of a Fractional Share

If you receive cash instead of a fractional share of Ameris common stock, then you will be treated as having
received the fractional share of Ameris common stock pursuant to the merger and then as having sold that
fractional share of Ameris common stock for cash. As a result, you generally will recognize gain or loss equal to
the difference between the amount of cash received and the basis allocable to your fractional share of Ameris
common stock. This gain or loss generally will be capital gain or loss, and will be long- term capital gain or loss
if, as of the effective date of the merger, the holding period for the shares (including the holding period of
Atlantic common stock surrendered therefor) is greater than one year. The deductibility of capital losses is subject
to limitations.

Backup Withholding

If you are a non-corporate holder of Atlantic common stock you may be subject to information reporting and
backup withholding (currently at a rate of 24%, after recent reduction pursuant to the 2017 Tax Act) on any cash
payments you receive. You generally will not be subject to backup withholding, however, if you:

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules will generally be allowed as a refund or credit
against your United States federal income tax liability, provided you timely furnish the required information to
the IRS.

This summary of material United States federal income tax consequences is not tax advice. You are
urged to consult your tax advisor with respect to the application of United States federal income tax laws

TABLE OF CONTENTS

COMPARISON OF SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS

Atlantic is incorporated under the laws of the State of Maryland. Ameris is incorporated under the laws of
the State of Georgia. The rights of holders of Atlantic capital stock are governed by Maryland law and Atlantic’s
articles of incorporation and bylaws. The rights of holders of Ameris capital stock are governed by Georgia law

their entirety. Copies of the respective companies’ governing documents have been filed with the SEC. To find

claim for an advancement of expenses,
in which case the applicable period shall
be 20 days, the indemnitee may at any
time thereafter bring suit against
Atlantic to recover the unpaid amount of
the claim. If successful in whole or in
part in any such suit, or in a suit brought
by Atlantic to recover an advancement
of expenses pursuant to the terms of an
undertaking, the indemnitee shall also be
entitled to be reimbursed the expense of
prosecuting or defending such suit. It
shall be a defense to any action for
advancement of expenses that Atlantic
has not received both: (i) an undertaking
as required by law to repay such
advances in the event it shall ultimately
be determined that the standard of
conduct has not been met; and (ii) a
written affirmation by the indemnitee of
his good faith belief that the standard of
conduct necessary for indemnification
by Atlantic has been met. In (i) any suit
brought by the indemnitee to enforce a
right to indemnification (but not in a suit
brought by the indemnitee to enforce a
right to an advancement of expenses) it
shall be a defense that, and (ii) any suit
by Atlantic to recover an advancement
of expenses pursuant to the terms of an
undertaking Atlantic shall be entitled to
recover such expenses upon a final
adjudication that, the indemnitee has not
met the applicable standard for
indemnification set forth in the
Maryland General Corporation Law.

(ii) reasonably believed (a) in the case of
conduct in the person’s official capacity,
that the conduct was in Ameris’s best
interests; (b) in all other cases, that the
conduct was at least not opposed to
Ameris’s best interests; and (c) in the case
of a criminal proceeding, that the person
had no reasonable cause to believe that
the conduct was unlawful.

Ameris’s bylaws further provide that
those persons who may be entitled to
indemnification under the bylaws who
have been wholly successful, on the
merits or otherwise, with respect to any
claim for which indemnification is
available shall be entitled to
indemnification as of right without any
further action or approval by the Ameris
board of directors. Those officers and
directors who have not been wholly
successful with respect to any claim for
which indemnification is available may be
entitled to indemnification if the Ameris
board of directors, acting by majority
vote, finds the director or officer has met
the required standard of conduct.

Pursuant to its bylaws, Ameris may
advance to directors or officers expenses
incurred with respect to any claim for
which indemnification is available under
the bylaws prior to the final disposition
thereof upon Ameris’s receipt of an
undertaking by, or on behalf of, the
director or officer to repay such amount
unless it shall ultimately be determined
that he or she is entitled to
indemnification.

Certain Business
Combination Restrictions

State Law.   Subject to certain
exceptions, the Maryland General
Corporation Law provides that a
“business combination” between a
Maryland corporation and an “interested
stockholder,” or an affiliate of an
interested stockholder, is prohibited for
five years after the most recent date on
which the interested stockholder
becomes an interested stockholder, and
after the five-year prohibition, any
business combination between a
Maryland corporation and an interested
stockholder generally must be
recommended by the board of directors
and approved by the

State Law.   The Georgia Business
Corporation Code contains a business
combination statute that protects certain
Georgia corporations from hostile
takeovers, and from actions following the
takeover, by prohibiting some transactions
once an acquirer has gained a significant
holding in the corporation. The Georgia
Business Corporation Code prohibits
“business combinations,” including
mergers, sales and leases of assets,
issuances or exchanges of securities,
certain loans and other financial benefits
and similar transactions by a corporation
or a subsidiary with an interested

• prior to the time the person becomes
an interested shareholder, the board
of directors of the target corporation
approved either the business
combination or the transaction which
will result in the person becoming an
interested shareholder; after the
completion of the transaction in
which the person becomes an
interested shareholder, the interested
shareholder holds at least 90% of the
voting stock of the corporation,
excluding for purposes of
determining the number of shares
outstanding, those shares owned by
(i) persons who are directors or

of determining the number of shares
outstanding, those shares owned by
(i) persons who are directors or
officers, their affiliates or associates,
(ii) subsidiaries of the corporation,
and (iii) specific employee benefit
plans, and the business combination
was approved by the shareholders of

of shares outstanding calculated as
above and further excluding shares

the votes entitled to be cast by holders of
outstanding shares of voting stock,

and (ii) two-thirds of the votes entitled
to be cast by holders of voting stock
other than the shares held by the
interested stockholder or an affiliate or
associate of the interested stockholder,
voting together as a single voting group.

The supermajority vote requirements do
not apply, however, if the corporation’s
common stockholders receive a
minimum price, as defined under the
Maryland General Corporation Law, for
their shares in the form of cash or other
consideration in the same form as
previously paid by the interested
stockholder for its shares.
The Maryland General Corporation Law
generally defines an interested
stockholder as: (i) any person who
beneficially owns 10% or more of the
voting power of the voting stock after
the date on which the corporation had
100 or more beneficial owners of its
stock; or (ii) an affiliate or associate of
the corporation who was the beneficial
owner, directly or indirectly, of 10% or
more of the voting power of the
corporation’s then-outstanding voting
stock at any time within the two-year
period immediately prior to the date in
question, and after the date on which it
had 100 or more beneficial owners of its
stock.

A person is not an interested stockholder
under the statute if the board of directors
approved in advance the transaction by
which the person otherwise would have
become an interested stockholder.

The business combinations covered by
the Maryland General Corporation Law
generally include mergers,
consolidations, statutory share
exchanges, or, in certain circumstances,
certain transfers of assets, certain stock
issuances and transfers, liquidation plans
and reclassifications involving interested
stockholders and their affiliates, or

shareholder that beneficially owns 10% or
more of a corporation’s voting stock,

bylaws provide that such requirements are
applicable. Ameris’s articles of
incorporation and bylaws do not contain

Certain Control Share
Acquisition Restrictions

State Law.   The Maryland General
Corporation Law provides that “control
shares” of a Maryland corporation
acquired in a “control share acquisition”
have no voting rights except to the
extent approved by a vote of the other
stockholders. Two-thirds of the votes
entitled to be cast on the matter must
vote in favor of granting the “control
shares” voting rights. “Control shares”
are shares of stock that, taken together
with all other voting shares of stock the
acquirer previously acquired or in
respect of which the acquirer is able to
exercise or direct the exercise of voting
power (except solely by virtue of a
revocable proxy), would entitle the
acquirer to exercise voting power in
electing directors within one of the
following ranges of voting power:
(i) one-tenth or more but less than one-
third of all voting power; (ii) one-third
or more but less than a majority of all
voting power; or (iii) a majority or more
of all voting power.

Control shares do not include shares of
stock the acquiring person is entitled to
vote as a result of having previously
obtained stockholder approval. A
“control share acquisition” means the
acquisition of control shares, subject to
certain exceptions.

If a person who has made (or proposes
to make) a control share acquisition
satisfies certain conditions

Corporation Code does not contain a

(including agreeing to pay expenses),
such person may compel the
corporation’s board of directors to call a
special meeting of stockholders to
consider the voting rights of the shares.
If such a person makes no request for a
meeting, the corporation has the option
to present the question at any
stockholders’ meeting.

If voting rights are not approved at a
meeting of stockholders or the acquiring
person does not deliver an acquiring
person statement as required by the
statute, then, subject to certain
conditions and limitations, the
corporation may redeem any or all of the
control shares (except those for which
voting rights have previously been
approved) for fair value. The
corporation will determine the fair value
of the shares, without regard to the
absence of voting rights, as of the date
of either: (i) the last control share
acquisition; or (ii) the meeting of
stockholders where stockholders
considered and did not approve voting
rights of the control shares.

If voting rights for control shares are
approved at a stockholders’ meeting and
the acquirer becomes entitled to vote a
majority of the shares of stock entitled to
vote, all other stockholders may obtain
rights as objecting stockholders and,
thereunder, exercise appraisal rights.
Under the Maryland General
Corporation Law, the fair value may not
be less than the highest price per share
paid in the control share acquisition.
Furthermore, certain limitations
otherwise applicable to the exercise of
dissenters’ rights would not apply in the
context of a control share acquisition.
The control share acquisition statute
would not apply to shares acquired in a
merger, consolidation or share exchange
if the corporation were a party to the
transaction.

Bylaw Provision.   Atlantic’s bylaws
provide that the “control share”
acquisition restrictions under the

shall not apply to any acquisition by any

Board, in whole or in part, and, upon
such repeal, may, to the extent provided

Fundamental Business
Transactions

State Law.   Under the Maryland General
Corporation Law, a Maryland
corporation generally cannot merge,
convert, sell all or substantially all of its
assets or engage in a statutory share
exchange, unless declared advisable by
the board of directors and approved by
the affirmative vote of stockholders
entitled to cast at least two-thirds of the
votes entitled to be cast on the matter.
However, a Maryland corporation may
provide in its articles of incorporation
for approval of these matters by a
lesser percentage, but not less than a
majority of all of the votes entitled to be
cast on the matter.

State Law.   Under the Georgia Business
Corporation Code, subject to certain
exceptions, a merger, share exchange or
sale, lease, exchange or transfer of all or
substantially all of the corporation’s assets
generally must be approved at a meeting
of a corporation’s shareholders by the:
(i) affirmative vote of a majority of all the
votes entitled to be cast on the matter; and
(ii) in addition, with respect to a merger or
share exchange, affirmative vote of a
majority of all the votes entitled to be cast
by holders of the shares of each voting
group entitled to vote separately on the
transaction as a group by the articles of
incorporation.

Charter Provision.   Atlantic’s articles of
incorporation provide that,
notwithstanding any provision of the
Maryland General Corporation Law
requiring stockholder authorization of an
action by a greater proportion than a
majority of the total number of shares of
all classes of capital stock or of the total
number of shares of any class of capital
stock, such action shall be valid and
effective if authorized by the affirmative
vote of the holders of a majority of the
total number of shares of all classes
outstanding and entitled to vote thereon.

Charter Provision.   Ameris’s articles of
incorporation do not contain any
provision regarding approval of
fundamental business transactions by the
holders of Ameris common stock.

Non-Shareholder
Constituency Provision

Atlantic’s articles of incorporation
provide that the board of directors of
Atlantic, when evaluating: (i) any offer
of another person to (a) make a tender or
exchange offer for any equity security of
Atlantic, (b) merge or consolidate
Atlantic with another corporation or
entity, or (c) purchase or otherwise
acquire all or substantially all of the
properties and assets of Atlantic; or (ii)
any other actual or proposed transaction
that would or may involve a change in

The following unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial information and accompanying notes
show the impact on the historical financial conditions and results of operations of Ameris and Atlantic and have
been prepared to illustrate the effects of the merger under the acquisition method of accounting. See “The Merger 
— Accounting Treatment.”

The unaudited pro forma combined condensed balance sheet as of September 30, 2017, is presented as if the
merger had occurred on September 30, 2017. The unaudited pro forma combined condensed income statements
for the year ended December 31, 2016, and the nine months ended September 30, 2017, are presented as if the
merger had occurred on January 1, 2016. The historical combined condensed financial information has been
adjusted to reflect factually supportable items that are directly attributable to the merger and, with respect to the
income statements only, expected to have a continuing impact on consolidated results of operations.

The unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial statements are provided for informational purposes
only. The unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial statements are not necessarily, and should not be
assumed to be, an indication of the results that would have been achieved had the merger been completed as of
the dates indicated or that may be achieved in the future. The preparation of the unaudited pro forma combined
condensed financial statements and related adjustments required management to make certain assumptions and
estimates. The unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial statements should be read together with:

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 1 — Basis of Pro Forma Presentation
The unaudited pro forma condensed balance sheet as of September 30, 2017, and the unaudited pro forma

condensed income statements for the nine months ended September 30, 2017, and the year ended December 31,
2016, are based on the historical financial statements of Ameris and Atlantic after giving effect to the completion
of the merger and the assumptions and adjustments described in the accompanying notes. Such financial
statements do not reflect cost savings or operating synergies expected to result from the merger, or the costs to
achieve these cost savings or operating synergies, or any anticipated disposition of assets that may result from the
integration of the operations of the two companies.

The transaction will be accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with
Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 805, Business Combinations (“ASC 805”). In business
combination transactions in which the consideration given is not in the form of cash (that is, in the form of non-
cash assets, liabilities incurred, or equity interests issued), measurement of the acquisition consideration is based
on the fair value of the consideration given or the fair value of the asset (or net assets) acquired, whichever is
more clearly evident and, thus, more reliably measurable.

Under ASC 805, all of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are recognized
at their acquisition-date fair value, while transaction costs and restructuring costs associated with the business
combination are expensed as incurred. The excess of the acquisition consideration over the fair value of assets
acquired and liabilities assumed, if any, is allocated to goodwill. Changes in deferred tax asset valuation
allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date generally affect income tax expense.
Subsequent to the completion of the merger, Ameris and Atlantic will finalize an integration plan, which may
affect how the assets acquired, including intangible assets, will be utilized by the combined company. For those
assets in the combined company that will be phased out or will no longer be used, additional amortization,
depreciation and possibly impairment charges will be recorded after management completes the integration plan.

The unaudited pro forma information is presented solely for informational purposes and is not necessarily
indicative of the combined results of operations or financial position that might have been achieved for the
periods or dates indicated, nor is it necessarily indicative of the future results of the combined company.

Note 2 — Preliminary Estimated Acquisition Consideration
Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, Atlantic stockholders will receive 0.17 shares of Ameris common

stock plus $1.39 in cash, without interest, for each share of Atlantic common stock.

Based on Atlantic’s estimated shares of Atlantic common stock outstanding as of September 30, 2017, the
preliminary estimated acquisition consideration is as follows, assuming all shares of Atlantic common stock, with
the exception of 63,474 unallocated shares of Atlantic common stock held by the Atlantic ESOP which are
assumed to be cancelled for the repayment of the Atlantic ESOP Loan, are exchanged for the per share stock
consideration (in thousands):

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Note 3 — Preliminary Estimated Acquisition Consideration Allocation

Under the acquisition method of accounting, the total acquisition consideration is allocated to the acquired
tangible and intangible assets and assumed liabilities of Atlantic based on their estimated fair values as of the
closing of the merger. The excess of the acquisition consideration over the fair value of assets acquired and
liabilities assumed, if any, is allocated to goodwill.

The allocation of the estimated acquisition consideration is preliminary because the proposed merger has not
yet been completed. The preliminary allocation is based on estimates, assumptions, valuations, and other studies
which have not progressed to a stage where there is sufficient information to make a definitive allocation.
Accordingly, the acquisition consideration allocation unaudited pro forma adjustments will remain preliminary
until Ameris management determines the final acquisition consideration and the fair values of assets acquired and
liabilities assumed. The final determination of the acquisition consideration allocation is anticipated to be
completed as soon as practicable after the completion of the merger and will be based on the value of the Ameris
common stock at the closing of the merger. The final amounts allocated to assets acquired and liabilities assumed
could differ significantly from the amounts presented in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined
consolidated financial statements.

The total preliminary estimated acquisition consideration as shown in the table above is allocated to
Atlantic’s tangible and intangible assets and liabilities as of September 30, 2017, based on their preliminary
estimated fair values as follows (in thousands):

Preliminary Estimated Acquisition Consideration Allocation

Cash and due from banks $ 4,091
Federal funds sold and interest bearing deposits in banks 38,143
Investment securities available for sale 39,113
Other investments 7,228
Loans held for sale 5,025
Loans, net of unearned income 780,864
Other real estate owned 141
Premises and equipment 14,360
Deferred income taxes 5,177
Cash value of bank owned life insurance 17,887
Other assets 4,542
Deposits (676,416
Other borrowings (155,140
Other liabilities (3,283
Intangible assets 7,121
Goodwill 59,586

Total Preliminary Estimated Acquisition Consideration $ 148,439

Approximately $7.1 million has been preliminarily allocated to amortizable intangible assets acquired. The
amortization related to the preliminary fair value of net amortizable intangible assets is reflected as a pro forma
adjustment to the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements.

Identifiable intangible assets.   The preliminary fair values of intangible assets were determined based on the
provisions of ASC 805, which defines fair value in accordance with ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements
and Disclosures (“ASC 820”). ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or
paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
Intangible assets were identified that met either the separability criterion or the contractual-legal criterion
described in ASC 805. The preliminary allocation to intangible assets is allocated to core deposit intangibles.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Goodwill.   Goodwill represents the excess of the preliminary estimated acquisition consideration over the
preliminary fair value of the underlying net tangible and intangible assets. Among the factors that contributed to a
purchase price in excess of the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets are the skill sets, operations,
customer base and organizational cultures that can be leveraged to enable the combined company to build an
enterprise greater than the sum of its parts. In accordance with ASC Topic 350, Intangibles — Goodwill and
Other, goodwill will not be amortized, but instead will be tested for impairment at least annually and whenever
events or circumstances have occurred that may indicate a possible impairment. In the event management
determines that the value of goodwill has become impaired, the combined company will incur an accounting
charge for the amount of the impairment during the period in which the determination is made.

Note 4 — Preliminary Unaudited Pro Forma and Acquisition Accounting Adjustments

The unaudited pro forma financial information is not necessarily indicative of what the financial position
actually would have been had the merger been completed at the date indicated. Such information includes
adjustments which are preliminary and may be revised. Such revisions may result in material changes. The
financial position shown herein is not necessarily indicative of what the past financial position of the combined
companies would have been, nor necessarily indicative of the financial position of the post-merger periods. The
unaudited pro forma financial information does not give consideration to the impact of possible expense
efficiencies, synergies, strategy modifications, asset dispositions or other actions that may result from the merger.

The following unaudited pro forma adjustments result from accounting for the merger, including the
determination of fair value of the assets, liabilities, and commitments which Ameris, as the acquirer for
accounting purposes, will acquire from Atlantic. The descriptions related to these preliminary adjustments are as
follows (in thousands):

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Pursuant to the acquisition method of accounting, the final acquisition consideration will be based on the
price of the Ameris common stock immediately prior to the effective time of the merger. A 20% difference in per
share price at the closing of the merger compared to the amount used in these unaudited pro forma condensed
combined financial statements would increase or decrease total acquisition consideration and goodwill by
approximately $25.4 million.

FUTURE ATLANTIC STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS

Advanced Notice of Business to be Conducted at an Atlantic Annual Meeting

Atlantic’s bylaws provide an advance notice procedure for stockholder proposals and nominations for
director to be brought before an annual meeting of stockholders of Atlantic. In order for a stockholder to properly
bring business before an annual meeting, or to propose a nominee for director, Atlantic’s Corporate Secretary
must receive written notice at Atlantic’s principal executive office not less than 80 days nor more than 90 days
prior to date of the annual meeting; provided, however, that in the event that less than 90 days’ notice or prior
public disclosure of the date of the annual meeting is provided to stockholders, then, to be timely, written notice
by the stockholder must be received not later than the tenth day following the day on which notice of the meeting
was mailed to stockholders or public announcement of the date of such annual meeting was made. A stockholder
may submit a stockholder proposal and/or nominate someone for director if the stockholder is: (i) a stockholder
of record on the date such stockholder gives the notice described herein and on the record date for the
determination of stockholders entitled to vote at such annual meeting; and (ii) complies with the notice
procedures described herein and in Atlantic’s bylaws.

The notice with respect to stockholder proposals that are not nominations for director must set forth as to
each matter such stockholder proposes to bring before the annual meeting: (i) a brief description of the business
desired to be brought before the annual meeting and the reasons for conducting such business at the annual

stockholder as they appear on Atlantic’s books and of the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the
nomination is made; the class or series and number of shares of Atlantic capital stock which are owned
beneficially or of record by such stockholder and such beneficial owner; a description of all arrangements or
understandings between such stockholder and each proposed nominee and any other person(s) (including their
names) pursuant to which the nomination(s) are to be made by such stockholder; a representation that such
stockholder intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to nominate the person(s) named in its notice;
and any other information relating to such stockholder that would be required to be disclosed in a proxy statement
or other filings required to be made in connection with solicitations of proxies for election of directors pursuant to
Regulation 14A under the Exchange Act or any successor rule or regulation. Such notice must be accompanied
by a written consent of each proposed nominee to be named as a nominee and to serve as a director, if elected.

Nothing in this proxy statement/prospectus shall be deemed to require Atlantic to include in its proxy
statement and proxy relating to an annual meeting any stockholder proposal that does not meet all of the
requirements for inclusion established by the SEC in effect at the time such proposal is received.

Atlantic intends to hold an annual meeting during the year ending December 31, 2018, only if the merger is
not completed. If the merger is not completed, Atlantic’s 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders is expected to be
held in the third quarter of 2018. Accordingly, advance written notice for stockholder proposals and nominations
for director, to be brought before that annual meeting must be received by Atlantic’s Corporate Secretary no
earlier than 80 days and no later than 90 days prior to such meeting. However, if less than 90 days’ notice or prior
public disclosure of the date of such meeting is given to stockholders, any such notice must be delivered or
mailed to Atlantic’s Corporate Secretary not later than the 10th day after the notice or prior public disclosure of
the meeting date. If notice is received outside of these dates, it will be considered untimely, and we will not be
required to present the matter at the stockholders meeting.

Atlantic Stockholder Proposals

In order to be eligible for inclusion in Atlantic’s proxy materials for its 2018 Annual Meeting of
Stockholders, any stockholder proposal to take action at such meeting must have been received at Atlantic’s
principal executive office, 4655 Salisbury Road, Suite 110, Jacksonville, Florida 32256, Attention: Corporate
Secretary, no later than December 18, 2017. Any such proposals will need to be in writing and shall be subject to
the requirements of the proxy rules adopted under the Exchange Act.

and Section 14-2-1107 of the Georgia Business Corporation Code. Upon consummation of the Merger, the

Merger”) with the Georgia Secretary of State and the articles of merger (the “Articles of Merger”) with the
Maryland State Department of Assessments and Taxation pursuant to Section 1.4; and (b) such later date and time
to which Ameris and Atlantic shall agree and as may be specified in accordance with the Georgia Business
Corporation Code.

1.2 Merger Consideration.   Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, at the Effective Time,
automatically by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Ameris, Atlantic or the stockholders
of either of the foregoing:

(a)   Each share of Ameris common stock, $1.00 par value per share (“Ameris Common Stock”), that is
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain outstanding following the
Effective Time and shall be unchanged by the Merger.

(b)   Each share of Atlantic common stock, $0.01 par value per share (“Atlantic Common Stock”),
owned directly by Ameris, Atlantic or any of their respective Subsidiaries (other than shares in trust
accounts, managed accounts or other similar accounts for the benefit of customers or shares held as
collateral for outstanding debt previously contracted) immediately prior to the Effective Time, and each
share of Atlantic Common Stock that is remitted to Atlantic prior to the Effective Time for purposes of
repayment of the Atlantic ESOP Loan as contemplated by Section 5.10(d), shall be cancelled and retired at
the Effective Time without any conversion thereof, and no payment shall be made with respect thereto. Such
cancelled and retired shares of Atlantic Common Stock are referred to collectively as the “Cancelled
Shares”.

(c)   Subject to Section 1.2(f), each share of Atlantic Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than treasury stock and the Cancelled Shares) shall become
and be converted into the right to receive the following consideration, in each case without interest: (i) an
amount of cash equal to $1.39 (the “Cash Consideration”); and (ii) 0.17 validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable shares (the “Exchange Ratio”) of Ameris Common Stock together with cash in lieu of any
fractional shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 1.2(f) (the “Stock Consideration”, and
together with the Cash Consideration, per share, the “Per Share Purchase Price” and, in the aggregate, as
adjusted in accordance with the terms hereof, the “Merger Consideration”). Each certificate previously
representing such shares of Atlantic Common Stock (each, a “Certificate”) shall thereafter represent, subject
to Section 1.3(d), only the right to receive the Merger Consideration. Any reference herein to “Certificate”
shall be deemed, as appropriate, to include reference to book-entry account statements relating to the
ownership of shares of Atlantic Common Stock, and it being further understood that provisions herein
relating to Certificates shall be interpreted in a manner that appropriately accounts for book-entry shares,
including that, in lieu of delivery of a Certificate and a Letter of Transmittal, shares held in book-entry form
may be transferred by means of an “agent’s message” to the Exchange Agent or such other evidence of
transfer as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request.

(d)   At the Effective Time, each option to acquire shares of Atlantic Common Stock (an “Atlantic
Stock Option”) issued pursuant to Atlantic’s equity-based compensation plans identified in Section 2.28(a)
of the Disclosure Schedule (the “Atlantic Stock Plans”), whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall become fully vested and shall be cancelled and converted
automatically into the right to receive a cash payment from Ameris or Ameris Bank (the “Cash-Out
Amount”) in an amount equal to the product of: (i) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration Price over
the exercise price of each such Atlantic Stock Option; and (ii) the number of shares of Atlantic Common
Stock subject to such Atlantic Stock Option to the extent not previously exercised. After the Effective Time,
any such cancelled Atlantic Stock Option shall no longer be exercisable by the former holder thereof, but
shall only entitle the holder to the payment of the Cash-Out Amount, without interest. In the event the

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Atlantic Stock Plans, whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time, shall become fully vested and shall be converted automatically into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration in respect of each share of Atlantic Common Stock underlying such Atlantic Restricted Share
Award. Prior to the Effective Time, Atlantic shall: (i) obtain any necessary consents or make any necessary
amendments to the terms of any outstanding Atlantic Restricted Share Awards or Atlantic Stock Plans to
give effect to the transactions contemplated by this Section 1.2(e); (ii) take all actions as may be necessary to
terminate (and, except as provided in this Section 1.2(e), ensure that neither Atlantic nor Atlantic Coast
Bank remains bound by or liable for) any outstanding Atlantic Restricted Share Awards or other rights to
acquire Atlantic Common Stock; and (iii) ensure that the Atlantic Stock Plans which allow the grant of
Atlantic Restricted Share Awards or other rights to acquire Atlantic Common Stock, if any, will be amended
to eliminate the ability to grant any such Atlantic Restricted Share Awards or other rights to acquire Atlantic
Common Stock effective as of immediately after the Effective Time. At or as promptly as practicable
following the Effective Time (which may be in connection with the payment of the first regular base salary
payment due to such holder following the Closing, but in any event shall occur within thirty (30) days after
the Effective Time), Ameris or Ameris Bank shall deliver the Merger Consideration to the holders of
Atlantic Restricted Share Awards, without interest. Such payments may be reduced by any Taxes withheld
pursuant to Section 1.3(g).

(f)   No scrip or fractional share certificates of Ameris Common Stock shall be issued in connection
with the Merger, and an outstanding fractional share interest will not entitle the owner thereof to vote, to
receive dividends or to have any of the rights of a shareholder with respect to such fractional interest. In lieu
of any fractional interest, there shall be paid in cash, without interest, an amount (computed to the nearest
cent) equal to such fraction multiplied by the purchase price per share of Atlantic Common Stock as
determined by multiplying: (i) the Exchange Ratio; by (ii) the Average Ameris Stock Price.

(g)   If either party should change the number of its outstanding shares as a result of a stock split,
reverse stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, reclassification or similar transaction with respect to
such shares prior to the Effective Time, then the shares to be issued hereunder to holders of Atlantic
Common Stock shall be proportionately and appropriately adjusted; provided, however, that, for the
avoidance of doubt, no such adjustment shall be made with regard to Ameris Common Stock if: (i) Ameris
issues additional shares of Ameris Common Stock and receives consideration for such shares in a bona fide
merger, acquisition or other business combination or third-party transaction or in any issuance of securities
in a capital-raising transaction; or (ii) Ameris issues stock options, restricted stock or restricted stock units or
grants or similar equity awards or Ameris Common Stock upon exercise or vesting of any such grants or
awards.

1.3 Delivery of the Merger Consideration.

(a)   At or prior to the Effective Time, Ameris shall appoint Computershare Inc. to act as exchange
agent (the “Exchange Agent”) and shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, for the benefit of the holders of
Atlantic Common Stock, for exchange in accordance with this Section 1.3, through the Exchange Agent:
(i) certificates of Ameris Common Stock or, at Ameris’s option, evidence of shares of Ameris Common
Stock in book-entry form (collectively, “New Certificates”) to be issued in exchange for the Stock
Consideration; and (ii) cash in an amount sufficient to pay (A) the aggregate cash portion of the Merger
Consideration and (B) cash sufficient to pay cash in lieu of fractional shares in accordance with
Section 1.2(f) (such cash and New Certificates described in the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii), together with
any dividends or distributions with respect thereto, being hereinafter referred to as the “Exchange Fund”).
Ameris shall, after the Effective Time on the appropriate payment date, if applicable, provide or cause to be
provided to the Exchange Agent any dividends or other distributions represented by such deposited shares.
The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Ameris for
Ameris’s benefit pending payment thereof by the Exchange Agent to the holders of Atlantic Common Stock
pursuant to this Article I; provided, however, that no investment of such deposited funds directed by Ameris
shall relieve Ameris or the Exchange Agent from promptly making the payments required by this Article I,
and following any losses from any such investment, Ameris shall promptly provide additional funds to the
Exchange Agent, for the benefit of

the holders of Atlantic Common Stock, in the amount of such losses, which additional funds will be held and
disbursed in the same manner as funds initially deposited with the Exchange Agent. Ameris shall direct the
Exchange Agent to hold the Exchange Fund for the benefit of the former holders of Atlantic Common Stock
and to make payments from the Exchange Fund in accordance with this Article I. The Exchange Fund shall
not be used for any purpose other than to fund payments pursuant to this Article I, except as expressly
provided for in this Agreement.

(b)   Ameris shall direct the Exchange Agent to mail no later than five (5) Business Days after the
Effective Time (the mailing date of such letter of transmittal being referred to herein as the “Mailing Date”)

shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the holder’s Certificate or Certificates
shall pass, only upon delivery of such Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the Exchange
Agent, and shall otherwise be in such form and have such other provisions as Ameris may reasonably
specify (the “Letter of Transmittal”); and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration. Upon the surrender of Certificates (or affidavits of loss
in lieu thereof) for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, and delivery of a Letter of Transmittal, duly
executed and properly completed, with respect to such Certificates, the record holder of such Certificates
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration to be paid therefor pursuant to this
Article I. No interest shall be paid or accrue on any cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate. For
purposes of this Agreement, a “Business Day” is any day other than Saturday, Sunday, a day which is a legal
holiday in Florida or Georgia or a day on which commercial banks in Florida or Georgia are authorized or

shall be no further registration of transfers of Atlantic Common Stock on the records of Atlantic. The
Merger Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this Article I with respect to any Atlantic
Common Stock shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining thereto. From
and after the Effective Time, the holders of shares of Atlantic Common Stock outstanding immediately prior
thereto shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto except as otherwise provided for herein or by
Applicable Law.

(d)   No dividends or other distributions with respect to Atlantic Common Stock shall be paid to the
holder of any unsurrendered Atlantic Common Stock with respect to the shares of Ameris Common Stock
represented thereby, in each case unless and until the surrender of each outstanding share of such Atlantic
Common Stock in accordance with this Section 1.3. Subject to the effect of applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Laws, following surrender of any such share of such Atlantic Common Stock in
accordance with this Section 1.3, the record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive, without interest:
(i) the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore
payable with respect to the whole shares of Ameris Common Stock represented by such Atlantic Common
Stock and paid prior to such surrender date; and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of
dividends or other distributions payable with respect to shares of Ameris Common Stock represented by
such Atlantic Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time (but before such surrender date)
and with a payment date subsequent to the issuance of the Ameris Common Stock issuable with respect to
such Atlantic Common Stock.

(e)   At any time following the first anniversary of the Effective Time (or such earlier date immediately
prior to such time when the amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental
Authority), Ameris shall be entitled to require the Exchange Agent to deliver to it any portion of the
Exchange Fund (including any interest or investment income received with respect thereto) not disbursed to
holders of Atlantic Common Stock, and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look only to Ameris
(subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) as general creditors thereof with respect to
the Merger Consideration payable upon due surrender of their Certificates and compliance with the
procedures set forth in this Section 1.3, without interest. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Ameris nor
the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any holder of Atlantic Common Stock for Merger Consideration
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. For
purposes of this Agreement, “Governmental Authority” means any governmental, regulatory or

(f)   If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent or Ameris, as
applicable, shall issue in exchange therefor upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof,
the Merger Consideration into which such shares of Atlantic Common Stock formerly represented thereby
were converted pursuant to this Article I; provided, however, that the Exchange Agent, or Ameris, as
applicable, may, in its reasonable discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of such Merger
Consideration, as applicable, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate to deliver a
customary indemnity agreement or provide a bond in a customary amount.

deduct and withhold, from the Merger Consideration and any other amounts otherwise payable pursuant to

the making of such payment under the Code. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and remitted on a
timely basis to the appropriate Governmental Authority by or on behalf of Ameris or Ameris Bank, such

respect of which such deduction and withholding was made. For purposes of this Agreement, “Person”

TABLE OF CONTENTS

(b)   Section 2.28(b) of the Disclosure Schedule lists separately any employee benefit plan within the
meaning of Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”)
(whether or not subject to ERISA), sponsored, maintained or contributed to by Atlantic or its ERISA
Affiliates or with respect to which Atlantic or any of its ERISA Affiliates has any liability (direct or indirect,
contingent, as the result of any indemnity or guaranty or otherwise) (collectively, “ERISA Plans”). True,
correct and complete copies of all ERISA Plans and, to the extent applicable, all related trust agreements,
insurance contracts, summary plan descriptions, Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) determination letters
and filings, the past three (3) years of actuarial reports and valuations, the three (3) most recent annual
reports and Form 5500 filings (including attachments) and all material correspondence relating to any
ERISA Plan from or with any Governmental Authority in the last three (3) years, have been delivered to
Ameris.

(c)   Atlantic and its ERISA Affiliates are not currently and have never in the past six (6) years been
required to contribute to or had any liability (direct or indirect, contingent, as the result of any indemnity or
guaranty or otherwise) with respect to: (i) a multiemployer plan as defined in Section 3(37)(A) or 4001(a)(3)
of ERISA; (ii) an employee benefit plan within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA that is subject to
Section 302 or Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 or 430 of the Code; (iii) a multiple employer plan within

employer welfare plan within the meaning of Section 3(40)(A) of ERISA. For purposes of this Agreement,
the term “ERISA Affiliate” means any Person within the meaning of Section 3(9) of ERISA, or any trade or
business (whether or not incorporated), that, together with Atlantic or any of its Subsidiaries, would be
treated at the relevant time as a single employer within the meaning of Section 414 of the Code or 4001(a) of
ERISA.

(d)   Each Atlantic Plan has been established, operated and administered in all material respects in
accordance with its terms and in accordance with, and has been amended to comply with (unless such
amendment is not yet required), all Applicable Laws, including ERISA, the Code and the regulations issued
under ERISA and the Code. With respect to each Atlantic Plan, other than routine claims for benefits
submitted in the ordinary course of the benefits process and in accordance with the express terms of such
Atlantic Plans, no litigation or administrative or other proceeding is pending or, to the knowledge of
Atlantic, threatened involving such Atlantic Plan or any of its assets or fiduciaries. With respect to each
Atlantic Plan, neither Atlantic nor any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective directors, officers,
employees or agents or any fiduciary of any Atlantic Plan has been engaged in or been a party to any
transaction relating to the Atlantic Plan which could reasonably be expected to constitute a breach of
fiduciary duty under ERISA or a “prohibited transaction” (as such term is defined in Section 406 of ERISA
or Section 4975 of the Code), unless such transaction is specifically permitted under Sections 407 or 408 of
ERISA, Section 4975 of the Code or a class or administrative exemption issued by the Department of Labor.
Each Atlantic Plan that is a group health plan within the meaning of Section 607(l) of ERISA and
Section 4980B of the Code is in material compliance with: (i) the continuation coverage requirements of
Section 501 of ERISA and Section 4980B of the Code and other Applicable Laws; and (ii) the applicable
requirements of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended.

(e)   With respect to each Atlantic Plan, all contributions or other remittances required by such plan or
Applicable Law have been made, or will be made, on a timely basis.

(f)   Each Atlantic Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code, and its related
trust, respectively, has received a favorable determination letter (or opinion letter) from the IRS as to the
qualification of such plan and the tax-exempt status of the related trust (or has filed with the IRS a request
for such a determination letter within the applicable remedial amendment period or is a prototype plan for
which the prototype plan sponsor has received a favorable opinion letter or advisory opinion from the IRS as
to the qualification of the prototype plan on which Atlantic or its applicable Subsidiary may rely) and, to the
knowledge of Atlantic, no event has occurred, and no condition exists, that would reasonably be expected to
cause the loss of such qualified or tax-exempt status or the imposition of any liability, tax or penalty under
ERISA or the Code.

(g)   Neither Atlantic nor any of its Subsidiaries provides or has any obligation to provide benefits,
including death, health, post-retirement life insurance or medical benefits (whether or not

insured), with respect to current or former employees of Atlantic or any of its Subsidiaries or their spouses,
dependents or beneficiaries beyond the employees’ retirement or other termination of employment or service
with Atlantic or any of its Subsidiaries, other than coverage mandated by Applicable Law and at the sole
expense of such employees or their spouses, dependents or beneficiaries.

(h)   Except as set forth in Section 2.28(h) of the Disclosure Schedule, neither this Agreement nor any
transaction contemplated hereby (either alone or in combination with any other event) will: (i) entitle any
current or former employee, officer, director or other service provider of Atlantic or any of its Subsidiaries
to any payment or benefit, including any bonus, retention, severance pay, retirement pay, unemployment
compensation or any similar or other payment; (ii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting of, or increase
the amount of compensation or benefits due any such employee, officer, director or other service provider;
(iii) increase any benefits, or accelerate the time of payment or any benefits, otherwise payable under any
Atlantic Plan; (iv) trigger any material obligation under any Atlantic Plan, including any funding thereof; or
(v) cause the payment of any “excess parachute payment” (as defined in Section 280G of the Code). No
Atlantic Plan provides for the gross up of Taxes under Code Sections 409A or 4999.

(i)   Each Atlantic Plan that is subject to Section 409A of the Code has been maintained in written form,
and administered and operated, in compliance in all material respects with Section 409A of the Code and the
regulations and rulings thereunder.

(j)   There is no audit or investigation pending with respect to any Atlantic Plan before any
Governmental Authority and, to the knowledge of Atlantic, no such audit or investigation is threatened.

(k)   Atlantic has properly accrued on its financial statements in all material respects the correct number
of days for all vacation, sick leave, personal time and paid time off credited to employees and individual
consultants of Atlantic or any of its Subsidiaries as of the date of such financial statements. Atlantic or its
applicable Subsidiary has, for each Atlantic Plan and all other purposes, including Taxes and participation in
Atlantic Plans, correctly classified all natural persons and, if applicable, their disregarded entities providing
services to Atlantic or any of its Subsidiaries as common law employees or independent contractors, as
appropriate.

(l)   Neither Atlantic nor any of its Subsidiaries has entered into any commitment to modify or amend
any Atlantic Plan (other than in the ordinary course and consistent with past practice or as required by
Applicable Law) or to establish any new benefit plan, program or arrangement. There has been no
amendment to any Atlantic Plan, interpretation or announcement by Atlantic or any of its Subsidiaries
relating to any Atlantic Plan or written notice or arrangement, or change in eligibility, participation or
coverage under any Atlantic Plan, that would increase the expense of maintaining any such Atlantic Plan
above the level of expense incurred or with respect to such Atlantic Plan for the most-recently completed
fiscal year of Atlantic and its Subsidiaries.

(m)   Each pension plan, within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA, that is not intended to be
qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code is exempt from Parts 2, 3 and 4 of ERISA as an unfunded plan
that is maintained primarily for the purpose of providing deferred compensation for a select group of
management or highly compensated employees pursuant to Sections 201(2), 301(a)(3) and 401(a)(1) of
ERISA. No assets of any such pension plan have been set aside to pay the obligations under such pension
plan in a rabbi trust or otherwise.

(n)   The Atlantic Coast Financial Corporation Employee Stock Ownership Plan (the “Atlantic ESOP”)
grants to its participants full voting rights as to all shares of Atlantic Common Stock held by the Atlantic
ESOP on behalf of such participants and that have been allocated to their accounts.

2.29 Employment and Labor Matters.   Neither Atlantic nor any of its Subsidiaries is, or has been, a
party to any collective bargaining agreement or agreement of any kind with any union or labor organization or to
any agreement with any of its employees which is not terminable at will or upon ninety (90) days’ notice at the
election of, and without cost or penalty to, Atlantic or any of its Subsidiaries. Neither Atlantic nor any of its
Subsidiaries has received at any time in the past five (5) years any demand

for recognition from any union, and no attempt has been made during such time to organize any of its employees.

Relations Act, as amended, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, as amended, and all other federal, state
and local labor Laws applicable to employees. Except as described in Section 2.29 of the Disclosure Schedule:

or any of its Subsidiaries; and (b) there are, and in the past three (3) years there have been, no charges,
complaints, claims or proceedings, pending, or to the knowledge of Atlantic, threatened against, or involving, as
the case may be, Atlantic or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to any alleged violation of any wage and hour
Laws, age discrimination act Laws, employment discrimination Laws or any other claims arising out of any
employment relationship as to any of employee of Atlantic or any of its Subsidiaries or as to any person seeking
employment therefrom, and no such violations exist. All employees and independent contractors of Atlantic and
its Subsidiaries are properly classified as such for all purposes, including the Atlantic Plans.

2.30 Related-Party Transactions.   Except for: (a) loans and extensions of credit made on substantially
the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions
by Atlantic or any of its Subsidiaries with other Persons who are not affiliated with Atlantic or any of its
Subsidiaries, and which do not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable
features; (b) deposits, all of which are on terms and conditions identical to those made available to all customers
of Atlantic Coast Bank at the time such deposits were entered into; and (c) transactions specifically described in
Section 2.30 of the Disclosure Schedule, there are no contracts with or commitments to present or former
five percent (5%) or greater stockholders, directors, officers or employees involving the expenditure of more than
$50,000 as to any one individual, including with respect to any business directly or indirectly controlled by any
such Person, or $100,000 for all such contracts or commitments in the aggregate for all such individuals (other
than contracts or commitments relating to services to be performed by any officer, director or employee as a
currently-employed employee of Atlantic or any of its Subsidiaries).

2.31 Approvals, Consents and Filings.   Except for the Required Regulatory Approvals, neither the

materially impede or delay Ameris and Atlantic from obtaining the Required Regulatory Approvals without the
imposition of any Burdensome Regulatory Condition.

2.32 Absence of Brokers.   Except for Hovde Group, LLC (“Hovde”) and B. Riley FBR, Inc.
(“B. Riley FBR”), which have provided financial advisory services to Atlantic, no broker, finder or other
financial consultant has acted on behalf of Atlantic or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with this Agreement

that that are currently owed to Hovde and to B. Riley FBR and that will be owed to Hovde and to B. Riley FBR
as a result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

opinion has not been amended or rescinded as of the date of this Agreement. Atlantic has provided Ameris with a
true and complete copy of such opinion for informational purposes.

applicable with respect to Atlantic. No “fair price” Law or similar provision of the articles of incorporation of
Atlantic or bylaws of Atlantic is applicable to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

stockholders of Atlantic the board’s recommendation that the stockholders adopt and approve this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger (the “Atlantic
Recommendation”), and include the Atlantic Recommendation in the Atlantic Proxy Materials. Neither the
Atlantic board of directors nor any committee thereof shall: (i) withdraw, qualify or modify, or propose
publicly to withdraw, qualify or modify, in a manner adverse to Ameris or any of Ameris’s Subsidiaries, the
Atlantic Recommendation; or (ii) approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend,
any Acquisition Proposal (each, an “Adverse Recommendation Change”); provided, however, that, prior to
the Requisite Atlantic Stockholder Approval, Atlantic’s board of directors may make an Adverse
Recommendation Change if: (A) Atlantic’s board of directors determines in good faith, after consultation
with Atlantic’s financial advisor and outside counsel, that it has received an Acquisition Proposal (that did
not result from a breach of Section 4.19) that is a Superior Proposal and such Superior Proposal has not been
withdrawn; (B) Atlantic’s board of directors determines in good faith, after consultation with Atlantic’s
outside counsel, that a failure to accept such Superior Proposal would be reasonably likely to result in a
breach of the fiduciary duties of the members of the board of directors of Atlantic under Applicable Law;
(C) Atlantic’s board of directors provides written notice (a “Notice of Recommendation Change”) to Ameris
of its receipt of the Superior Proposal and its intent to announce an Adverse Recommendation Change on
the third (3rd) Business Day following delivery of such notice, which notice shall specify the material terms
and conditions of the Superior Proposal (it being understood that any amendment to any material term of
such Superior Proposal shall require a new Notice of Recommendation Change); (D) after providing such
Notice of Recommendation Change, Atlantic negotiates in good faith with Ameris (if requested by Ameris)
and provides Ameris reasonable opportunity during the three (3)-Business Day period following the Notice
of Recommendation Change to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement as
would enable Atlantic’s board of directors to proceed without an Adverse Recommendation Change;
provided, however, that Ameris shall not be required to propose any such adjustments; and (E) Atlantic’s
board of directors, following the final such three (3)-Business Day period, again determines in good faith,
after consultation with Atlantic’s financial advisor and

TABLE OF CONTENTS

outside counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal nonetheless continues to constitute a Superior Proposal and
that failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to result in a breach of the fiduciary duties of the
members of the board of directors of Atlantic under Applicable Law.

(c)   For purposes of this Agreement:

(i)   The term “Acquisition Proposal” means: (A) any proposal or offer with respect to a merger,
joint venture, partnership, consolidation, dissolution, liquidation, tender offer, recapitalization,
reorganization, rights offering, share exchange, business combination or similar transaction involving
Atlantic or any of its Subsidiaries; or (B) any acquisition by any Person resulting in, or proposal or
offer, which, if consummated, would result in, any Person becoming the beneficial owner, directly or
indirectly, of more than twenty percent (20%) of the total voting power of any class of equity securities
of Atlantic or any of its Subsidiaries, or more than twenty percent (20%) of the consolidated total assets
of Atlantic or any of its Subsidiaries, in each case, other than the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

(ii)   The term “Superior Proposal” means any bona fide written Acquisition Proposal with respect
to which the board of directors of Atlantic: (A) determines in good faith that such Acquisition Proposal,
if accepted, is reasonably likely to be consummated on a timely basis, taking into account all legal,
financial, regulatory and other aspects of the Acquisition Proposal and the Person making the
Acquisition Proposal; and (B) determines in good faith (based on, among other things, the advice of
Atlantic’s financial advisor) to be more favorable to Atlantic’s stockholders than the Merger taking into
account all relevant factors (including whether, in the good faith judgment of the board of directors of
Atlantic, after obtaining the advice of the Atlantic’s financial advisor, the Person making such
Acquisition Proposal is reasonably able to finance the transaction and close it timely, and any proposed
changes to this Agreement that may be proposed by Ameris in response to such Acquisition Proposal);
provided, however that for purposes of the definition of Superior Proposal, the references to
twenty percent (20%) in the definition of Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be references to
fifty percent (50%).

5.3 Access to Properties, Books and Records.   Atlantic shall allow Ameris and its authorized
representatives full access, upon reasonable prior notice, during normal business hours from and after the date
hereof and prior to the Closing Date to all of Atlantic’s properties, books, contracts, commitments and records
and those of its Subsidiaries and shall furnish Ameris and its authorized representatives such information
concerning its affairs and the affairs of its Subsidiaries as Ameris may reasonably request; provided, however,
that such request shall be reasonably related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and shall not
interfere unreasonably with normal operations. Atlantic shall cause its and its Subsidiaries’ personnel, employees
and other representatives to assist Ameris in making any such investigation. During such investigation, Ameris
and its authorized representatives shall have the right to make copies of such records, files, Tax Returns and other
materials as it may deem advisable and shall advise Atlantic of those items of which copies are made. No
investigation made heretofore or hereafter by Ameris and its authorized representatives shall affect the
representations and warranties of Atlantic hereunder.

5.4 Confidentiality.   Prior to consummation of the Merger, the parties to this Agreement have provided
and will provide one another with information which may be deemed by the party providing the information to be
confidential, including information regarding such party’s operations, customers (including consumer financial
information), business and financial condition. Each party agrees that it will hold confidential and protect all
information provided to it by each other party or such party’s affiliates or representatives, except that the
obligations contained in this Section 5.4 shall not in any way restrict the rights of any party to use information
that: (a) was known to such party prior to the disclosure by the other party; (b) is or becomes generally available
to the public other than by breach of this Agreement; (c) is provided by one party for disclosure concerning such
party in the Ameris Registration Statement; or (d) otherwise becomes lawfully available to a party to this
Agreement on a non-confidential basis from a third party who is not under an obligation of confidence to the
other party to this Agreement. If this Agreement is terminated prior to the Closing, then, upon request, each party
hereto agrees to return all documents, statements and other written materials, whether or not confidential, and all
copies thereof,

provided to it by or on behalf of the other party to this Agreement. The provisions of this Section 5.4 shall
survive termination, for any reason whatsoever, of this Agreement, and, without limiting the remedies of the
parties hereto in the event of any breach of this Section 5.4, the parties hereto will be entitled to seek injunctive
relief against the other party in the event of a breach or threatened breach of this Section 5.4.

5.5 Cooperation.   Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the parties hereto shall use
commercially reasonable efforts in good faith to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary or advisable so as to permit consummation of the Merger as promptly as practicable
and shall cooperate fully with each other to that end.

5.6 Expenses.   All of the expenses incurred by Ameris in connection with the authorization,
preparation, execution and performance of this Agreement and the Bank Merger Agreement, including all fees
and expenses of its agents, representatives, counsel and accountants and the fees and expenses related to filing the
Ameris Registration Statement and all regulatory applications with state and federal authorities in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, shall be paid by Ameris. All expenses incurred by
Atlantic in connection with the authorization, preparation, execution and performance of this Agreement and the
Bank Merger Agreement, including all fees and expenses of its agents, representatives, counsel and accountants
in connection with all regulatory applications to be filed with state and federal authorities in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby and the cost of reproducing and mailing the Atlantic Proxy
Materials, shall be paid by Atlantic.

5.7 Preservation of Business and Goodwill.   Each party hereto shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to, during the period from the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, conduct its business
in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice, except as expressly contemplated by this
Agreement or as required by Applicable Law or with the prior written consent of the other party, and use its
commercially reasonable efforts to preserve its business organization, to keep available the services of its present
employees and to preserve the goodwill of customers and others having business relations with it.

5.8 Approvals and Consents.   Each party hereto represents and warrants to and covenants with the
other that it will use its commercially reasonable efforts, and will cause its officers, directors, employees and
agents and its Subsidiaries and any Subsidiary’s officers, directors, employees and agents to use their
commercially reasonable efforts, to obtain as promptly as is reasonably practicable all regulatory authorizations,
consents, orders or approvals from: (a) the Federal Reserve, the FDIC and the GDBF; and (b) any other approvals
set forth in Section 2.31 that are necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including the Merger and the Bank Merger, or those the failure of which to be obtained would reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Ameris or Atlantic (collectively,
the “Required Regulatory Approvals”). Ameris shall file all applications or notices for Required Regulatory
Approvals within forty-five (45) days. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained herein shall be deemed
to require Ameris, or require or permit Atlantic, to take any action, or commit to take any action, or agree to any
condition or restriction, in connection with obtaining the Required Regulatory Approvals that would:
(i) reasonably be expected to result in Ameris or Ameris Bank becoming subject to any cease-and-desist order or
other order, formal or informal enforcement action issued by, or written agreement, consent agreement, operating
agreement, memorandum of understanding, commitment letter or similar undertaking with, or any request to
adopt any board resolutions by, any Governmental Authority; or (ii) reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on Ameris and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving effect to the Merger (including, for
the avoidance of doubt, any determination by any Governmental Authority that the Bank Merger may not be
consummated as contemplated in the Bank Merger Agreement or in a substantially similar manner immediately
following the Effective Time) (any of the foregoing matters in clauses (i) and (ii), a “Burdensome Regulatory
Condition”).

5.9 Press Releases.   Prior to the Closing Date, Ameris and Atlantic must each approve the form,
substance and timing of any press release or other public disclosure materially related to this Agreement or any
other transaction contemplated hereby; provided, however, that nothing in this Section 5.9 shall be deemed to
prohibit Ameris or Atlantic from making any disclosure which its counsel deems necessary or advisable in order
to satisfy Ameris’s or Atlantic’s, as the case may be, disclosure obligations imposed by any Applicable Law or
stock exchange listing requirement.

5.10 Employee Benefits and Agreements.

(a)   Following the Closing Date, Ameris shall, or shall cause its applicable Subsidiary to, provide
generally to employees of Atlantic and its Subsidiaries who continue employment with Ameris or any of its
Subsidiaries following the Closing Date (“Atlantic Continuing Employees”) medical, dental, vacation and
long-term disability benefits, medical and dependent care flexible spending accounts, severance and life
insurance (collectively, “Employee Benefits”), on terms and conditions consistent in all material respects
with those then currently provided by Ameris or its Subsidiaries to its other similarly-situated employees.
For purposes of eligibility to participate and any vesting determinations (but not benefit accruals) in
connection with the provision of any such Employee Benefits by Ameris or its Subsidiaries to the Atlantic
Continuing Employees, service with Atlantic or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing Date shall be
counted to the extent such service was counted under the similar plan of Atlantic or its Subsidiary. The
Atlantic Continuing Employees’ prior service with Atlantic or any of its Subsidiaries shall also be credited
for purposes of all waiting periods for participation in any of such Employee Benefits to the extent such
service was counted under the similar plan of Atlantic or its Subsidiary. Ameris or its applicable Subsidiary
shall also waive all restrictions and limitations for preexisting conditions under Ameris’s Employee Benefit
plans, to the extent such restrictions or limitations would not apply to the Atlantic Continuing Employees
under the similar plan of Atlantic or its Subsidiary. Ameris or its applicable Subsidiary shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to provide the Atlantic Continuing Employees with credit under Ameris’s
group health Employee Benefit plans, for the plan year of such plans which includes the Closing Date,
towards any applicable deductibles under Ameris’s group health Employee Benefit plans for the aggregate
amounts paid by such employees toward applicable deductibles under Atlantic’s group health Employee
Benefit plans for the plan year of such plans which includes the Closing Date.

(b)   Subject to applicable legal requirements, Ameris and Atlantic shall take such other actions prior to
the Closing Date as may be reasonably necessary to enable the employees of Atlantic and its Subsidiaries
after the Closing Date to rollover the amount credited to their accounts under the Atlantic 401(k) Plan
through a rollover contribution into a defined contribution retirement plan with a 401(k) feature of Ameris or
its Subsidiaries (the “Ameris 401(k) Plan”), if such employees are Atlantic Continuing Employees, or to
transfer the amount credited to their accounts through an eligible rollover contribution to a separate third-
party individual retirement account (after the deemed distribution of any participant loans as reflected in
such accounts), or to take a cash distribution from the Atlantic 401(k) Plan (after the deemed distribution of
any participant loans as reflected in such accounts), provided that: (i) Atlantic’s board of directors shall
adopt resolutions to terminate the Atlantic 401(k) Plan and cease all further deferrals with respect to eligible
compensation no later than the Business Day immediately prior to the Closing Date; and (ii) the foregoing
shall be subject to the receipt of a final favorable IRS determination letter (or prototype sponsor letter) with
respect to the Atlantic 401(k) Plan to the extent reasonably required by Ameris and completion of such other
actions as may be required by applicable legal requirements. For purposes of any vesting determinations (but
not benefit accruals) in connection with the Ameris 401(k) Plan in which any Atlantic Continuing
Employees may participate after the Closing Date, service with Atlantic or any of its Subsidiaries prior to
the Closing Date shall be counted to the extent such service was counted under the Atlantic 401(k) Plan. For
purposes of eligibility to participate in any matching contribution under the Ameris 401(k) Plan, Atlantic
Continuing Employees shall be eligible on terms and conditions consistent with those then currently
provided by Ameris to its other similarly-situated employees as of their employment date with Ameris or
any of its Subsidiaries. Prior to the Closing Date, Atlantic shall make any necessary employer contributions
to the Atlantic 401(k) Plan due such Atlantic Continuing Employees for compensation paid by Atlantic prior
to termination of the Atlantic 401(k) Plan.

(c)   Subject to applicable legal requirements, Ameris and Atlantic shall take such other commercially
reasonable actions prior to the Closing Date as may be necessary to terminate or amend the agreements as so
designated (and with respect to an amendment, in the manner specified) on Section 2.28(a) of the Disclosure
Schedule effective as of the Closing Date and any other Atlantic Plans that Ameris directs Atlantic or
Atlantic Coast Bank to terminate or amend prior to the Closing. In connection with such terminations, any
compensation to be provided thereunder shall be paid in full in exchange for a settlement and release
agreement in a form reasonably acceptable to Ameris to the

extent requested by Ameris. Atlantic shall: (i) permit Ameris to review, comment on and approve in advance
any documents or notices required to effect any of the foregoing; and (ii) provide to Ameris prior to the
Closing written evidence as to satisfaction of the requirements of this Section 5.10(c) as Ameris may
reasonably request. Unless terminated prior to Closing pursuant to this Section 5.10(c), Ameris shall honor
any existing employment agreements with any Atlantic Continuing Employees in accordance with their
terms or as otherwise amended by the parties.

(d)   The Atlantic ESOP shall be terminated immediately prior to the Effective Time (the “ESOP
Termination Date”). On the ESOP Termination Date, Atlantic shall direct the Atlantic ESOP trustee to remit
to Atlantic a sufficient number of shares of Atlantic Common Stock held by the Atlantic ESOP’s unallocated
suspense account to repay in full the outstanding balance of the loan between the Atlantic ESOP and
Atlantic (the “Atlantic ESOP Loan”) (with such Atlantic Common Stock valued as of the ESOP Termination
Date). If after remitting all such unallocated shares there remains any unpaid amount outstanding under the
Atlantic ESOP Loan, such unpaid amount, including any unpaid but accrued interest, shall be forgiven by
Atlantic at the Effective Time. All remaining shares of Atlantic Common Stock held by the Atlantic ESOP
as of the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration. Within thirty
(30) days following the date of this Agreement, Atlantic shall file or cause to be filed all necessary
documents with the IRS for a determination letter for termination of the Atlantic ESOP. As soon as
practicable following the receipt of a favorable determination letter from the IRS regarding the qualified
status of the Atlantic ESOP upon its termination, the account balances in the Atlantic ESOP shall either be
distributed to participants and beneficiaries or transferred to an eligible tax-qualified retirement plan or
individual retirement account as a participant or beneficiary may direct. Atlantic shall adopt such
amendments, board resolutions and other documentation as may be necessary to effect the provisions of this
Section 5.10(d).

5.11 Directors’ and Officers’ Tail Coverage.   Prior to the Closing Date, Ameris shall have, at
Ameris’s expense, amended, modified or obtained directors’ and officers’ liability insurance (either through its
existing directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policies or under Atlantic’s existing directors’ and officers’
liability insurance policies, in which event Atlantic will designate Ameris’s insurance broker as Atlantic’s broker-
of-record, as determined by Ameris in its sole discretion) for a period of six (6) years after the Closing Date,
covering any person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date hereof or who becomes prior to the
Closing Date, a director or officer of Atlantic or any of its Subsidiaries, who are currently covered by Atlantic’s
policies on terms similar to such existing insurance; provided, however, that Ameris shall not be obligated to
make aggregate annual premium payments for such six (6)-year period in respect of such policy which exceed
two hundred percent (200%) of the annual premium payments on Atlantic’s current policy in effect as of the date
of this Agreement (the “Maximum Amount”). If the amount of the premiums necessary to maintain or procure
such insurance coverage exceeds the Maximum Amount, then Ameris shall use its reasonable best efforts to
maintain the most advantageous policies of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance obtainable for a premium
equal to the Maximum Amount. The directors and officers of Atlantic and its Subsidiaries shall take all
reasonable actions required by the insurance carrier necessary to procure such endorsement.

5.12 Indemnification.

(a)   For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time (or, in the case of Claims that have not been
resolved prior to the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, until such Claims are finally resolved),
Ameris shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the present and former directors and executive officers of
Atlantic and each of its Subsidiaries (each, an “Indemnified Party”) against all liabilities arising out of,
resulting from or related to any claim, action, suit, proceeding, investigation or other legal proceeding,
whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (each, a “Claim”), in which an Indemnified Party is,
or is threatened to be made, a party or witness arising out of the fact that such Indemnified Party is or was a
director or officer of Atlantic or any of its Subsidiaries (or, at Atlantic’s request, was a director, officer,
manager or trustee of, or in a similar capacity with, another Atlantic entity or Atlantic Plan) prior to the
Effective Time if such Claim pertains to any matter of fact arising, existing or occurring on or prior to the
Effective Time (including the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby), regardless of whether
such Claim is asserted or claimed before, or

TABLE OF CONTENTS

after, the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law. Ameris shall promptly pay
reasonable expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) in advance of the final disposition of any such
Claim to each Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law upon receipt of an
undertaking to repay such advance payments if he or she shall be adjudicated not to be entitled to
indemnification under this Section 5.12(a). Ameris shall not have any obligation hereunder to any
Indemnified Party when and if a federal or state banking agency or other Governmental Authority shall
determine that indemnification of an Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by
Applicable Law (including any Law promulgated, interpreted or enforced by any federal or state banking
agency or other Governmental Authority).

(b)   Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under Section 5.12(a), upon learning of
any such Claim, shall promptly notify Ameris thereof in writing (provided that a failure to timely provide
such notice shall not relieve Ameris of any indemnification obligation unless, and to the extent that, Ameris
is materially prejudiced by such failure). In the event of any such Claim (whether arising before or after the
Effective Time): (i) Ameris shall have the right to assume the defense thereof and Ameris shall not be liable
to such Indemnified Parties for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses subsequently
incurred by such Indemnified Parties in connection with the defense thereof, except that if Ameris elects not
to assume such defense for the Indemnified Parties, or if there are substantive issues which raise conflicts of
interest between Ameris and the Indemnified Parties, then the Indemnified Parties may retain counsel
satisfactory to them, and Ameris shall pay all reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for the
Indemnified Parties promptly as statements therefor are received; provided, however, that Ameris shall be
obligated pursuant to this Section 5.12(b) to pay for only one firm of counsel for any Indemnified Party in
any jurisdiction; (ii) each Indemnified Party will cooperate in good faith in the defense of any such Claim;
(iii) Ameris shall not be liable for any settlement effected without its prior written consent (which shall not
be unreasonably withheld or delayed); and (iv) without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party
(which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) Ameris shall not agree to any settlement which does
not provide for a release of the Indemnified Party.

(c)   Ameris covenants and agrees that neither it, nor any successors or assigns, shall consolidate with or
merge into any other Person where Ameris or any such successor or assign shall not be the continuing or
surviving Person of such consolidation or merger, or transfer all or substantially all of its assets to any
Person, unless, in each case, proper provision shall have been made to ensure that the successors and assigns
of Ameris shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.12.

(d)   The provisions of this Section 5.12 are intended to be for the benefit of and shall be enforceable
by, each Indemnified Party and their respective heirs and legal and personal representatives.

5.13 Certain Litigation.   Each party shall promptly advise the other party orally and in writing of any
actual or threatened stockholder litigation against such party or the members of such party’s board of directors
related to this Agreement or the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Atlantic
shall: (a) permit Ameris to review and discuss in advance, and shall consider in good faith the view of Ameris in
connection with, any proposed written or oral response to such stockholder litigation; (b) furnish Ameris’s
outside legal counsel with all non-privileged information and documents which outside legal counsel may
reasonably request in connection with such stockholder litigation; (c) consult with Ameris regarding the defense
or settlement of any such stockholder litigation; and (d) not settle any such litigation prior to such consultation
and consideration; provided, however, that Atlantic shall not settle any such stockholder litigation if such
settlement requires the payment of money damages without the written consent of Ameris (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld) unless the payment of any such damages by Atlantic is reasonably expected by Atlantic,
following consultation with outside counsel, to be fully covered (disregarding any deductible to be paid by
Atlantic) under Atlantic’s existing director and officer insurance policies, including any tail policy.

5.14 Information Systems Conversion.   From and after the date hereof, Ameris and Atlantic shall use
their commercially reasonable efforts to facilitate the integration of Atlantic with the business of Ameris
following consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and shall meet on a regular basis

TABLE OF CONTENTS

to discuss and plan for the conversion of the telecommunications, data processing and related electronic
information systems of Atlantic and each of its Subsidiaries (the “Information Systems Conversion”) to those
used by Ameris, which planning shall include the following: (a) discussion of third-party service provider
arrangements of Atlantic and each of its Subsidiaries; (b) non-renewal or changeover, after the Effective Time, of
personal property leases and software licenses used by Atlantic and any of its Subsidiaries in connection with
their systems operations; (c) retention of outside consultants and additional employees to assist with such
conversion; (d) outsourcing, as appropriate after the Effective Time, of proprietary or self-provided system
services; and (e) any other actions necessary and appropriate to facilitate such conversion, as soon as practicable
following the Effective Time. Ameris shall promptly reimburse Atlantic on request for any reasonable and
documented out-of-pocket fees, expenses or charges that Atlantic may incur as a result of taking, at the request of
Ameris, any action prior to the Effective Time to facilitate the Information Systems Conversion.

5.15 No Control of Other Party’s Business.   Nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Ameris,
directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the operations of Atlantic or its Subsidiaries prior to the
Effective Time, and nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Atlantic, directly or indirectly, the right to
control or direct the operations of Ameris or its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective
Time, each of Atlantic and Ameris shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
control and supervision over its and its Subsidiaries’ respective operations.

5.16 Director Resignations.   Atlantic shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be
delivered to Ameris resignations, to be effective as of the Effective Time, of all the directors of Atlantic and its
Subsidiaries.

5.17 Restrictive Covenants Agreements.   Concurrently with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement and effective at the Effective Time, Atlantic has caused all of the non-employee directors of Atlantic
and Atlantic Coast Bank to execute and deliver the Director Non-Solicitation Agreements and the Chief
Executive Officer of Atlantic and Atlantic Coast Bank to execute and deliver the Executive Non-Competition
Agreement.

time, as a result of changes or events expressly permitted or contemplated herein or where the failure to be

occurrences that, individually or in the aggregate, have had or would reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Atlantic.

(a)   This Agreement may be terminated at any time on or prior to the Closing Date by Ameris upon
written notice to Atlantic: (i) if the terms, covenants or conditions of this Agreement to be complied with or
performed by Atlantic before the Closing shall not have been substantially complied with or substantially
performed on or prior to the Closing Date and such noncompliance or nonperformance shall not have been
waived by Ameris; or (ii) in the event of a material breach by Atlantic of any covenant, agreement or
obligation contained in this Agreement which breach has not been cured within twenty (20) days after the

TABLE OF CONTENTS

good faith, within twenty (20) days after such written notice, taken steps to cure such breach as promptly as
practicable; provided, however, that in no event shall the cure periods provided in this Section 7.2(a),
without the consent of Ameris, extend past June 30, 2018 or otherwise limit Ameris’s rights under
Section 7.5.

(b)   This Agreement may be terminated at any time on or prior to the Closing Date by Atlantic upon
written notice to Ameris: (i) if the terms, covenants or conditions of this Agreement to be complied with or
performed by Ameris before the Closing shall not have been substantially complied with or substantially
performed on or prior to the Closing Date and such noncompliance or nonperformance shall not have been
waived by Atlantic; or (ii) in the event of a material breach by Ameris of any covenant, agreement or
obligation contained in this Agreement which breach has not been cured within twenty (20) days after the
giving of written notice by Atlantic of such breach or, if such breach is not capable of being cured within
twenty (20) days, Ameris has not actively and in good faith, within twenty (20) days after such written
notice, taken steps to cure such breach as promptly as practicable; provided, however, that in no event shall
the cure periods provided in this Section 7.2(b), without the consent of Atlantic, extend past June 30, 2018
or otherwise limit Atlantic’s rights under Section 7.5.

7.3 Failure to Disclose.   This Agreement may be terminated at any time on or prior to the Closing Date
by Ameris upon written notice to Atlantic, if Ameris learns of any fact or condition that would reasonably be
expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Atlantic or Ameris, which
fact or condition was required to be disclosed by Atlantic pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement and was
not disclosed in this Agreement, the Disclosure Schedule or the Atlantic Financial Statements.

7.4 Regulatory Approval.   This Agreement may be terminated at any time on or prior to the Closing
Date by either party upon written notice to the other party, if any Required Regulatory Approval has been denied

7.5 Termination Date.   This Agreement may be terminated at any time on or prior to the Closing Date

June 30, 2018 (the “Termination Date”), which Termination Date may be extended for a period of three
(3) additional months by either party upon written notice to the other party given on or prior to June 30, 2018;
provided, however, that neither party shall have the right under this Section 7.5 to terminate this Agreement or to
extend the Termination Date if the failure of the Closing to occur by June 30, 2018 shall be due to the failure of
such party to perform or observe the covenants and agreements of such party under this Agreement. If the
Termination Date is extended in accordance with this Section 7.5, then, provided that it does not, and will not,
prevent or impede the Merger from qualifying as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code, the aggregate Cash Consideration payable hereunder as part of the Merger Consideration shall be increased
by the amount of Atlantic’s after-tax net income (calculated in accordance with GAAP consistently applied and
consistent with the preparation of the Atlantic Financial Statements) for the interim period of January 1, 2018
through June 30, 2018.

7.6 Stockholder Vote.   This Agreement may be terminated at any time on or prior to the Closing Date
by either party upon written notice to the other party (provided, in the case of termination by Atlantic, it has
complied with its obligations under Section 5.2(a)), if Atlantic shall have failed to obtain the Requisite Atlantic
Stockholder Approval at the duly convened Special Meeting or at any adjournment thereof at which a vote on the
approval of this Agreement and the Merger was taken.

(a)   This Agreement may be terminated by Atlantic upon written notice to Ameris, if, prior to obtaining
the Requisite Atlantic Stockholder Approval: (i) the board of directors of Atlantic shall have effected an

TABLE OF CONTENTS

terminates this Agreement other than pursuant to Section 7.1(b) or Section 7.2(b); or (ii) Ameris terminates
this Agreement pursuant to this Article VII after an Adverse Recommendation Change, then Atlantic shall
pay, or cause to be paid to Ameris, at the time of the termination of this Agreement, an amount equal to
$5,750,000, which shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Ameris for all claims under this Agreement
based upon, resulting from or arising out of the circumstances giving rise to the termination of this
Agreement, except that Atlantic shall not be relieved from liability arising from any willful breach of any
provision of this Agreement.

7.8 Ameris Stock Price Decline.   This Agreement may be terminated by Atlantic, at any time during
the four (4) Business Day period immediately following the Determination Date, if both of the following
conditions are satisfied:

(a)   the quotient obtained by dividing the Average Ameris Stock Price by the Starting Price (such
quotient being the “Ameris Ratio”) shall be less than 0.85; and

(b)   the Ameris Ratio shall be less than eighty-five percent (85%) of the quotient of  (i) the Average
Index Price divided by (ii) the Index Price on the Starting Date (such quotient being the “Index Ratio”);

The following examples are provided only for purposes of illustrating the foregoing conditions:

Example 1: If the Ameris Ratio = 0.80 and the Index Ratio = 0.90, then 85% of the Index Ratio would
be 0.85 x 0.90, or 76.5%, and condition 7.8(a) above would be satisfied, but condition 7.8(b) above
would not be satisfied.

Example 2: If the Ameris Ratio = 0.70 and the Index Ratio = 0.84, then 85% of the Index Ratio would
be 0.85 x 0.84, or 71.4%, and both conditions 7.8(a) and 7.8(b) above would be satisfied.

provided, however, that if Atlantic refuses to consummate the Merger pursuant to this Section 7.8, then it
shall give prompt written notice thereof to Ameris (and provided that such Atlantic notice of election to
terminate may be withdrawn at any time within the aforementioned four (4) Business Day period). During
the three (3) Business Day period commencing with its receipt of such notice, Ameris shall have the option
to increase the consideration to be received by the holders of Atlantic Common Stock hereunder by either:

(i)   increasing the Exchange Ratio (calculated to the nearest one one-thousandth); or

(ii)   provided that it does not, and will not, prevent or impede the Merger from qualifying as a
“reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, paying, as part of the Merger
Consideration, to each recipient of the Per Share Purchase Price, a cash payment (in addition to, and not
in lieu of, issuing the Per Share Purchase Price to such recipients in accordance with this Agreement)
(such cash payment, the “Additional Cash Consideration”);

in each case of the immediately preceding clauses (i) and (ii), such that the value of the consideration
(calculated based on the Average Ameris Stock Price and including any Additional Cash Consideration)
to be received by each holder of Atlantic Common Stock hereunder, exclusive of Cash Consideration,
equals the lesser of the following: (A) an amount equal to the product of the Starting Price, 0.85 and the
Exchange Ratio (as in effect immediately prior to any increase in the Exchange Ratio pursuant to this
Section 7.8); and (B) an amount equal to (1) the product of the Index Ratio, 0.85, the Exchange Ratio
(as in effect immediately prior to any increase in the Exchange Ratio pursuant to this Section 7.8) and
the Average Ameris Stock Price, divided by (2) the Ameris Ratio.

If Ameris so elects within such three (3) Business Day period, then it shall give prompt written notice to
Atlantic of such election and the revised Exchange Ratio or the Additional Cash Consideration, as applicable,
whereupon no termination shall have occurred pursuant to this Section 7.8 and this Agreement shall remain in
effect in accordance with its terms, provided that any references in this Agreement to the “Exchange Ratio” shall
thereafter be deemed to refer to the Exchange Ratio as increased pursuant to this Section 7.8, if applicable, and
any references in this Agreement to the Per Share Stock Purchase Price shall thereafter include the Additional
Cash Consideration as set forth in this Section 7.8, if applicable.

actually traded during the twenty (20) consecutive full trading days ending at the closing of trading on the
trading day immediately prior to the Determination Date.

8.5 Counterparts.   This Agreement may be executed simultaneously in any number of counterparts,
each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which shall constitute one and the same instrument. This
Agreement may be executed by facsimile, photo or electronic signature and such facsimile, photo or electronic
signature shall constitute an original for all purposes.

8.6 No Third-Party Beneficiaries.   Except as set forth in Section 5.11 and Section 5.12, no provision
of this Agreement shall be deemed to create any third-party beneficiary rights in anyone, including any employee
or former employee of Atlantic (including any beneficiary or dependent thereof).

8.7 Binding Effect; Assignment.   This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit
of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns; provided, however, that, except as expressly
provided herein, this Agreement may not be assigned by either party without the prior written consent of the
other party.

8.8 Governing Law; Venue.   This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with
the laws of the State of Georgia, without giving effect to its principles of conflicts of laws; provided, however,
that the Maryland General Corporation Law shall govern to the extent mandatorily applicable to Maryland

County, Florida.

8.9 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL.   EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY
CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW AT THE
TIME OF INSTITUTION OF THE APPLICABLE LITIGATION, ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO
A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF

AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT: (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE,

Agreement or invalidate or render unenforceable such term or provision in any other jurisdiction. Upon such
determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the parties hereto shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as
possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as
originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible.

8.11 Cumulative Remedies; Specific Performance.   All rights and remedies under this Agreement or
otherwise afforded by Applicable Law to any party shall be cumulative and not alternative. Without limiting the
rights of a party hereto to pursue all other legal and equitable rights available to such party for another party’s
failure to perform its obligations under this Agreement, the parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the remedy
at law for any failure to perform their respective obligations hereunder would be inadequate and that each party
shall be entitled to specific performance, injunctive relief or other equitable remedies in the event of any such
failure. Each of the parties hereby further waives any requirement under Applicable Law to post security as a
prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief.

APPENDIX B 

FORM OF 
VOTING AND SUPPORT AGREEMENT

THIS VOTING AND SUPPORT AGREEMENT (this “Agreement”), dated as of November 16, 2017, is
entered into by and among Ameris Bancorp, a Georgia corporation (“Ameris”), Atlantic Coast Financial
Corporation, a Maryland corporation (“Atlantic”), and each person or entity executing this Agreement or a
counterpart to this Agreement as a stockholder of Atlantic (each, a “Stockholder”).

WITNESSETH:

WHEREAS, pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger (as the same may be amended or
supplemented, the “Merger Agreement”), dated as of the date hereof and to be executed by Ameris and Atlantic
concurrently with the execution of this Agreement by the parties hereto, Atlantic will, subject to the terms and
conditions set forth therein, merge with and into Ameris, with Ameris being the surviving entity (the “Merger”);
and

WHEREAS, as an inducement for Ameris to enter into the Merger Agreement, Ameris has required that
each Stockholder enter into this Agreement;

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of, and as a material inducement to, the parties entering into the
Merger Agreement and proceeding with the transactions contemplated thereby, and in consideration of the
expenses incurred and to be incurred by them in connection therewith, the parties hereto agree as follows:

1. Definitions.   Capitalized terms not defined in this Agreement have the respective meanings assigned
to them in the Merger Agreement.

2. Effectiveness.   If the Merger Agreement is terminated for any reason in accordance with its terms,
this Agreement shall automatically terminate and be null and void and of no effect. The effectiveness of this
Agreement shall be conditioned upon the execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement by the parties thereto.

3. Voting Agreement.

(a)    From the date hereof until the earlier of  (x) the Effective Time and (y) the termination of the
Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms (the “Support Period”), each Stockholder irrevocably and
unconditionally agrees that at any stockholder meeting of Atlantic to approve the Merger Agreement or any
adjournment or postponement thereof, such Stockholder shall be present (in person or by proxy) and shall
vote (or cause to be voted) all shares of Atlantic Common Stock beneficially owned by such Stockholder as
of the date hereof, together with all shares of Atlantic Common Stock over which such Stockholder may
acquire beneficial ownership from time to time after the date hereof, in each case that are entitled to vote at
such meeting (collectively, the “Owned Shares”), as follows:

(i)   in favor of  (A) the approval or adoption of the Merger Agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby (including any amendments or modifications of the terms thereof approved by
the board of directors of Atlantic and adopted in accordance with the terms thereof) and (B) the
approval of any proposal to adjourn or postpone such meeting to a later date if there are not sufficient
votes to approve the Merger Agreement; and

(ii)   against (A) any action or agreement that would be reasonably likely to impair the ability of
either Ameris or Atlantic to complete the Merger, or that would otherwise be inconsistent with, prevent,
impede or delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, and (B)
other than the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, any proposal that relates to an
Acquisition Proposal, without regard to the terms of such proposal.

(b)   Each Stockholder further agrees not to vote or execute any written consent to rescind or amend in
any manner any prior vote or written consent, as a stockholder of Atlantic, to approve or adopt the Merger
Agreement unless this Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

(c)   Each Stockholder represents and warrants and covenants and agrees that, except for this
Agreement, such Stockholder (i) has not entered into, and shall not enter into during the Support Period, any
voting agreement or voting trust with respect to the Owned Shares and (ii) has not granted, and shall not
grant during the Support Period, a proxy, consent or power of attorney with respect to the Owned Shares
except any proxy to carry out the intent of this Agreement.

(d)   With respect to any Stockholder that is an officer, director or other representative of Atlantic or
any of Subsidiary of Atlantic, such Stockholder, in its capacity as a stockholder of Atlantic, hereby
acknowledges that such Stockholder is bound by the restrictions set forth in Section 4.19 of the Merger
Agreement and agrees consistent therewith not to solicit or facilitate any Acquisition Proposal.

4. Grant of Irrevocable Proxy; Appointment of Proxy.   During the Support Period, each Stockholder
hereby irrevocably and unconditionally grants to, and appoints, Ameris and any designee thereof as such
Stockholder’s proxy and attorney-in-fact (with full power of substitution), for and in the name, place and stead of
such Stockholder, to vote or cause to be voted (including by proxy or written consent, if applicable) the Owned
Shares owned by such Stockholder as of the applicable record date in accordance with Section 3 of this
Agreement; provided, however, that each Stockholder’s grant of the proxy contemplated by this Section 4 shall
be effective if, and only if, such Stockholder has not delivered to Atlantic prior to the meeting at which any of the
matters described in Section 3 are to be considered, a duly executed irrevocable proxy card directing that the
Owned Shares of such Stockholder be voted in accordance with Section 3 of this Agreement. Each Stockholder
hereby affirms that the irrevocable proxy set forth in this Section 4, if it becomes effective, is coupled with an
interest and is given in connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement, and that such irrevocable proxy
is given to secure the performance of the duties of such Stockholder under this Agreement. The parties hereby
further affirm that the irrevocable proxy, if it becomes effective, is intended to be irrevocable until the end of the
Support Period, at which time it will terminate automatically. If for any reason any proxy granted herein is not
irrevocable after it becomes effective, then the Stockholder granting such proxy agrees, until the end of the
Support Period, to vote the Owned Shares in accordance with Section 3 of this Agreement. The parties agree that
the foregoing is a voting agreement. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, this proxy shall
automatically terminate and be revoked upon the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms.

5. Transfer Restrictions Prior to Merger.   Each Stockholder agrees that it will not, during the Support
Period, sell, transfer, assign, tender in any tender or exchange offer, pledge, encumber, hypothecate or similarly
dispose of  (by merger, by testamentary disposition, by operation of law or otherwise), either voluntarily or
involuntarily, enter into any swap or other arrangements that transfers to another, in whole or in part, any of the
economic consequences of ownership of, enter into any contract, option or other arrangement or understanding
with respect to the sale, transfer, assignment, pledge, lien, hypothecation or other disposition of  (by merger, by
testamentary disposition, by operation of law or otherwise) or otherwise convey or dispose of, any of such
Stockholder’s Owned Shares, or any interest therein, including the right to vote any Owned Shares, as applicable
(a “Transfer”); provided, however, that such Stockholder may Transfer Owned Shares for estate planning
purposes so long as the transferee, prior to the date of Transfer, agrees in a signed writing to be bound by and
comply with the provisions of this Agreement with respect to such Owned Shares.

6. Cooperation.   From time to time, at the reasonable request of Ameris or Atlantic and without further
consideration, each Stockholder shall cooperate with Ameris and Atlantic, at Atlantic’s expense, to make all
filings and obtain all consents of Governmental Authorities and third parties and execute and deliver such
additional documents and take all such further actions as may be necessary or desirable to effect the actions
contemplated by this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, each Stockholder hereby: (i) authorizes Ameris
and Atlantic to publish and disclose in any public announcement, disclosure required by the SEC or by
Applicable Law or the Atlantic Proxy Materials (and, if applicable, the Ameris Registration Statement), such
Stockholder’s identity and ownership of the Owned Shares, the nature of such Stockholder’s obligations under
this Agreement and any other information that Ameris or Atlantic reasonably determines is required to be
disclosed in connection with the Merger and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement; (ii) agrees
to promptly give to Ameris and Atlantic any information Ameris or Atlantic may reasonably require for the
preparation of any such disclosure documents; and (iii) agrees to promptly notify Ameris and Atlantic of any
required corrections with respect

APPENDIX C 

November 15, 2017

Board of Directors 
Atlantic Coast Financial Corporation 
4655 Salisbury Road, Suite 110 
Jacksonville, FL 32256

Gentlemen:

Hovde Group, LLC (“we” or “Hovde”) understand that Ameris Bancorp, a Georgia corporation (“Ameris”)
and Atlantic Financial Corporation, a Maryland corporation (“Atlantic” and, together with Ameris, the “Parties”
and each a “Party”), are about to enter into an Agreement and Plan of Merger to be dated on or about
November 15, 2017 (the “Agreement”). Pursuant and subject to the terms of the Agreement, Atlantic shall merge
with and into Ameris, with Ameris being the surviving entity (the “Merger”). Further, it is contemplated that the
Merger will be immediately followed by a merger of Atlantic’s wholly owned banking subsidiary, Atlantic Coast
Bank (“Atlantic Coast Bank”), with and into Ameris’s wholly owned banking subsidiary, Ameris Bank (“Ameris
Bank”), with Ameris Bank being the surviving entity (the “Bank Merger”). The Merger and the Bank Merger are
collectively referred to in the Agreement as the Merger. Capitalized terms used herein that are not otherwise
defined shall have the same meanings attributed to them in the Agreement. For purposes of our analysis and
opinion, Agreement as used herein shall refer to the draft Agreement dated November 10, 2017 provided to
Hovde by Atlantic.

Pursuant and subject to the terms of the Agreement, at the Effective Time, automatically by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the Parties or any stockholder of Atlantic, each share of Atlantic
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than treasury stock and the
Cancelled Shares), shall be converted, in accordance with the terms of the Agreement, into the right to receive the
following consideration, in each case without interest: (i) an amount of cash equal to $1.39 (the “Cash
Consideration”); and (ii) 0.17 validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares (the “Exchange Ratio”) of
Ameris Common Stock together with cash in lieu of any fractional shares in accordance with the provisions of
Section 1.2(f) of the Agreement (the “Stock Consideration”, and together with the Cash Consideration, per share,
the “Per Share Purchase Price”, as may be adjusted in accordance with Section 7.8 the Agreement, and in the
aggregate, the “Merger Consideration”). As used in the Agreement, the term “Merger Consideration Price” means
the sum of: (x) the Exchange Ratio multiplied by the Average Ameris Stock Price; and (y) $1.39.

We note that pursuant to the Agreement, each option to acquire shares of Atlantic Common Stock (an
“Atlantic Stock Option”) issued pursuant to Atlantic’s equity-based compensation plans (the “Atlantic Stock
Plans”), whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall
become fully vested and shall be cancelled and converted automatically into the right to receive a cash payment
from Ameris or Ameris Bank (the “Cash-Out Amount”) in an amount equal to the product of: (i) the excess, if
any, of the Merger Consideration Price over the exercise price of each such Atlantic Stock Option; and (ii) the
number of shares of Atlantic Common Stock subject to such Atlantic Stock Option to the extent not previously
exercised. After the Effective Time, any such cancelled Atlantic Stock Option shall no longer be exercisable by
the former holder thereof, but shall only entitle the holder to the payment of the Cash-Out Amount, without
interest. In the event the exercise price per share of Atlantic Common Stock subject to an Atlantic Stock Option is
equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration Price, such Atlantic Stock Option shall be cancelled without
consideration and have no further force or effect. We have been advised by you that as of November 8, 2017 there
are 20,776 Atlantic Stock Options outstanding with a weighted average exercise price of  $14.95 per share, and
therefore, with your consent, we have assumed for our opinion that all such outstanding options will be canceled
and not entitled to receive the Merger Consideration Price.

(i) reviewed a draft of the Agreement dated November 10, 2017, as provided to Hovde by Atlantic;

(ii) reviewed unaudited financial statements for Atlantic and Ameris for the nine-month period ended
September 30, 2017;

(iii) reviewed certain historical annual reports of each of Atlantic and Ameris, including audited annual
reports for the year ending December 31, 2016;

(iv) reviewed certain historical publicly available business and financial information concerning each of
Atlantic and Ameris;

(v) reviewed certain internal financial statements and other financial and operating data concerning
Atlantic;

(vi) reviewed financial projections prepared by certain members of senior management of Atlantic;

(vii) discussed with certain members of senior management of Atlantic and Ameris the business, financial
condition, results of operations and future prospects of each entity; the history and past and current
operations of Atlantic and Ameris; Atlantic’s and Ameris’s historical financial performance; and their
assessment of the rationale for the Merger;

(viii) reviewed and analyzed materials detailing the Merger prepared by Atlantic and Ameris and by their
respective legal and financial advisors, including the estimated amount and timing of the cost savings
and related expenses, purchase accounting adjustments and synergies expected to result from the
Merger (the “Synergies”);

(ix) analyzed the pro forma financial impact of the Merger on the combined company’s earnings, tangible
book value, financial ratios and other such metrics we deemed relevant, giving effect to the Merger
based on assumptions relating to the Synergies;

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Further, we note that, at the Effective Time, each award of shares of Atlantic Common Stock subject to
vesting, repurchase or other lapse restriction (an “Atlantic Restricted Share Award”) granted pursuant to the
Atlantic Stock Plans, whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time, shall become fully vested and shall be converted automatically into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration Price in respect of each share of Atlantic Common Stock underlying such Atlantic Restricted Share
Award. For purposes of the foregoing, you have advised us that there are 63,475 unallocated shares of Atlantic
restricted stock outstanding held by the ESOP as of November 13, 2017, all of which will be cancelled for the
repayment of the Atlantic ESOP Loan (as provided in the Agreement), and we have relied on such amounts for
purposes of our analysis and opinion. Accordingly, you have advised us that there are a total of 15,490,234 shares
of Atlantic Common Stock outstanding as of November 13, 2017 eligible to receive the Merger Consideration
Price, and therefore, based upon the closing price of Ameris Common Stock as of November 13, 2017 of  $46.75,
we have assumed for purposes of our analysis and opinion that the aggregate Merger Consideration payable by
Ameris to the holders of Atlantic Common Stock is $144,640,060.

We note that pursuant to Section 7.8 of the Agreement, in the event that the Ameris Stock Price declines at
any time during the four Business Day period immediately following the Determination Date as set forth in such
Section, the Agreement may be terminated by Atlantic or, alternatively, either (i) the Exchange Ratio may be
increased by Ameris or (ii) Ameris paying as part of the Merger Consideration a cash payment in addition to the
Per Share Purchase Price (such cash payment being the “Additional Cash Consideration”) provided that the
Additional Cash Consideration complies with the provisions for such Additional Cash Consideration set forth in
the Agreement. For purposes of our analysis and opinion, we have assumed, with your consent, that the
provisions of Section 7.8 will not be triggered and that the Exchange Ratio, the Per Share Purchase Price, the
Merger Consideration Price and the aggregate Merger Consideration will not be adjusted and remain as set forth
herein above.

You have requested our opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the Merger
Consideration to the stockholders of Atlantic. This opinion addresses only the fairness of the Merger
Consideration to be paid in connection with the Merger, and we are not opining on any individual stock, cash,
option, or other components of the consideration.

During the course of our engagement and for the purposes of the opinion set forth herein, we have:

Ameris for the years ending December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2018;

(xi) assessed current general economic, market and financial conditions;

companies that we deemed relevant to our analysis; and

(xvi) performed such other analyses and considered such other factors as we have deemed appropriate.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

We have assumed, without investigation, that there have been, and from the date hereof through the
Effective Date will be, no material changes in the financial condition and results of operations of Atlantic or
Ameris since the date of the latest financial information described above. We have further assumed, without
independent verification, that the representations and financial and other information included in the Agreement
and all other related documents and instruments that are referred to therein or otherwise provided to us by
Atlantic and Ameris are true and complete. We have relied upon the management of Atlantic and Ameris as to the
reasonableness and achievability of the financial forecasts, projections and other forward-looking information
provided to Hovde by Atlantic and Ameris, and we assumed such forecasts, projections and other forward-
looking information have been reasonably prepared by Atlantic and Ameris on a basis reflecting the best
currently available information and Atlantic’s and Ameris’ judgments and estimates. We have assumed that such
forecasts, projections and other forward-looking information would be realized in the amounts and at the times
contemplated thereby, and we do not assume any responsibility for the accuracy or reasonableness thereof. We
have been authorized by Atlantic to rely upon such forecasts, projections and other information and data, and we
express no view as to any such forecasts, projections or other forward-looking information or data, or the bases or
assumptions on which they were prepared.

In performing our review, we have assumed and relied upon the accuracy and completeness of all of the
financial and other information that was available to us from public sources, that was provided to us by Atlantic
or Ameris or their respective representatives or that was otherwise reviewed by us for purposes of rendering this
opinion. We have further relied on the assurances of the respective managements of Atlantic and Ameris that they
are not aware of any facts or circumstances that would make any of such information inaccurate or misleading.
We have not been asked to undertake, and have not undertaken, an independent verification of any of such
information, and we do not assume any responsibility or liability for the accuracy or completeness thereof. We
have assumed that each party to the Agreement would advise us promptly if any information previously provided
to us became inaccurate or was required to be updated during the period of our review.

We are not experts in the evaluation of loan and lease portfolios for purposes of assessing the adequacy of
the allowances for losses with respect thereto. We have assumed that such allowances for Atlantic and Ameris
are, in the aggregate, adequate to cover such losses and will be adequate on a pro forma basis for the combined
entity. We were not requested to make, and have not made, an independent evaluation, physical inspection or
appraisal of the assets, properties, facilities, or liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of Atlantic or Ameris, the
collateral securing any such assets or liabilities, or the collectability of any such assets, and we were not furnished
with any such evaluations or appraisals; nor did we review any loan or credit files of Atlantic or Ameris.

We have undertaken no independent analysis of any pending or threatened litigation, regulatory action,
possible unasserted claims or other contingent liabilities to which Atlantic or Ameris is a party or may be subject,
and our opinion makes no assumption concerning, and therefore does not consider, the possible

TABLE OF CONTENTS

assertion of claims, outcomes or damages arising out of any such matters. We have also assumed, with your
consent, that neither Atlantic nor Ameris is party to any material pending transaction, including without
limitation any financing, recapitalization, acquisition or merger, divestiture or spin-off, other than the Merger
contemplated by the Agreement; however, we have been informed by Ameris that it is currently a party to a non-
binding Letter of Intent (the “LOI”) with a third party financial institution that contemplates the potential
acquisition of such financial institution by Ameris the outcome of which, if any, cannot be predicted at this time.
Consequently, we have assumed, with your consent, that the existence of the LOI would result in no impact upon
the assumptions, facts and circumstances stated herein that serve as the basis of our analysis and opinion
regarding the Merger as set forth in the Agreement.

We have relied upon and assumed with your consent and without independent verification, that the Merger
will be consummated substantially in accordance with the terms set forth in the Agreement, without any waiver
of material terms or conditions by Atlantic or any other party to the Agreement and that the final Agreement will
not differ materially from the draft we reviewed. We have assumed that the Merger will be consummated in
compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. Atlantic has advised us that they are not aware of any factors
that would impede any necessary regulatory or governmental approval of the Merger. We have assumed that the
necessary regulatory and governmental approvals as granted will not be subject to any conditions that would be
unduly burdensome on Atlantic or Ameris or would have a material adverse effect on the contemplated benefits
of the Merger. Additionally, we have assumed, with your consent, that the Consent Order issued by the FDIC and
the GDBF will either be removed by such regulatory authorities prior to the Effective Time, or in the absence of
such regulatory action, will not impede or prevent the consummation of the Merger as set forth in the Agreement.

Our opinion does not consider, include or address: (i) the legal, tax, accounting, or regulatory consequences
of the Merger on Atlantic, or its stockholders; (ii) any advice or opinions provided by any other advisor to the
Board or Atlantic; (iii) any other strategic alternatives that might be available to Atlantic; or (iv) whether Ameris
has sufficient cash or other sources of funds to enable it to pay the consideration contemplated by the Merger.

Our opinion does not constitute a recommendation to Atlantic as to whether or not Atlantic should enter into
the Agreement or to any stockholders of Atlantic as to how such stockholders should vote at any meetings of
stockholders called to consider and vote upon the Merger. Our opinion does not address the underlying business
decision to proceed with the Merger or the fairness of the amount or nature of the compensation, if any, to be
received by any of the officers, directors or employees of Atlantic relative to the amount of consideration to be
paid with respect to the Merger. Our opinion should not be construed as implying that the Merger Consideration
is necessarily the highest or best price that could be obtained in a sale, merger, or combination transaction with a
third party. We do not express any opinion as to the value of Ameris’ common stock following the announcement
of the proposed Merger, or the value of Ameris’ common stock following the consummation of the Merger, or the
prices at which shares of Ameris’ common stock may be purchased or sold at any time. Other than as specifically
set forth herein, we are not expressing any opinion with respect to the terms and provisions of the Agreement or
the enforceability of any such terms or provisions. Our opinion is not a solvency opinion and does not in any way
address the solvency or financial condition of Atlantic or Ameris.

This opinion was approved by Hovde’s fairness opinion committee. This letter is directed solely to the board
of directors of Atlantic and is not to be used for any other purpose or quoted or referred to, in whole or in part, in
any registration statement, prospectus, proxy statement, or any other document, except in each case in accordance
with our prior written consent; provided, however, that we hereby consent to the inclusion and reference to this
letter in any registration statement, proxy statement or information statement to be delivered to the holders of
Atlantic Common Stock in connection with the Merger if, and only if, (i) this letter is quoted in full or attached as
an exhibit to such document, (ii) this letter has not been withdrawn prior to the date of such document, and (iii)
any description of or reference to Hovde or the analyses performed by Hovde or any summary of this opinion in
such filing is in a form acceptable to Hovde and its counsel in the exercise of their reasonable judgment.

Our opinion is based solely upon the information available to us and described above, and the economic,
market and other circumstances as they exist as of the date hereof. Events occurring and information that
becomes available after the date hereof could materially affect the assumptions and

TABLE OF CONTENTS

analyses used in preparing this opinion. We have not undertaken to update, revise, reaffirm or withdraw this
opinion or to otherwise comment upon events occurring or information that becomes available after the date
hereof.

In arriving at this opinion, Hovde did not attribute any particular weight to any single analysis or factor
considered by it, but rather made qualitative judgments as to the significance and relevance of each analysis and
factor. Accordingly, Hovde believes that its analyses must be considered as a whole and that selecting portions of
its analyses, without considering all analyses, would create an incomplete view of the process underlying this
opinion.

Hovde, as part of its investment banking business, regularly performs valuations of businesses and their
securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions and other corporate transactions. In addition to being
retained to render this opinion letter, we were retained by Atlantic to act as its financial advisor in connection
with the Merger. In connection with our services, we will receive from Atlantic a fairness opinion fee that is
contingent upon the issuance of this opinion letter and a completion fee that is contingent upon the consummation
of the Merger; the opinion fee will be credited in full towards the portion of the completion fee which will
become payable to Hovde upon the consummation of the Merger. Atlantic has also agreed to indemnify us and
our affiliates for certain liabilities that may arise out of our engagement.

Other than in connection with this present engagement, in the past two years, Hovde has not provided
investment banking or financial advisory services to Atlantic. During the past three years preceding the date of
this opinion, Hovde has provided investment banking services to, and received fees from, two banks in
connection with their respective sales to Ameris. During the past two years preceding the date of this opinion
Hovde has not provided any investment banking or financial advisory services to Ameris. We or our affiliates
may presently or in the future seek or receive compensation from Ameris in connection with future transactions,
or in connection with potential advisory services and corporate transactions, although to our knowledge none are
expected at this time. In the ordinary course of our business as a broker/dealer, we may from time to time
purchase securities from, and sell securities to, Atlantic or Ameris or their affiliates, and as a market maker in
securities, Hovde may from time to time have a long or short position in, and buy or sell, debt or equity securities
of Atlantic or Ameris for its own accounts and for the accounts of customers. Except for the foregoing, during the
past two years there have not been, and there currently are no mutual understandings contemplating in the future,
any material relationships between Hovde and Atlantic or Ameris.

Based upon and subject to the foregoing review, assumptions and limitations, we are of the opinion, as of the
date hereof, that the Merger Consideration to be paid in connection with the Merger is fair to the holders of
Atlantic Common Stock from a financial point of view.

Sincerely, 
   
HOVDE GROUP, LLC
