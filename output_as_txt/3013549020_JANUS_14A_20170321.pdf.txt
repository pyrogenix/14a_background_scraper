MERGER PROPOSED—YOUR VOTE IS VERY IMPORTANT 

Dear Stockholder:

            You are cordially invited to attend a special meeting of the stockholders, which we refer to as the Janus special meeting, of Janus Capital Group Inc., which we refer to as Janus. The Janus special meeting, is to be held on April 25, 2017 at 10:00 a.m. local time at the
JW Marriott Hotel, 150 Clayton Lane, Denver, Colorado.

            As previously announced, Janus, Henderson Group plc, which we refer to as Henderson, and Horizon Orbit Corp., a Delaware corporation and a direct and wholly owned subsidiary of Henderson, which we refer to as Merger Sub, entered into an Agreement and Plan
of Merger, dated as of October 3, 2016, which we refer to as the merger agreement. Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into Janus, with Janus surviving such merger as a direct and wholly owned subsidiary of Henderson, which
we refer to as the merger. Upon closing of the merger, Henderson will be the parent holding company for the combined group and will be renamed Janus Henderson Group plc, which we refer to as Janus Henderson. We believe that this merger of Janus and Henderson
accelerates both businesses' strategic objectives for growth, diversification, and the creation of a truly global active investment manager. We believe that the merger will benefit both the Janus stockholders and the Henderson shareholders and we ask for your support in
voting for the proposals at the Janus special meeting.

            Upon closing of the merger, a holder of Janus common stock will be entitled to receive 4.7190 fully paid and non-assessable Henderson ordinary shares for each share of Janus common stock that it holds, which we refer to as the exchange ratio, plus cash in lieu of
any fractional shares based on then prevailing market prices, subject to the following adjustments. Effective immediately prior to the closing of the merger, Henderson will implement a share consolidation of Henderson ordinary shares, which we refer to as the share
consolidation, at a ratio of one Janus Henderson ordinary share (or CDI, as applicable) for every 10 Henderson ordinary shares (or CDIs, as applicable) outstanding (so that at closing of the merger each Janus stockholder will receive 0.4719 Janus Henderson ordinary shares
for each share of Janus common stock). In addition, subject to approval by the Henderson shareholders at the Henderson shareholder meeting, effective upon the date of the Henderson shareholder meeting, the par value of Henderson ordinary shares will be redenominated
from pounds sterling into U.S. dollars. Following the redenomination, subject to approval by the Henderson shareholders at the Henderson shareholders meeting, upon completion of certain registration procedures with the Jersey Registrar of Companies, the par value of
Henderson ordinary shares will be reduced to ensure that the par value is a round number. Based on Henderson's and Janus's respective fully diluted shares as of the signing date, it is expected that the exchange ratio will result in Henderson shareholders and Janus
stockholders owning approximately 57% and 43% of Janus Henderson, respectively, immediately following the effective time of the merger, which we refer to as the effective time, excluding the conditional options granted to Dai-ichi, which are subject to closing of the
merger and Henderson shareholders' approval. Shares of Janus common stock are currently traded on the New York Stock Exchange, which we refer to as NYSE, under the symbol "JNS" and Henderson ordinary shares are currently traded on the London Stock Exchange,
which we refer to as the LSE, under the symbol "HGG", and Henderson maintains a listing of CHESS Depositary Interests, which we refer to as CDIs, each representing a beneficial interest in one Henderson ordinary share, on the ASX Limited, which we refer to as ASX,
under the ticker symbol "HGG". We expect that, subject to shareholder approval, Henderson ordinary shares will be delisted from the LSE, ordinary shares of Janus Henderson, which we refer to as the Janus Henderson ordinary shares, will be listed on the NYSE under the
ticker symbol "JHG" and the CDIs will remain quoted and traded on the financial market operated by ASX under the ticker symbol "HGG" for a short period of time following closing of the merger and then under the new ticker symbol "JHG".

            On September 30, 2016, the last trading day prior to the public announcement of the merger, for Henderson ordinary shares, the closing price on the LSE was 232.00 pence per share and, for shares of Janus common stock, the closing price on the NYSE was $14.01
per share. On September 30, 2016, the exchange rate for pounds sterling was $1.2972 per pound sterling as reported by Bloomberg. The implied value of the merger consideration payable in respect of each share of Janus common stock was 1,094.81 pence, or $14.20 in
dollar equivalent. The total merger consideration as of the date immediately prior to the public announcement of the merger, based on 179,762,551 diluted shares of Janus common stock, was $2,552,960,673. On March 17, 2017, the latest practicable date before the date of
this proxy statement/prospectus, for Henderson ordinary shares, the closing price on the LSE was 231.00 pence per share and, for shares of Janus common stock, the closing price on the NYSE was $12.82 per share. On March 17, 2017, the exchange rate for pounds sterling
was $1.2376 per pound sterling as reported by Bloomberg. The implied value of the merger consideration payable in respect of each share of Janus common stock was 1,090.09 pence, or $13.49 in dollar equivalent. The total merger consideration as of March 17, 2017,
based on 179,560,968 diluted shares of Janus common stock, was $2,422,446,509. The maximum number of Janus Henderson ordinary shares expected to be issued to Janus stockholders at the effective time is 86,970,130 (based on Janus shares of common stock
outstanding as of March 15, 2017).

            We urge you to obtain current market quotations of Janus common stock and Henderson ordinary shares prior to casting your vote.

            At the Janus special meeting, you will be asked to consider and vote on:

(i) a proposal to adopt the merger agreement, which we refer to as the Janus merger proposal; 

(ii) a non-binding, advisory proposal to approve the compensation that may become payable to Janus's named executive officers in connection with the consummation of the merger, which compensation is summarized in the table in the section entitled "The
Merger—Merger Related Compensation" beginning on page 127; 

(iii) a non-binding, advisory proposal to approve an amendment to the Henderson Memorandum of Association implementing the share consolidation of Henderson ordinary shares at a ratio of one new Janus Henderson ordinary share (or CDI) for every 10
Henderson ordinary shares (or CDIs, as applicable) outstanding, to be implemented effective upon the closing of the merger; 

(iv) a non-binding, advisory proposal to approve an amendment to the Henderson Memorandum of Association increasing the authorized share capital of the company from £274,363,847.00 to $720,000,000; 

(v) a non-binding, advisory proposal to approve an amendment to the Henderson Articles of Association removing preemptive rights for Janus Henderson shareholders on new issuances of Janus Henderson ordinary shares; 

(vi) a non-binding, advisory proposal to approve an amendment to the Henderson Articles of Association removing the requirement that the Janus Henderson board seek the approval of Janus Henderson shareholders to issue Janus Henderson ordinary
shares; 

(vii) a non-binding, advisory proposal to approve an amendment to the Henderson Articles of Association requiring directors of Janus Henderson to be re-elected at each annual Janus Henderson shareholder meeting; and 

(viii) a proposal to adjourn the Janus special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes to approve the Janus merger proposal.

            The Janus board unanimously recommends that Janus stockholders vote "FOR" each of the proposals to be considered at the Janus special meeting.

            We cannot complete the merger unless the Janus stockholders approve the Janus merger proposal.

            Your vote is very important, regardless of the number of shares you own. Whether or not you plan to attend the Janus special meeting, please promptly mark, sign and date the accompanying proxy and return it promptly in the enclosed postage-paid
envelope, or authorize the individuals named on your proxy card to vote your shares by calling the toll-free telephone number or by using the Internet as described in the instructions included with your proxy card.

            The obligations of Janus and Henderson to complete the merger are subject to the satisfaction or waiver of several conditions set forth in the merger agreement. More information about Janus, Henderson, and the merger is contained in this proxy
statement/prospectus.

            Janus encourages you to read this entire proxy statement/prospectus carefully, including the section entitled "Risk Factors" beginning on page 50.

Sincerely,

Glenn Schafer
Chairman of the Board

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS 

        The following are some questions that you, as a stockholder of Janus, may have regarding the merger and the other matters being considered at the Janus special meeting, as well as the answers to those
questions. Janus urges you to read carefully the remainder of this proxy statement/prospectus because the information in this section does not provide all the information that might be important to you with
respect to the merger and the other matters being considered at the Janus special meeting. Additional important information is also contained in the annexes to and the documents incorporated by reference into
this proxy statement/prospectus. See "Where You Can Find More Information" beginning on page 300.

        Except where specifically noted, the following information and all other information contained in this proxy statement/prospectus does not give effect to the share consolidation described in the section
entitled "The Merger—Share Consolidation", beginning on page 144 of this proxy statement/prospectus.

About the Merger 

Q: What is the proposed transaction on which I am being asked to vote? 

A: Janus and Henderson have agreed to the strategic combination of Janus and Henderson under the terms of the merger agreement that is described in this proxy statement/prospectus. Subject to the terms
and conditions of the merger agreement, Merger Sub, a Delaware corporation and a direct and wholly owned subsidiary of Henderson, will be merged with and into Janus, with Janus surviving as a
direct and wholly owned subsidiary of Henderson, which we refer to as the merger. 

As a result of the merger, each issued and outstanding share of Janus common stock, par value $0.01, will be converted into the right to receive 4.7190 Henderson ordinary shares, par value £0.125, plus
cash in lieu of any fractional shares based on then prevailing market prices, subject to the following adjustments. Effective immediately prior to the closing of the merger, subject to approval by the
Henderson shareholders at the Henderson shareholder meeting, Henderson will implement the share consolidation at a ratio of one Janus Henderson ordinary share (or CDI, as applicable) for every 10
Henderson ordinary shares (or CDIs, as applicable) outstanding (so that at closing of the merger each Janus stockholder will receive 0.4719 Janus Henderson ordinary shares for each share of Janus
common stock). In addition, subject to approval by the Henderson shareholders at the Henderson shareholder meeting, effective upon the date of the Henderson shareholder meeting, the par value of
Henderson ordinary shares will be redenominated from pounds sterling into U.S. dollars. Following the redenomination, subject to approval by the Henderson shareholders at the Henderson shareholder
meeting, upon completion of certain registration procedures with the Jersey Registrar of Companies, the par value of Henderson ordinary shares will be reduced to ensure that the par value is a round
number.

Upon closing of the merger, Henderson will be the parent holding company for the combined group and will be renamed Janus Henderson Group plc, which we refer to as Janus Henderson or the
combined company. Upon closing of the merger: (i) shares of Janus common stock will be delisted from the New York Stock Exchange, which we refer to as the NYSE, and shares of Janus common
stock will be deregistered under the Exchange Act; and (ii) subject to the Henderson LSE de-listing approval being obtained, Henderson ordinary shares will be delisted from the London Stock
Exchange, which we refer to as the LSE. Upon the closing, Janus Henderson ordinary shares will be listed for trading on the NYSE and CHESS Depositary Interests, which we refer to as the CDIs, each
representing a beneficial interest in one Janus Henderson ordinary share, will continue to be quoted and traded on the financial market operated by ASX.

Q: Why is stockholder approval necessary and who is entitled to vote? 

A: This proxy statement/prospectus serves as the proxy statement through which Janus will solicit proxies to obtain the necessary stockholder approvals for the merger. It also serves as the prospectus by
which Henderson will issue its ordinary shares as consideration in the merger. 

Janus is holding a special meeting of stockholders, which we refer to as the Janus special meeting, in order to obtain the stockholder approval necessary to adopt the merger agreement. Janus
stockholders will also be asked to approve the adjournment of the Janus special meeting (if necessary or appropriate to solicit additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes to approve the Janus
stockholder proposals), to approve, by non-binding advisory vote, the compensation arrangements for Janus's named executive officers in connection with the merger, which compensation is summarized
in the table in the section entitled "The Merger—Merger Related Compensation" beginning on page 127, and to approve, by non-binding advisory vote, certain amendments to the Henderson
Memorandum of Association and Henderson Articles of Association. The approval of the foregoing compensation arrangements and amendments are not conditions to the completion of the merger and
the merger will be consummated regardless of whether one or more of these approvals are obtained.

We will be unable to complete the merger unless, among other things, the Janus stockholders vote to adopt the merger agreement and the Henderson shareholders approve the merger, the Henderson
share issuance proposal, the Henderson name change proposal, the Henderson amended articles proposal, the Henderson LSE de-listing proposal and the Henderson permitted dividend proposal.

You are receiving this proxy statement/prospectus because you were a holder of record of Janus common stock as of the close of business on March 15, 2017, the record date for the Janus special
meeting, which we refer to as the record date.

This proxy statement/prospectus contains important information about the merger, the merger agreement (which is summarized below in the section entitled "The Merger—Description of the Merger
Agreement" and a copy of which is attached as Annex A), the amended Memorandum of Association of Janus Henderson, which we refer to as the Janus Henderson Amended Memorandum, and the
amended Articles of Association of Janus Henderson, which we refer to as the Janus Henderson Amended Articles (which are summarized below in the section entitled "Description of Janus Henderson
Ordinary Shares and Janus Henderson Amended Articles of Association" and forms of which are attached as Annex B), and the Janus special meeting. You should read this information carefully and in
its entirety.

The enclosed voting materials also allow you to vote your shares of Janus common stock without attending the Janus special meeting. Your vote is very important and we encourage you to submit your
proxy as soon as possible.

Q: What will Janus stockholders receive in the merger? 

A: If the merger is completed, pursuant to the merger agreement, Janus stockholders will be entitled to receive 4.7190, which we refer to as the exchange ratio, Henderson ordinary shares for each share of
Janus common stock they hold at the effective time, which we refer to as the merger consideration. Effective immediately prior to the closing of the merger, subject to approval by the Henderson
shareholders at the Henderson shareholder meeting, Henderson will implement the share consolidation at a ratio of one Janus Henderson ordinary share (or CDI, as applicable) for every 10 Henderson
ordinary shares (or CDIs, as applicable) outstanding (so that at closing of the merger each Janus stockholder will receive 0.4719 Janus Henderson ordinary shares for each share of Janus common stock).
Janus stockholders will not receive any fractional Henderson ordinary

shares in the merger. Instead, Janus stockholders will receive cash in lieu of any fractional Henderson ordinary shares, that they would otherwise have been entitled to receive, based on then prevailing
market prices.

Q: What will Henderson shareholders receive in the merger? 

A: If the merger is completed, Henderson shareholders will continue to hold their Janus Henderson ordinary shares or CDIs, as applicable, and will not receive any consideration in the merger. 

Q: What equity stake will former Janus stockholders and former Henderson shareholders hold in Janus Henderson? 

A: Under the merger agreement and pursuant to the exchange ratio, based on Henderson's and Janus's respective fully diluted shares as of the signing date, it is expected that Henderson shareholders and
Janus stockholders will own approximately 57% and 43%, respectively, of the combined company's ordinary shares immediately following the effective time excluding any dilutative instruments issued
to Dai-ichi in connection with the merger. 

Q: How do I calculate the value of the merger consideration? 

A: On September 30, 2016, the last trading day prior to the public announcement of the merger, for Henderson ordinary shares, the closing price on the LSE was 232.00 pence per share and, for shares of
Janus common stock, the closing price on the NYSE was $14.01 per share. On September 30, 2016, the exchange rate for pounds sterling was $1.2972 per pound sterling as reported by Bloomberg. The
implied value of the merger consideration payable in respect of each share of Janus common stock was 1,094.81 pence, or $14.20 in dollar equivalent. The total merger consideration as of the date
immediately prior to the public announcement of the merger, based on 179,762,551 diluted shares of Janus common stock, was $2,552,960,673. 

On December 31, 2016, for Henderson ordinary shares, the closing price on the LSE was 235.60 pence per share and, for shares of Janus common stock, the closing price on the NYSE was $13.27 per
share. On December 31, 2016, the exchange rate for pounds sterling was $1.2340 per pound sterling as reported by Bloomberg. The implied value of the merger consideration payable in respect of each
share of Janus common stock was 1,111.80 pence, or $13.72 in dollar equivalent. The total merger consideration as of December 31, 2016, based on 180,253,742 diluted shares of Janus common stock,
was $2,473,003,394.

On March 17, 2017, the latest practicable date before the date of this proxy statement/prospectus, for Henderson ordinary shares, the closing price on the LSE was 231.00 pence per share and, for shares
of Janus common stock, the closing price on the NYSE was $12.82 per share. On March 17, 2017, the exchange rate for pounds sterling was $1.2376 per pound sterling as reported by Bloomberg. The
implied value of the merger consideration payable in respect of each share of Janus common stock was 1,090.09 pence, or $13.49 in dollar equivalent. The total merger consideration as of March 17,
2017, based on 179,560,968 diluted shares of Janus common stock, was $2,422,446,509.

We urge you to obtain current market quotations and currency exchange rates before voting your shares of Janus common stock.

The merger agreement does not contain any provision that would adjust the exchange ratio based on fluctuations in the market value of either the Janus common stock or Henderson ordinary shares or
currency exchange rates between the signing date and the effective time. Because of this, the implied value of consideration to the Janus stockholders may fluctuate between now and closing of the
merger. The value of the consideration to Janus stockholders will depend on the

market value of Henderson ordinary shares at the time the merger is completed and on currency exchange rates. However, the merger agreement provides that the merger consideration will be adjusted
appropriately to reflect the effect of any stock/share split, reverse stock split, share consolidation (including the share consolidation), share subdivision, share bonus issue or stock/share dividend
(including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into the Henderson ordinary shares or Janus common stock, as applicable), reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination,
exchange of shares or other like change with respect to the number of Henderson ordinary shares or shares of Janus common stock issued and outstanding after October 3, 2016 and prior to the effective
time.

Q: What do I need to do now to receive the merger consideration? 

A: After the merger is completed, Janus stockholders will each receive from the exchange agent instructions on how to surrender their book-entry shares in exchange for the merger consideration. 

Q: After the merger, where can I trade my Janus Henderson ordinary shares? 

A: It is a condition to the closing of the merger that the Janus Henderson ordinary shares will be approved for listing on the NYSE. At and as of the closing of the merger, it is expected that the Janus
Henderson ordinary shares will be traded on the NYSE under the ticker symbol "JHG". 

Subject to the Henderson LSE de-listing approval being obtained, Janus Henderson ordinary shares will not be traded on the LSE following the closing of the merger, but interests in Janus Henderson
ordinary shares will continue to be quoted and traded on the financial market operated by ASX in the form of CDIs under the ticker symbol "HGG" for a short period of time following closing of the
merger and then under the new ticker symbol "JHG".

Q: Will I still be paid dividends prior to the merger? 

A: Janus has declared and paid to Janus stockholders quarterly cash dividends of US$0.11 and US$0.11 per share of Janus common stock for the third and fourth quarter of 2016, respectively. Janus also
currently expects to declare and pay a dividend in respect of the first quarter of 2017 to Janus stockholders prior to closing of the merger. 

Q: Will I still be paid dividends after the merger? 

A: Janus Henderson is expected to continue to follow a progressive dividend policy, increasing the dividend broadly in-line with growth in adjusted operating income over the medium term and with a pay-
out ratio consistent with Henderson's past practice. Following the closing of the merger, it is intended that Janus Henderson will declare dividends on a quarterly basis beginning with the second quarter
of 2017. 

However, the amount of dividends, if any, that are declared or paid to Janus Henderson shareholders in periods after closing of the merger cannot yet be determined and will depend on a number of
factors. The Janus Henderson board will have sole discretion to determine whether any interim dividends will be declared, the amount of any such interim dividend, the amount of any final dividend
recommended to its shareholders (which may be paid subject to the approval of Janus Henderson shareholders by way of an ordinary resolution) and when any dividend will be paid. We expect that such
determination would be based on a number of considerations, including, but not limited to, Janus Henderson's results of operations, capital management plans, the market price of Janus Henderson
ordinary shares, the combined company's access to capital markets, as well as legal requirements, industry practice and other factors deemed relevant by the Janus Henderson board. There can be no
assurance that Janus Henderson shareholders will receive or be entitled to dividends commensurate with the historical dividends of Janus or Henderson. For a

Q: Who will serve as the directors and senior officers of the combined company? 

A: Under the terms of the merger agreement, at the effective time, the Janus Henderson board will consist initially of 12 directors. Six of the 12 directors will be persons that are current directors of
Henderson: Andrew Formica, the current Chief Executive of Henderson, Richard Gillingwater, the current Chairman of Henderson, who will serve as Chairman of the Janus Henderson board, Sarah
Arkle, Kalpana Desai, Kevin Dolan, and Angela Seymour-Jackson. Six of the 12 directors will be persons that are current directors of Janus: Richard Weil, the current Chief Executive Officer of Janus,
Glenn Schafer, the current Chairman of Janus, who will serve as Deputy Chairman of the Janus Henderson board, Jeff Diermeier, Eugene Flood Jr., Larry Kochard and Tatsusaburo Yamamoto. Dai-ichi
is entitled to nominate a director to the Janus Henderson board pursuant to the terms of the amended investment and cooperation agreement, whom we refer to as the Dai-ichi Representative.
Mr. Yamamoto is the initial Dai-ichi Representative. Not less than four directors designated by each of Henderson and Janus will be "independent" in accordance with the standards of the NYSE and the
Corporate Governance Principles and Recommendations issued by the ASX Corporate Governance Council in March 2014, which we refer to as the ASX Principles. 

Under the terms of the merger agreement, at the effective time, Andrew Formica and Richard Weil each will become co-Chief Executive Officer of Janus Henderson. Also at the effective time, the
individuals set forth below will become executive officers of Janus Henderson, serving in the respective offices set forth beside each individual's name below. The executive officers, together with the
co-Chief Executive Officers, will constitute the executive committee of Janus Henderson.

Q: Who is the exchange agent for the merger? 

A: Computershare Inc., is the exchange agent. 

Q: When do you expect the merger to be completed? 

A: Janus and Henderson are currently anticipating closing of the merger on May 30, 2017. However, the merger is subject to certain conditions, and it is possible that the merger will be completed at a later
time, or not at all. For additional information on the regulatory approvals and clearances required to complete the merger, see the section entitled "The Merger—Regulatory Approvals" beginning on
page 142. For additional information on the conditions to closing of the merger, see the section entitled "The Merger—Description of the Merger Agreement—Conditions to Closing of the Merger"

Q: What effects will the merger have on Janus and Henderson? 

A: Upon closing of the merger, Janus will cease to have its common stock traded publicly. Merger Sub will merge with and into Janus, with Janus surviving the merger as a direct and wholly owned
subsidiary of Henderson. Following closing of the merger, the registration of the Janus common stock and the reporting obligations of Janus with respect to its common stock under the Exchange Act
will be terminated. In addition, upon closing of the merger, shares of Janus common stock will no longer be listed on the NYSE or any other stock exchange or quotation system. Although current Janus
stockholders will no longer be stockholders of Janus, they will have an indirect interest in Janus through their ownership of Janus Henderson ordinary shares. Subject to the Henderson LSE de-listing
approval being obtained, upon closing of the merger, Henderson ordinary shares will be delisted from the LSE and the Janus Henderson ordinary shares will be listed on the NYSE. In addition, the Janus
Henderson CDIs will continue to be quoted and traded on the financial market operated by ASX. 

Q: What are the implications to Janus stockholders of Henderson being a "foreign private issuer"? 

A: Following completion of the merger, Janus Henderson will be subject to the reporting requirements under the Exchange Act applicable to foreign private issuers. Notwithstanding the fact that Janus
Henderson will be a foreign private issuer, Janus Henderson intends to file its annual report on Form 10-K and, starting with closing of the merger, to file quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current
reports on Form 8-K. As a foreign private issuer, Janus Henderson would be required to file an annual report on Form 20-F and to furnish reports on Form 6-K to the SEC regarding certain information
required to be publicly disclosed by Janus Henderson. In addition, as a foreign private issuer, Janus Henderson will be exempt from certain rules under the Exchange Act, including the proxy rules,
which impose certain disclosure and procedural requirements for proxy solicitations under Section 14 of the Exchange Act, and will not be required to comply with Regulation FD, which addresses
certain restrictions on the selective disclosure of material information. In addition, among other matters, Janus Henderson's officers, directors and principal stockholders will be exempt from the
reporting and "short-swing" profit recovery provisions of Section 16 of the Exchange Act and the rules under the Exchange Act with respect to their purchases and sales of Janus Henderson ordinary
shares. If Janus Henderson loses its status as a foreign private issuer, it will no longer be exempt from such rules and, among other things, will be required to file periodic reports and financial statements
as if it were a company incorporated in the United States. 

Q: What are the conditions to the closing of the merger? 

A: In addition to the adoption of the merger agreement by the Janus stockholders, the closing of the merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of a number of other conditions, including: 

• the approval of (i) the merger by the affirmative vote of a majority of the Henderson shareholders voting (in person or represented by proxy) at the Henderson shareholder meeting, (ii) the
Henderson share issuance proposal by the affirmative vote of a majority of the Henderson shareholders voting (in person or represented by proxy) at the Henderson shareholder meeting, (iii) the
Henderson amended articles proposal by the affirmative vote of two-thirds of the Henderson shareholders voting (in person or represented by proxy) at the Henderson shareholder meeting,
(iv) the Henderson name change proposal by the affirmative vote of two-thirds of the Henderson shareholders voting (in person or represented by proxy) at the Henderson shareholder meeting,
(v) the Henderson permitted dividend proposal by the affirmative vote of a majority of the Henderson shareholders voting (in person or represented by proxy) at the Henderson annual general
shareholder meeting and (vi) the Henderson LSE de-listing proposal by the affirmative vote of three-fourths of the Henderson shareholders voting

• the receipt of certain regulatory approvals and clearances, including (i) the termination or expiration of any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act, (ii) approval from the Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority, Inc., which we refer to as FINRA, pursuant to NASD Rule 1017 in connection with the merger, (iii) the required approval from the FCA, pursuant to Section 189(4)(a) of
the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, which we refer to as FSMA, (iv) the approval by the Jersey Financial Services Commission, which we refer to as the JFSC, of this proxy
statement/prospectus, the registration statement of which this proxy statement/prospectus forms a part and any other relevant document deemed to be a prospectus pursuant to the Jersey
Companies Law, and the issue by the JFSC of any consent required pursuant to the Control of Borrowing (Jersey) Order 1958 for Henderson to lawfully assume the Janus awards and plans, and
(iv) consents, non-objections and/or approvals from the applicable governmental authorities in Canada, Hong Kong, Ireland, Singapore, Switzerland, and, if applicable, Australia, India and Jersey
and certain other non-U.S. jurisdictions, as well as obtaining approvals, consents and/or non-objections from the applicable governmental authorities in Jersey, Switzerland and, if applicable,
Ireland necessary in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Dai-ichi agreements; 

• approval by the boards of trustees and shareholders of Janus-advised U.S. mutual funds of new investment advisory agreements with Janus to take effect at the closing of the merger representing
at least 67.5% of the assets under management of those funds as of September 30, 2016; 

• the absence of certain governmental restraints or prohibitions preventing the consummation of the merger; 

• the effectiveness of the registration statement of which this proxy statement/prospectus forms a part and the absence of any stop order or proceeding seeking a stop order; and 

• the approval for listing by the NYSE of the Henderson ordinary shares to be issued in connection with the merger, subject to official notice of issuance.

additional information on the conditions to closing of the merger, see the section entitled "The Merger—Description of the Merger Agreement—Conditions to Closing of the Merger" beginning

Q: What will happen to outstanding Janus equity awards in the merger? 

A: The merger agreement generally provides for the conversion of Janus Options, Janus RSU Awards, Janus PSU Awards and Janus Restricted Share Awards into corresponding awards for a number of
Janus Henderson ordinary shares, determined by multiplying the number of shares of Janus common stock subject to each Janus award by the exchange ratio (subject to adjustment to account for the
share consolidation). The exercise price of the Janus Options following the conversion will be determined by dividing the per-share exercise price of the Janus Options by the exchange ratio,

as adjusted to give effect to the share consolidation. The converted Janus equity awards will generally be subject to the same terms and conditions as the original Janus equity awards. For additional
information on the treatment of Janus equity awards, see the section entitled "The Merger—Description of the Merger Agreement—Merger Consideration" beginning on page 146.

Q: What will happen to the Janus Employee Stock Purchase Plan in the merger? 

A: The merger agreement generally provides that each outstanding award under Janus's Employee Stock Purchase Plan, which we refer to as the Janus ESPP, will be converted at the effective time into
corresponding awards for a number of Janus Henderson ordinary shares on the same basis as the Janus Options, provided that Janus and Henderson will cooperate prior to the effective time to determine
whether different treatment of the Janus ESPP is appropriate, which treatment may include termination of the Janus ESPP at the effective time of the merger. For additional information on the treatment
of Janus equity awards, see the section entitled "The Merger—Description of the Merger Agreement—Merger Consideration" beginning on page 146. 

Q: Are there any risks relating to the merger, Janus's business or the combined business that I should consider? 

A: Yes. There are risks associated with all mergers. These risks are discussed in more detail in the section entitled "Risk Factors" beginning on page 50 and you should also refer to the section entitled
"Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" beginning on page 49. 

Q: Are Janus stockholders entitled to appraisal rights? 

A: No. Under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, which we refer to as the DGCL, no appraisal rights are available to Janus stockholders in connection with the merger. 

Q: Will Janus still have an annual stockholders' meeting in 2017? 

A: Janus does not expect to hold an annual stockholders' meeting in 2017 while the merger is pending, and it currently plans to delay its 2017 annual stockholders' meeting and only hold an annual meeting
in 2017 if the merger is terminated. 

Q: What are the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger to U.S. holders of shares of Janus common stock? 

A: The parties intend the merger to be treated as a tax-free reorganization under section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, which we refer to as the Code. In addition, provided that
the fair market value of Henderson, at the time of the merger, equals or exceeds the fair market value of Janus, as specially determined for purposes of section 367 of the Code, the parties intend that the
merger should not be subject to section 367(a)(1) of the Code. 

Assuming that the merger is so treated, if you are a U.S. holder of Janus common stock and you exchange all of your Janus common stock for Henderson ordinary shares in the merger, you should not
recognize any gain or loss with respect to your Janus common stock, except to the extent of any cash you may receive in lieu of a fractional share.

If section 367(a)(1) of the Code were to apply to the merger, however, which cannot be determined definitively until the closing of the merger, a U.S. holder of Janus common stock would recognize gain
(but not loss) in an amount equal to the excess, if any, of the fair market value, as of the closing date of the merger, of Henderson ordinary shares received in the merger plus cash received in lieu of
fractional shares, over such U.S. holder's basis in the shares of Janus common stock surrendered by the U.S. holder in the merger. Any gain so recognized would

generally be long-term capital gain if the U.S. holder had held the Janus common stock for more than one year at the time the merger is completed. See "Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Taxes—The
merger may fail to qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of section 368(a) of the Code or may be subject to section 367(a)(1) of the Code, potentially causing U.S. holders of Janus common
stock to recognize taxable gain" beginning on page 66.

Janus has requested that Skadden render its opinion to Janus, which will be dated on or after the closing date of the merger and be based on certain facts, representations, covenants, and assumptions, that
the merger should be treated as a tax-free reorganization under section 368(a) of the Code and that section 367(a)(1) should not apply to the merger. Whether such opinion can be given will depend on
the facts as of the closing date. Moreover, if such opinion is rendered, there can be no assurance that the Internal Revenue Service, which we refer to as the IRS, will agree with the conclusions expressed
therein. The obligation of Janus and Henderson to consummate the merger, however, is not conditioned upon the receipt of such opinion from Skadden or any other counsel, nor have the parties applied
for a ruling from the IRS.

For a more complete description of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger, please see the section entitled "The Merger—U.S., U.K. and Jersey Tax Considerations—U.S. Federal
Income Tax Considerations for U.S. Holders" beginning on page 131.

Q: What are the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger to U.S. holders of Henderson ordinary shares? 

A: So long as section 7874 of the Code is not applicable to the merger, there are no U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger to U.S. holders of Henderson ordinary shares unless they also hold
Janus common stock. If section 7874 of the Code were to apply, there would be an indirect impact on Henderson shareholders because Janus Henderson could be treated as a U.S. corporation and
therefore could be liable for substantial U.S. federal income tax on its operations and income following the merger. In addition, non-U.S. shareholders could be subject to U.S. withholding tax on the
gross amount of any dividends paid by Janus Henderson to such shareholders. Finally, the ability to use tax attributes to offset certain income may be limited. 

Based on currently available data, the parties do not expect section 7874 to apply to the merger, although this conclusion cannot be made definitively until the closing of the merger.

For a more complete description of section 7874 and the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger for U.S. holders of Henderson ordinary shares, please see the sections entitled "Risk Factors
—Risks Relating to Taxes—The IRS may not agree with the conclusion that Janus Henderson is to be treated as a foreign corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes following the merger or may
assert that Janus Henderson is subject to certain adverse consequences for U.S. federal income tax purposes following the merger" beginning on page 64 and "The Merger—U.S., U.K. and Jersey Tax
Considerations—U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations for U.S. Holders" beginning on page 131.

will transact no other business at its special meeting except such business as may properly be brought before the Janus special meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof. 

Q: How does the Janus board recommend that I vote? 

A: The Janus board unanimously approved the merger agreement and determined that the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger, are advisable and fair to and in
the best interests of Janus and its stockholders.

Table of Contents

• "FOR" the Janus adjournment proposal. 

Q: How do I vote? 

A: If you are a holder of record of Janus common stock as of the close of business on the record date for the Janus special meeting, you may vote in person by attending the applicable special meeting or, to
ensure your shares are represented at the applicable meeting, you may vote by: 

• accessing the Internet website specified on your proxy card; 

• calling the toll-free number specified on your proxy card; or 

• marking, signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy card in the postage-paid envelope provided. 

If your shares are held in street name, through a broker, bank, trustee or other nominee, please follow the instructions on a voting instruction card furnished by the record holder.

Q: How do I vote shares of Janus common stock I hold through the Employee Stock Ownership Plan and/or the Kansas City Southern 401(k) Plan? 

A: Each participant in the Employee Stock Ownership Plan of Janus, which we refer to as the Janus ESOP, and the Kansas City Southern 401(k) Plan, which we refer to as the KCS 401(k) Plan, may
instruct the respective trustees of these plans on how to vote the shares of Janus common stock held on behalf of the participant under such plans. The trustee of each plan must receive your voting
instructions for the common stock allocated to your Janus ESOP or KCS 401(k) Plan account before April 21, 2017. If the trustee for the Janus ESOP or the KCS 401(k) Plan does not receive your
voting instructions before April 21, 2017, it will vote those shares, subject to the requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, in the same proportion as the
voting instructions that it receives from other Janus ESOP or KCS 401(k) Plan account holders (as applicable). 

Q: If I am a Janus stockholder and my shares are represented by physical stock certificates, should I send in my stock certificates now? 

A: No. After the merger is completed, you will receive a transmittal form with instructions for the surrender of your Janus stock certificates. Please do not send in your stock certificates with your proxy
card. 

Q: What is a "broker non-vote"? 

A: Under NYSE rules, banks, brokers and other nominees may use their discretion to vote "uninstructed" shares (i.e., shares held of record by banks, brokerage firms or other nominees but with respect to
which the beneficial owner of such shares has not provided instructions on how to vote on a particular proposal) with respect to matters that are considered to be "routine," but not with respect to "non-
routine" matters. "Non-routine" matters are matters that may substantially affect the rights or privileges of stockholders, such as mergers, stockholder proposals, elections of directors (even if not
contested), executive compensation (including any advisory stockholder votes on executive compensation) and certain corporate governance proposals, even if management-supported. A "broker non-
vote" occurs on an item when (i) a broker, nominee or intermediary has discretionary authority to vote on one or more proposals to be voted on at a meeting of stockholders, but is not permitted to vote
on other proposals without instructions from the beneficial owner of the shares and (ii) the beneficial owner fails to provide the broker, nominee or intermediary with such instructions. Because none of
the proposals to be voted on at the Janus

special meeting are routine matters for which brokers may have discretionary authority to vote, Janus does not expect there to be any broker non-votes at the Janus special meeting.

Q: What vote is required to approve each Janus proposal? 

A: Proposal to Adopt the Merger Agreement by Janus Stockholders.    Approving the Janus merger proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of Janus common stock
entitled to vote on the Janus merger proposal. Accordingly, a Janus stockholder's failure to submit a proxy card or to vote in person at the Janus special meeting, an abstention from voting, or a broker
non-vote will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the proposal to adopt the merger agreement. 

Proposal Regarding Certain Merger-Related Executive Compensation Arrangements.    In accordance with Section 14A of the Exchange Act, Janus is providing stockholders with the opportunity to
approve, by non-binding advisory vote, compensation payments for Janus's named executive officers in connection with the merger. Approving the Janus compensation proposal, on a non-binding
advisory basis, requires the affirmative vote of a majority of Janus stockholders present, in person or represented by proxy, and entitled to vote at the Janus special meeting. Accordingly, abstentions of
Janus stockholders present (in person or represented by proxy) at the Janus special meeting will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the Janus compensation proposal. A Janus stockholder's
failure to submit a proxy card will have no effect on the Janus compensation proposal. A Janus stockholder who attends the Janus special meeting but does not vote will have the same effect as a vote
"AGAINST" the Janus compensation proposal.

Proposals Regarding Certain Amendments to the Henderson Memorandum of Association and Henderson Articles of Association.    Approving each of the amendment proposals, on a non-binding
advisory basis, requires the affirmative vote of a majority of Janus stockholders present, in person or represented by proxy, and entitled to vote at the Janus special meeting. Accordingly, abstentions of
Janus stockholders present (in person or represented by proxy) at the Janus special meeting will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" each of the amendment proposals. A Janus stockholder's
failure to submit a proxy card will have no effect on the amendment proposals. A Janus stockholder who attends the Janus special meeting but does not vote will have the same effect as a vote
"AGAINST" each of the amendment proposals.

Proposal to Adjourn the Janus special meeting by Janus stockholders.    Approving the Janus adjournment proposal (if necessary or appropriate to obtain additional proxies if there are not sufficient
votes to adopt the merger agreement) requires the affirmative vote of a majority of Janus stockholders present, in person or represented by proxy, and entitled to vote at the Janus special meeting.
Accordingly, abstentions of Janus stockholders present (in person or represented by proxy) at the Janus special meeting will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the Janus compensation proposal.

Q: How many votes do I have? 

A: You are entitled to cast one vote for each share of Janus common stock that you owned as of the close of business on the record date for the Janus special meeting. As of the close of business on
March 15, 2017, there were 184,297,796 shares of Janus common stock issued and outstanding entitled to vote at the Janus special meeting. 

Q: Do the Janus stockholders have to vote on the Janus merger proposal at the Janus special meeting if the Janus board has changed its recommendation of the Janus merger proposal? 

A: Yes. Unless the merger agreement is terminated before the Janus special meeting, Janus will notify the Janus stockholders before the Janus special meeting if the Janus board has changed its

recommendation with respect to the adoption of the merger agreement, and the Janus stockholders will be asked to vote on such adoption even if the Janus board has so changed its recommendation.

Q: What will happen if I am present at the Janus special meeting, in person or by proxy, and I fail to vote or I abstain from voting? 

A: Proposal to Adopt the Merger Agreement by Janus stockholders.    If you are a Janus stockholder and fail to vote, fail to instruct a broker or other nominee to vote, or abstain, it will have the same effect
as a vote "AGAINST" the Janus merger proposal. 

Proposal Regarding Certain Merger-Related Executive Compensation Arrangements.    If you are a Janus stockholder present at the Janus special meeting (in person or represented by proxy) and fail to
vote or abstain, it will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the Janus compensation proposal.

Proposals Regarding Certain Amendments to the Henderson Memorandum of Association and Henderson Articles of Association.    If you are a Janus stockholder present at the Janus special meeting (in
person or represented by proxy) and fail to vote or abstain, it will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" each of the amendment proposals.

Proposal to Adjourn the Janus special meeting by Janus stockholders.    If you are a Janus stockholder present at the Janus special meeting (in person or represented by proxy) and fail to vote or abstain,
it will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the Janus adjournment proposal.

Q: What constitutes a quorum? 

A: A quorum of stockholders is necessary to transact business at the Janus special meeting. A quorum exists if the holders of at least a majority of the shares of Janus common stock entitled to vote are
present either in person or represented by proxy at the meeting. Abstentions and broker non-votes will be counted in determining whether a quorum exists. Because none of the proposals to be voted on
at the Janus special meeting are routine matters for which brokers may have discretionary authority to vote, Janus does not expect any broker non-votes at the Janus special meeting. 

Q: If my shares are held in "street name" by my broker, will my broker automatically vote my shares for me? 

A: No. If you hold your shares in a stock brokerage account or if your shares are held by a bank or nominee, that is, in "street name", your broker, bank, trust company or other nominee cannot vote your
shares on "non-routine" matters without instructions from you. You should instruct your broker, bank, trust company or other nominee as to how to vote your shares, following the directions provided by
your broker, bank, trust company or other nominee to you. Please check the voting form used by your broker, bank, trust company or other nominee. 

If you are a Janus stockholder and you do not provide your broker, bank, trust company or other nominee with instructions and your broker, bank, trust company or other nominee submits an unvoted
proxy, your shares of Janus common stock will be counted for purposes of determining a quorum at the Janus special meeting, but will not be voted on any proposal on which your broker, bank, trust
company or other nominee does not have discretionary authority.

Q: What will happen if I return my proxy card without indicating how to vote? 

A: If you are a registered holder of record and you return your signed proxy card but do not indicate your voting preferences, the persons named in the proxy card will vote the shares represented by that
proxy as recommended by the Janus board. 

Please note that you may not vote shares held in street name by returning a proxy card directly to Janus, or by voting in person at the Janus special meeting unless you provide a "legal proxy", which you
must obtain from your broker, bank, trust company or other nominee.

If you are a Janus stockholder and you do not instruct your broker on how to vote your shares of Janus common stock, your broker may not vote your shares of Janus common stock, which will have the
same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the Janus merger proposal but will have no effect on the Janus compensation proposal, the amendment proposals or the Janus adjournment proposal, assuming a
quorum is present. However, because none of the proposals to be voted on at the Janus special meeting are routine matters for which brokers may have discretionary authority to vote, Janus does not
expect any broker non-votes at the Janus special meeting.

Q: Can I change my vote after I have returned a proxy or voting instruction card? 

A: Yes. You can change your vote or revoke your proxy at any time before it is exercised at the Janus special meeting by doing any of the following: 

• Deliver a written notice of revocation to the General Counsel and Secretary, Janus Capital Group Inc., 151 Detroit Street, Denver, Colorado 80206 by 5:00 p.m. Denver time on April 24, 2017. 

• Complete, sign, and timely submit a new proxy card with a later date. 

• Timely submit a proxy with new voting instructions using the telephone or Internet voting system. 

• Vote in person at the Janus special meeting. 

Your attendance at the special meeting in and of itself will not revoke any proxy.

Q: Are any Janus stockholders already committed to vote in favor of any of the special meeting proposals? 

A: Under a voting and support agreement with Dai-ichi and Henderson, which we call the "voting agreement," Dai-ichi has agreed to vote all of its shares of Janus common stock in favor of the Janus
merger proposal and have granted to Henderson a proxy to vote its shares in favor of the Janus merger proposal. As of March 15, 2017, Dai-ichi beneficially owned (with sole or shared voting power)
36,382,545 shares, or 19.74%, of the Janus common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the special meeting. For more information, see "Dai-ichi Agreements" beginning on page 167. 

Q: What happens if I transfer my Janus common stock before the Janus special meeting? 

A: The record date for the Janus special meeting is earlier than both the date of the Janus special meeting and the date that the merger is expected to be completed. If you transfer your shares of Janus
common stock after the record date but before the Janus special meeting, you will retain your right to vote at the Janus special meeting. However, in order to receive the merger consideration you must
hold your shares of Janus common stock through the closing of the merger.

Q: Who is the inspector of election? 

A: The Janus board has appointed David W. Grawemeyer, Amy J. Stefonick and Broadridge Financial Services to act as inspectors of election at the Janus special meeting. 

Q: Where can I find the voting results of the Janus special meeting? 

A: The preliminary voting results are expected to be announced at the Janus special meeting. In addition, within four business days following certification of the final voting results, Janus intends to furnish
on Form 8-K the final voting results of its special meeting with the SEC. 

Q: What will happen if the Janus merger proposal to be considered at the Janus special meeting is not approved? 

A: As a condition to the closing of the merger, Janus stockholders must approve the Janus merger proposal. Closing of the merger is not conditioned or dependent on approval of any of the other proposals
to be considered at the Janus special meeting. Under specified circumstances, Janus or Henderson may be required to pay to, or be entitled to receive from, the other party, a fee with respect to
termination of the merger agreement, see "The Merger—Description of the Merger Agreement—Expenses and Termination Fees" beginning on page 163. 

Q: Why are Janus stockholders being asked to approve, on a non-binding advisory basis, the compensation that may be paid or become payable to Janus's named executive officers in
connection with the closing of the merger? 

A: The rules promulgated by the SEC under Section 14A of the Exchange Act require Janus to seek a non-binding, advisory vote with respect to certain compensation that may be paid or become payable to
Janus's named executive officers in "Janus Proposal 2: The Janus Compensation Proposal" beginning on page 173. 

Q: What will happen if Janus stockholders do not approve, on a non-binding advisory basis, the payments to Janus's named executive officers in connection with the closing of the merger? 

A: The votes on the Janus compensation proposal are votes separate and apart from the votes on the Janus merger proposal. Accordingly, Janus stockholders may vote in favor of the Janus merger proposal
and not in favor of the Janus compensation proposal, or vice versa. Approval of the Janus compensation proposal is not a condition to consummation of the merger, and it is advisory in nature only,
meaning it will not be binding on Janus. 

Q: Why are Janus stockholders being asked to approve, on a non-binding advisory basis, the amendments to the Henderson Memorandum of Association and Henderson Articles of Association?

A: Each stockholder of Janus will become a shareholder of Janus Henderson upon completion of the merger and the ordinary shares of Janus Henderson received by the Janus stockholders will be governed
by the Janus Henderson Amended Memorandum and Janus Henderson Amended Articles. Accordingly, Janus stockholders are being provided the opportunity to cast a non-binding advisory vote on
several of the amendments to the Henderson Memorandum of Association and Henderson Articles of Association. As an advisory vote, none of these proposals is binding upon Janus or Henderson (or
Janus Henderson), and approval of these proposals is not a condition to completion of the merger. However, Janus seeks the support of Janus stockholders and believes that stockholder support is
appropriate because the Janus stockholders will become Janus Henderson shareholders upon completion of the merger. Accordingly, holders of Janus common stock are being asked to vote on the non-
binding amendment proposals.

on page 218.

Q: What will happen if Janus stockholders do not approve, on a non-binding advisory basis, any of the amendments to the Henderson Memorandum of Association or Henderson Articles of
Association? 

A: Approval by Janus stockholders of the amendment proposals is not a condition to completion of the merger. The votes by Janus stockholders with respect to the amendment proposals are advisory and
will not be binding on Janus or Henderson (or Janus Henderson). If Henderson's shareholders approve the Janus Henderson Amended Memorandum and Janus Henderson Amended Articles, the Janus
Henderson Amended Memorandum and Janus Henderson Amended Articles will be effective upon completion of the merger. See "Janus Proposals 3 through 7: The Amendment Proposals" beginning

After the Merger 

Merger Consideration (see page 146)

        Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the merger agreement, at the effective time, each share of Janus common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time will be
cancelled and each holder of such share of Janus common stock will have the right to receive 4.7190 fully paid and non-assessable Henderson ordinary shares, plus cash in lieu of fractional Henderson
ordinary shares, based on then prevailing market prices, without interest, which we refer to as the merger consideration. Effective immediately prior to closing of the merger, subject to approval by the
Henderson shareholders at the Henderson shareholder meeting, Henderson will implement the share consolidation at a ratio of one Janus Henderson ordinary share (or CDI, as applicable) for every
10 Henderson ordinary shares (or CDIs, as applicable) outstanding (so that at closing of the merger each Janus stockholder will receive 0.4719 Janus Henderson ordinary shares for each share of Janus
common stock). In addition, each share of common stock of Merger Sub, par value $0.01 per share, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time will be cancelled and, in exchange for
the cancellation and the funding of the merger consideration by Henderson, Janus, as the surviving corporation in the merger will issue an equivalent number of fully paid and non-assessable shares of
common stock of Janus, par value $0.01 per share, all of which shares shall be held by Janus Henderson, and which shall constitute the only outstanding shares of common stock of Janus, as the surviving
corporation, immediately following the effective time.

        The merger agreement does not contain any provision that would adjust the exchange ratio based on the fluctuations in the market value of either the Janus common stock or Henderson ordinary
shares or currency exchange rates. Because of this, the implied value of consideration to the Janus stockholders may fluctuate between now and closing of the merger. The value of the consideration to
Janus stockholders will depend on the market value of Henderson ordinary shares at the time the merger is completed and on currency exchange rates. However, the merger agreement provides that the
merger consideration will be adjusted appropriately to reflect the effect of any stock/share split, reverse stock split, share consolidation (including the share consolidation), share subdivision, share bonus
issue or stock/share dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into the Henderson ordinary shares or Janus common stock, as applicable), reorganization, recapitalization,
reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other like change with respect to the number of

shares of Henderson ordinary shares or Janus common stock issued and outstanding after October 3, 2016 and prior to the effective time.

        On September 30, 2016, the last trading day prior to the public announcement of the merger, for Henderson ordinary shares, the closing price on the LSE was 232.00 pence per share and, for shares
of Janus common stock, the closing price on the NYSE was $14.01 per share. On September 30, 2016, the exchange rate for pounds sterling was $1.2972 per pound sterling as reported by Bloomberg.
The implied value of the merger consideration payable in respect of each share of Janus common stock was 1,094.81 pence, or $14.20 in dollar equivalent. The total merger consideration as of the date
immediately prior to the public announcement of the merger, based on 179,762,551 diluted shares of Janus common stock, was $2,552,960,673.

        On December 31, 2016, for Henderson ordinary shares, the closing price on the LSE was 235.60 pence per share and, for shares of Janus common stock, the closing price on the NYSE was $13.27
per share. On December 31, 2016, the exchange rate for pounds sterling was $1.2340 per pound sterling as reported by Bloomberg. The implied value of the merger consideration payable in respect of

2017, based on 179,560,968 diluted shares of Janus common stock, was $2,422,446,509.

        We urge you to obtain current market quotations and currency exchange rates before voting your shares of Janus common stock.

Share Consolidation (see page 144)

        Subject to approval by the Henderson shareholders at the Henderson shareholder meeting, upon the effectiveness of the Janus Henderson Amended Memorandum immediately prior to the effective
time of the merger, which we refer to as the share consolidation effective time, the Henderson ordinary shares and CDIs outstanding immediately prior to the share consolidation effective time will be
consolidated into a smaller number of shares or CDIs, as applicable, such that a Henderson shareholder will own one Janus Henderson ordinary share (or one Janus Henderson CDI) for each 10 issued
Henderson ordinary shares (or CDIs, as applicable) held by that Henderson shareholder immediately prior to the share consolidation effective time.

        No fractional shares or CDIs will be issued in connection with the share consolidation. Fractional entitlements arising because a Henderson shareholder of record holds a number of pre-consolidation
Henderson ordinary shares not evenly divisible by 10 will be aggregated with the number of shares allocated to the CDI depositary in excess of the total number of shares to which CDI holders would
have been entitled had they been Henderson shareholders of record immediately prior to the share consolidation, and all such shares will be sold on the market for the best price reasonably obtainable.
The net proceeds of such sale, after the deduction of the expenses of the sale (including any fees in relation to currency conversions), will be paid in due proportion to the relevant Henderson shareholders
of record or CDI holders (as applicable), in the case of CDI holders, such that they are paid the amount that they would have received in respect of the sale of fractional shares had they been a Henderson
shareholder of record immediately prior to the share consolidation.

        The approval of the share consolidation by the Henderson shareholders at the Henderson shareholder meeting is inter-conditional with the approval of the merger, the Henderson share issuance
proposal, the Henderson amended articles proposal, the Henderson name change proposal and the Henderson LSE de-listing proposal, which means that for any of such matters to take effect, they must
all be passed.

        As a result of the share consolidation, and in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement, the exchange ratio (being 4.7190 existing Henderson ordinary shares for each share of Janus
common stock) will be adjusted so that at closing of the merger each Janus stockholder will receive 0.4719 Janus Henderson ordinary shares for each share of Janus common stock.

        Janus stockholders will also be entitled to receive cash in lieu of any fractional entitlement to new Janus Henderson ordinary shares based on the then prevailing market price.

Treatment of Henderson Equity Awards (see page 128)

        All Henderson equity awards will remain outstanding in accordance with the terms and conditions under the applicable plan and award agreement in effect immediately prior to the effective time
(subject to adjustment to account for the share consolidation). For additional information on these amended terms and conditions, see the sections entitled "The Merger—Interests of Henderson Directors
and Executive Officers in the Merger" beginning on page 128.

Treatment of Janus Equity Awards (see page 146)

        The merger agreement provides that, as of the effective time (subject to adjustment to account for the share consolidation):

• except for certain required adjustments under the Code, each Janus Option outstanding immediately prior to the effective time, whether vested or unvested, will be converted into an option
exercisable for that number of Janus Henderson ordinary shares equal to the product of (i) the aggregate number of shares of Janus common stock for which such Janus Option was
exercisable multiplied by (ii) the exchange ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole share. The exercise price per share of such converted Janus Option will be adjusted so that it is equal to
(A) the exercise price per share of such Janus Option immediately prior to the effective time divided by (B) the exchange ratio, rounded up to the nearest cent; 

• each Janus RSU Award outstanding immediately prior to the effective time, whether vested or unvested, will be converted into a Janus Henderson restricted share unit award with respect
to Janus Henderson ordinary shares on the terms and conditions (including any continuing vesting requirements) under the applicable plan and award agreement in effect immediately prior
to the effective time, with the aggregate number of Janus Henderson restricted share units held by each holder (rounded up to the nearest whole unit) determined by multiplying (i) the
number of shares of Janus common stock subject to such Janus RSU Award immediately prior to the effective time by (ii) the exchange ratio; 

• each Janus PSU Award outstanding immediately prior to the effective time, whether vested or unvested, will be converted into a Janus Henderson restricted share unit award with respect to
Janus Henderson ordinary shares on the terms and conditions (including any continuing vesting requirements) under the applicable plan and award agreement in effect immediately prior to
the effective time, with the aggregate number of Janus Henderson restricted share units held by each holder (rounded up to the nearest whole unit) determined by multiplying (i) the
number of shares of Janus common stock subject to such Janus PSU Award immediately prior to the effective time by (ii) the exchange ratio, provided that, in accordance with their
existing terms and conditions, Janus PSU Awards granted in 2014 to Richard Weil will be converted as of the effective time into Janus Henderson restricted share unit awards with respect
to Janus

Henderson ordinary shares on the terms and conditions (including any continuing time-based vesting requirements) under the applicable plan and award agreement in effect immediately
prior to the effective time, with the aggregate number of Janus Henderson restricted share units held by Mr. Weil (rounded up to the nearest whole unit) determined by multiplying (A) the
number of shares of Janus common stock subject to Mr. Weil's Janus PSU Awards that are earned based on achievement of the applicable performance criteria as of (or approximate to) the
effective time in accordance with the terms and conditions of the applicable award agreement by (B) the exchange ratio;

• each Janus Restricted Share Award outstanding immediately prior to the effective time will be converted into a restricted Janus Henderson ordinary share award on the terms and
conditions (including any continuing vesting requirements) under the applicable plan and award agreement in effect immediately prior to the effective time, with the aggregate number of
restricted Janus Henderson ordinary shares held by each holder (rounded up to the nearest whole share) determined by multiplying (i) the number of shares of Janus common stock subject
to such Janus Restricted Share Award immediately prior to the effective time by (ii) the exchange ratio; and 

• each outstanding award under the Janus ESPP will be converted at the effective time into corresponding awards for a number of Janus Henderson ordinary shares on the same basis as the
Janus Options, provided that Janus and Henderson will cooperate prior to the effective time to determine the appropriate treatment of the Janus ESPP in connection with the consummation
of the merger, which may include termination of the Janus ESPP at the effective time.

U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger to U.S. Holders of Janus Common Stock (see page 131)

        The parties intend the merger to be treated as a tax-free reorganization under section 368(a) of the Code. In addition, provided that the fair market value of Henderson, at the time of the merger,
equals or exceeds the fair market value of Janus, as specially determined for purposes of section 367 of the Code, the parties intend that the merger should not be subject to section 367(a)(1) of the Code.

        Assuming that the merger is so treated, if you are a U.S. holder of Janus common stock and you exchange all of your Janus common stock for Henderson ordinary shares in the merger, you should
not recognize any gain or loss with respect to your Janus common stock, except to the extent of any cash you may receive in lieu of a fractional share.

        If section 367(a)(1) of the Code were to apply to the merger, however, which cannot be determined definitively until the closing of the merger, a U.S. holder of Janus common stock would recognize
gain (but not loss) in an amount equal to the excess, if any, of the fair market value, as of the closing date of the merger, of Henderson ordinary shares received in the merger plus cash received in lieu of
fractional shares, over such U.S. holder's basis in the shares of Janus common stock surrendered by the U.S. holder in the merger. Any gain so recognized would generally be long-term capital gain if the
U.S. holder had held the Janus common stock for more than one year at the time the merger is completed.

        Janus has requested that Skadden render its opinion to Janus, which will be dated on or after the closing date of the merger and be based on certain facts, representations, covenants, and assumptions,
that the merger should be treated as a tax-free reorganization under section 368(a) of the Code and that section 367(a)(1) should not apply to the merger. Whether such opinion can be given will depend on
the facts as of the closing date. Moreover, if such opinion is rendered, there can be no assurance that the IRS will agree with the conclusions expressed therein. The obligation of Janus and Henderson to
consummate the merger, however, is not conditioned upon the receipt of such opinion from Skadden or any other counsel, nor have the parties applied for a ruling from the IRS.

Janus's Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of the Janus Board (see page 99)

        After careful consideration, the Janus board, on October 1, 2016, unanimously approved the merger agreement and determined that entering into the merger agreement and consummating the
transactions contemplated thereby are advisable and fair to, and in the best interests of, Janus and its stockholders. For factors considered by the Janus board in reaching its decision to approve the merger
agreement, see the section entitled "The Merger—Janus's Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of the Janus Board" beginning on page 99. The Janus board unanimously recommends that Janus
stockholders vote "FOR" each of the Janus merger proposal, the Janus compensation proposal, the amendment proposals and the Janus adjournment proposal.

Opinion of Janus's Financial Advisor (see page 113)

        Janus retained Loeb Spencer House to act as its financial advisor in connection with the merger. At the meeting of the Janus board on October 1, 2016, Loeb Spencer House rendered its oral opinion
to the Janus board that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth in its opinion, the exchange ratio in the merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to
holders of Janus's common stock (other than Janus or any wholly-owned subsidiary of Janus or Henderson and its affiliates). Loeb Spencer House confirmed its October 1, 2016 oral opinion by delivering
its written opinion to the Janus board, dated October 1, 2016, that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth in its opinion, the exchange ratio in the merger was
fair, from a financial point of view, to holders of Janus common stock (other than Janus or any wholly-owned subsidiary of Janus or Henderson and its affiliates).

        The full text of the written opinion of Loeb Spencer House, dated October 1, 2016, which sets forth the assumptions made, matters considered and limits on the review undertaken, is attached as
Annex C to this proxy statement/prospectus. Janus's stockholders are urged to read the opinion in its entirety. Loeb Spencer House's written opinion was addressed to the Janus board (in its capacity as
such) in connection with and for the purposes of its evaluation of the merger, spoke only as of October 1, 2016, was directed only to the exchange ratio in the merger and did not address any other aspect
of the merger. The opinion does not constitute a recommendation to any stockholder of Janus as to how such stockholder should vote with respect to the Janus merger proposal or any other matter.

        For further information, see the section of this proxy statement/prospectus entitled "The Merger—Opinion of Janus's Financial Advisor" beginning on page 113 of this proxy statement/prospectus
and Annex C.

Interests of Henderson Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger (see page 128)

        Janus and Henderson are currently anticipating closing of the merger on May 30, 2017, subject to the receipt of required stockholder and shareholder approvals and regulatory approvals and
clearances and the satisfaction or waiver of the other closing conditions. However, it is possible that the merger may be completed at a later time or not at all.

Dai-ichi Agreements (see page 167)

Voting Agreement

        On October 3, 2016, Dai-ichi entered into a voting and support agreement with Janus and Henderson, pursuant to which Dai-ichi, among other things and subject to the terms and conditions thereof,
agreed to vote in favor of the approval of the Janus merger proposal and the Janus adjournment proposal and against any alternative business combination transaction. As of March 15, 2017, Dai-ichi
beneficially owned, in the aggregate, 36,382,545 shares of common stock, which represented approximately 19.74% of the issued and outstanding shares of Janus common stock on such date. See "Dai-
ichi Agreements—Voting and Support Agreement" on page 170.

Amended and Restated Investment and Strategic Cooperation Agreement

        On October 3, 2016, Dai-ichi entered into an amended and restated investment and strategic cooperation agreement with Janus and Henderson, pursuant to which, among other things and subject to
the terms and conditions thereof, Dai-ichi agrees to maintain a certain level of investments in investment products of Janus Henderson, as well as certain standstill obligations in respect of Janus
Henderson ordinary shares and certain restrictions on the transfer of its Janus Henderson ordinary shares and receives the right to designate a representative to the Janus Henderson board. See "Dai-ichi
Agreements—Amended and Restated Investment and Strategic Cooperation Agreement" beginning on page 167.

Option Agreement

        On October 3, 2016, Henderson and Dai-ichi entered into an option agreement pursuant to which, conditional on closing of the merger, Henderson will, subject to the terms and conditions therein,
grant Dai-ichi: (i) 11 conditional options, each to subscribe for or purchase 500,000 Janus Henderson ordinary shares at a strike price of 2,997.2 pence per share (the terms of such options having been
adjusted in accordance with the terms of the Dai-ichi option agreement to take account of the effect of the share consolidation), and (ii) subject to the approval of Henderson shareholders (to be sought at
the Henderson shareholder meeting in relation to the merger), nine conditional options, each to subscribe for or purchase 500,000 Janus Henderson ordinary shares at a strike price of 2,997.2 pence per
share (the terms of such options having been adjusted in accordance with the terms of the Dai-ichi option agreement to take account of the effect of the share consolidation). The price that Dai-ichi will
pay at closing for the purchase of the options is £19.8 million (provided that, if the requisite Henderson shareholder approval is not obtained at the Henderson shareholder meeting in relation to the
merger, no amount shall be due from Dai-ichi in respect of the nine unapproved options). In aggregate, the options sold to Dai-ichi would, if exercised at closing of the merger (and subject to relevant
regulatory approvals), entitle Dai-ichi to purchase an additional approximately 5% of the ordinary shares of Janus Henderson.

such representations and warranties relate to a specific date or as of the date of the original merger agreement, in which case such representations and warranties must be true and correct as

No Solicitation of Alternative Proposals (see page 154)

        The merger agreement contains detailed provisions outlining the circumstances in which Janus and Henderson may respond to competing proposals received from third parties. Under reciprocal
provisions, Janus and Henderson each have agreed not to, and not to authorize or permit any of its controlled affiliates or any of its or their officers, directors or employees to, and to use its reasonable
best efforts to cause any investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other representative retained by it or any of its controlled affiliates not to, directly or indirectly:

• solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage (including furnishing information in connection with any inquiry or proposal with respect to an "alternative transaction", as defined on page 154), or
knowingly take any other action designed to facilitate, any inquiries regarding, or the making of, any proposal the consummation of which would constitute an alternative transaction; 

• engage or participate in any discussions or negotiations, regarding any proposal the consummation of which would constitute an alternative transaction, except to notify such person or
group of persons as to the existence of the provisions of the merger agreement summarized in this section; or 

• resolve, propose or agree to do any of the foregoing.

        If Janus or Henderson, at any time prior to obtaining approval of its stockholders or shareholders, respectively, receives "an unsolicited proposal" that its board of directors determines in good faith
(after consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor of U.S. or U.K. nationally recognized reputation) that any such proposal that did not result from a material breach of the non-solicitation
obligations set forth in the merger agreement constitutes or could reasonably be expected to result in a

described below, take the following actions:

• furnish information about itself and its subsidiaries to the person (or group of persons) making such proposal (and its representatives and financing sources) (provided that all such
information has previously been provided to the other party or is promptly provided to the other party prior to or substantially concurrent with the time it is provided to such person)
pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement containing terms as to confidentiality (it being understood that such confidentiality agreement need not include any "standstill" or other
similar terms that prohibit the counterparty thereto or any of its affiliates or representatives from making any proposal for an alternative transaction with such party, or acquiring such party
or taking any other similar action) that are generally no less restrictive than the terms of the confidentiality agreement entered into between Janus and Henderson; and 

• participate in discussions or negotiations regarding such proposal with the person (or group of persons) making such proposal (and its representatives and financing sources).

        Janus and Henderson have each also agreed to (i) notify the other party promptly, and in any event within 24 hours of receipt, of any request for substantive information or of any proposal relating to
an alternative transaction, the material terms and conditions of such request or proposal (including any changes thereto) and the identity of the person making such request or proposal; (ii) keep the other
party reasonably informed of the status and details (including amendments or proposed amendments) of any such request or proposal on a current basis; and (iii) provide the other party, as soon as
reasonably practicable, copies of all material substantive correspondence and other material written materials exchanged with the person making the proposal that describes in any material respect any of
the material terms or conditions of any such request or proposal. For more information on the no solicitation provisions in the merger agreement, see the section entitled "The Merger—Description of the
Merger Agreement—No Solicitation of Alternative Proposals" beginning on page 154.

Changes in Board Recommendations (see page 155)

        Janus, through its board of directors, has agreed to recommend approval to its stockholders of the Janus merger proposal, and to include such recommendations in this proxy statement/prospectus.
Henderson, through its board of directors, has agreed to recommend approval to its shareholders of the merger, the Henderson share issuance proposal, the Henderson name change proposal, the
Henderson amended articles proposal, the Henderson LSE de-listing proposal, the Henderson option proposal and the Henderson permitted dividend proposal.

        Except as provided below, each of the Janus board and the Henderson board is not permitted to:

• effect a board recommendation change (as defined on page 156); 

• approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend, any alternative transaction; or 

• enter into, or cause any of its controlled affiliates to enter into, any letter of intent, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement or other agreement related to any alternative transaction
(other than a confidentiality agreement otherwise permitted by the merger agreement).

        However, prior to obtaining the relevant stockholder or shareholder approvals, as applicable, the Janus board or the Henderson board, as applicable, is permitted to make a change of
recommendation, if:

• such board of directors has concluded in good faith, after it has received a superior proposal (as defined on page 155) (and after consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor of
U.S.

or U.K. nationally recognized reputation) that the failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law; or

• such board of directors has concluded in good faith (and after consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor of U.S. or U.K. nationally recognized reputation) that it is required
to do so pursuant to its fiduciary duties under applicable law.

        Prior to making a change of recommendation in response to a superior proposal, the party doing so must provide the other party with at least four business days' written notice specifying the material
terms and conditions of such proposal, identifying the person making such proposal and stating that it intends to take such action, or in the event of a subsequent modification to the material terms and
conditions of such superior proposal, at least two business days' written notice advising such other party of the modification to such terms and conditions, so long as during such four or two business day
notice period, as applicable, such party engages (to the extent requested by the other party) in good faith negotiations with the other party to amend the merger agreement in such a manner that the
proposal to enter into an alternative transaction no longer constitutes a superior proposal.

        If either Janus or Henderson effects a change of recommendation, such party has no termination right and will be required to submit the Janus merger proposal (in case of Janus) or the merger
proposal, the Henderson amended articles proposal, the Henderson name change proposal, the Henderson permitted dividend proposal and the Henderson LSE de-listing proposal (in case of Henderson)
to a vote of their stockholders and shareholders, respectively, at their respective special and shareholder meetings unless the merger agreement is earlier terminated in accordance with its terms.

        The parties have agreed that, to the extent that the U.K. Panel on Takeovers and Mergers determines that any of the above provisions either require Henderson to take an action that is not permitted,
or restrict Henderson from taking an action that is required, under Rule 21.2 of the U.K. City Code on Takeovers and Mergers, which we refer to as the City Code, such provision shall be disregarded in
respect of both parties.

Termination of the Merger Agreement (see page 162)

        The merger agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the effective time, whether before or after receipt of the required stockholder or shareholder approvals, as applicable, including the
following circumstances:

• by mutual written consent of Janus and Henderson; or 

• by either Janus or Henderson: 

• if the merger is not consummated by September 30, 2017, which we refer to as the outside date (however, this right to terminate the merger agreement will not be available to a
party whose breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained in the merger agreement has been the primary cause of, or primarily resulted in, the
failure of the merger to be consummated by such time); 

• if any of the Henderson required shareholder approvals of the merger, the Henderson share issuance proposal, the Henderson amended articles proposal, the Henderson name
change proposal and the Henderson permitted dividend proposal has not been obtained by reason of the failure to obtain the required vote at a duly convened Henderson
shareholders meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof; 

• if the Janus required stockholder approval of the Janus merger proposal has not been obtained by reason of the failure to obtain the required vote at a duly convened Janus
stockholders meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof;

• if any restraint having the effect of preventing the consummation of the merger shall have become final and non-appealable or if any governmental entity that must grant a requisite
regulatory approval has denied approval of the merger and such denial has become final and non-appealable; or 

• if the other party has breached or failed to perform under the merger agreement, where such breach or failure to perform would give rise to failure of the related condition which is
not curable prior to the outside date, or if curable prior to the outside date is not cured within the earlier of 30 days after written notice from the other party or five business days
prior to the outside date; provided that this right to terminate the merger agreement will not be available to a party who is in material breach of the merger agreement.

        In addition, the merger agreement may be terminated by Janus or Henderson, at any time prior to the other party's special meeting or shareholder meeting, as applicable, if a "triggering event" (as
defined on page 163) shall have occurred.

        See the section entitled "The Merger—Description of the Merger Agreement—Termination of the Merger Agreement" beginning on page 162 for a more complete discussion of the circumstances
under which the merger agreement may be terminated.

Expenses and Termination Fees Relating to the Merger (see page 163)

        Generally, each party is required to pay all fees and expenses incurred by it in connection with the merger and the other transactions and agreements contemplated by the merger agreement, except
that each of Henderson and Janus will bear and pay one-half of the costs and expenses (other than the fees and expenses of each party's attorneys and accountants, which shall be borne by the party
incurring such expenses) incurred by Henderson and Janus in connection with (i) the filing, printing and mailing of this Form F-4 and this proxy statement (including SEC filing fees), (ii) the filing,
printing and mailing of the Henderson Shareholder Circular and any Henderson U.K. Prospectus (including filing fees), (iii) the filings of the premerger notification and report forms under the HSR Act
and similar laws of other jurisdictions (including filing fees) and (iv) obtaining the consents of the boards of trustees and shareholders of Janus-advised U.S. mutual funds of new investment advisory
agreements with Janus to take effect at the closing of the merger (including the costs and expenses of the proxy solicitation of the Janus-advised U.S. mutual funds filing, printing and mailing of materials
required to be distributed to shareholders, and legal counsel). However, under the terms of the merger agreement, Janus or Henderson, as the case may be, must pay to the other party a termination fee
equal to $34,000,000 in immediately available funds, upon termination of the merger agreement under the following circumstances:

• a termination of the merger agreement by Janus or Henderson because of: 

• a failure to obtain the requisite approvals of the stockholders or shareholders, as applicable, of the other party at a time when there was an offer or proposal for an alternative
transaction with respect to such party, such offer or proposal has not been withdrawn prior to the other party's special meeting or shareholder meeting, as applicable, and such party
enters into or consummates such alternative transaction within 12 months following the date of such termination; 

• a material breach by the other party at a time when there was an offer or proposal for an alternative transaction with respect to such party , such offer or proposal has not been
withdrawn on or prior to the time of such breach by the other party, and such party enters into or consummates such alternative transaction within 12 months following the date of
such termination;

• failure to consummate the merger by the outside date at a time when there was an offer or proposal for an alternative transaction with respect to such party, such offer or proposal
has not been withdrawn on or prior to the outside date, and such party enters into or consummates an alternative transaction within 12 months from the outside date; or 

• the merger agreement is terminated by Henderson or Janus, as applicable, upon the occurrence of a triggering event (as defined in the section entitled "Description of the Merger
Agreement—Termination of the Merger Agreement" beginning on page 162) at any time prior to the receipt of the Janus required stockholder approval (in the case of a termination by
Henderson) or Henderson required shareholder approval (in the case of a termination by Janus).

        In addition, if either Janus or Henderson terminates the merger agreement in the event the Janus required stockholder approval (in the case of a termination by Henderson) or the Henderson required
shareholder approvals (in the case of a termination by Janus) are not obtained, the party whose stockholders or shareholders, as applicable, failed to provide the requisite approval is required to pay the
other party's expenses up to an amount equal to $10,000,000. The expense reimbursement is credited against any termination fee payable as described above.

        See the section entitled "The Merger—Description of the Merger Agreement—Expenses and Termination Fees" beginning on page 163 for a more complete discussion of the circumstances under
which termination fees and expenses will be required to be paid.

Accounting Treatment (see page 142)

        The merger will be accounted for as a business combination under the United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, which we refer to as U.S. GAAP, (ASC 805, which we refer to as the
Standard). The Standard requires as the first step in the application of acquisition accounting for one of the combining entities to be identified as the acquirer. Henderson will be treated as the acquiring
entity for accounting purposes. In identifying Henderson as the acquiring entity for accounting purposes, Henderson took into account the voting rights of all equity instruments, the intended corporate
governance structure of the combined company, and the size of each of the companies. In assessing the size of each of the companies, Henderson evaluated various metrics, including, but not limited to:
market capitalization, revenue, operating profit, assets and assets under management. No single factor was the sole determinant in the overall conclusion that Henderson is the acquirer for accounting
purposes, rather all factors were considered in arriving at such conclusion.

No Appraisal Rights Available (see page 145)

        Under the DGCL, no appraisal rights are available to Janus stockholders in connection with the merger.

De-listing from LSE and Listing on NYSE of Henderson ordinary shares; De-listing from NYSE and Deregistration of Janus common stock (see page 145)

        Henderson ordinary shares are currently listed on the premium segment of the Official List maintained by the U.K. Listing Authority, being the Financial Conduct Authority, which we refer to as the
FCA, acting in its capacity as the authority for listing in the U.K., which we refer to as the UKLA, and admitted to trading on the main market for listed securities of the LSE. CDIs, each representing a
beneficial interest in one Henderson ordinary share, are quoted and traded on the financial market operated by ASX. Shares of Janus common stock are currently listed and admitted to trading on the
NYSE.

        Following the merger, ordinary shares of Janus Henderson will be listed and will be admitted to trading on the NYSE. Janus Henderson will also maintain its listing on the ASX and the quotation of

its CDIs on the financial market operated by ASX, linked to the primary listing of Janus Henderson ordinary shares on the NYSE. Subject to the Henderson LSE de-listing approval being obtained,
Henderson ordinary shares will be de-listed from the LSE upon closing of the merger.

        When the merger is completed, the shares of Janus common stock currently listed on the NYSE will cease to be quoted on the NYSE and will subsequently be deregistered under the Exchange Act.

Name Change (see page 171)

        It is a condition to the closing of the merger that the Henderson shareholders approve the Henderson name change. As of the effective time, Henderson will file for registration to change the name of
Henderson from "Henderson Group plc" to "Janus Henderson Group plc".

Janus Henderson Amended Memorandum and Articles of Association (see page 218)

        As of the effective time, Janus Henderson will adopt the Janus Henderson Amended Memorandum and the Janus Henderson Amended Articles, the forms of which are attached to this proxy
statement/prospectus as Annex B. Approval of the Janus Henderson Amended Memorandum and the Janus Henderson Amended Articles requires the approval of not less than two thirds of the Henderson
shareholders. It is a condition to the closing of the merger that the Henderson shareholders approve the Janus Henderson Amended Memorandum and the Janus Henderson Amended Articles.

        Subject to approval by the Henderson shareholders at the Henderson shareholder meeting, the par value of Henderson ordinary shares will be redenominated from pounds sterling into U.S. dollars.
The redenomination will be reflected in the updated version of the Henderson Memorandum of Association, which we refer to as the Henderson interim memorandum, that will replace the Henderson
Memorandum of Association effective upon the date of the Henderson shareholder meeting.

        The Janus Henderson Amended Memorandum will replace the Henderson interim memorandum and will reflect the (i) changing of the company name from Henderson Group plc to Janus Henderson
Group plc and (ii) increasing of the authorized share capital of the company from £274,363,847.00 to $720,000,000.

        The Janus Henderson Amended Articles will replace the Henderson Articles of Association and will have the effect of, among other things, (i) removing preemptive rights, (ii) removing the
requirement to seek shareholder approval to issue shares, (iii) establishing that the number of directors of Janus Henderson shall be not less than three nor more than 12 (to reflect the agreed governance
arrangements in the merger agreement), (iv) increasing the quorum required for a general shareholder meeting from two holders to holders representing at least one-third in nominal value of the issued
shares, (v) requiring directors of Janus Henderson to be re-elected at each annual shareholder meeting and eliminating the right of the chairman to cast a tie-breaking vote, (vi) establishing that the record
date for general shareholder meetings must be set no less than 10 days and no more than 60 days before the date fixed for the meeting, (vii) increasing the cap on the remuneration of the non-executive
directors of Janus Henderson to $3,000,000 per annum (or any higher amount approved by Janus Henderson shareholders), (viii) adopting the disclosure requirements for beneficial ownership of the
company's ordinary shares set forth in Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act, (ix) granting the Janus Henderson board the authority to impose certain restrictions on shareholders in the event a disclosure
notice pertaining to information on beneficial ownership is not complied with, (x) requiring shareholders to provide certain information and comply with certain timing requirements when exercising their
right under Jersey companies law to require the Janus Henderson board to call a shareholder meeting, (xi) removing certain provisions that reflect the UK Companies Act 2006 (which are not considered
to be appropriate following closing of the merger as Janus Henderson will not be listed on the LSE), (xii) removing the ability to issue bearer shares, (xiii) permitting the Janus Henderson board to transfer
amounts to the share premium account from any other account (other

Henderson Foreign Private Issuer Status (see page 70)

        Under U.S. securities laws, classification as a "foreign private issuer" depends on two tests—one based on the percentage of shares of the issuer held by U.S. residents and the other on the nature and
extent of the issuer's business contacts with the United States, which we refer to as the U.S. A company incorporated under the laws of a foreign country will not qualify as a foreign private issuer if it
fails both of the tests in the definition as of the last business day of its most recently completed second fiscal quarter.

        The shareholder test will be met if 50% or less of the outstanding voting securities of a non-U.S. domiciled company are held by U.S. residents. If more than 50% of a non-U.S. company's voting
securities are held by U.S. residents, the determination of foreign private issuer status will depend upon the business contacts the issuer has with the U.S. The business contacts test will not be met if any
one of the following are true with respect to a non-U.S. domiciled company: (i) the majority of its executive officers or directors are U.S. citizens or residents; (ii) 50% or more of its assets are located in
the U.S.; or (iii) its business is administered principally in the U.S. If an issuer determines that it no longer meets the definition of a foreign private issuer, it must transition to domestic reporting status
and it becomes subject to the reporting requirements for a domestic company beginning on the first day of its next fiscal year.

        Henderson currently qualifies as a foreign private issuer, or FPI, under the foregoing rules. As a result, Henderson qualifies for certain accommodations under the U.S. securities laws, including
(i) being able to report its financial results in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards, which we refer to as IFRS, as adopted by the International Accounting Standards Board,
which we refer to as the IASB, (ii) being subject to reduced disclosure requirements with respect to quarterly reporting and executive compensation, (iii) not being subject to the proxy rules under the
Exchange Act, Section 16 under the Exchange Act or Regulation FD, and (iv) being able to follow certain home country rules in lieu of domestic company requirements under NYSE rules.

        Janus and Henderson currently anticipate that Janus Henderson may not satisfy the foreign private issuer test in the future. Following such time Janus Henderson will need to comply with all
domestic company reporting requirements. However, even though Janus Henderson may avail itself of the accommodations for foreign private issuers, it currently intends to report its financial results in
accordance with U.S. GAAP, to file annual reports on Form 10-K, to file interim reports on Form 10-Q upon closing of the merger, to begin filing current reports on Form 8-K upon closing of the merger
and to generally follow the NYSE corporate governance rules applicable to domestic companies. Until it becomes obligated to report as a domestic company Janus Henderson intends to avail itself of the
exemptions from application of the proxy rules under the Exchange Act, Section 16 of the Exchange Act, Regulation FD and certain other rules applicable to domestic companies.

Pre-Closing Dividends; Post-Closing Dividend Policy (see page 143)

        Prior to the closing of the merger, Henderson intends to declare and pay a final cash dividend for the financial year ended December 31, 2016 of 7.30 pence per Henderson ordinary share. The
payment of the dividend is subject to approval by Henderson shareholders at the shareholder meeting to be held on April 26, 2017. If approved by Henderson shareholders, such dividend will be paid on
or around May 19, 2017.

        Janus has declared and paid to Janus stockholders quarterly cash dividends of US$0.11 and US$0.11 per share of Janus common stock for the third and fourth quarter of 2016 respectively.

Table of Contents

        In addition, each of the Henderson and Janus boards of directors also currently intends to declare and pay to Henderson shareholders or Janus stockholders, as applicable, prior to closing of the
merger, an interim dividend in respect of the first quarter of the financial year ending December 31, 2017. The Henderson and Janus boards will determine the amount of any such first quarter 2017
dividend following the end of the first quarter of 2017. Janus Henderson is expected to continue to follow a progressive dividend policy, increasing the dividend broadly in-line with growth in adjusted
operating income over the medium term and with a pay-out ratio consistent with Henderson's past practice. Following the closing of the merger, it is intended that Janus Henderson will declare and pay
quarterly dividends beginning in the second quarter of 2017.

        However, the amount of dividends, if any, that are declared or paid to Janus Henderson shareholders in periods after closing of the merger cannot yet be determined and will depend on a number of
factors. The Janus Henderson board will have sole discretion to determine whether any interim dividends will be declared, the amount of any such interim dividend, the amount of any final dividend
recommended to its shareholders (which may be paid subject to the approval of Janus Henderson shareholders by way of an ordinary resolution) and when any dividend will be paid. We expect that such
determination would be based on a number of considerations, including, but not limited to, Janus Henderson's results of operations, capital management plans, the market price of Janus Henderson
ordinary shares, the combined company's access to capital markets, as well as legal requirements, industry practice and other factors deemed relevant by the Janus Henderson board. There can be no
assurance that Janus Henderson shareholders will receive or be entitled to dividends commensurate with the historical dividends of Janus or Henderson. For a further discussion of the risks related to the
payment of dividends after the merger, see "Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Merger" beginning on page 71.

Litigation Relating to the Transaction (see page 145)

        The merger agreement requires each party to promptly advise the other party of any litigation brought by any stockholder or shareholder of that party, as applicable, against such party or any of their
respective directors relating to the merger agreement or any of the transactions contemplated thereby, and will keep the other party reasonably informed regarding any such litigation. Each party will give
the other party the opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any such litigation by any stockholders or shareholders, and no such settlement will be agreed to without the other party's prior
written consent, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. For a description of any current litigation related to the merger agreement and the merger, see "The Merger—Litigation
Relating to the Transaction" beginning on page 145 of this proxy statement/prospectus.

Comparison of Rights of Holders Janus Henderson Ordinary Shares and Shares of Janus Common Stock (see page 274)

        Upon closing of the merger, Janus stockholders will become shareholders of Janus Henderson and their rights will be governed by the laws of Jersey, Channel Islands, and the governing documents
of Janus Henderson in effect at the effective time, including the Janus Henderson Amended Memorandum and the Janus Henderson Amended Articles. Janus stockholders will have different rights once
they become Janus Henderson shareholders due to differences between the governing documents of each of the entities. These differences are described in detail in the section entitled "Comparison of
Rights of Holders Janus Henderson Ordinary Shares and Shares of Janus Common Stock" beginning on page 274.

Table of Contents

Jersey Company Considerations (see page 218)

        Henderson's corporate affairs are governed by its existing Memorandum of Association, which we refer to as the Henderson Memorandum of Association, and Articles of Association, which we refer
to as the Henderson Articles of Association, and by the laws of Jersey, Channel Islands. Upon consummation of the merger, the rights of Janus Henderson shareholders will be governed by the Janus
Henderson Amended Memorandum and the Janus Henderson Amended Articles and the laws of Jersey, Channel Islands. The provisions of the Jersey Companies Law, which applies to Henderson and
will apply to Janus Henderson, differ in certain material respects from laws generally applicable to U.S. companies incorporated in the State of Delaware, including Janus, and their stockholders. For
additional information, see the section entitled "Comparison of Rights of Holders Janus Henderson Ordinary Shares and Shares of Janus Common Stock" beginning on page 274.

The Special Meeting

The Janus Special Meeting (see page 82)

        Date, Time and Place:    The Janus special meeting will be held at JW Marriott Hotel, 150 Clayton Lane, Denver, Colorado, on April 25, 2017, at 10:00 a.m., Mountain Daylight Time.

        Purpose: At the Janus special meeting, Janus stockholders will be asked:

• to consider and vote on the Janus merger proposal; 

• to consider and vote on the Janus compensation proposal; 

• to consider and vote for each of the amendment proposals; and 

• to consider and vote on the Janus adjournment proposal.

Record Date; Voting Rights

        Only holders of record of shares of Janus common stock at the close of business on March 15, 2017, the record date for voting at the Janus special meeting, which we refer to as the record date, are
entitled to vote at the Janus special meeting. On March 15, 2017, 184,297,796 shares of Janus common stock were issued and outstanding.

        You may cast one vote for each share of Janus common stock that you owned as of the close of business on the record date.

        Votes Required.    The votes required for each proposal are as follows:

        Proposal 1: Janus merger proposal.    The votes cast "FOR" this proposal must represent a majority of all outstanding shares of Janus common stock entitled to vote.

        Proposal 2: Janus compensation proposal.    The affirmative vote of a majority of Janus stockholders present, in person or represented by proxy, and entitled to vote at the Janus special meeting is
required to approve the Janus compensation proposal.

        Proposals 3 through 7: Amendment proposals.    The affirmative vote of a majority of Janus stockholders present, in person or represented by proxy, and entitled to vote at the Janus special meeting
is required to approve each of the amendment proposals.

        Proposal 8: Janus adjournment proposal.    The affirmative vote of a majority of Janus stockholders present, in person or represented by proxy, and entitled to vote at the Janus special meeting is
required to approve the Janus adjournment proposal.

Table of Contents

        Under the NYSE rules, if you hold your shares of Janus common stock in "street name," your broker, nominee or intermediary may not vote your shares without instructions from you on non-routine
matters. None of the proposals to be voted on at the Janus special meeting are routine matters. Therefore, without your voting instructions, your broker or other nominee may not vote your shares on any
of Proposals 1 through 7 at the Janus special meeting.

        Broker non-votes will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" Proposal 1 and will have no effect on Proposals 2 through 7 (assuming a quorum is present). However, because none of the
proposals to be voted on at the Janus special meeting are routine matters for which brokers may have discretionary authority to vote, Janus does not expect any broker non-votes at the Janus special
meeting.

        As of the close of business on March 15, 2017, 2.23% of the outstanding shares of Janus common stock were held by Janus directors and executive officers and their affiliates. We currently expect
that Janus directors and executive officers will vote their shares of Janus common stock in favor of the above-listed proposals, although none of them has entered into any agreements obligating him or
her to do so. As of March 15, 19.74% of the outstanding shares of Janus common stock were held by Dai-ichi. Dai-ichi has entered into a voting agreement with Janus and Henderson obligating it to vote
all of its shares of Janus common stock "FOR" the Janus merger proposal.

        Closing of the merger is conditioned on approval by Janus stockholders of the Janus merger proposal.

Summary Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information 

        The following table shows summary unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information, which Janus and Henderson refer to as the summary pro forma financial information, about the
financial condition and results of operations of the combined company, after giving effect to the merger, which were prepared using the acquisition method of accounting with Henderson designated as the
accounting acquirer of Janus. See "The Merger—Accounting Treatment" beginning on page 142 and see "Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information" beginning on page 259 for
more information.

        The summary pro forma financial information is presented for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the unaudited operating results or financial position that would have
occurred if the merger had been completed as of the beginning of the period presented, nor is it necessarily indicative of the future operating results or financial position of the combined company. In
addition, the summary pro forma financial information includes adjustments which are preliminary and may be revised. There can be no assurance that such revisions will not result in material changes to
the information presented. The summary pro forma financial information does not include estimated cost or growth synergies, adjustments related to restructuring or integration activities, future
acquisitions or disposals not yet known or probable, including those that may be required by regulatory or governmental authorities in connection with the merger, or impacts of merger related change in
control provisions that are currently not factually supportable and/or probable of occurring.

COMPARATIVE HISTORICAL AND PRO FORMA PER SHARE INFORMATION 

        The following table summarizes unaudited per share information for Henderson and Janus on a historical basis and unaudited pro forma combined basis for Henderson and Janus reflecting the merger and
related transactions and adjustments. The following information should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes of Henderson and Janus, and the
unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements beginning on page 259. The unaudited pro forma information is presented for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of what
the operating results or financial position would have been if the merger had been completed as of the beginning of the period presented, nor is it necessarily indicative of the future operating results or financial
position of the combined companies. The historical earnings per share, dividends per share and book value per share of Henderson and Janus shown in the table below are derived from their audited consolidated
financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2016.

        The historical book value per share is computed by dividing total shareholders' equity by the number of shares outstanding at the end of the period, excluding any shares held in treasury. The unaudited pro
forma combined earnings per share from continuing operations is computed by dividing the pro forma earnings from continuing operations available to holders of shares by the pro forma weighted-average
number of shares outstanding of Henderson plus the actual number of shares outstanding for Janus multiplied by the exchange ratio. The unaudited pro forma combined book value per share is computed by
dividing total pro forma shareholders' equity by the pro forma number of shares outstanding at the end of the period. Pro forma per share information is presented as if the merger and related transactions and
adjustments occurred as of the date of the historical financial statements.

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

        This proxy statement/prospectus contains "forward-looking statements." In this context, forward-looking statements often address expected future business and financial performance and financial
condition, and often contain words such as "expect," "anticipate," "intend," "plan," "believe," "seek," "see," "will," "would," "target," similar expressions, and variations or negatives of these words. Forward-
looking statements by their nature address matters that are, to different degrees, uncertain, such as statements about consummation of the merger and the anticipated benefits thereof. These and other forward-
looking statements, including the failure to consummate the merger or to make or take any filing or other action required to consummate such transaction in a timely matter or at all, are not guarantees of future
results and are subject to numerous risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements. Important risk factors that
may cause such a difference include, but are not limited to, (i) the closing of the merger on anticipated terms and timing, including obtaining required shareholder approvals, anticipated tax treatment, unforeseen
liabilities, failure to obtain board and shareholder approval from the Janus U.S. mutual funds for new investment advisory agreements, failure to obtain regulatory approvals and other conditions to the closing of
the merger, (ii) risks related to the operation of the combined business, including macro-economic conditions, investment performance, operation of an international business, exchange rate fluctuations, failure
or breach of security systems, indebtedness, continued availability of capital and financing and rating agency actions, managing expenses, operational losses, future prospects and business and management
strategies for the management, expansion and growth of the combined company's operations, (iii) the ability of Janus and Henderson to integrate their businesses successfully and to achieve anticipated
synergies, (iv) potential litigation relating to the merger, (v) the risk that disruptions from the merger will harm Janus's or Henderson's business, including current plans and operations, (vi) the ability of Janus or
Henderson to retain and hire key personnel, (vii) potential adverse reactions or changes to business relationships resulting from the announcement or closing of the merger, (viii) termination of existing
investment advisory agreements, (ix) political, legislative, regulatory and economic developments, (x) potential business uncertainty, including changes to existing business relationships, during the period
before closing of the merger that could affect Janus's and/or Henderson's financial performance, (xi) certain restrictions during the period before closing of the merger that may impact Janus's or Henderson's
ability to pursue certain business opportunities or strategic transactions and (xii) unpredictability and severity of catastrophic events, including, but not limited to, acts of terrorism or outbreak of war or
hostilities, as well as management's response to any of the aforementioned factors. Consequences of material differences in results as compared with those anticipated in the forward-looking statements could
include, among other things, business disruption, operational problems, financial loss, legal liability to third parties and similar risks, any of which could have a material adverse effect on Janus's or Henderson's
assets under management, consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. The information contained herein speaks as of the date hereof. Neither Janus nor Henderson assumes any obligation
to publicly provide revisions or updates to any forward looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, should circumstances change, except as otherwise required
by securities and other applicable laws. Because forward-looking statements are subject to assumptions and uncertainties, actual results or future events could differ, possibly materially, from those that Janus or
Henderson anticipated in its forward-looking statements and future results could differ materially from historical performance. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not
limited to, those included under "Risk Factors" starting on page 50.

RISK FACTORS 

Risks Related to the Combined Business of Janus and Henderson 

Janus's and Henderson's results of operations and financial condition are, and the combined company's results of operations and financial condition will be, primarily dependent on the value,
composition and relative investment performance of their collective investment products.

        Any decrease in the value, relative investment performance or amount of assets under management will cause a decline in revenue and negatively impact operating results and the financial condition of
Janus Henderson. Assets under management may decline for various reasons, many of which will not be under the control of Janus Henderson.

        Factors that could cause assets under management and revenue to decline include the following:

• Declines in equity markets.  Janus's assets under management are concentrated in the U.S. equity markets (approximately 66% of Janus's assets under management at December 31, 2016) and, to
a lesser extent, in the international equity markets (approximately 24% of Janus's assets under management at December 31, 2016). Henderson's assets under management (excluding global
portfolios) are concentrated in the European equity markets (approximately 34% of Henderson's assets under management at December 31, 2016) and to a lesser degree in the U.S.
(approximately 5% of Henderson's assets under management at December 31, 2016). Equity securities may decline in value as a result of many factors, including an issuer's actual or perceived
financial condition and growth prospects, investor perception of an industry or sector, changes in currency exchange rates, changes in regulations and geopolitical and economic risks. While
Janus Henderson's assets under management will, following the merger, be more geographically diverse than the assets under management of either Janus or Henderson on a stand-alone basis,
declines in the equity markets as a whole, or in the market segments in which Janus or Henderson investment products are concentrated, may cause assets under management of the combined
company to decrease. 

• Declines in fixed income markets.  Henderson has significant assets under management in U.K., European and Australian fixed income securities (approximately 26% of Henderson assets under
management at December 31, 2016). Janus has significant assets under management in U.S. fixed income securities (approximately 24% of Janus assets under management at December 31,
2016). Fixed income investment products may decline in value as a result of many factors, principally increases in interest rates, changes in currency exchange rates, changes in relative yield
among instruments with different maturities, geopolitical and general economic risks, available liquidity in the markets in which a security trades, an issuer's actual or perceived creditworthiness,
or an issuer's ability to meet its obligations. 

• Relative investment performance.  Janus's and Henderson's investment products are often judged on their performance as compared to benchmark indices or peer groups, as well as being judged
on an absolute return basis. Any period of underperformance of investment products relative to peers may result in the loss of existing assets and affect the ability of Janus and Henderson to
attract new assets. In addition, at December 31, 2016 approximately 34% of Janus's assets under management and 29% of Henderson's assets under management were subject to performance
fees. Performance fees are based either on each product's investment performance as compared to an established benchmark index or on its positive absolute return over a specified period of
time. If Janus or Henderson investment products subject to performance fees underperform their respective benchmark index or produce a negative absolute return for a defined period, the
revenue and thus results of operations and financial condition of Janus or Henderson, respectively, may be adversely affected. In addition, performance fees subject Janus's and Henderson's
revenue to increased volatility. Further, certain of Janus's U.S. mutual fund

contracts, representing approximately 20% of Janus's assets under management at December 31, 2016 (which is a subset of the 34% figure cited above), are subject to fulcrum performance fees
and as a result, performance fees earned can be negative as well as positive.

Janus Henderson may fail to successfully implement a strategy for the combined business, which could negatively impact the combined company's assets under management, results of operations and
financial condition.

        Through the combination of Janus and Henderson, the combined company intends to establish an independent, active asset manager with a globally relevant brand, footprint, investment proposition and
client service. No assurance can be given that the combined company will successfully achieve this objective or that this objective will lead to increased revenue and net income, or to the creation of shareholder
value. The failure to successfully implement a strategy for Janus Henderson could adversely affect the combined company's assets under management, results of operations and financial condition.

Janus Henderson's revenue and profitability would be adversely affected by any reduction in assets under management as a result of redemptions and other withdrawals from the funds and accounts
managed.

        Redemptions or withdrawals may be caused by investors (in response to adverse market conditions or pursuit of other investment opportunities or as a consequence of damage to Janus Henderson's
reputation, among other factors) reducing their investments in funds and accounts in general or in the market segments on which Janus Henderson focuses; investors taking profits from their investments; poor
investment performance of the funds and accounts managed by Janus Henderson; and portfolio risk characteristics, which could cause investors to move assets to other investment managers. Poor performance
relative to competing products provided by other investment management firms tends to result in decreased sales, increased redemptions of fund shares and the loss of or reduction in assets under management
in private institutional accounts, with corresponding decreases in revenue. Failure of the Janus Henderson funds and accounts to perform well could, therefore, have a material adverse effect on the results of
operations and financial condition of the combined company.

Janus Henderson will operate in a highly competitive environment and revenue from fees may be reduced.

        The investment management business is highly competitive and has relatively low barriers to entry. In addition, established firms as well as new entrants to the asset management industry have, in recent
years, expanded their application of technology, including through the use of robo-advisers, in providing services to clients. Janus's and Henderson's traditional fee structures may be subject to downward
pressure due to these factors. Moreover, in recent years there has been a trend toward lower fees in the investment management industry, as evidenced by the movement toward passively managed mutual funds
and the growth of lower cost funds such as exchange traded, smart beta and quant funds. Fees for actively managed investment products may come under increased pressure if such products fail to outperform
returns for comparable passively managed products or as a consequence of regulatory intervention. Fee reductions on existing or future new business as well as changes in regulations pertaining to fees could
adversely affect the combined company's results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, Janus Henderson will compete with investment management companies on the basis of investment
performance, fees, diversity of products, distribution capability, reputation and the ability to develop new investment products to meet the changing needs of investors. Failure to adequately compete could
adversely affect the combined company's assets under management, results of operations and financial condition.

The combined company's results will be dependent on its ability to attract and retain key personnel.

        The investment management business is highly dependent on the ability to attract, retain and motivate highly skilled and often highly specialized technical, executive, sales and investment management
personnel. The market for qualified investment and sales professionals is extremely competitive and is characterized by the frequent movement of portfolio managers, analysts and salespeople among different
firms. Any changes to management structure, shifts in corporate culture, changes to corporate governance authority, or adjustments or reductions to compensation, any of which may occur as a result of the
merger, could affect the combined company's ability to retain key personnel and could result in legal claims. If Janus Henderson is unable to retain key personnel, particularly those personnel responsible for
managing client funds that account for a high proportion of Janus Henderson's revenue, it could adversely affect the combined company's assets under management, results of operations and financial condition.

The combined company will be dependent upon third-party distribution channels to access clients and potential clients.

        Janus Henderson's ability to market and distribute its investment products is significantly dependent on access to the client base of insurance companies, defined contribution plan administrators, securities
firms, broker-dealers, financial advisors, multi-managers, banks and other distribution channels. These companies generally offer their clients various investment products in addition to, and competitive with,
products offered by Janus and Henderson. Further, Janus's separate account business uses referrals from financial planners, investment advisers and other professionals. Janus and Henderson cannot be certain
that the combined company will continue to have access to these third-party distribution channels or have an opportunity to offer some or all of its investment products through these channels. In addition,
Janus's and Henderson's existing relationships with third-party distributors and access to new distributors could be adversely affected by recent consolidation within the financial services industry. Consolidation
may result in increased distribution costs, a reduction in the number of third parties distributing Janus's and Henderson's investment products or increased competition to access third-party distribution channels.
The inability to access clients through third-party distribution channels could adversely affect the combined company's business prospects, assets under management, results of operations and financial
condition.

Illiquidity in certain securities in which Janus Henderson invests may negatively impact the financial condition of the combined company's investment products, and may impede the ability of Janus
Henderson funds to effect redemptions.

        Janus Henderson is exposed to the risk that some of its funds or mandates invest in certain securities or other assets in which the secondary trading market is illiquid or in which there is no secondary
trading market at all. Illiquidity may occur with respect to the securities of a specific issuer, of issuers within a specific industry or sector, of issuers within a specific geographic region or regions, with respect to
an asset class or an investment type, or with respect to the market as a whole. An illiquid trading market may increase market volatility and may make it impossible for funds or mandates to sell investments
promptly without suffering a loss. This may have an adverse impact on the investment performance of such funds and mandates and on the assets under management, revenues and results of operations of Janus
Henderson.

        Investors in certain funds managed by Janus Henderson have contractual terms that provide for a shorter notice period than the time period during which these funds may be able to sell underlying
investments within the fund. This liquidity mismatch may be exacerbated during periods of market illiquidity and, in circumstances in which there are high levels of investor redemptions, it may be necessary
for Janus Henderson to impose "gates" on redeeming investors, suspend redemptions or

create "sidepockets". Such actions may increase the risk of legal claims by investors, regulatory investigation and/or fines and adversely affect the reputation of Janus Henderson.

INTECH's investment process is highly dependent on key employees and proprietary software.

        INTECH's investment process (which relates to approximately 24% of Janus's assets under management as of December 31, 2016) is based on complex and proprietary mathematical models that seek to
outperform various indices by capitalizing on the volatility in stock price movements while controlling trading costs and overall risk relative to the index. The maintenance of such models for current products
and the development of new products is highly dependent on certain key INTECH employees. If INTECH is unable to retain key personnel or properly transition key personnel responsibilities to others, if the
mathematical investment strategies developed by INTECH fail to produce the intended results, or if errors occur in the development or implementation of INTECH's mathematical models, INTECH may not be
able to maintain its historical level of investment performance, which could adversely affect Janus Henderson's assets under management, results of operations and financial condition and could also result in
legal claims against Janus Henderson or regulatory investigations in respect of its operations.

Changes in the value of seeded investment products could affect Janus Henderson's non-operating income or earnings and could increase the volatility of its earnings.

        Janus and Henderson periodically add new investment strategies to their respective investment product offerings and provide the initial cash investment or "seeding" to facilitate the launch of the product.
Janus or Henderson may also provide substantial supplemental capital to an existing investment product in order to accelerate the growth of a strategy and attract outside investment in the product. A decline in
the valuation of these seeded investments could negatively impact Janus Henderson's earnings and financial condition.

The global scope of Janus Henderson's business will subject the combined company to exchange rate risk that may adversely impact the combined company's revenue and income.

        Henderson generates, and, following consummation of the merger, Janus Henderson will generate, a substantial portion of its revenue in pounds sterling, euro and Australian dollars. As a result, Janus
Henderson will be subject to foreign currency exchange risk relative to the U.S. dollar, Janus Henderson's financial reporting currency, through its non-U.S. operations. Fluctuations in the exchange rates to the
U.S. dollar may affect Janus Henderson's financial results from one period to the next. In addition, the combined company will have risk associated with the foreign exchange revaluation of balances held by
certain subsidiaries for which the local currency is different than the combined company's functional currency.

The global scope of Janus Henderson's business will subject the combined company to market-specific political, economic and other risks that may adversely impact the combined company's revenue and
income generated overseas.

        The combined company's global portfolios and revenue derived from managing these portfolios will be subject to significant risks of loss as a result of political, economic, and diplomatic developments,
currency fluctuations, social instability, changes in governmental policies, expropriation, nationalization, asset confiscation and changes in legislation related to non-U.S. ownership. Political events in any
country or region could result in significant declines in equity and/or fixed income securities exposed to such a country or region and, to the extent that Janus Henderson has a concentration of assets under
management in such a country or region could result in a material adverse effect on the assets under management, results of operations and financial condition of the combined company. In addition,
international trading markets, particularly in some emerging market

countries, are often smaller, less liquid, less regulated and significantly more volatile than those in the U.S. As the combined company's business grows in non-U.S. markets, any ongoing and future business,
political, economic or social unrest affecting these markets may have a negative impact on the long-term investment climate in these and other areas and, as a result, on Janus Henderson's assets under
management and the corresponding revenue and income generated from these markets may be negatively affected.

Janus Henderson will operate in an industry that is highly regulated in many countries, and any enforcement action or adverse changes in the laws or regulations governing its business could adversely
affect its results of operations or financial condition.

        Like all investment management firms, Janus Henderson's activities will be highly regulated in almost all countries in which it conducts business. The combined company will be subject to regulation in the
U.S., the U.K., Europe, Australia and in other international markets, including regulation by the SEC, FINRA, the Commodities Future Trading Commission, which we refer to as the CFTC, the National
Futures Association, which we refer to as the NFA, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission in Australia, and the FCA in the U.K. Subsidiaries operating in the European Union, which we refer to
as the EU, are subject to various EU Directives, which are implemented by member state national legislation. Janus Henderson's operations elsewhere in the world are regulated by similar regulatory
organizations. See the section entitled "Business of Henderson—Regulation" in this proxy statement/prospectus and the section entitled "Business—Regulation," in Janus's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
fiscal year end December 31, 2016, incorporated by reference herein.

        Laws and regulations applied at the national, state or provincial and local level generally grant governmental agencies and industry self-regulatory authorities broad administrative discretion over Janus
Henderson's activities, including the power to limit or restrict its business activities, conduct examinations, risk assessments, investigations and capital adequacy reviews, and impose remedial programs to
address perceived deficiencies. As a result of regulatory oversight, Janus Henderson could face requirements which negatively impact the way in which it conducts business, increase compliance costs, impose
additional capital requirements and/or involve enforcement actions which could lead to sanctions up to and including the revocation of licenses to operate certain businesses, the suspension or expulsion from a
particular jurisdiction or market of any of its business organizations or key personnel, or the imposition of fines and censures on it or its employees. Judgments or findings of wrongdoing by regulatory or
governmental authorities, or in private litigation against Janus Henderson, could affect its reputation, increase its costs of doing business and/or negatively impact revenues, any of which could have an adverse
impact on Janus Henderson's results of operations or financial condition.

        Janus Henderson may also be adversely affected as a result of new or revised legislation or regulations, or by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and regulations. The costs and
burdens of compliance with these and other current and future reporting and operational requirements and regulations have increased significantly and may continue to increase the cost of offering mutual funds
and other investment products, which could adversely affect Janus Henderson's assets under management, results of operations and financial condition.

        The regulatory environment in which Janus Henderson operates frequently changes and has seen a significant increase in regulation in recent years. Various changes in laws and regulations have been
enacted or otherwise developed in multiple jurisdictions globally in response to the crisis in the financial markets that began in 2007. Various other proposals remain under consideration by legislators,
regulators, and other government officials and other public policy commentators. Certain enacted provisions and certain other proposals are potentially far reaching and, depending upon their implementation,
could have a material impact on Janus Henderson's business. While certain of these provisions appear to address perceived problems in the banking sector, some will or may be applied more broadly and affect
other financial services companies, including investment managers. Janus

Henderson may be adversely affected as a result of the new or revised legislation or regulations or by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and regulations.

Proposed Changes in the U.S. Regulatory Framework

        In the U.S., the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which we refer to as the Dodd-Frank Act, was signed into law in July 2010. Certain provisions have required Janus and/or
Henderson, and other provisions will or may require Janus Henderson, to change or impose new limitations on the manner in which it conducts business; they also have increased regulatory burdens and related
compliance costs, and will or may continue to do so. Moreover, the Dodd-Frank Act mandated many regulatory studies, some of which pertain directly to the investment management industry, which could lead
to additional legislation or regulation.

        In December 2014, the Chairperson of the SEC announced a comprehensive agenda for regulatory change governing the U.S. asset management industry and directed SEC staff to develop a five-part series
of new regulations addressing the topics of enhanced portfolio reporting, liquidity risk management, leverage and use of derivatives, adviser wind up and stress testing for funds and advisers. When finalized,
these new industry rules can be expected to add additional reporting and compliance costs and may affect the development of new products. Janus Henderson believes these proposals could increase operational
and compliance costs.

        The U.S. Department of Labor has adopted regulations that are currently scheduled to go into effect on April 10, 2017, that will treat as fiduciaries any person who provides investment advice or
recommendations to employee benefit plans, plan fiduciaries, plan participants, plan beneficiaries, Individual Retirement Accounts, which we refer to as IRAs, or IRA owners. The proposal will have wide-
ranging consequences for Janus Henderson and its U.S. distribution partners and product line. Under the new rules, firms and individuals who recommend financial products to retirement investors would be
required to act in the best interest of the investor and, to receive variable compensation, would be required to enter into a contract with clients and produce complex disclosure documents intended to highlight
financial conflicts of interest that may arise from the compensation the financial adviser receives from firms like Janus Henderson.

        With the commencement of President Trump's new administration, the regulatory moratorium imposed by President Trump on January 20, 2017, the possibility for the repeal of aspects of the Dodd-Frank
Act, delay of the U.S. Department of Labor's fiduciary rule and other deregulation, and other political uncertainty in the U.S. following the 2016 Presidential and Congressional elections, the regulatory
environment in the U.S. may experience increased volatility. At this time, it is not possible to determine the impact such reforms would have on Janus Henderson's business.

Proposed Changes in the European Union Regulatory Framework

        The European Union has promulgated or is considering various new or revised directives pertaining to financial services, including investment managers. Such directives are progressing at various stages,
and have been, are being, or will or would be implemented by national legislation in member states. The Alternative Investment Fund Manager Directive, which we refer to as AIFMD, is an example of such
regulation, as is the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II, which we refer to as MiFID II, which seeks to promote a single market for wholesale and retail transactions in financial instruments. MiFID II
addresses the conduct of business rules for intermediaries providing investment services and the effective, efficient and safe operation of financial markets. Key elements of MiFID II in relation to investor
protection measures include changes to the extent to which retrocessions may be paid and the use of trading commissions to fund research.

by non-EU managers. Various regulators promulgated or are considering other new disclosure or suitability requirements pertaining to the distribution of investment funds and other investment products,
including enhanced standards and requirements pertaining to disclosures made to retail investors at the point of sale. As with the Dodd-Frank Act, Janus and Henderson do not believe implementation of these
directives will fundamentally change the asset management industry or cause Janus Henderson to reconsider its fundamental strategy, but certain provisions have required Janus and/or Henderson, and other
provisions will or may require Janus Henderson, to change or impose new limitations on the manner in which it conducts business; they also have increased regulatory burdens and compliance costs, and will or
may continue to do so. Certain provisions may have unintended adverse consequences on the liquidity or structure of the financial markets. Similar developments are being implemented or considered in other
jurisdictions where Janus Henderson does business; such developments could have similar effects.

        The full impact of potential legal and regulatory changes or possible enforcement proceedings on the Janus Henderson business cannot be predicted. Such changes have imposed, and may continue to
impose, new compliance costs and/or capital requirements, including costs related to information technology systems, or may impact Janus Henderson in other ways that could have an adverse impact on Janus
Henderson's results of operations or financial condition. Similarly, regulatory enforcement actions which impose significant penalties or compliance obligations or which result in significant reputational harm
could have similar adverse effects on Janus Henderson. Moreover, certain legal or regulatory changes could require Janus Henderson to modify its strategies, businesses or operations, and it may incur other new
constraints or costs, including the investment of significant management time and resources in order to satisfy new regulatory requirements or to compete in a changed business environment. In recent years,
certain regulatory developments have also added pressures regarding fee levels. In addition, the recent presidential election in the U.S., and upcoming elections in Europe, have created additional uncertainty as
to the future regulatory environment and how it may impact Janus Henderson.

        To the extent that existing or future regulations affecting the sale of Janus Henderson products and services or investment strategies cause or contribute to reduced sales or increased redemptions of its
products, impair the investment performance of its products or impact its product mix, Janus Henderson's aggregate assets under management, results of operations or financial condition might be adversely
affected.

Janus Henderson may have increased regulatory capital requirements imposed on it by regulators which could negatively impact the combined company's ability to return capital or pay dividends to
shareholders or its results of operations and financial condition.

        Janus's and Henderson's regulators typically have broad discretion to impose increased regulatory capital requirements on the regulated entities in their respective groups. It is possible that the regulatory
capital requirements that the Janus and Henderson businesses are subject to currently may be subject to change and could increase as a result on the merger (among other factors). The imposition of increased
regulatory capital requirements could negatively impact the combined company's ability to return capital or pay dividends to shareholders, restrict its ability to make future acquisitions or, should the company
be required to raise additional capital, its results of operations and financial condition.

The U.K. electorate voted in favor of a U.K. exit from the EU in a referendum, which could adversely impact Janus Henderson's business, results of operations and financial condition.

        The U.K. Government held an "in-or-out" referendum in June 2016 on the U.K.'s membership in the EU. The U.K. electorate voted in favor of a U.K. exit from the EU, which we refer to as Brexit. It is
expected that a process of negotiation will commence in the first part of 2017 to determine the terms

of the U.K.'s exit from the EU. At present, it is not possible to predict the outcome of those negotiations or the future relationship the U.K. will have with the EU. However, Janus Henderson will be
headquartered and tax resident in the U.K. and conduct business in Europe in part through its U.K. subsidiaries, although it also has European subsidiaries. Depending on the terms of Brexit, Janus Henderson
could face new regulatory costs and challenges. For instance, U.K. asset management firms could lose their current level of access to the single EU market and the U.K. may no longer benefit from global trade
deals negotiated by the EU on behalf of its members. A decline in trade could affect the attractiveness of the U.K. as a global investment center and, as a result, could have a detrimental impact on U.K. growth.
Although Janus Henderson will have an international customer base, it could be adversely affected by reduced growth and greater volatility in the pound sterling and the U.K. economy. There could also be
changes to U.K. immigration policy as a result of Brexit, which could lead to operations gravitating towards EU member states. Taken together, these factors could lead to a decline in London's role as a global
financial center, particularly if financial institutions move their operations to the EU as a result of the EU financial services passport not having been maintained. Any of the foregoing factors could have a
material adverse effect on Janus Henderson's business, results of operations or financial condition.

Harm to Janus Henderson's reputation or poor investment performance of Janus Henderson's products could reduce the level of assets under management or affect sales, potentially negatively impacting
the combined company's revenue and net income. Janus Henderson's reputation is critical to the success of the combined company.

        Janus and Henderson believe that their respective brand names have been, and continue to be, well received both in the asset management industry and with their respective clients, reflecting the fact that
their brands, like their businesses, are based in part on trust and confidence. If the reputation of Janus or Henderson is harmed, by the process of integrating and rebranding the two businesses following the
closing of the merger, existing clients may reduce amounts held in, or withdraw entirely from, funds advised by Janus Henderson or funds may terminate or reduce assets under management under their
management agreements with Janus Henderson, which could reduce the amount of assets under management of the combined company and cause the combined company to suffer a corresponding loss in
revenue and income. The investment performance of Janus Henderson, along with achieving and maintaining superior distribution and client services, is also critical to the success of the business. Strong
investment performance has historically stimulated sales of Janus and Henderson investment products. Poor investment performance as compared to third-party benchmarks or competitive products has in the
past (for each separate entity), and could in the future, lead to a decrease in sales of investment products managed by Janus Henderson and stimulate redemptions from existing products, generally lowering the
overall level of assets under management and reducing management fees. No assurance can be given that past or present investment performance in the investment products Janus or Henderson manage will be
indicative of future performance. Any poor investment performance may negatively impact the revenue and net income of Janus Henderson. The reputation of Janus Henderson could also be damaged by factors
such as litigation, regulatory action, loss of key personnel, misconduct, operational failures (including any failures during the integration process), mismanagement, loss of client data, fraud (by employees or
third parties), failure to manage conflicts of interest or satisfy fiduciary responsibilities, and negative publicity or press speculation (whether or not any such allegations or claims are valid or ultimately
disproved, dismissed or withdrawn). The risk of some or all of these factors occurring and damaging the reputation of Janus Henderson may be increased during integration as Janus Henderson works to
combine and rationalize the policies, systems and processes relied upon by each of Janus and Henderson. Reputational harm or poor investment performance may cause Janus Henderson to lose current clients
and it may be unable to continue to attract new clients or develop new business. If Janus Henderson fails to address, or appears to fail to address, successfully and promptly the underlying causes of any
reputational harm or

poor investment performance, it may be unsuccessful in repairing any existing harm to its reputation or performance and the combined company's future business prospects would likely be affected.

Failure to establish adequate controls and risk management policies, the circumvention of controls and policies, or fraud could have an adverse effect on the combined company's assets under
management, results of operation and financial condition.

        Janus Henderson will have a comprehensive risk management process and will continue to enhance various controls, procedures, policies and systems to monitor and manage risks to its business; however,
there can be no assurances that such controls, procedures, policies and systems will successfully identify and manage internal and external risks to the business. Janus Henderson is subject to the risk that its
employees, contractors or other third parties may deliberately seek to circumvent established controls to commit fraud or act in ways that are inconsistent with the combined company's controls, policies and
procedures (including insider trading). Persistent or repeated attempts involving conflicts of interests, circumvention of policies and controls, fraud or insider trading could have a materially adverse impact on
Janus Henderson's reputation and could lead to costly regulatory inquiries.

Failure to properly address conflicts of interest could harm Janus Henderson's reputation, business and results of operations.

        Janus Henderson's business will require continuously managing actual and potential conflicts of interest, including situations where the combined company's services to a particular client conflict, or are
perceived to conflict, with the interests of another client or those of Janus Henderson. The risk of actual or potential conflicts of interest occurring may be increased as a result of the merger and it is possible that
conflicts between aspects of Janus's and Henderson's existing businesses will be identified during the integration process. The willingness of clients to enter into transactions in which such a conflict might arise
may be affected if Janus Henderson fails, or appears to fail, to deal appropriately with conflicts of interest. In addition, potential or perceived conflicts could give rise to litigation or regulatory enforcement
actions.

Failure in Janus Henderson's operational or risk management processes, systems or infrastructure could harm Janus Henderson's reputation, business and results of operations.

        Janus Henderson's business is highly dependent on the successful and timely execution of complex investment management, operational, risk management and financial processes. Any operational errors or
negligence by the employees of, or others acting on behalf of, Janus Henderson or weaknesses in the internal controls over those processes could result in losses for Janus Henderson, a requirement for Janus
Henderson to compensate clients for losses suffered and/or regulatory fines. The risk of such operational errors or of weaknesses in internal controls may be increased during the integration process as the
businesses of Janus and Henderson are combined and the processes, systems and controls are rationalized.

        The Janus Henderson business is also highly dependent on the integrity, security and reliability of its information technology systems and infrastructure. If any of the critical systems or infrastructure do not
operate properly or are disabled, the ability of Janus Henderson to perform effective investment management on behalf of its clients could be impaired. The risk of such systems and infrastructure failing to
operate properly will be increased during the integration process while such systems and infrastructure are combined or replaced. In addition, the failure to maintain an infrastructure commensurate with the size
and scope of Janus Henderson's business, including any expansion, could impede the combined company's productivity and growth, which could negatively impact assets under management, results of
operations and financial condition.

Failure to maintain adequate infrastructure could impede Janus Henderson's productivity and ability to support business growth.

        Janus Henderson's infrastructure, including its technological capacity, data centers and office space, will be vital to the operations and competitiveness of its business. The failure to maintain an
infrastructure commensurate with the increased size and scope of Janus Henderson's business, including any expansion, could impede the combined company's productivity and growth, which could negatively
impact assets under management, results of operations and financial condition and increase operational risk.

Failure to maintain adequate business continuity plans could have a material adverse impact on Janus Henderson and its products.

        Significant portions of Janus Henderson's business operations and those of its critical third-party service providers will be concentrated in a few geographic areas, including the U.K., U.S., Luxembourg and
Australia. Should Janus Henderson, or any of its critical service providers, experience a significant local or regional disaster or other business continuity problem, the combined company's continued success
will depend in part on the safety and availability of its personnel, its office facilities, and the proper functioning of its computer, telecommunication and other related systems and operations. The failure by Janus
Henderson, or any of its critical service providers, to maintain updated adequate business continuity plans, including backup facilities, which will be more difficult during the integration process due to the
changing nature of the business during that period, could impede the combined company's ability to operate in the event of a disruption. This could negatively impact the combined company's assets under
management, results of operations and financial condition. Janus and Henderson have developed various backup systems and contingency plans but no assurance can be given that they will be adequate in all
circumstances that could arise or that material interruptions and disruptions will not occur. In addition, Janus Henderson will rely to varying degrees on outside vendors for disaster contingency support, and,
notwithstanding any due diligence or oversight carried out by Janus Henderson, no assurance can be given that these vendors will be able to perform in an adequate and timely manner. If Janus Henderson, or
any of its critical service providers, is unable to respond adequately to such an event in a timely manner, the combined company may be unable to continue its business operations, which could lead to a
damaged reputation and loss of customers that results in a decrease in assets under management, lower revenue and reduced net income.

Janus Henderson could be subject to losses and reputational harm if the combined company, or its agents, fail to properly safeguard sensitive and confidential information or as a result of cyberattacks.

        Janus Henderson will be dependent on the continued effectiveness of its information and cyber security policies, procedures and capabilities to protect its computer and telecommunications systems and the
data that resides in or is transmitted through such systems. The risk of weaknesses in such policies, procedures and capabilities may be increased during the integration process as the businesses of Janus and
Henderson are combined and the policies, procedures and systems are rationalized.

        As part of Janus Henderson's normal operations, the combined company will maintain and transmit confidential information about its clients and employees as well as proprietary information relating to its
business operations. Janus and Henderson maintain, and Janus Henderson will maintain, a system of internal controls designed to provide reasonable assurance that fraudulent activity, including
misappropriation of assets, fraudulent financial reporting and unauthorized access to sensitive or confidential data, is either prevented or detected on a timely basis. Nevertheless, all technology systems remain
vulnerable to unauthorized access and may be corrupted by cyberattacks, computer viruses or other malicious software code, the nature of which threats are constantly evolving and becoming increasingly
sophisticated. In addition, authorized persons could inadvertently or intentionally release confidential or proprietary information. Although Janus Henderson will take precautions to

password protect and encrypt its mobile electronic hardware, if such hardware is stolen, misplaced or left unattended, it may become vulnerable to hacking or other unauthorized use, creating a possible security
risk and resulting in potentially costly actions by Janus Henderson. Breach or other failure of Janus Henderson's technology systems, including those of third parties with which the combined company does
business, or failure to timely and effectively identify and respond to any such breach or failure, could result in the loss of valuable information, liability for stolen assets or information, remediation costs to
repair damage caused by the incident, additional security costs to mitigate against future incidents and litigation costs resulting from the incident. Moreover, loss of confidential customer identification
information could harm Janus Henderson's reputation, result in the termination of contracts by the combined company's existing customers and subject the combined company to liability under laws that protect
confidential personal data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue. The increasing prevalence and sophistication of cyberattacks generally and the heightened profile of Janus Henderson as a result of its
increased scale and breadth of global activities may result in an increase in the volume and sophistication of cyberattacks on Janus Henderson specifically. This may increase the amount of investment that the
combined company will need to make to minimize the risk of harm to its business and potentially increase the risk that, despite such investment, the combined company will be a victim of a successful
cyberattack. Recent well-publicized security breaches at other companies have exposed failings by companies to keep pace with the threats posed by cyberattackers and have led to enhanced government and
regulatory scrutiny of the measures taken by companies to protect against cyberattacks, and may in the future result in heightened cyber security requirements, including additional regulatory expectations for
oversight of vendors and service providers which could lead to increased costs or fines or public censure which could lead to a damaged reputation and loss of customers (and a decrease in assets under
management, lower revenue and reduced net income) as a result.

Failure to comply with client contractual requirements and/or investment guidelines could negatively impact the combined company's assets under management, results of operations and financial
condition.

        Many of the investment management agreements under which the combined company will manage assets or provide services will specify investment guidelines or requirements that Janus Henderson will
be required to observe in the provision of its services. Laws and regulations will also impose similar requirements for certain accounts. A failure to follow these guidelines or requirements could result in
damage to Janus Henderson's reputation or in clients seeking to recover losses, withdrawing their assets or terminating their contracts, any one of which could cause revenues and profitability to decline. In
addition breach of these investment guidelines or requirements could result in regulatory investigation, censure and/or fine. The risk of breach of such investment guidelines or requirements may be increased
during the integration process as the businesses of Janus and Henderson are combined.

Janus Henderson may be subject to claims of lack of suitability.

        If clients of Janus Henderson suffer losses on funds or investment mandates managed by the combined company, they may seek compensation from Janus Henderson on the basis of allegations that the
funds and/or investment mandates were not suitable for such clients or that the fund prospectuses or other marketing materials contained material errors or were misleading. Despite the controls relating to
disclosure in fund prospectuses and marketing materials, it is possible that such action may be successful, which in turn could adversely affect the business, financial condition and results of operations of the
combined company. Any claim for lack of suitability may also result in regulatory investigation, censure and/or fine and may damage the reputation of Janus Henderson.

Janus Henderson's business may be vulnerable to failures of support systems and client service functions provided by third-party vendors.

        Janus Henderson's client service capabilities as well as its ability to obtain prompt and accurate securities pricing information and to process client transactions and reports will be significantly dependent
on communication and information systems and services provided by third-party vendors. The ability to consistently and reliably obtain securities pricing information, process client transactions and provide
reports and other client services to the shareholders of funds and other investment products managed by Janus Henderson will be essential to the combined company's operations. Any delays, errors or
inaccuracies in obtaining pricing information, processing client transactions or providing reports, and any other inadequacies in other client service functions could impact client relationships, result in financial
loss and potentially give rise to regulatory action and claims against Janus Henderson. A failure of third-party systems or services could adversely affect Janus Henderson's assets under management, results of
operations and financial condition.

The failure of one of Janus Henderson's third-party service providers or other key vendors to fulfill its obligations could have a material adverse effect on the combined company's reputation or business,
which could negatively impact the combined company's assets under management, results of operations and financial condition.

        Janus Henderson will depend on third-party service providers and other key vendors for various fund administration, accounting, custody, risk analytics, market data, market indices and transfer agent roles,
and other distribution and operational needs. If Janus Henderson's third-party service providers or other key vendors fail to fulfill their obligations, experience service interruptions or otherwise provide
inadequate service, it could lead to operational and regulatory problems, including with respect to certain of the combined company's products, which could result in losses, enforcement actions, or reputational
harm and which could negatively impact the combined company's, assets under management, results of operations and financial condition.

Janus's and Henderson's businesses are dependent on investment management agreements that are subject to termination, non-renewal or reductions in fees.

        Janus and Henderson derive revenue from investment management agreements with investment funds, institutional and other investors. With respect to investment management agreements with U.S.
mutual funds, these agreements may be terminated by either party with notice, or in the event of an "assignment" (as defined in the Investment Company Act), and must be approved and renewed annually by
the independent members of each fund's board of directors or trustees or its shareowners, as required by law. In addition, the board of directors or trustees of certain investment funds and institutional and other
investors generally may terminate their investment management agreements upon written notice for any reason and without penalty. Such U.S. mutual funds, investments funds or other investors may choose to
exercise such termination rights as a result of the uncertainty caused by the merger or if the employees with whom they have a relationship leave the business during or following the integration process. The
termination of or failure to renew one or more of these agreements or the reduction of the fee rates applicable to such agreements could have a material adverse effect on the combined company's assets under
management, results of operations and financial condition.

Janus Henderson could be impacted by counterparty or client defaults.

        In periods of significant market volatility, the deteriorating financial condition of one financial institution may materially and adversely impact the performance of others. Janus and Henderson, and the
funds and accounts they manage, have exposure to many different counterparties, and routinely execute transactions with counterparties across the financial industry. Following the closing of the

merger, Janus Henderson will have a greater exposure to such counterparties than Janus or Henderson on a standalone basis and, following the integration process, the concentration of its exposure to certain of
those counterparties may increase. Janus Henderson, and the funds and accounts it manages, may be exposed to credit, operational or other risk in the event of a default by a counterparty or client, or in the event
of other unrelated systemic market failures.

Janus Henderson's indebtedness could adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations.

        Janus Henderson's indebtedness could limit its ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt servicing requirements or other purposes. Debt servicing
requirements will increase Janus Henderson's vulnerability to adverse economic, market and industry conditions; limit Janus Henderson's flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in business operations
or to the asset management industry overall; and place Janus Henderson at a disadvantage in relation to competitors that have lower debt levels. Any or all of the above events and factors could adversely affect
Janus Henderson's assets under management, results of operations and financial condition.

Janus Henderson could be adversely impacted by changes in assumptions used in calculating pension assets and liabilities.

        Henderson provides retirement benefits for its current and former employees in the U.K. through the Henderson Group Pension Scheme, which we refer to as the U.K. Pension Scheme. The U.K. Pension
Scheme operates a number of defined benefit sections, which closed to new entrants on November 15, 1999, and a money purchase section. As at December 31, 2014, the U.K. Pension Scheme had a funding
deficit of £29 million on a technical provisions basis. On the IAS19 accounting basis the U.K. Pension Scheme showed a surplus of £145.9 million as at December 31, 2016.

        Henderson may be required to increase its contributions in the future to cover any increased funding shortfall and/or expenses in the U.K. Pension Scheme, which could adversely impact Janus Henderson's
results and financial condition.

        The following issues could adversely affect the funding of the defined benefits under the U.K. Pension Scheme and materially affect Janus Henderson's funding obligations: (i) poorer than anticipated
investment performance of pension fund investments; (ii) the trustees of the U.K. Pension Scheme switching investment strategy to one with a lower weighting of return-seeking assets; (iii) changes in the
corporate bond yields which are used in the measurement of the U.K. Pension Scheme's liabilities; (iv) longer life expectancy (which will make pensions payable for longer and therefore more expensive to
provide, whether paid directly from the U.K. Pension Scheme or secured by the purchase of annuities); (v) adverse annuity rates (which tend, in particular, to depend on prevailing interest rates and life
expectancy), as these will make it more expensive to secure pensions with an insurance company; (vi) a change in the actuarial assumptions by reference to which Henderson's contributions are assessed, for
example changes to assumptions for long term price inflation; (vii) any increase in the risk-based levy assessed by and payable to the Pension Protection Fund by the U.K. Pension Scheme; (viii) other events
occurring which make past service benefits more expensive than predicted in the actuarial assumptions by reference to which Henderson's past contributions were assessed; (iv) changes to the regulatory regime
for funding defined benefit pension schemes in the U.K.; and (x) the U.K. Pensions Regulator exercising its power to trigger a winding up of the U.K. Pension Scheme thereby triggering a buy-out debt on the
employers or the U.K. Pensions Regulator using its powers under the Pensions Act 2004 to make other members of the Janus Henderson group liable for any deficit in the U.K. Pension Scheme's funding
(although, in practice, it is assumed that the Pensions Regulator would be unlikely to exercise these powers while Henderson continues to fund the U.K. Pension Scheme appropriately).

Janus and Henderson are periodically involved in various legal proceedings and regulatory matters and Janus Henderson may be involved in such proceedings in the future.

        Janus and Henderson and their respective employees are periodically involved in various legal proceedings and regulatory investigations. Among other things, such matters may result in fines, censure,
suspension of personnel and revocation of licenses. Any of these outcomes could adversely affect Janus Henderson's assets under management, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, Janus
and Henderson and their respective employees have received and may receive in the future requests for information in connection with certain investigations or proceedings from various governmental and
regulatory authorities. Following the closing of the merger, Janus Henderson will be subject to any legal proceedings and regulatory investigations that either Janus or Henderson were involved in prior to
closing, and may be subject to new proceedings or investigations relating to facts or circumstances that occurred in respect of Janus or Henderson prior to the closing of the merger. These investigations or
proceedings may result in increased costs or reputational harm to the combined company, which may lower sales and increase redemptions.

Insurance may not be available on a cost-effective basis to help protect Janus Henderson from potential liabilities.

        Janus Henderson faces the inherent risk of liability related to litigation from clients, third-party vendors or others. To help protect against these potential liabilities, Janus and Henderson have, and Janus
Henderson will in the future, purchase insurance in amounts, and against risks, that Janus Henderson considers appropriate, where such insurance is available at prices it deems acceptable. There can be no
assurance, however, that a claim or claims will be covered by insurance or, if covered, will not exceed the limits of available insurance coverage, that any insurer will remain solvent and will meet its obligations
to provide Janus Henderson with coverage or that insurance coverage will continue to be available with sufficient limits at a reasonable cost. Insurance costs are impacted by market conditions and the risk
profile of the insured, and may increase significantly over relatively short periods. In addition, certain insurance coverage may not be available or may only be available at prohibitive costs. Renewals of
insurance policies may expose Janus Henderson to additional costs through higher premiums or the assumption of higher deductibles or co-insurance liability.

Janus Henderson will have significant goodwill and intangible assets that are subject to impairment.

        At December 31, 2016, Henderson's goodwill and intangible assets totaled $1.1 billion and the additional goodwill and intangible assets arising on the merger is provisionally estimated to be approximately
$3.2 billion. The value of these assets may not be realized for a variety of reasons, including, but not limited to, significant redemptions, loss of clients, damage to brand name and unfavorable economic
conditions. Janus and Henderson have recorded goodwill and intangible asset impairments in the past and Janus Henderson could incur similar charges in the future. Under U.S. GAAP, goodwill and intangible
assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are tested for impairment annually, or more often if an event or circumstance indicates that an impairment loss may have been incurred. Other intangible assets
with a finite life are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment whenever there is an indication of impairment. Should such reviews indicate impairment, a
reduction of the carrying value of the intangible asset could occur, resulting in a charge that may, in turn, adversely affect Janus Henderson's assets under management, results of operations and financial
condition.

Risks Related to Taxes 

Additional tax liabilities could have a material impact on Janus Henderson's financial condition, results of operations and/or liquidity.

        The members of the Janus Henderson group operate in a number of territories, and will accordingly be subject to tax in several jurisdictions. The tax rules to which the members of the Janus Henderson
group are subject are complex, and each member, and the group as a whole, must make judgments (including certain judgments based on external advice) as to the interpretation and application of these rules.

        The tax affairs of members of the Janus Henderson group will in the ordinary course be reviewed by tax authorities, which may disagree with certain positions that Janus and/or Henderson have taken, or
that members of the Janus Henderson group have taken or will take in the future, and assess additional taxes. Janus and Henderson regularly assess the likely outcomes of such tax inquiries, investigations or
audits in order to determine the appropriateness of their respective tax provisions. However, there can be no assurance that Janus or Henderson will accurately predict the outcomes of these inquiries,
investigations or audits, and the actual outcomes of these inquiries, investigations or audits could have a material impact on Janus Henderson's financial results.

        Janus and Henderson are subject to ongoing routine tax inquiries, investigations or audits in various jurisdictions.

The IRS may not agree with the conclusion that Janus Henderson is to be treated as a foreign corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes following the merger or may assert that Janus Henderson is
subject to certain adverse consequences for U.S. federal income tax purposes following the merger.

        Although Henderson is incorporated and registered in Jersey, Channel Islands, and is treated as (and Janus Henderson after the merger is expected to be treated as) tax resident in the U.K., the IRS may
assert that Janus Henderson, as a result of the merger, should be treated as a U.S. corporation (and, therefore, a U.S. tax resident) for U.S. federal income tax purposes pursuant to section 7874 of the Code
(referred to as "section 7874"). Under current U.S. federal income tax law, a corporation will generally be considered to be resident for U.S. federal income tax purposes in its place of organization or
incorporation. Accordingly, under the generally applicable U.S. federal income tax rules, Janus Henderson would generally be classified as a non-U.S. corporation (and, therefore, not a U.S. tax resident).

        Section 7874 and the Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder, however, contain specific rules that may cause a non-U.S. corporation to be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax
purposes under certain circumstances.

        Section 7874 provides that if, following an acquisition of a U.S. corporation by a non-U.S. corporation, at least 80% of the acquiring non-U.S. corporation's stock (by vote or value) is considered to be held
by former shareholders of the U.S. corporation by reason of holding stock of such U.S. corporation (such percentage referred to as the "ownership percentage" and such test referred to as the "ownership test"),
and the "expanded affiliated group" which includes the acquiring non-U.S. corporation does not have substantial business activities in the country in which the acquiring non-U.S. corporation is created or
organized, then the non-U.S. corporation would be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes even though it is a corporation created and organized outside the U.S. This test is referred to
herein as the "80% test."

        Based on currently available data, the parties do not expect section 7874—either the 60% test (as described below) or the 80% test—to apply to the merger. Whether the ownership test has been satisfied,
however, is determined only after the closing of the merger. For example, for purposes of determining the ownership percentage of the former Janus stockholders, the former Janus stockholders

will be deemed to own an amount of Janus Henderson ordinary shares in respect of certain prior distributions (including stock repurchases) by Janus prior to the closing of the merger. Further, there is limited
guidance regarding the application of section 7874, and changes in law between the date of this proxy/prospectus and the closing of the merger could also alter this analysis.

        If Janus Henderson were treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, it could be liable for substantial additional U.S. federal income tax on its operations and income following the
closing of the merger. Additionally, if Janus Henderson were treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, non-U.S. Janus Henderson shareholders would generally be subject to U.S.
withholding tax on the gross amount of any dividends paid by Janus Henderson to such shareholders.

        In addition, if the ownership percentage is equal to or greater than 60% but less than 80%, then the U.S. corporation and its affiliates could be prohibited from using their foreign tax credits or other
attributes to offset the income or gain recognized by reason of the transfer of property to a non-U.S. related person or any income received or accrued by reason of a license of any property by such U.S. entity to
a non-U.S. related person. Further, certain Janus stock compensation held directly or indirectly by management would be subject to an excise tax at a rate equal to 15%. In addition, under U.S. Treasury
temporary regulations, Janus Henderson's ability to integrate certain non-U.S. operations or to access cash earned by non-U.S. subsidiaries may be limited. This test is referred to herein as the "60% test."

        Janus has requested that Skadden render an opinion, which will be dated on or after the closing date of the merger and which will be based on certain facts, representations, covenants, and assumptions, that
the merger should not be subject to section 7874. Whether such opinion can be given will depend on the facts as of the closing date. Moreover, if such opinion is rendered, there can be no assurance that the IRS
will agree with the position that Janus Henderson is to be treated as a non-U.S. corporation or that Janus Henderson is not to be subject to the other adverse tax consequences associated with having an
ownership fraction that is equal to or greater than 60% but less than 80%. In addition, the receipt of an opinion from Skadden with respect to section 7874 is not a condition to the closing of the merger, nor have
the parties applied for a ruling from the IRS.

        Please see the section entitled "The Merger—U.S., U.K. and Jersey Tax Considerations—U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations for U.S. Holders" beginning on page 131 for a full discussion of the
application of section 7874 to the merger.

Future changes to tax laws could adversely affect Janus Henderson.

        Any change in tax law, interpretation or practice, or in the terms of tax treaties, in a jurisdiction where Janus Henderson is subject to tax could increase the amount of tax payable by the combined company
and/or the Janus Henderson group.

        As discussed above, under current law, Janus Henderson is expected to be treated as a non-U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In addition to the potential application of section 7874,
however, recent legislative proposals have also aimed to expand the scope of U.S. corporate tax residence, including in such a way as would cause Janus Henderson to be treated as a U.S. corporation if the
management and control of the combined company and its affiliates were determined to be located primarily in the U.S.

        In addition, the U.S. Congress, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, which we refer to as the OECD, and other government agencies in jurisdictions where Janus and Henderson
and their respective affiliates do business have had an extended focus on issues related to the taxation of multinational corporations. One example is the OECD's "base erosion and profit shifting" project, which
focuses on limiting the ability of companies to shift income, losses, and

deductions based on relative tax rates. A number of tax authorities have indicated that they will consider reforms to their tax laws in response to this project and on June 20, 2016 the EU Council adopted the
Anti Tax Avoidance Directive (EU) 2016/1164, which requires member states to implement certain of the OECD's recommendations. As a result of the OECD project and the focus on the taxation of multi-
national corporations, the tax laws in the U.S., the U.K., and other countries in which Janus and Henderson and their respective affiliates do business could change on a prospective or retroactive basis, and any
such changes could adversely affect Janus Henderson after the merger.

        Furthermore, the U.S. Congress and the current Administration under President Trump have indicated a desire to reform the U.S. corporate income tax. There is a substantial lack of clarity around the
likelihood, timing and details of any such tax reform. At this time, it is not possible to determine whether such reform could adversely affect Janus Henderson's assets under management, results of operation, or
financial condition.

The merger may fail to qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of section 368(a) of the Code or may be subject to section 367(a)(1) of the Code, potentially causing U.S. holders of Janus common
stock to recognize taxable gain.

        Assuming, as the parties intend, that the merger is treated as a reorganization under section 368(a) of the Code and that the merger is not subject to section 367(a)(1) of the Code, if you are a U.S. holder of
Janus common stock and you exchange all of your Janus common stock for Henderson ordinary shares in the merger, you should not recognize any gain or loss with respect to your Janus stock, except to the
extent of any cash you may receive in lieu of a fractional share.

        Although the parties intend that the merger will qualify as a tax free reorganization within the meaning of section 368(a) of the Code and that the merger will not be subject to section 367(a)(1) of the Code,
until the closing, the parties cannot definitively determine the tax treatment of the merger. In addition, no assurance can be given that the IRS will not assert, or that a court would not sustain, that the merger
does not qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of section 368(a) of the Code or that the merger is subject to section 367(a)(1) of the Code.

        If section 367(a)(1) of the Code were to apply to the merger, a U.S. holder of Janus common stock would recognize gain (but not loss) in an amount equal to the excess, if any, of the fair market value, as of
the closing date of the merger, of Henderson ordinary shares received in the merger plus cash received in lieu of fractional shares, over such U.S. holder's basis in the shares of Janus common stock surrendered
by the U.S. holder in the merger. Any gain so recognized would generally be long-term capital gain if the U.S. holder had held the Janus common stock for more than one year at the time the merger is
completed.

        Janus has requested that Skadden render its opinion to Janus, which will be dated on or after the closing date of the merger and be based on certain facts, representations, covenants, and assumptions, that
the merger should be treated as a tax-free reorganization under section 368(a) of the Code and that section 367(a)(1) of the Code should not apply to the merger. Whether such opinion can be given will depend
on the facts as of the closing date. Moreover, if such opinion is rendered, there can be no assurance that the IRS will agree with the conclusions expressed therein. The obligation of Janus and Henderson to
consummate the merger, however, is not conditioned upon the receipt of such opinion from Skadden or any other counsel, nor have the parties applied for a ruling from the IRS.

        For a more complete description of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger, please see the section entitled "The Merger—U.S., U.K. and Jersey Tax Considerations—U.S. Federal Income
Tax Considerations for U.S. Holders" beginning on page 131.

If Henderson is, or if Janus Henderson were to become, a passive foreign investment company (a "PFIC") for U.S. federal income tax purposes, U.S. holders of Janus Henderson ordinary shares would
be subject to certain adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences.

        In general, a non-U.S. corporation will be a PFIC for any taxable year if (i) 75% or more of its gross income consists of passive income or (ii) 50% or more of the average quarterly value of its assets
consists of assets that produce, or are held for the production of, passive income. Henderson believes that it was not a PFIC for its taxable year prior to the merger, and Janus and Henderson do not expect Janus
Henderson to be a PFIC for its first taxable year that includes the merger or in the foreseeable future. There can be no assurance, however, that Janus Henderson will not be considered a PFIC for any taxable
year. If Janus Henderson were a PFIC for any taxable year during which a U.S. investor held Janus Henderson ordinary shares, such investor would generally be subject to certain adverse U.S. federal income
tax consequences, such as ineligibility for any preferred tax rates on capital gains or on actual or deemed dividends, the application of additional taxes equal to interest charges generally applicable to
underpayments of tax on certain distributions and sales, and additional reporting requirements under U.S. federal income tax laws and regulations.

        For a more complete description of the rules relating to PFICs, please see the section entitled "The Merger—U.S., U.K. and Jersey Tax Considerations—U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations for U.S.
Holders" beginning on page 131.

Henderson is, and Janus Henderson intends to be, tax resident in the U.K. and nowhere else. However, were Janus Henderson to be treated as tax resident in an alternative and/or additional jurisdiction,
this could increase the aggregate tax burden on Janus Henderson and its shareholders.

        Janus Henderson is and will remain incorporated and registered in Jersey, Channel Islands, so will not be presumed automatically to be U.K. resident for tax purposes. The senior management of Janus
Henderson intends to meet all requirements to establish U.K. tax residency by establishing that central management and control of the combined company rests in the U.K. If U.K. tax residency is not
established or maintained, this could increase the amount of tax payable or suffered by the Janus Henderson group.

Risks Related to the Business Combination 

The combined company may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the merger.

        The success of the merger will depend on, among other things, the combined company's ability to combine the Janus and Henderson businesses in a manner that realizes anticipated synergies and meets or
exceeds the projected stand-alone cost savings and revenue growth trends anticipated by each company. On a combined basis, Janus Henderson expects to benefit from recurring annual run-rate pre-tax net cost
synergies, expected to be fully executed within three years following closing, that will exceed the cost reductions that could be achievable by Janus and Henderson through stand-alone cost reduction programs.
Such cost synergies are expected to be realized by reducing combined headcount in internal support functions, investment management and trading functions and distribution and marketing functions and
consolidation of offices in overlapping locations and other actions.

        If the combined company is not able to successfully achieve these objectives, or the cost to achieve these synergies is greater than expected, then the anticipated benefits of the merger may not be realized
fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected.

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements included in this proxy statement/prospectus may not reflect the actual financial condition and results of operations of Janus Henderson
after the merger.

        This proxy statement/prospectus includes unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements for the combined company, which give effect to the merger, and should be read in conjunction with
the financial statements and accompanying notes of Janus and Henderson which are included or incorporated by reference in this proxy statement/prospectus. The pro forma financial statements are presented
for informational purposes only and are not necessarily indicative of what the combined company's actual financial condition or results of operations would have been had the merger been completed on the
dates indicated. Accordingly, the combined company's business, assets under management, results of operations and financial condition may differ significantly from those indicated by the pro forma financial
statements included in this proxy statement/prospectus. For more information, see "Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information."

Combining the businesses of Janus and Henderson may be more difficult, costly or time-consuming than expected, which may adversely affect the combined company's results and negatively affect the
value of Janus Henderson ordinary shares following the merger.

        Janus and Henderson have entered into the merger agreement because each believes that the merger will be beneficial to its respective company and stockholders or shareholders, as applicable, and that
combining the businesses of Janus and Henderson will produce cost synergies and other benefits. However, Janus and Henderson have historically operated as independent companies and will continue to do so
until the closing of the merger. Following the closing of the merger, the combined company's management will need to integrate Janus's and Henderson's respective businesses. The combination of two
independent businesses of the size and scale of Janus and Henderson is a complex, costly and time consuming process and the management of the combined company may face significant challenges in
implementing such integration, some of which may be beyond their control including, without limitation:

• difficulties in achieving, in a timely manner, anticipated cost synergies, business opportunities and growth prospects; 

• difficulties in managing a larger combined company, addressing differences in historical business culture and retaining key personnel; 

• the diversion of Henderson's and Janus's respective management teams attention from ongoing business operations as a result of the merger; 

• the possibility of incorrect assumptions underlying expectations regarding the integration process; 

• unanticipated difficulties in integrating information technology, communications programs, financial procedures and operations, and other systems (including those provided by third party
service providers), procedures and policies; 

• unanticipated changes in applicable laws and regulations; 

• managing tax costs or inefficiencies associated with integrating the operations of the combined company; 

• coordinating geographically separate organizations; and 

• any other unforeseen expenses or delays associated with the merger.

        Some of these factors will be outside of the control of Henderson and Janus and any one of them could result in increased costs or decreased revenue which could materially impact the combined
company's business, financial conditions and results of operations as well as increase the risk of operational errors due to management teams being diverted from ongoing business concerns which

could have negative reputational or regulatory impacts. The integration process and other disruptions resulting from the merger may also adversely affect the combined company's relationships with employees,
customers, and others with whom Janus and Henderson have business or other dealings, and difficulties in integrating the businesses or regulatory functions of Janus and Henderson could harm the reputation of
the combined company.

        If the combined company is not able to combine the businesses of Janus and Henderson successfully in an efficient, cost-effective and timely manner, the anticipated benefits and cost synergies of the
merger may not be realized fully, or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected, and the value of Janus Henderson ordinary shares, the revenue, levels of expenses and results of operations of the
combined company may be affected adversely. If the combined company is not able to adequately address integration challenges, the combined company may be unable to successfully realize the anticipated
benefits of the merger.

Janus and Henderson have incurred, and the combined company expects to incur, additional significant costs in connection with the integration of the combined company.

        There are a large number of processes, policies, procedures, operations, technologies and systems that must be integrated in connection with the merger. While both Janus and Henderson have assumed that
a certain level of expenses would be incurred in connection with the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, there are many factors beyond their control that could affect the
total amount of, or the timing of, anticipated expenses with respect to the integration and implementation of the combined businesses.

        There may also be additional unanticipated significant costs in connection with the merger that the combined company may not recoup. These costs and expenses could reduce the benefits and additional
income Janus and Henderson expect to achieve from the merger. Although Janus and Henderson expect that the benefits of the merger will offset the transaction expenses and integration costs over time, no
assurance can be given that any benefits will be achieved in the near term, if at all.

Inability to access the debt capital markets could impair Janus Henderson's liquidity, business or financial condition.

        Each of Janus and Henderson has utilized in the past and Janus continues to utilize the debt capital markets as a source of finance. An inability to raise money in the debt markets could limit the combined
company's ability to secure additional financing (if required). The combined company's access to the debt markets in amounts adequate to finance its activities could be impaired as a result of various factors,
some of which are not specific to the combined company, such as a severe disruption of the financial markets and interest rate fluctuations.

        The costs and availability of financing from the debt capital markets will also be dependent on the creditworthiness of members of the combined company. The level and quality of the combined company's
earnings, operations, business and management, among other things, will impact its creditworthiness and potentially any credit ratings assigned by rating agencies to members of the combined company. A
decrease in credit ratings assigned to members of the combined company by the ratings agencies may, to the extent that the combined company wishes to secure further borrowing, negatively impact the
combined company's access to the debt capital markets and increase the combined company's cost of borrowing. It may also impact investor confidence in the combined company and consequently reduce the
level of assets under management or affect sales. There can be no assurance that the combined company will have a credit rating assigned to it by rating agencies or maintain the current credit rating of Janus on
a stand-alone basis. Any actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in such credit ratings may have a negative impact on the combined company.

Following the closing of the transaction, the combined company may launch branding or rebranding initiatives that may involve substantial costs and may not be favorably received by customers.

        Following closing of the transaction, the combined company corporate name will be Janus Henderson Group plc. Following this, the combined company may incur substantial costs in rebranding its
products and services, and the combined company may not be able to achieve or maintain brand name recognition or status under the new combined company brand that is comparable to the recognition and
status previously enjoyed by Janus and Henderson separately. The failure of any such rebranding initiative could adversely affect the combined company's ability to attract and retain customers after the closing
of the transaction, which could cause the combined company not to realize some or all of the benefits contemplated by Janus and Henderson to result from the closing of the transaction.

An impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets would adversely affect Janus Henderson's financial condition and results of operations.

        Upon closing of the merger, a significant portion of the difference between the purchase price, Janus's net assets at that date and the allocation of costs of the combination to the assets acquired and the
liabilities assumed will be recorded as goodwill. In addition, other intangible assets will be recorded as a result of the purchase price allocation. Under U.S. GAAP, which will be the accounting principles of
Janus Henderson following the closing of the merger, goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are tested for impairment annually, or more often if an event or circumstance
indicates that an impairment loss may have been incurred. Other intangible assets with a finite life are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment whenever
there is an indication of impairment. In particular, if the combination of the businesses meets with unexpected difficulties, or if the combined company's business does not develop as expected, impairment
charges may be incurred in the future which could be significant and which could have an adverse effect on the combined company's financial condition and results of operations.

Following the merger, Janus Henderson will be a foreign private issuer under the rules and regulations of the SEC and will therefore qualify for certain accommodations under the U.S. securities laws,
which may result in less information being made available about Janus Henderson than is currently made available about Janus and/or Janus stockholders being provided with less protection than at
present.

        Following the merger, Janus Henderson will retain its status as a foreign private issuer, or FPI, until at least the end of the 2017 fiscal year. For so long as Janus Henderson retains its FPI status, Janus
Henderson will qualify for certain accommodations under the U.S. securities laws, including (i) being subject to reduced disclosure requirements with respect to quarterly reporting and executive compensation,
(ii) not being subject to the proxy rules under the Exchange Act, Section 16 of the Exchange Act or Regulation FD, and (iii) being able to follow certain home country rules in lieu of domestic company
requirements under NYSE rules. While Janus Henderson will report its financial results in accordance with U.S. GAAP and intends to file its annual and interim reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, regardless of
whether Janus Henderson continues to qualify as an FPI following closing of the merger, Janus Henderson will not be required to file such domestic U.S. company reports and may not file periodic reports and
financial statements with the SEC as frequently or as promptly as domestic U.S. companies with securities registered under the Exchange Act for so long as Janus Henderson retains its status as an FPI. During
this time period, Janus Henderson will also not be required to comply with the proxy rules, which impose certain disclosure and procedural requirements for proxy solicitations under Section 14 of the Exchange
Act, Regulation FD, which imposes certain restrictions on the selective disclosure of material information, and Janus Henderson's officers, directors and principal shareholders will be exempt from the reporting
and "short-swing" profit recovery provisions of Section 16 of the Exchange Act and the rules under the Exchange Act with respect to their purchases

and sales of Janus Henderson ordinary shares. Accordingly, after the merger, if you continue to hold Janus Henderson ordinary shares, you may receive less information about Janus Henderson than you
currently receive about Janus.

        As a foreign private issuer, Janus Henderson may also follow certain corporate governance practices permitted under its home country rules instead of those otherwise required under the applicable rules of
the NYSE for domestic U.S. issuers for so long as Janus Henderson retains foreign private issuer status. Janus and Henderson currently intend for Janus Henderson to generally follow the NYSE corporate
governance requirements applicable to a domestic company upon closing of the merger, although Janus Henderson will not be obligated to do so. Were Janus Henderson to follow corporate governance practices
permitted under home country rules as opposed to the requirements that would otherwise apply to a domestic U.S. company listed on the NYSE, you may not receive the same corporate governance protections
as a Janus Henderson shareholder as you currently have as a Janus stockholder.

Risks Related to the Merger 

Janus stockholders cannot be sure of the value of the merger consideration they will receive.

        Janus stockholders will receive a fixed number of Henderson ordinary shares (per share of Janus common stock) in the merger, rather than a number of Henderson ordinary shares with a particular fixed
market value. The market value of Henderson ordinary shares at the effective time may vary significantly from their prices on the date prior to the date the merger agreement was executed, the date of this proxy
statement/prospectus or the date on which Janus stockholders vote on the Janus merger proposal. All of the merger consideration to be received by Janus stockholders will be Henderson ordinary shares (other
than cash in lieu of fractional shares, based on then prevailing market prices, received by Janus stockholders). At the time of the Janus special meeting, Janus stockholders will not know or be able to determine
the value of the Henderson ordinary shares they will receive upon closing of the merger. Changes in the market prices of Henderson ordinary shares may result from a variety of factors that are beyond the
control of Henderson, including changes in its business, operations and prospects, regulatory considerations, governmental actions, and legal proceedings and other developments. Market assessments of the
benefits of the merger, the likelihood that the merger will be completed and general and industry-specific market and economic conditions may also have an effect on the market price of Henderson ordinary
shares. Changes in market prices of Henderson ordinary shares may also be caused by fluctuations and developments affecting industry-specific and general economic and market conditions and may have an
adverse effect on Henderson ordinary shares prior to consummation of the merger.

        You are urged to obtain up-to-date prices for Henderson ordinary shares. Further, neither Janus nor Henderson is permitted to terminate the merger agreement solely because of changes in the market prices
of Henderson ordinary shares. See "Comparative Per Share Market Price and Dividend Information" for ranges of historic prices of Janus common stock and Henderson ordinary shares.

The market price for the combined company's ordinary shares may be affected by factors different from those that historically have affected Janus common stock and Henderson ordinary shares.

        Upon closing of the merger, holders of shares of Janus common stock (other than any shares held in treasury) will become holders of Janus Henderson ordinary shares. Janus and Henderson each have
businesses that differ from each other. Accordingly, the results of operations of the combined company will be affected by some factors that are different from those currently affecting the results of operations
of each of Henderson and Janus. For a discussion of the businesses of Janus and Henderson and of certain important factors to consider in connection with those businesses, see the sections of this proxy
statement/prospectus entitled "Business of Henderson," "—Risks Related to the Combined Business of Janus and Henderson" and the documents incorporated by reference in this proxy statement/prospectus

Janus or Henderson may waive one or more of the closing conditions without re-soliciting shareholder approval.

        Janus or Henderson may determine to waive, in whole or in part, one or more of the conditions to its obligations to consummate the merger. Janus and Henderson currently expect to evaluate the materiality
of any waiver and its effect on Janus stockholders or Henderson shareholders, as applicable, in light of the facts and circumstances at the time to determine whether any amendment of this proxy
statement/prospectus or any re-solicitation of proxies or voting cards is required in light of such waiver. Any determination whether to waive any condition to the merger or as to re-soliciting stockholder
approval or amending this proxy statement/prospectus as a result of a waiver will be made by Janus or Henderson, as applicable, at the time of such waiver based on the facts and circumstances as they exist at
that time.

The merger agreement may be terminated in accordance with its terms and the merger may not be completed.

        The closing of the merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of a number of conditions. Those conditions include: (i) approval of the Janus merger proposal, (ii) approval of (a) the merger and the other
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and the Dai-ichi agreements, the allotment of the Henderson ordinary shares in connection therewith and the Henderson share issuance proposal by the
affirmative vote of a majority of the Henderson shareholders, (b) the Henderson amended articles proposal, (c) the Henderson name change proposal, (d) the Henderson permitted dividend proposal and (e) the
Henderson LSE de-listing proposal, (iii) certain regulatory approvals, including (a) expiration or termination of the waiting periods under the HSR Act, (b) approval from FINRA pursuant to NASD Rule 1017,
(c) the required approvals from the FCA for Henderson to acquire control of each subsidiary of Janus that is authorized by the FCA and (d) the approval by the JFSC of this proxy statement/prospectus, the
registration statement of which this proxy statement/prospectus forms a part and any other relevant document deemed to be a prospectus pursuant to the Jersey Companies Law, and the issue by the JFSC of any
consent required pursuant to the Control of Borrowing (Jersey) Order 1958 for Henderson to lawfully assume the Janus awards and plans, (e) consents, non-objections and/or approvals from the applicable
governmental authorities in Canada, Hong Kong, Ireland, Singapore, Switzerland and, if applicable, Australia, India and Jersey and certain other non-U.S. jurisdictions and (f) consents, non-objections and/or
approvals from the applicable governmental authorities in Jersey, Switzerland and, if applicable, Ireland necessary in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Dai-ichi agreements, (iv) the SEC
having declared effective the registration statement of which this proxy statement/prospectus forms a part, and the Janus Henderson ordinary shares having been approved for listing on the NYSE, (v) the
absence of judgments, orders or decrees preventing or making illegal the consummation of the merger, (vi) approval by the boards of trustees and shareholders of Janus-advised U.S. mutual funds of new
investment advisory agreements with Janus to take effect at the closing of the merger representing at least 67.5% of the assets under management of those funds as of September 30, 2016, and (vii) the absence
of breach of the representations and warranties by Henderson and Janus (subject to materiality and "material adverse effect" qualifications in certain cases) and material compliance by each of Henderson and
Janus with its covenants. These conditions to the closing may not be fulfilled and, accordingly, the merger may not be completed.

        If the merger is not completed by September 30, 2017, either Janus or Henderson may choose not to proceed with the merger. In addition, the parties can mutually decide to terminate the merger agreement
at any time prior to consummation of the merger, before or after the required Janus and Henderson shareholder approvals. In addition, Janus or Henderson may elect to terminate the merger agreement in certain
other circumstances.

        If the merger agreement is terminated, Henderson and Janus may incur substantial fees in connection with termination of the merger agreement and will not recognize the anticipated benefits of

the merger. See "The Merger—Description of the Merger Agreement—Termination of the Merger Agreement" beginning on page 162.

Termination of the merger agreement could negatively impact Janus and/or Henderson.

        If the merger agreement is terminated and the merger is not consummated, the ongoing businesses of Janus and Henderson may be adversely affected. Janus's and Henderson's respective businesses may be
adversely impacted by the failure to pursue other beneficial opportunities during the pendency of the merger, by the failure to obtain the anticipated benefits of completing the merger, by payment of certain
costs relating to the merger, and by the focus of their respective managements on the merger for an extended period of time rather than on normal business operations or opportunities or by the loss of certain
senior managers and other key personnel to either or both of Janus and Henderson as a consequence of the merger not completing. The market price of Janus common stock and/or Henderson ordinary shares
might decline as a result of any such failures to the extent that the current market prices reflect a market assumption that the merger will be completed. Any of these factors, among others, could have a material
impact on the business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations of Janus and/or Henderson.

        In addition, if the merger agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, Janus or Henderson, as applicable, may be required to pay the other party a termination fee of $34,000,000 in cash or to pay
the other party's expenses in the amount of up to $10,000,000 in cash, depending on the circumstances surrounding the termination (and in each case subject to certain adjustments that may be required in
respect of VAT). See "The Merger—Description of the Merger Agreement—Expenses and Termination Fees."

        Janus or Henderson may also be negatively impacted if the respective companies become subject to litigation related to entering into or failing to consummate the merger, including direct actions by Janus
stockholders or Henderson shareholders, as applicable, against the directors and/or officers of Janus or Henderson for breaches of fiduciary duty and derivative actions brought by Janus stockholders or
Henderson shareholders in the name of the respective companies.

The investment advisory agreements of the Janus U.S. mutual funds are subject to termination as a result of the merger, and no assurance can be given that approval of new investment advisory
agreements will be obtained.

        Under the Investment Company Act, each of the investment advisory agreements for Janus-advised U.S. mutual funds that are registered as an "investment company" under the Investment Company Act
automatically terminate in the event of its "assignment", as defined under the Investment Company Act. An assignment may occur under the Investment Company Act if, among other things, Janus undergoes a
change of control. In order for Janus to continue to act as an investment adviser to any such Janus-advised U.S. mutual fund, Janus must obtain approval of such fund's board and shareholders of a new
investment advisory agreement. Alternatively, in the event that the approval of a new investment advisory agreement by the shareholders of a Janus-advised U.S. mutual fund is not obtained prior to the closing
date, Janus may continue to act as investment adviser, subject to certain conditions, for any such Janus-advised U.S. mutual fund for a period of 150 days following an assignment of the applicable investment
advisory agreement if such fund's board approves an "interim contract" (within the meaning of Section 15a-4 of the Investment Company Act).

        The merger is expected to result in the assignment of the investment advisory agreements with each such Janus-advised U.S. mutual fund under the Investment Company Act and an assignment of the
investment advisory agreements with each of Janus's other clients under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, which we refer to as the Advisers Act. Janus is currently in the process of seeking the
necessary approvals for new registered fund investment advisory agreements and consents

from its other clients. It is a condition to closing the merger that Janus receive approval of the boards of trustees or shareholders of Janus-advised U.S. mutual funds of new investment advisory agreements with
Janus to take effect at the closing of the merger representing at least 67.5% of the assets under management of those funds as of September 30, 2016. No assurance can be given that Janus will be able to obtain
the necessary approvals from the boards and shareholders of the Janus-advised U.S. mutual funds. The decrease in revenue that could result from a failure to obtain such approvals, even if the merger agreement
condition is satisfied, could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition and results of operations of Janus Henderson.

Janus and Henderson will be subject to business uncertainties while the merger is pending.

        Uncertainty about the closing or effect of the merger may affect the relationship between Henderson and Janus and their respective customers, including through reduced net flows during the pendency of
the merger. This uncertainty may also affect the relationship between Henderson and Janus, on the one hand, and their respective business counterparties, on the other hand. Any such impact may have an
adverse effect on Janus and/or Henderson, and consequently on the combined company. These uncertainties may cause parties that deal with Henderson and/or Janus to seek to change existing business
relationships with them and to delay or defer decisions concerning Henderson or Janus. Changes to existing business relationships, including termination or modification, could negatively affect each of Janus's
and Henderson's assets under management, revenue, earnings and cash flow, as well as the market price of Janus's common stock and Henderson's ordinary shares.

Janus and Henderson may face challenges in attracting and retaining key personnel during the pendency of the merger.

        Each of Janus and Henderson is dependent on the experience and industry knowledge of their respective officers, key management personnel and other key employees to operate their businesses and
execute their respective business plans. The combined company's success after the merger will depend in part upon the ability of Janus and Henderson to retain key management personnel and other key
employees and to attract new management personnel and other key employees. Current and prospective employees of Janus and Henderson may experience uncertainty about their roles within the combined
company during and following the merger, which may have an adverse effect on the ability of each of Janus and Henderson to attract or retain key management personnel and other key employees. If key
employees depart because of issues related to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain with the businesses, the combined company's business following consummation of the merger
could be negatively impacted. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that the combined company will be able to attract or retain key management personnel and other key employees of Janus and Henderson to
the same extent that Janus and Henderson have previously been able to attract or retain their employees. Adverse effects arising from the pendency of the merger could be exacerbated by any delays in
consummation of the merger or termination of the merger agreement.

Janus and Henderson will be subject to certain contractual restrictions while the merger is pending.

        The merger agreement restricts each of Janus and Henderson from making certain acquisitions and divestitures, entering into certain contracts, incurring certain indebtedness and expenditures, repurchasing
or issuing securities outside of existing equity awards, and taking other specified actions without the consent of the other party until the earlier of the closing of the merger or the termination of the merger
agreement. These restrictions may prevent Janus and/or Henderson from pursuing attractive business opportunities that may arise prior to the closing of the merger and could have the effect of delaying or
preventing other strategic transactions. Adverse effects arising from the pendency of the merger could be exacerbated by any delays in consummation of the merger or termination of the

merger agreement. See "The Merger—Description of the Merger Agreement—Conduct of Business" beginning on page 151.

Third parties may terminate or alter existing contracts or relationships with Janus or Henderson.

        Each of Janus and Henderson has contracts with customers, vendors, distributors, affiliates, landlords, licensors, joint venture partners, and other business partners which may require Janus or Henderson,
as applicable, to obtain consent from these other parties in connection with the merger. If these consents cannot be obtained, the counterparties to these contracts and other third parties with which Janus and/or
Henderson currently have relationships may have the ability to terminate, reduce the scope of or otherwise materially adversely alter their relationships with either or both parties in anticipation of the merger, or
with the combined company following the merger. The pursuit of such rights may result in Janus, Henderson or the combined company suffering a loss of potential future revenue or incurring liabilities in
connection with a breach of such agreements and losing rights that are material to its business. Any such disruptions could limit the combined company's ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger.
Such disruptions could also result from a delay in the closing of the merger.

Janus and Henderson will incur significant transaction costs in connection with the merger.

        Janus and Henderson have incurred and expect to incur significant non-recurring costs associated with the merger. These costs and expenses include financial advisory, legal, accounting, consulting and
other advisory fees and expenses, reorganization and restructuring costs, severance/employee benefit-related expenses, public company filing fees and other regulatory expenses, printing expenses and other
related charges. Some of these costs are payable by Janus and Henderson regardless of whether the merger is completed.

Janus directors and executive officers may have interests in the merger different from the interests of Janus stockholders generally.

        Certain of the directors and executive officers of Janus negotiated the terms of the merger agreement, the Janus board approved the merger agreement and the Janus board recommended that Janus
stockholders vote in favor of the Janus merger proposal, the Janus compensation proposal, each of the amendment proposals and the Janus adjournment proposal. Janus directors and executive officers have
certain financial interests in the merger that may be different from, or in addition to, or in conflict with, those of Janus stockholders generally. These interests include the continued service of certain of Janus's
current directors and executive officers as directors and executive officers of Janus Henderson following consummation of the merger, the treatment in the merger of Janus Options, Janus RSU Awards, Janus
PSU Awards, Janus Restricted Share Awards, Janus MFU Awards, change-in-control and severance agreements, certain deferred compensation payments and other rights held by Janus directors and executive
officers, and the indemnification of former Janus directors and executive officers by Janus Henderson.

        The Janus board was aware of and considered these potential interests, among other matters, in evaluating and negotiating the merger agreement, in determining that the merger agreement and the
transactions contemplated thereby were advisable and fair to and in the best interests of the Janus stockholders, and in recommending to you that you vote to approve the Janus merger proposal, the Janus
compensation proposal, each of the amendment proposals and the Janus adjournment proposal. Janus stockholders should be aware of these interests when they consider recommendations of the Janus board
that they vote in favor of the Janus merger proposal, the Janus compensation proposal, each of the amendment proposals and the Janus adjournment proposal. The interests of Janus directors and executive
officers are described in more detail in the section of this proxy statement/prospectus

entitled "The Merger—Interests of Janus Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger" beginning on page 122.

Existing Janus stockholders will have a reduced ownership and voting interest in, and will exercise less influence over management of, the combined company after the merger than they did with respect to
Janus prior to the merger.

        Janus stockholders currently have the right to vote in the election of the Janus board, and on other matters affecting Janus. Upon the closing of the merger, each Janus stockholder who receives Janus
Henderson ordinary shares in the merger will become a shareholder of the combined company with a percentage ownership of, and voting interest in, the combined company that is smaller than such
stockholder's percentage ownership of, and voting interest in, Janus immediately prior to the merger. Assuming fully diluted equity capitalization of each of Janus and Henderson as of the date the merger
agreement was signed, immediately following the closing of the merger, the former Janus stockholders, as a group, will own approximately 43%, of the combined company. Accordingly, Janus stockholders will
have less influence on the management and policies of the combined company than they now have on the management and policies of Janus.

Janus Henderson ordinary shares to be received by Janus stockholders in the merger will have rights that differ from the shares of Janus common stock.

        Upon closing of the merger, Janus stockholders will no longer be stockholders of Janus, but will instead be shareholders of Janus Henderson. The rights of former Janus stockholders who become Janus
Henderson shareholders will be governed by the Janus Henderson Amended Memorandum and the Janus Henderson Amended Articles, which will be adopted, as of the effective time, in the form of Annex B to
this proxy statement/prospectus. The rights associated with Janus Henderson ordinary shares are different from the rights associated with shares of Janus common stock. See "Comparison of Rights of Holders
of Janus Henderson Ordinary Shares and Shares of Janus Common Stock" beginning on page 274.

The merger agreement contains provisions that may discourage other companies from trying to enter into a strategic transaction with either Janus or Henderson for greater consideration.

        Notwithstanding that such provisions are to be disregarded in respect of both parties to the extent that the U.K. Panel on Takeovers and Mergers determines that they are prohibited by Rule 21.2 of the City
Code, certain provisions of the merger agreement may discourage third parties from submitting business combination proposals to Janus or Henderson during the pendency of the merger agreement that might
have otherwise resulted in greater value to Janus stockholders or Henderson shareholders, as applicable, than the merger. These provisions include a general prohibition on each company, its respective
controlled affiliates, directors, officer employees and representatives, from soliciting, initiating or knowingly encouraging, or, subject to certain exceptions, entering into discussions with any third party
regarding any alternative transactions, subject to limited exceptions. In addition, Dai-ichi, Janus's largest shareholder, has committed to vote its shares of Janus's common stock in favor of the merger. This may
discourage a third party from pursuing a strategic transaction with Janus.

        If, in certain permitted circumstances, either the Janus board or Henderson board (i) withdraws, qualifies or modifies, or proposes publicly to withdraw, qualify or modify, or fails to make, in each case in
any manner adverse to the other party, its approval or recommendation of the Janus required stockholder approval or the Henderson required shareholder approvals, as applicable, or (ii) approves or
recommends, or proposes publicly to approve or recommend, any alternative transaction, Janus or Henderson, as applicable, will still be required to submit the merger to a vote of its stockholders or
shareholders, as applicable, at their respective special meetings unless the merger agreement is earlier terminated by the other party in accordance with its terms. For further information, please see the

        In addition, Janus or Henderson, as the case may be, must pay to the other party a termination fee equal to $34,000,000 in immediately available funds pursuant to the merger agreement, upon termination
of the merger agreement under the following circumstances:

• a termination of the merger agreement by Janus or Henderson because of: 

• a failure to obtain the requisite approvals of the stockholders or shareholders, as applicable, of the other party at a time when there was an offer or proposal for an alternative transaction
with respect to such party, such offer or proposal has not been withdrawn prior to the other party's special meeting or shareholder meeting, as applicable, and such party enters into or
consummates such alternative transaction within 12 months following the date of such termination; 

• a material breach by the other party at a time when there was an offer or proposal for an alternative transaction with respect to such party, such offer or proposal has not been withdrawn
on or prior to the time of such breach by the other party, and such party enters into or consummates such alternative transaction within 12 months following the date of such termination; 

• failure to consummate the merger by the outside date at a time when there was an offer or proposal for an alternative transaction with respect to such party, such offer or proposal has not
been withdrawn on or prior to the outside date, and such party enters into or consummates an alternative transaction within 12 months from the outside date; or 

• the merger agreement is terminated by Henderson or Janus, as applicable, upon the occurrence of a triggering event (as defined in the section entitled "The Merger—Description of the Merger
Agreement—Termination of the Merger Agreement" beginning on page 162) at any time prior to the receipt of the Janus required stockholder approval (in the case of a termination by
Henderson) or Henderson required shareholder approval (in the case of a termination by Janus).

        In addition, if either Janus or Henderson terminates the merger agreement in the event the Janus required stockholder approval (in the case of a termination by Henderson) or the Henderson required
shareholder approvals (in the case of a termination by Janus) are not obtained, the party whose stockholders or shareholders, as applicable, failed to provide the requisite approval is required to pay the other
party's expenses up to an amount equal to $10,000,000. The expense reimbursement is credited against any termination fee payable as described above. For further information, please see the section entitled
"The Merger—Description of the Merger Agreement—Expenses and Termination Fees" beginning on page 163.

        If the merger agreement is terminated and either Henderson or Janus determines to seek another strategic transaction, Henderson or Janus, as applicable, may not be able to negotiate a transaction on terms
comparable to, or more favorable than, the terms of the merger agreement.

The market price of the combined company's ordinary shares may be volatile, and holders of the combined company's ordinary shares could lose a significant portion of their investment due to drops in
the market price of the combined company's ordinary shares following closing of the merger.

        The market price of the combined company's ordinary shares may be volatile following closing of the merger, and shareholders may not be able to resell their Janus Henderson ordinary shares at or above
their value at the effective time due to fluctuations in the market price, including changes in price caused by factors unrelated to the combined company's operating performance or prospects.

Henderson" beginning on page 50 and "—Risks Related to the Business Combination" beginning on page 67.

The opinion of Janus's financial advisor will not be updated to reflect changes in circumstances between the signing of the merger agreement on October 3, 2016 and the closing of the merger.

        Janus has not obtained an updated opinion from its financial advisor as of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus, and Janus does not anticipate asking its financial advisor to update its opinion.
Changes in the operations and prospects of Janus or Henderson, general market and economic conditions and other factors that may be beyond the control of Janus or Henderson, and on which Janus's financial
advisor's opinion was based, may significantly alter the prices of the shares of Janus common stock or Henderson ordinary shares by the time the merger is completed. The opinion does not speak as of the time
the merger will be completed or as of any date other than the date of the opinion. Because Janus's financial advisor will not be updating its opinion, which was issued in connection with the signing of the merger
agreement on October 3, 2016, the opinion will not address the fairness of the merger consideration from a financial point of view at the time the merger is completed. The Janus board's recommendation that
Janus stockholders vote "FOR" the Janus merger proposal, the Janus compensation proposal, each of the amendment proposals and the Janus adjournment proposal, however, is made as of the date of this proxy
statement/prospectus. For a description of the opinion that Janus received from its financial advisor, please refer to "The Merger—Opinion of Janus's Financial Advisor" beginning on page 113.

Janus stockholders will not be entitled to appraisal rights in the merger.

        Appraisal rights are statutory rights that, if applicable under law, enable stockholders to dissent from an extraordinary transaction, such as a merger, and to demand that the corporation pay the fair value for
their shares as determined by a court in a judicial proceeding instead of receiving the consideration offered to stockholders in connection with the extraordinary transaction.

        Under DGCL, which is applicable to Janus as a Delaware corporation, stockholders do not have appraisal rights if the shares of stock they hold, as of the record date for determination of stockholders
entitled to vote at the meeting of stockholders to act upon a merger, are either (i) listed on a national securities exchange or (ii) held of record by more than 2,000 holders. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
appraisal rights are available if stockholders are required by the terms of the merger agreement to accept for their shares anything other than (a) shares of stock of the surviving corporation, (b) shares of stock of
another corporation that will either be listed on a national securities exchange or held of record by more than 2,000 holders, (c) cash instead of fractional shares or (d) any combination of clauses (a)-(c).

        Because Janus common stock is listed on the NYSE, a national securities exchange, and is expected to continue to be so listed on the record date for the Janus special meeting, and because Janus
stockholders will receive Janus Henderson ordinary shares in the merger, which are expected to be listed on the NYSE upon the effective time, Janus stockholders will not be entitled to appraisal rights in the
merger with respect to their shares of Janus common stock.

There has been no prior public market for Janus Henderson ordinary shares on the NYSE, and an active market for such securities may not develop or be sustained and trading prices may vary.

        Upon closing of the merger the Janus Henderson ordinary shares will be registered with the SEC and Henderson intends to apply for the Janus Henderson ordinary shares to be listed on the NYSE, and will
commence trading on the NYSE on a conditional "when issued" basis, subject to the official

notice of issuance, following closing of the merger. Although Henderson ordinary shares are currently listed and admitted to trading on the LSE, prior to closing of the merger there will be no public market for
Janus Henderson ordinary shares on the NYSE. Upon listing and trading on the NYSE, there can be no assurance that an active market for Janus Henderson ordinary shares will develop or be sustained if it does
develop. The failure of an active and liquid trading market to develop would likely have a material adverse effect on the value of the Janus Henderson ordinary shares.

Risks Related to Being a Jersey, Channel Islands Company Listing Ordinary Shares 

Janus Henderson's ordinary shares will be issued under the laws of Jersey, Channel Islands, which may not provide the level of legal certainty and transparency afforded by incorporation in a U.S. state.

        Henderson is organized under the laws of Jersey, Channel Islands, a British crown dependency that is an island located off the coast of Normandy, France. Jersey is not a member of the European Union.
Jersey, Channel Islands legislation regarding companies is largely based on English corporate law principles. However, there can be no assurance that the laws of Jersey, Channel Islands, will not change in the
future or that it will serve to protect investors in a similar fashion afforded under corporate law principles in the U.S., which could adversely affect the rights of investors.

U.S. shareholders may not be able to enforce civil liabilities against Janus Henderson.

        At present, none of Henderson's directors and officers are residents of the U.S. Following consummation of the merger, certain of Janus Henderson's directors and executive officers will not be residents of
the U.S. A substantial portion of the assets of such persons are located outside the U.S. As a result, it may not be possible for investors to effect service of process within the U.S. upon such persons.

        Judgments of U.S. courts may not be directly enforceable outside of the U.S. and the enforcement of judgments of U.S. courts outside of the U.S. may be subject to limitations. Investors may also have
difficulties pursuing an original action brought in a court in a jurisdiction outside the U.S. for liabilities under the securities laws of the U.S.

General 

        This section contains information about the Janus special meeting that has been called to consider and vote on the Janus merger proposal, the Janus compensation proposal, the amendment proposals and
the Janus adjournment proposal. This proxy statement/prospectus is being furnished to Janus stockholders in connection with the solicitation of proxies by the Janus board for use at the Janus special meeting
and any postponements or adjournments of such special meeting. This proxy statement/prospectus provides Janus stockholders with information about the Janus special meeting and should be read carefully in
its entirety.

Date, Time and Place 

        The Janus special meeting will be held at the JW Marriott Hotel, 150 Clayton Lane, Denver, Colorado, on April 25, 2017, at 10:00 a.m. (local time).

Purpose of the Janus Special Meeting 

        At the Janus special meeting, Janus stockholders will be asked to vote on the following proposals:

• Proposal 1 (Janus merger proposal)—Adoption of the Merger Agreement.  To consider and vote on the Janus merger proposal (see the section below entitled "Janus Proposal 1: The Merger
Proposal"); 

• Proposal 2 (Janus compensation proposal)—Approval, on an Advisory (Non-Binding) Basis, of Certain Compensatory Arrangements with Janus Named Executive Officers.  To
consider and vote on the Janus compensation proposal (see the section below entitled "Janus Proposal 2: The Janus Compensation Proposal"); 

• Proposals 3 through 7 (amendment proposals)—Approval, on an Advisory (Non-Binding) Basis, of Certain Amendments to the Henderson Memorandum of Association and

section below entitled "Janus Proposal 8: Possible Adjournment to Solicit Additional Proxies, if Necessary or Appropriate").

        You should carefully read this proxy statement/prospectus in its entirety for more detailed information concerning the transaction and the proposals to be voted on at the Janus special meeting.

Recommendation of the Janus Board 

        After careful consideration, the Janus board, on October 1, 2016, unanimously (a) approved the merger agreement and determined that entering into the merger agreement and consummating the
transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger, are advisable and fair to, and in the best interests of, Janus and its stockholders; (b) authorized and approved the execution, delivery and performance of
the merger agreement by Janus and approved the merger; and (c) recommended the adoption of the merger agreement by the Janus stockholders and directed that the merger agreement be submitted for
consideration by the Janus stockholders at the Janus special meeting.

The Janus board unanimously recommends that the Janus stockholders vote: 

        "FOR" the Janus merger proposal;

        "FOR" the Janus compensation proposal;

        "FOR" each of the amendment proposals; and

        "FOR" the Janus adjournment proposal.

Record Date; Stockholders Entitled to Vote 

        Only holders of record of shares of Janus common stock at the close of business on March 15, 2017 the record date for voting at the Janus special meeting will be entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the
Janus special meeting or any adjournments or postponements thereof. As of the close of business on March 15, 2017, there were 184,297,796 shares of Janus common stock issued and outstanding and entitled
to vote at the Janus special meeting, including 36,382,545 shares of Janus common stock held by Dai-ichi. A list of stockholders of record entitled to vote at the Janus special meeting shall be open to any
stockholder for any purpose relevant to such meeting for ten days before the Janus special meeting, during normal business hours, at 151 Detroit Street, Denver, Colorado 80206.

Shares and Voting of Janus Directors and Executive Officers 

        As of the close of business on March 15, 2017, approximately 2.23% of the issued and outstanding shares of Janus common stock (including Janus Restricted Share Awards entitled to vote) were held by
Janus directors and executive officers and their affiliates. We currently expect that Janus directors and executive officers will vote their shares of Janus common stock in favor of the above-listed proposals,
although none of them has entered into any agreements obligating him or her to do so.

Quorum 

        A quorum of stockholders is necessary to transact business at the Janus special meeting. In order to take any action at the Janus special meeting, a majority of Janus's outstanding shares of common stock as
of the record date must be present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote at the Janus special meeting, or any adjournment or postponement thereof. The inspectors intend to treat as "present" for
these purposes stockholders who have submitted properly executed or transmitted proxies that are marked "abstain." The inspectors will also treat as "present" at the Janus special meeting shares held in "street
name" by brokers that are voted on at least one proposal to come before the Janus special meeting. In the event that a quorum is not present, or if there are insufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at the
time of the Janus special meeting, it is expected that the Janus special meeting will be adjourned to solicit additional proxies.

Required Vote 

        Proposal 1: Vote on the Janus merger proposal.    The votes cast "FOR" this proposal must represent a majority of all outstanding shares of Janus common stock entitled to vote thereon.

        Proposal 2: Advisory vote on the Janus compensation proposal.    The affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of Janus common stock represented at the Janus special meeting and entitled to vote
thereon is required to approve the Janus compensation proposal.

        Proposals 3 through 7: Advisory vote on the amendment proposals.    The affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of Janus common stock represented at the Janus special meeting and entitled to vote
thereon is required to approve each of the amendment proposals.

        Proposal 8: Vote on the Janus adjournment proposal.    The affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of Janus common stock represented at the Janus special meeting and entitled to vote thereon is
required to approve the Janus adjournment proposal.

Table of Contents

        Under the NYSE rules, if you hold your shares of Janus common stock in "street name," your broker, nominee or intermediary may not vote your shares without instructions from you on non-routine
matters. None of the proposals to be voted on at the Janus special meeting are routine matters. Therefore, without your voting instructions, your broker or other nominee may not vote your shares on any of
Proposals 1 through 7 at the Janus special meeting.

        Broker non-votes will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" Proposal 1 and will have no effect on Proposals 2 through 7 (assuming a quorum is present). However, because none of the proposals to
be voted on at the Janus special meeting are routine matters for which brokers may have discretionary authority to vote, Janus does not expect any broker non-votes at the Janus special meeting.

Abstentions and Broker Non-Votes 

        A "broker non-vote" occurs on an item when (i) a bank, broker, nominee, intermediary or other holder of record holding shares for a beneficial owner does not vote on a particular proposal because the
broker does not have discretionary authority to vote on that particular proposal without receiving voting instructions from the beneficial owner of the shares, and (ii) the beneficial owner fails to provide the
bank, broker, nominee, intermediary or other holder of record with such instructions. Under the current rules for the NYSE, brokers do not have discretionary authority to vote on "non-routine" proposals,
including the Janus merger proposal (Proposal 1), the vote, on an advisory basis, on the Janus compensation proposal (Proposal 2), the vote, on an advisory basis, on the amendment proposals (Proposals 3
through 7) and the Janus adjournment proposal (Proposal 8). Because none of the proposals to be voted on at the Janus special meeting are routine matters for which brokers may have discretionary authority to
vote, Janus does not expect any broker non-votes at the Janus special meeting. If you hold your shares in street name, it is critical that you cast your vote by instructing your bank, broker or other nominee on
how to vote if you want your vote to be counted at the Janus special meeting. The NYSE rules governing brokers' discretionary authority will not permit brokers to exercise discretionary authority
regarding any of the proposals to be voted on at the Janus special meeting.

        If you are a Janus stockholder and you mark your proxy or voting instructions to abstain, it will have the effect of a vote "AGAINST" the Janus merger proposal, the Janus compensation proposal, each of
the amendment proposals and the Janus adjournment proposal. If you are a Janus stockholder and you fail to instruct your broker or nominee to vote, it will have the effect of a vote "AGAINST" the Janus
merger proposal but will have no effect on the Janus compensation proposal, the amendment proposals and the Janus adjournment proposal, assuming a quorum is present.

How to Vote 

Voting by Proxy

        If you hold shares of Janus common stock in your name as a holder of record, which we refer to as the registered stockholder, you can vote your shares by one of the following methods:

        By Internet—You may submit a proxy electronically via the Internet at www.proxyvote.com until 11:59 p.m. EDT on April 24, 2017. Please have your proxy card in hand when you log on to the website.
The Internet procedures are designed to authenticate a stockholder's identity to allow stockholders to vote their shares and confirm that their instructions have been properly recorded. Internet voting facilities for
stockholders of record are available 24 hours a day. Voting via the Internet authorizes the named proxies to vote your shares in the same manner as if you had submitted a validly executed proxy card.

        By Telephone—You may submit a proxy by telephone, toll-free, at 1-800-690-6903 until 11:59 p.m. EDT on April 24, 2017. Please have your proxy card in hand when you call. The telephone voting

procedures are designed to authenticate a stockholder's identity to allow stockholders to vote their shares and confirm that their instructions have been properly recorded. Voting by telephone authorizes the
named proxies to vote your shares in the same manner as if you had submitted a validly executed proxy card.

        By Mail—You may complete, sign and date the proxy card and return it so that it is received by 11:59 p.m. EDT on April 24, 2017.

        If your shares of Janus common stock are held in a stock brokerage account or by a bank, or other holder of record, you are considered the "beneficial owner" of shares held in street name. As the beneficial
owner, you have the right to direct your broker, bank, or other registered stockholder on how to vote your shares by using the voting instruction form included in the mailing or by following their instructions for
voting by telephone or on the Internet.

Voting at the Janus special meeting

        Attendance at the Janus special meeting is limited to Janus stockholders on the record date and their proxies. Please indicate on the proxy card if you plan to attend the Janus special meeting. You will need
proof of ownership to enter the Janus special meeting. If you are a beneficial owner of shares of Janus common stock and you plan to attend the Janus special meeting, you must present proof, such as a bank or
brokerage account statement, of your ownership of Janus common stock as of the record date to be admitted to the Janus special meeting.

        If you are a registered stockholder, representatives of Janus will confirm your stockholder status at the Janus special meeting. You must present a form of personal identification to be admitted to the Janus
special meeting. NO CAMERAS, RECORDING EQUIPMENT, ELECTRONIC DEVICES, BAGS, BRIEFCASES, PACKAGES, OR SIMILAR ITEMS WILL BE PERMITTED AT THE JANUS
SPECIAL MEETING.

        If you vote by proxy and also attend the Janus special meeting, you do not need to vote again at the Janus special meeting unless you wish to change your vote. Even if you plan to attend the Janus
special meeting, we strongly urge you to vote in advance by proxy by signing and dating the enclosed proxy card and returning it in the postage-paid envelope provided or by voting via the Internet
or by telephone by following the instructions provided on the enclosed proxy card and below. Submitting your proxy prior to the Janus special meeting does not limit your right to vote in person at the
Janus special meeting if you decide to do so. If you wish to vote in person at the Janus special meeting, we will pass out written ballots for such purpose as requested; however, if you are a beneficial owner, you
must obtain a legal proxy from your broker, bank, or other holder of record and bring it to the Janus special meeting to vote in person at the Janus special meeting.

        Janus stockholders should not send in their stock certificates with their proxy cards.    Janus stockholders will be sent materials for exchanging shares of Janus common stock shortly after the closing
of the transaction.

Voting of Proxies 

        A proxy card is enclosed for your use. Janus requests that you mark, sign and date the accompanying proxy and return it promptly in the enclosed postage-paid envelope. When the accompanying proxy is
returned properly executed, the shares of Janus common stock represented by it will be voted at the Janus special meeting or any adjournment thereof in accordance with the instructions contained in the proxy.
If no specific instructions are given by you when you execute your voting form, as explained on the form, your shares will be voted as recommended by the Janus board as stated in this proxy
statement/prospectus, specifically "FOR" the Janus merger proposal, "FOR" the

Janus compensation proposal, "FOR" each of the amendment proposals, and "FOR" the Janus adjournment proposal.

        At the date hereof, Janus's management has no knowledge of any business that will be presented for consideration at the Janus special meeting and which would be required to be set forth in this proxy
statement/prospectus or the related Janus proxy card other than the matters set forth in Janus's Notice of Special Meeting of Stockholders. If any other matter is properly presented at the Janus special meeting
for consideration, it is intended that the persons named in the enclosed form of proxy and acting thereunder will vote in accordance with their best judgment on such matter and as the Janus board may
recommend.

        Your vote is important. Accordingly, please mark, sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card whether or not you plan to attend the Janus special meeting in person.

How Proxies Are Counted 

        All shares of Janus common stock represented by properly executed proxies received in time for the Janus special meeting will be voted at the meeting in the manner specified by the Janus stockholder
giving those proxies. Properly executed proxies that do not contain voting instructions with respect to the Janus merger proposal, the Janus compensation proposal, the amendment proposals or the Janus
adjournment proposal will be voted as recommended by the Janus board as stated in this proxy statement/prospectus, specifically "FOR" the Janus merger proposal, "FOR" the Janus compensation proposal,
"FOR" each of the amendment proposals and "FOR" the Janus adjournment proposal.

Voting of Janus Common Stock Held in Street Name 

        If you hold shares of Janus common stock through a broker, bank or other nominee, you may instruct your broker, bank or other nominee to vote your shares of Janus common stock by following the
instructions that the broker, bank or other nominee provides to you with these materials. Most brokers offer the ability for stockholders to submit voting instructions by mail by completing a voting instruction
card, by telephone and via the Internet. Your broker, bank or other nominee may have an earlier deadline by which you must provide instructions to it as to how to vote your shares, so you should read carefully
the materials provided to you by your broker, bank or other nominee. If you do not provide voting instructions to your broker, bank or other nominee, your Janus shares will not be voted on any
proposal as your broker, bank or other nominee does not have discretionary authority to vote on any of the proposals to be voted on at the Janus special meeting. We urge you to instruct your
broker or other nominee how to vote your shares by following those instructions.

        Broker non-votes are counted for the purpose of determining the presence or absence of a quorum for purposes of the Janus special meeting but are not considered votes cast. With respect to the Janus
merger proposal, a broker non-vote will have the effect of a vote "AGAINST" the proposal. With respect to the Janus compensation proposal, the amendment proposals and the Janus adjournment proposal, a
broker non-vote will have no effect on such proposals. Because none of the proposals to be voted on at the Janus special meeting are routine matters for which brokers may have discretionary authority to vote,
Janus does not expect any broker non-votes at the Janus special meeting.

        If you hold shares of Janus common stock in the name of your broker, bank, or other nominee and wish to vote your shares of Janus common stock in person at the Janus special meeting, you must obtain a
legal proxy from your broker or nominee and present it to the inspector of election with your ballot when you vote at the Janus special meeting.

Voting by Employees Participating in the Employee Stock Ownership Plan and the Kansas City Southern 401(k) Plan 

        Each participant in the Janus ESOP and the KCS 401(k) Plan may instruct the respective trustees of these plans on how to vote the shares of Janus common stock held on behalf of the participant under
such plans. The trustee of each plan must receive your voting instructions for the common stock allocated to your Janus ESOP or KCS 401(k) Plan account before April 21, 2017. If the trustee for the Janus
ESOP or the KCS 401(k) Plan does not receive your voting instructions before April 21, 2017, it will vote those shares, subject to the requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as
amended, in the same proportion as the voting instructions that it receives from other Janus ESOP or KCS 401(k) Plan account holders (as applicable).

        On March 15, 2017, there were 1,173,928.265 outstanding Janus shares in the Janus 401(k) and Employee Stock Ownership Plan.

Revocability of Proxies and Changes to a Janus Stockholders' Vote 

        If you are a registered stockholder, you may change your vote or revoke your proxy at any time before it is exercised at the Janus special meeting. You may do this in one of four ways:

• Deliver a written notice of revocation to the General Counsel and Secretary, Janus Capital Group Inc., 151 Detroit Street, Denver, Colorado 80206 by 5:00 p.m. Denver time on April 24, 2017. 

• Complete, sign, and timely submit a new proxy card with a later date. 

• Timely submit a proxy with new voting instructions using the telephone or Internet voting system. 

• Vote in person at the Janus special meeting (merely attending the Janus special meeting will not revoke your proxy).

        Your attendance in and of itself will not revoke any proxy.

        If your shares of Janus common stock are held in street name, you should follow the instructions of your broker regarding the revocation of proxies.

        Once voting on a particular matter is completed at the Janus special meeting, a Janus stockholder will not be able to revoke its proxy or change its vote as to that matter.

        All shares of Janus common stock represented by valid proxies that Janus receives through this solicitation and that are not revoked will be voted in accordance with the instructions on the proxy card. If a
Janus stockholder makes no specifications on its proxy card as to how it should want its shares of Janus common stock voted before signing and returning it, such proxy will be voted as recommended by the
Janus board as stated in this proxy statement/prospectus, specifically "FOR" the Janus merger proposal, "FOR" the Janus compensation proposal, "FOR" each of the amendment proposals and "FOR" the Janus
adjournment proposal.

Tabulation of Votes 

        The Janus board has appointed David W. Grawemeyer, Amy J. Stefonick and Broadridge Financial Services to serve as the inspectors of election for the Janus special meeting. The inspectors of election
will, among other matters, determine the number of shares of Janus common stock represented at the Janus special meeting to confirm the existence of a quorum, determine the validity of all proxies and ballots
and certify the results of voting on all proposals submitted to the Janus stockholders.

Solicitation of Proxies 

        Janus is soliciting proxies to provide an opportunity to all Janus stockholders to vote on agenda items, whether or not the stockholders are able to attend the Janus special meeting or an adjournment or
postponement thereof. Janus will bear the entire cost of soliciting proxies from its stockholders, except that Janus and Henderson have agreed to each pay one half of the costs and expenses of filing, printing
and mailing this proxy statement/prospectus and all filing and other similar fees payable to the SEC in connection with this proxy statement/prospectus. In addition to the solicitation of proxies by mail, Janus
will request that banks, brokers and other record holders send proxies and proxy material to the beneficial owners of shares of Janus common stock and secure their voting instructions, if necessary. Janus will
reimburse the record holders on request for their reasonable expenses in taking those actions.

        Janus has also made arrangements with Georgeson LLC to assist in soliciting proxies and in communicating with Janus stockholders. Proxies also may be solicited on behalf of Janus in person, by mail, by
telephone, by facsimile, by messenger, via the Internet or by other means of communication, including electronic communication, or by Janus directors, officers and employees in person, by mail, by telephone,
by facsimile, via the Internet or by other means of communication, including electronic communication. Directors, officers and employees of Janus will not be specially compensated for their services or
solicitation in this regard.

Adjournments 

        If the Janus special meeting is postponed or adjourned, your proxy will still be valid and may be voted at the postponed or adjourned meeting in the manner described in this proxy statement/prospectus.
You will still be able to revoke your proxy until it was voted at the postponed or adjourned meeting.

        If a quorum is not present or represented, a meeting of Janus stockholders may be adjourned from time to time by the vote of shares of Janus common stock having a majority of the votes of the shares of
Janus common stock represented at such meeting until a quorum is present.

        If a quorum is present at the Janus special meeting but there are not sufficient votes at the time of the Janus special meeting to approve the Janus merger proposal, then Janus stockholders may be asked to
vote on the Janus adjournment proposal. No notices of an adjourned meeting need be given if the time and place to which the meeting is adjourned are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is
taken, unless the Janus board sets a new record date for such meeting, in which case a notice of the adjourned meeting will be given to each Janus stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting. At any
subsequent reconvening of the Janus special meeting at which a quorum is present, any business may be transacted that might have been transacted at the original meeting and all proxies will be voted in the
same manner as they would have been voted at the original convening of the Janus special meeting, except for any proxies that have been effectively revoked or withdrawn prior to the time the proxy is voted at
the reconvened meeting.

Assistance 

        If you need assistance in completing your proxy card or have questions regarding the Janus special meeting, please contact Georgeson LLC, the proxy solicitation agent for Janus, at 888-565-5423.

THE MERGER 

Effects of the Merger 

        At the effective time, Merger Sub will be merged with and into Janus, with Janus surviving the merger as a direct and wholly owned subsidiary of Henderson.

        Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the merger agreement, Janus stockholders will have the right to receive, with respect to each share of Janus common stock they hold at the effective time,
4.7190 Henderson ordinary shares, with cash paid in lieu of fractional Henderson ordinary shares based on then prevailing market prices, subject to the following adjustments. Effective immediately prior to the
closing of the merger, subject to approval by the Henderson shareholders at the Henderson shareholder meeting, Henderson will implement the share consolidation at a ratio of one Janus Henderson ordinary
share (or CDI, as applicable) for every 10 Henderson ordinary shares (or CDIs, as applicable) outstanding (so that at closing of the merger each Janus stockholder will receive 0.4719 Janus Henderson ordinary
shares for each share of Janus common stock). In addition, subject to approval by the Henderson shareholders at the Henderson shareholder meeting, effective upon the date of the Henderson shareholder
meeting, the par value of Henderson ordinary shares will be redenominated from pounds sterling into U.S. dollars. Following the redenomination, subject to approval by the Henderson shareholders at the
Henderson shareholder meeting, upon completion of certain registration procedures with the Jersey Registrar of Companies, the par value of Henderson ordinary shares will be reduced to ensure that the par
value is a round number. In addition, each share of common stock of Merger Sub, par value $0.01 per share, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time will be cancelled and, in exchange for
the cancellation and the funding of the merger consideration by Henderson, Janus, as the surviving corporation in the merger, will issue an equivalent number of fully paid and non-assessable shares of common
stock, par value $0.01 per share, all of which shares will be held by Henderson, and which will constitute the only outstanding shares of common stock of Janus, as the surviving corporation, immediately
following the effective time.

        The merger agreement does not contain any provision that would adjust the exchange ratio based on fluctuations in the market value of either the Janus common stock or Henderson ordinary shares or
currency exchange rates. Because of this, the implied value of consideration to the Janus stockholders may fluctuate between now and closing of the merger. The value of the consideration to Janus stockholders
will depend on the market value of Henderson ordinary shares at the time the merger is completed and on currency exchange rates. The merger agreement provides that the merger consideration will be adjusted
appropriately to reflect the effect of any stock/share split, reverse stock split, share consolidation, share subdivision, share bonus issue or stock/share dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities
convertible into the Henderson ordinary shares or Janus common stock, as applicable), reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other like change with respect to the
number of shares of Henderson ordinary shares or Janus common stock issued and outstanding after October 3, 2016 and prior to the effective time.

Background of the Merger 

        The management and board of directors of Janus regularly reviews and discusses the performance, risks, strategy, prospects and competitive position of Janus, as well as business opportunities available to
Janus. In addition, the management and board of directors of Janus from time to time reviews and evaluates the possibility of pursuing various strategic alternatives and relationships as part of Janus's ongoing
efforts to strengthen its overall business and enhance value for its stockholders, taking into account economic, regulatory, competitive and other conditions.

        On February 10, 2016, Richard Weil, Chief Executive Officer of Janus, was in London to visit Janus's London offices. Representatives of Bank of America Merrill Lynch, which we refer to as BAML, had

Chief Executive Officer of Henderson, while Mr. Weil was in London. On February 10, 2016, Mr. Weil and Mr. Formica met and discussed the asset management industry generally and their respective
businesses, though they did not have any substantive discussions regarding any strategic transaction involving Janus and Henderson.

        On March 8, 2016, Mr. Weil and Mr. Formica spoke by telephone to discuss certain follow-up items from their February meeting. They also discussed whether a strategic transaction between Henderson
and Janus would be worth considering, and each agreed to consider the possibility with their respective boards.

        On April 7, 2016, Mr. Weil and Mr. Formica spoke by telephone to continue discussions on the asset management industry generally, and their respective businesses, as well as the possibility of exploring a
potential business combination of Janus and Henderson. They did not discuss the structure or any specific terms of such a transaction, but each of them agreed to consider the matter further, as well as further
discussions on this topic.

        On April 8, 2016, during a regularly scheduled call between Mr. Weil and Glenn Schafer, Chairman of the Janus board, Mr. Weil informed Mr. Schafer that he had spoken to Mr. Formica, that in that

        Also on September 23, 2016 Mr. Weil and Mr. Formica discussed by telephone feedback from the Henderson board, the Dai-ichi relationship, exchange ratio, brand, potential headquarters and the draft
merger agreement, among other topics.

        On September 26, 2016, Mr. Weil and Mr. Formica, along with representatives of Loeb Spencer House and BAML, participated in a conference call to discuss certain material open items in the draft
merger agreement, including the methodology to calculate the exchange ratio and the name of the combined company. Certain items remained open at the conclusion of this call.

        On the morning of September 27, 2016, Mr. Weil and Mr. Formica, along with representatives of Loeb Spencer House and BAML, again participated in a conference call to discuss the items that remained
open at the conclusion of the previous day's call. Again, such items were not resolved, and the parties recessed to consider potential compromises. Later on that same day, after further negotiations by telephone,
Mr. Weil and Mr. Formica agreed in principle on a methodology to calculate the exchange ratio and the name of the combined company. The agreed methodology to calculate the exchange ratio was primarily
based upon the average of the daily volume weighted average price (which we refer to as VWAP) in USD for each share of Janus common stock and each Henderson ordinary share over the 30 trading days
(excluding U.S. and U.K. holidays) from August 18, 2016 to September 30, 2016. The VWAP for Janus common stock was $14.3173 and the VWAP for Henderson ordinary shares was $3.1098. This period
was selected as the most relevant period for measuring the relative prices of Janus common stock and Henderson ordinary shares taking into account the long-term trading relationship of the securities, the
impact of Brexit and the "merger of equals" structure of the transaction. Mr. Weil and Mr. Formica then agreed to an adjustment of 2.5% to the resulting exchange ratio in favor of the Janus stockholders
representing an equitable sharing of the expected incremental shareholder value to be created from the expected synergies from the transaction. As part of the negotiation and agreement on the exchange ratio,
the parties did not attempt to produce a particular ownership split of the combined company. After application of the 2.5% adjustment, the ratio of the VWAP for Janus common stock to the VWAP for
Henderson ordinary shares produced the exchange ratio of 4.7190, which is expected to result in Henderson shareholders and Janus stockholders owning approximately 57% and 43%, respectively, of Janus
Henderson immediately following closing of the merger. On September 30, 2016, the last trading day prior to the public announcement of the merger, the implied value of the merger consideration payable in
respect of each share of Janus common stock was 1,094.81 pence, or $14.20 in dollar equivalent.

        On September 27, 2016, Skadden sent to Freshfields a list of key material open items in the draft merger agreement, which included items related to governance, employee compensation and benefits, and
conditions to closing of the merger, among others.

        On September 28, 2016, representatives of Skadden and representatives of Freshfields discussed by telephone the Skadden list of key material open items relating to the draft merger agreement and the Dai-
ichi agreements. After the call, Freshfields sent to Skadden an annotated list to reflect the discussions from the call.

        On September 29, 2016, representatives of Skadden and representatives of Freshfields discussed by telephone Janus's and Henderson's respective positions on the remaining key material open items in the
draft merger agreement.

        Also on September 29, 2016, members of Janus management and members of Henderson management discussed by telephone the communication plan regarding the announcement of the business
combination assuming that an agreement could be reached.

        Also on September 29, 2016, Mr. Weil and Mr. Formica discussed by telephone the remaining key material open items in the draft merger agreement.

        Also, in the evening of September 29, 2016, Skadden sent to Freshfields a revised draft of the merger agreement to reflect Janus's position in relation to the key material open items. Over the next three
days, Skadden and Freshfields and their respective clients worked to resolve the remaining open items in the draft merger agreement and the Dai-ichi agreements.

        On September 30, 2016, Mr. Weil and Mr. Formica discussed by telephone feedback from the respective Janus and Henderson board meetings and the briefing of the investment managers of their
respective businesses.

        On October 1, 2016, the compensation committee of the Janus board held a special meeting in person to discuss certain change in control agreements to be entered into by Janus and certain Janus
employees in connection with the business combination with Henderson and to discuss a severance and transaction-related retention and bonus program to be implemented by Janus. The compensation
committee approved the severance and transaction-related retention and bonus program and recommended to the Janus board the approval of these programs.

        Later on October 1, 2016, the Janus board held a special meeting in person to discuss and consider the business combination with Henderson. The Janus board was joined at the meeting by representatives
of Janus management, as well as representatives from Loeb Spencer House and Skadden. Mr. Weil provided an update on the resolution of the open issues in the merger agreement, including the agreement
reached with Henderson on the combined company name and exchange ratio. Representatives from Skadden provided an update on revisions to the proposed merger agreement. Janus board members asked
questions and discussion ensued. Following such discussion, representatives from Loeb Spencer House presented their updated financial analysis of the proposed combination. Loeb Spencer House rendered to
the Janus board its oral opinion, confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated October 1, 2016, to the effect that as of that date, and based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth in the
written opinion, the exchange ratio set forth in the merger agreement was fair from a financial point of view to holders of shares of Janus common stock (other than Janus or any wholly-owned subsidiary of
Janus or Henderson and its affiliates). Loeb Spencer House's opinion is more fully described in the section of this proxy statement/prospectus entitled "The Merger Agreement—Opinion of Janus's Financial
Advisor" beginning on page 113 of this proxy statement/prospectus and the full text of the written opinion of Loeb Spencer House, which sets forth the assumptions and limitations in such opinion, is attached
as Annex C hereto. Thereafter, the Janus board unanimously determined that it was advisable and in the best interests of Janus and its stockholders to enter into the merger agreement and the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement, and the board unanimously approved the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. In addition, the board unanimously approved the
Dai-ichi agreements.

        On October 2, 2016, Janus and Henderson finalized the merger agreement, the Janus Henderson Amended Memorandum, the Janus Henderson Amended Articles and the Dai-ichi agreements.

        On October 3, 2016, the merger agreement was executed and delivered by Janus, Henderson and Merger Sub and the Dai-ichi agreements were executed and delivered by Janus, Henderson and Dai-ichi (as
applicable).

        On the morning of October 3, 2016, prior to market openings in London and the U.S., Janus and Henderson issued a joint press release announcing the execution of the merger agreement.

Janus's Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of the Janus Board 

        At its meeting on October 1, 2016, the Janus board unanimously determined that the merger agreement, the voting agreement and the amended investment and cooperation agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby, including the merger, are advisable, fair to, and in the best interests of, Janus and its stockholders, and adopted the merger agreement, the voting agreement and the amended investment
and cooperation agreement. The Janus board unanimously recommends that the Janus stockholders vote "FOR" each of the Janus merger proposal, the Janus compensation proposal, the
amendment proposals and the Janus adjournment proposal.

        In evaluating the merger agreement, the Janus board reviewed and discussed a significant amount of information and consulted with and received the advice of Janus's senior management and its legal and
financial advisors. In reaching its decision, the Janus board considered a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the following factors which the Janus board believed supported its decision to adopt and
enter into the merger agreement and its recommendation that Janus stockholders vote "FOR" each of the Janus merger proposal, the Janus compensation proposal, the amendment proposals and the Janus
adjournment proposal:

• the merger would create a combined company with highly complementary businesses that have a larger geographic footprint, compatible cultures and a shared focus on delivering excellent
investment performance and service to clients; 

• the combined company would accelerate both Janus's and Henderson's objectives to achieve growth, diversification and globalization, creating a more global active investment manager with
enhanced scale and market position; 

• the merger is expected to combine the talent pools of both organizations to build a strong global team with enhanced capabilities to innovate on behalf of clients and to create a leading
independent active asset manager with a globally relevant brand, footprint, investment proposition and client service capability; 

• the combined company is expected to have an expanded client-facing team that will permit it to deepen client relationships and increase growth opportunities across a wider range of investment
products and geographies; 

• the combined company will have a more diversified revenue mix across products, geographies and clients giving it a greater ability to maintain revenue levels and profitability across market
cycles than Janus on a standalone basis; 

• the risks and uncertainties associated with maintaining Janus's existence as an independent company including continued downward pressure on investment management fees and operating
margins faced by active investment managers such as Janus and the challenges that Janus would face in executing on its stand-alone strategic plan; 

• the likelihood that, in the view of the Janus board, conducting a private or public "auction" process of Janus would pose substantial risks to Janus, including being disruptive to client and
employee retention; 

• the belief that, based on the prior successful acquisition track record of the management teams of Janus and Henderson, the combined management teams will be able to successfully integrate the
two companies; 

• after integration the combined company is expected to achieve at least $110 million of recurring annual run rate pre-tax net cost synergies with the ambition of generating approximately 2-
3 percentage points of additional AUM growth from net new money following integration; see "—Certain Estimated Synergies";

• the merger is expected to be double-digit percentage accretive to each company's consensus earnings per share (excluding one-off costs) in the first 12 months following closing; 

• the merger is expected to provide increased distribution strength and coverage in key markets, including the U.S., Europe, Australia, Japan and the U.K., as well as a growing presence in the
Asia-Pacific region, the Middle East and Latin America; 

• the merger is expected to create additional revenue growth opportunities for the combined company through leveraging both companies' brand and distribution strength to cross-sell an expanded
product range across the respective core geographies and customer bases of Janus and Henderson. In large part, this is due to the highly complementary geographic footprints of the two
businesses. For example: 

• in the U.S., where Janus's approximately $149 billion of AUM is significantly larger than Henderson's U.S. business of approximately $18 billion of AUM as at December 31, 2016; 

• in Japan, where Janus currently has approximately $17 billion of AUM having benefited from the strategic relationship with Dai-ichi, compared to Henderson which has less than
$1 billion of AUM as at December 31, 2016; 

• in the U.K., where Henderson has approximately $64 billion of AUM and Janus has $3 billion of AUM as at December 31, 2016; and 

• in Europe and Latin America, where Henderson has approximately $27 billion of AUM, compared to Janus which has less than $7 billion of AUM as at December 31, 2016; 

• that Janus's strong fund management and distribution teams complement Henderson's teams in the U.S., that Henderson's strong Europe teams complement Janus's teams in Europe and that
Janus's alliance in Japan with Dai-ichi can be further leveraged to benefit the combined company; 

• the expectation that the combined company would follow a progressive dividend policy, increasing the dividend broadly in line with adjusted operating income growth over the medium term and
with a payout ratio consistent with Henderson's current practice; and 

• the commitment of Dai-ichi, Janus's largest stockholder, to supporting the merger and extending its strategic partnership with the combined group, as more fully described under the section
entitled "Dai-ichi Agreements" beginning on page 167 of this proxy statement/prospectus, which is expected to be highly beneficial to the ongoing business of the combined company, especially
in Japan and other parts of Asia.

        These beliefs are based in part on the following factors considered by the Janus board:

• its knowledge of Janus's business, operations, assets under management, financial condition, earnings and prospects; 

• information and discussions with Janus's management, in consultation with Loeb Spencer House, regarding Henderson business, operations, financial condition, earnings, strategy and future
prospects, and the results of Janus's due diligence review of Henderson; 

• the current and prospective business, economic and market conditions in the global asset management industry; 

• the projected financial performance of Janus as a stand-alone company (relative to the projected financial performance of Janus Henderson) and the fit of the transaction with Janus's previously
established strategic goals; 

• the recommendation of Janus's senior management in favor of the merger;

circumstances and the inability of Henderson to terminate the merger agreement in connection with a change of recommendation by the Henderson board;

• the Janus board's right to withhold, withdraw or change its recommendation to Janus stockholders to vote "FOR" the Janus merger proposal if a superior proposal is available, subject to Janus
being obligated to pay Henderson a termination fee of $34,000,000 in the event Henderson terminates the merger agreement prior to the Janus stockholders' vote on the Janus merger proposal or
in certain other circumstances in which Janus enters into an alternative transaction agreement within 12 months after termination of the merger agreement; and

Henderson permitted dividend proposal and the ability of Janus to terminate the merger agreement prior to the Henderson stockholders' meeting and collect a termination fee of $34,000,000 if
such a change of recommendation occurs.

        The Janus board weighed these advantages and opportunities against a number of risks and potential negative factors concerning the merger agreement and the merger, including:

• the terms of the merger agreement do not include termination rights for Janus triggered in the event of a decrease in the value of Henderson relative to the value of Janus; 

• the challenges inherent in the combination of two companies of the size, geographical diversity and scope of Janus and Henderson, including the risk that integration costs may be greater than
anticipated and the possible diversion of management attention for an extended period of time; 

• the challenges of developing and executing a successful strategy and business plan for Janus Henderson, including the risk of not capturing all the anticipated synergies between Janus and
Henderson and the risk that other anticipated benefits of the merger might not be realized;

• the fact that Janus engaged in negotiations solely with Henderson regarding a potential transaction rather than conducting a private or public "auction" process of Janus; 

• the fact that Janus will need to seek consents from clients in connection with the merger, including the potential resulting disruptions to Janus's business and relationships and potential resulting
loss of clients; 

• the restrictions in the merger agreement on Janus's ability to respond to and negotiate certain alternative transaction proposals from third parties, the requirement that Janus pay Henderson a
$34,000,000 termination fee if the merger agreement is terminated under certain circumstances and the inability of Janus to terminate the merger agreement in connection with a change of
recommendation by the Janus board, and the risk that such restrictions and termination fee may discourage third parties that might otherwise have an interest in a business combination with, or
acquisition of, Janus from making alternative proposals; 

• the fact that the merger agreement does not preclude Henderson from responding to and negotiating certain unsolicited alternative transaction proposals from third parties made prior to the time
Henderson stockholders adopt the merger agreement;

        The foregoing discussion of the factors considered by the Janus board is not intended to be exhaustive, but rather includes the principal factors considered by the Janus board. In view of the wide variety of
factors considered in connection with its evaluation of the merger and the complexity of these matters, the Janus board did not find it useful and did not attempt to quantify or assign any relative or specific
weights to the various factors that it considered in reaching its determination to approve the merger agreement and to make its recommendations to Janus stockholders. In addition, individual members of the
Janus board may have given differing weights to different factors. The Janus board conducted an overall review of the factors described above, including thorough discussions with Janus management and
outside legal and financial advisors.

        The Janus board concluded that the uncertainties, risks and potentially negative factors relevant to the transaction were outweighed by the potential benefits that it expected Janus and the Janus stockholders
would achieve as a result of the transaction.

        In considering the recommendation of the Janus board to approve the Janus merger proposal, Janus stockholders should be aware that Janus directors may have interests in the merger that are different
from, or in addition to, those of Janus stockholders generally. For additional information, see the section entitled "—Interests of Janus Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger" beginning on page 122 of
this proxy statement/prospectus.

        The foregoing discussion is based on assumptions regarding the cost synergies and revenue growth opportunities Janus expects to achieve following the merger. However, these expected cost synergies and
revenue growth opportunities may not develop. There can be no assurance that Janus will be able to successfully implement the strategic or operational initiatives that are intended. The explanation of the
reasoning of the Janus board and certain information presented in this section are forward-looking in nature and, therefore, the information should be read in light of the factors discussed in the section entitled
"Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" beginning on page 49 of this proxy statement/prospectus.

Henderson's Reasons for the Merger 

Strategic Considerations.

        The Henderson board considers that the merger is expected to provide a number of significant strategic opportunities and outcomes, including the following:

• Janus and Henderson have highly complementary businesses which share client-centric and collaborative cultures, well-matched investment capabilities and a focus on active management; 

• the merger is expected to combine the talent pools of both organizations to build a strong global team with enhanced capabilities to innovate on behalf of clients and to create a leading
independent active asset manager with a globally relevant brand, footprint, investment proposition and client service capability; 

• the combination of Janus and Henderson would give the combined company enhanced scale, diversity of products and investment strategies and increased depth and breadth in global
distribution, better positioning it to provide world-class client service, gain additional market share and further enhance shareholder value; 

• after integration the combined company is expected to achieve at least $110 million of recurring annual run rate pre-tax net cost synergies (see "—Certain Estimated Synergies"), with the
ambition of generating approximately 2-3 percentage points of additional AUM growth from net new money from leveraging both companies' brand strength to cross-sell an expanded product
range across the respective core geographies and customer bases of Henderson and Janus;

• the merger is expected to be double-digit percentage accretive to each company's consensus earnings per share (excluding one-off costs) in the first 12 months following closing; 

• the combined company's increased scale is expected to provide it with greater financial stability through market cycles; 

• the combined company is expected to continue to follow a progressive dividend policy, increasing the dividend broadly in-line with growth in adjusted operating income over the medium term
and with a pay-out ratio consistent with Henderson's past practice; 

• the merger will provide increased distribution strength and coverage in key markets, including the U.S., Europe, Australia, Japan and the U.K., as well as a growing presence in the Asia-Pacific
region, the Middle East and Latin America; 

• the merger is expected to create additional revenue growth opportunities for the combined company through leveraging both companies' brand and distribution strength to cross-sell an expanded
product range across the respective core geographies and customer bases of Henderson and Janus. In large part, this is due to the highly complementary geographic footprints of the two
businesses. For example: 

• in the U.S., where Janus's approximately $149 billion of AUM is significantly larger than Henderson's U.S. business of approximately $18 billion of AUM as at December 31, 2016; 

• in Japan, where Janus currently has approximately $17 billion of AUM having benefited from the strategic relationship with Dai-ichi, compared to Henderson which has less than
$1 billion of AUM as at December 31, 2016; 

• in the U.K., where Henderson has approximately $64 billion of AUM and Janus has $3 billion of AUM as at December 31, 2016; and 

• in Europe and Latin America, where Henderson has approximately $27 billion of AUM, compared to Janus which has less than $7 billion of AUM as at December 31, 2016; and 

• that Janus's strong fund management and distribution teams complement Henderson's teams in the U.S., that Henderson's strong Europe teams complement Janus's teams in Europe and that
Janus's alliance in Japan with Dai-ichi can be further leveraged to benefit the combined company.

Other Factors Considered by the Henderson Board.

        In addition to the strategic factors described above, the Henderson board considered the following additional factors:

• its knowledge of Henderson's business, operations, assets under management, financial condition, earnings and prospects and the results of Henderson's due diligence review of Janus which
involved a review and assessment of Janus's business, operations, assets under management, financial condition, earnings and prospects; 

• the current and prospective business climate in the asset management industry, in which rising industry-wide costs and global regulatory change favor firms with greater economies of scale and
financial flexibility, and encourage an increased focus on and substantial investment in technology and data management; 

• the alternatives reasonably available to Henderson, including remaining a stand-alone entity and pursuing other strategic alternatives and the Henderson board's belief that the merger with Janus
created the best available opportunity to maximize value for Henderson shareholders

given the potential risks, rewards and uncertainties associated with other strategic alternatives and without limiting strategic alternatives that Janus Henderson could pursue in the future;

• the projected financial performance of Henderson as a stand-alone company (relative to the projected financial performance of Janus Henderson) and the fit of the transaction with Henderson's
previously established strategic goals; 

• the recommendation of Henderson's senior management in favor of the merger; 

• the initial Janus Henderson board and each of its committees will be comprised of members nominated by Henderson and Janus in equal numbers; 

• Henderson will hold strong governance roles in the combined company: Mr. Andrew Formica will be a member of the Janus Henderson board of directors and will assume the role of co-Chief
Executive Officer of Janus Henderson, Mr. Richard D. Gillingwater will be a member of the Janus Henderson board and will assume the role of Chairman of the Janus Henderson board of
directors and Mr. Roger Thompson will assume the role of Chief Financial Officer of Janus Henderson; 

• the existing senior managers of Janus and Henderson leading the management and oversight of Janus Henderson following closing of the merger which provides continuity and allows an
experienced team to be drawn from both Henderson and Janus to work together to integrate the two companies; 

• the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, including the commitments by both Henderson and Janus to complete the merger; 

• the Henderson board's view, after consultation with its legal counsel, concerning the likelihood that regulatory approvals and clearances necessary to consummate the merger would be obtained; 

• the Henderson board's view, after consultation with its financial advisors, concerning the potential value creation and synergies of the merger; 

• the merger agreement provides for a fixed exchange ratio that is expected to result in Henderson shareholders and Janus stockholders owning approximately 57% and 43%, respectively of Janus
Henderson immediately following the effective time, calculated based on Janus's and Henderson's respective shares outstanding as of the signing date excluding any dilutative instruments issued
to Dai-ichi in connection with the merger, and that no adjustment will be made in the merger consideration to be received by Janus's stockholders in the merger as a result of possible increases or
decreases in the trading price of the Henderson ordinary shares following the announcement of the merger; 

• because holders of the issued and outstanding Henderson ordinary shares as of immediately prior to the merger would hold approximately 57% of the issued and outstanding shares of Janus
Henderson immediately after closing of the merger excluding any dilutative instruments issued to Dai-ichi in connection with the merger, Henderson shareholders would have the opportunity to
participate in the future performance of the combined company, including the anticipated synergies; 

• the merger condition that the boards of trustees and shareholders of Janus-advised U.S. mutual funds have approved new investment advisory agreements with Janus to take effect at the closing

• the anticipated client, employee and stakeholder reaction to the merger, which the Henderson board anticipated would be favorable based on the enhanced product and service offerings to be
achieved as a result of the merger; 

• the Henderson board's right to withhold, withdraw or change its recommendation to the Henderson shareholders to approve the merger if a superior proposal is available, subject to Henderson
being obligated to pay Janus a termination fee of $34,000,000 (which represents approximately 1% of Henderson's market capitalization as of the date of the merger agreement) in the event Janus
then terminates the merger agreement prior to the Henderson shareholders' vote on the merger or in certain other circumstances in which Henderson enters into an alternative transaction
agreement within 12 months after termination of the merger agreement; 

• the inability of Janus to terminate the merger agreement in connection with the Janus board withholding, withdrawing or changing its recommendation to the Janus stockholders to vote "FOR"
the Janus merger proposal, and the ability of Henderson to terminate the merger agreement prior to the Janus stockholders meeting and collect a termination fee of $34,000,000 if such change of
recommendation occurs; 

• Henderson having a track record of effectively executing and implementing complex transactions and both Janus and Henderson having a track record of successfully integrating acquired
businesses; 

• Dai-ichi will hold approximately 9% of the combined company and it intends to further invest in the combined company to increase its ownership interest to at least 15%; and 

• Dai-ichi confirming that it anticipates additional investments in the Janus Henderson product range, post-closing, of up to $500 million, which would bring its total committed invested assets in
Janus Henderson to $2.5 billion.

        The Henderson board weighed these advantages and opportunities against a number of other factors identified in its deliberations that weighed negatively against the merger, including:

• the challenges inherent in the merger of two businesses of the size, geographical diversity and scope of Henderson and Janus and the size of the companies relative to each other, including the
risk that integration costs may be greater than anticipated and the possible diversion of management attention for an extended period of time; 

• Janus's right, subject to certain conditions, to respond to and negotiate with respect to certain alternative proposals from third parties made prior to the time Janus stockholders adopt the merger
agreement; 

• the restrictions in the merger agreement on the conduct of each of Henderson's and Janus's respective businesses during the period between execution of the merger agreement and consummation
of the merger; 

• the risk that Henderson shareholders or Janus stockholders may object to and challenge the merger and take actions that may prevent or delay consummation of the merger, including to vote
down the proposals at the Henderson general meeting or Janus special meeting; 

• the risk that regulatory agencies may object to and challenge the merger or may impose terms and conditions in order to resolve those objections that adversely affect the financial results of Janus
Henderson; see the section entitled "—Regulatory Approvals" beginning on page 142; 

• the risk that the pendency of the merger for an extended period of time following announcement of the execution of the merger agreement, as well as the risk of an extended integration period
post-closing, could have an adverse impact on the business and financial performance of Henderson or Janus Henderson;

Henderson's businesses; 

• the risk that, despite the efforts of Henderson and Janus prior to consummation of the merger, Henderson and Janus may lose key personnel, including those who may have a number of retail and
institutional relationships, and certain employees of Janus with contracts that allow them to terminate their employment with Janus and receive payment if their roles or compensation are
materially reduced following the consummation of the merger, and the potential resulting negative effects on Henderson's and Janus's and ultimately, Janus Henderson's businesses; 

• the risk of not capturing all the anticipated cost synergies between Henderson and Janus and the risk that other anticipated benefits might not be realized; 

• the risk that Janus Henderson could be treated as a domestic corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes or that Janus Henderson or its affiliates could otherwise become subject to adverse
consequences under U.S. federal income tax laws; 

• the potential that the fixed exchange ratio under the merger agreement could result in Henderson delivering greater value to the Janus stockholders than had been anticipated by Henderson should
the value of the Henderson ordinary shares and Janus common stock vary disproportionately (relative to the exchange ratio) from the date of execution of the merger agreement; 

• the merger agreement prohibits each of Henderson and Janus from soliciting or engaging in discussions regarding alternative transactions during the pendency of the merger, subject to limited
exceptions; 

• the requirement that Henderson pay Janus a $34,000,000 termination fee if the merger agreement is terminated under certain circumstances as well as the inability of Henderson to terminate the
merger agreement in connection with a change of recommendation by the Henderson board, and the risk that such restrictions and termination fee may discourage third parties that might
otherwise have an interest in a business combination with, or acquisition of, Henderson from making alternative proposals; 

• the risk that changes in the regulatory landscape or new industry developments, including changes in consumer preferences, may adversely affect the business benefits anticipated to result from
the merger; 

• the risks associated with establishing Henderson's primary trading market in the U.S. on the NYSE for the first time; and 

• the risks of the type and nature described under "Risk Factors" beginning on page 50 and the matters described under "Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" beginning
on page 49.

        The foregoing discussion of the factors considered by the Henderson board is not exhaustive, but rather includes the principal factors considered by the Henderson board in connection with its deliberations
related to the merger. In view of the wide variety of factors considered in connection with its evaluation of the merger and the complexity of these matters, the Henderson board did not find it useful to, and did
not attempt to, quantify or assign any relative or specific weights to the various factors that it considered in reaching its determination to approve the merger agreement and to make its recommendations to
Henderson shareholders. In addition, individual members of the Henderson board may have given differing weights to different factors. The Henderson board conducted an overall review of the factors
described above, including thorough discussions with Henderson's management and outside legal and financial advisors.

        The foregoing discussion is based on assumptions regarding the cost synergies and revenue growth opportunities Henderson expects to achieve following the merger. However, these expected cost
synergies and revenue growth opportunities may not develop. There can be no assurance that Henderson will be able to successfully implement the strategic or operational initiatives that are intended. The
explanation of the reasoning of the Henderson board and certain information presented in this section are forward-looking in nature and, therefore, the information should be read in light of the factors discussed
in the section entitled "Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" beginning on page 49 of this proxy statement/prospectus.

Certain Estimated Synergies 

        As a result of the detailed and collaborative integration planning work undertaken since announcement of the merger, Henderson and Janus have been able both to further validate the initial cost synergy
estimate and identify areas with further potential for cost synergies. Accordingly, Henderson and Janus continue to believe that Janus Henderson will be able to achieve at least $110 million of recurring annual
run rate pre-tax net cost synergies, representing approximately 19% of Janus Henderson's underlying EBITDA (based on the EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2016 for each of Henderson
($275.3 million) and Janus ($310.9 million)).

        The work undertaken by the integration teams has led Henderson and Janus to believe that the delivery of these synergies will be accelerated, with significant elements of the cost synergy plan already in
progress. Janus Henderson is expected to realize approximately $80 million of net cost synergies by the end of the first 12 months following closing of the merger on a run rate basis, with the remainder
expected to be fully executed on a run rate basis within three years of closing.

        The announced cost synergies are expected to be realized as follows:

• More than half of the synergies are expected to arise from staff operating expenses in internal support functions and non-staff operating expenses, as follows: 

a. Staff operating expenses: synergies will arise from reducing combined headcount in internal support functions. These savings will arise from streamlining governance and management structures;
harmonization and rationalization of internal support functions such as finance, human resources, legal, risk, compliance, IT, and operations, among others; 

b. Non-staff operating expenses: consolidation of offices in overlapping locations; elimination of duplicative overheads; efficiencies in procurement spend; and leveraging potential operational
economies of scale; 

• Approximately one quarter of the synergies will arise from reducing combined headcount in investment management and trading functions. These savings will arise from removing duplication of
certain investment and research teams and leveraging potential economies of scale in trading activities; and 

• Approximately one fifth of the synergies will arise from reducing combined headcount in distribution and marketing functions. These savings will arise from rationalizing management structures;
removing duplication in centralized non-client facing roles; and consolidation of teams and staff in certain overlapping sales regions.

        It is estimated that the realization of these net cost synergies and other integration-related activities will result in non-recurring costs of up to $185 million, of which an estimated $125 million has already
been incurred or will be incurred by the end of the 2017 financial year and the balance within three years post closing of the merger.

Table of Contents

Basis of belief

        The analysis undertaken by Henderson and Janus in quantifying the potential synergies has been reviewed by external accountants and is informed by Henderson and Janus managements' industry
experience as well as their experience of executing and integrating past acquisitions. The analysis is based on the Henderson business and Janus business on a stand-alone basis and their detailed plans to
integrate the two businesses globally.

        The potential synergies have been calculated based on the latest available management information, consistent with that contained in Henderson's and Janus's financial information for the period ended
December 31, 2016.

        In arriving at the estimate and phasing of the potential synergies and non-recurring costs Henderson and Janus have made a number of key assumptions, including:

• The merger will complete in May 2017; 

• No significant impact on the underlying operations of Henderson or Janus or the ability for Janus Henderson to conduct business; 

• No material change in foreign exchange rates (with a pounds sterling / US Dollar exchange rate of 1.3 assumed for the duration of the integration); and 

• No material change to macro-economic, political, tax or legal conditions in the market or regions in which Henderson or Janus operate that materially impacts on the implementation, or costs to
achieve, the proposed synergies.

        The estimated cost synergies identified above reflect both the beneficial elements and relevant costs of achieving them. The estimated synergies are contingent on the merger being completed and the
expected benefits of the merger being realized. They assume that no restrictions, terms or other conditions will be imposed in connection with the receipt of any governmental, regulatory or other approvals or
consents necessary in connection with completion of the merger. The estimated synergies would not be achievable on a stand-alone basis.

        See the sections above titled "Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" beginning on page 49 of this proxy statement/prospectus and "Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Business
Combination—The combined company may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the merger" beginning on page 67 of this proxy statement/prospectus for further information regarding the uncertainties and
factors associated with realizing the synergies in connection with the merger.

Henderson Management Forecast 

        Henderson does not as a matter of course make public forecasts as to future performance, revenues, earnings or other results due to the unpredictability and uncertainty of the underlying assumptions and
estimates. However, in connection with the review of the merger, Henderson's management prepared and provided to Janus, certain illustrative non-public, unaudited internal financial information regarding
Henderson's future operations for the fiscal years ending December 31, 2016 through 2020. This unaudited illustrative financial information, which we refer to as the Henderson Management Forecast, was
prepared and provided in September 2016, treating Henderson on a stand-alone basis.

        The Henderson Management Forecast was not prepared for the purpose of public disclosure. However, a summary of the Henderson Management Forecast has been included below to provide Janus
stockholders access to this financial information that was furnished to Janus.

        The Henderson Management Forecast was prepared using IFRS accounting policies. The Henderson Management Forecast was not prepared in compliance with U.S. GAAP, the published

guidelines of the SEC regarding projections and forward-looking statements, the guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation and presentation of prospective
financial information, or the guidelines established by the International Accounting Standards Board for preparation and presentation of financial forecasts. In the view of Henderson management, it reflected
the best available estimates and judgments at the time the Henderson Management Forecast was prepared taking into account their inherent limitations. The inclusion of the Henderson Management Forecast
below is not an indication that Henderson or the Henderson board provided, or currently provides, any assurance that Henderson will achieve (or would have achieved on a standalone basis) the results reflected
in the Henderson Management Forecast. The summary of the Henderson Management Forecast is being included in this proxy statement/prospectus because this information was provided by Henderson to
Janus, as well as to Janus' financial advisor, for the purposes of considering and evaluating the merger and the merger agreement. The Henderson Management Forecast has been prepared by, and is the
responsibility of, Henderson's management. Neither Henderson's independent registered public accounting firm nor any other independent accountant has examined, compiled or performed any procedures with
respect to the Henderson Management Forecast, or expressed any opinion or any other form of assurance on such information or its achievability. The independent registered public accounting firm report issued
by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, London, United Kingdom (PwC) included in this proxy statement/prospectus relates to Henderson's historical financial information. It does not extend to the Henderson
Management Forecast and should not be read to do so.

        The Henderson Management Forecast is subjective in many respects and, as a result, subject to interpretation. The Henderson Management Forecast was based on numerous variables and assumptions that
are inherently uncertain and may be beyond the control of Henderson's management. Important factors that may affect actual results and cause the Henderson Management Forecast to not be achieved include,
but are not limited to, risks and uncertainties relating to Henderson's business (including its ability to achieve strategic goals, objectives and targets over applicable periods), industry performance, general
business and economic conditions, and the other factors described under "Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" beginning on page 49 of this proxy statement/prospectus. See also
"Where you Can Find More Information" and "Risk Factors" beginning on pages 300 and 50, respectively, of this proxy statement/prospectus. The Henderson Management Forecast also reflects assumptions as
to certain business decisions that have been or will be subject to change. As a result, actual results are expected to differ materially from the Henderson Management Forecast. Accordingly, there can be no
assurance that the Henderson Management Forecast will be realized or that actual results will not be significantly lower or higher than estimated. Portions of the Henderson Management Forecast cover multiple
years. Such information also by its nature becomes less predictive with each successive year.

        The Henderson Management Forecast reflects various assumptions and estimates that Henderson management made in good faith for illustrative purposes at the time that the Henderson Management
Forecast was prepared, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond Henderson's control, including, without limitation:

• flat market growth within each of Equities, Fixed Income and Property from the end of July 2016 until the end of December 2016; 

• for the years 2017 through 2020: 6% annual market growth in Equities; 3% annual market growth in Fixed Income and 3% annual market growth in Property; 

• net outflows of £0.9 billion for 2016, with strong Institutional inflows from August-December 2016 partially offsetting outflows from January-June 2016; 

• an illustrative target for net inflows of £4.2 billion in 2017, increasing to net inflows of £9.6 billion in 2020;

• management fee margins based on exit rates as at June 30, 2016, plus margin attrition of one basis point per year, beginning in 2017, in Retail UK, OEICs & UT and Retail SICAVs; 

• with respect to fixed staff costs, 3% annual pay increases and 3% annual growth in headcount, in each case beginning in 2017; 

• non-staff costs increasing 5% per annum; and 

• foreign exchange rates remaining stable at July 31, 2016 levels.

        These assumptions are inherently uncertain, were made as of the time the prospective financial information was prepared, and will not be reflective of actual results, either now or in the future, in light of
changed circumstances, or other developments.

        The 2016 forecasts within the Henderson Management Forecasts have been superseded by actual results and the 2017-20 targets included in the Henderson Management Forecasts do not reflect the view of
the Henderson board of directors as of the date hereof as to the future financial performance targets of Henderson. Therefore they are no longer considered to be valid.

        In practice, a number of the assumptions above have already proved to be incorrect, some materially, as a result of various macroeconomic and other external factors (including foreign exchange
fluctuations) that have occurred since the date on which the Henderson Management Forecast was prepared.

        The Henderson Management Forecast was also prepared, without giving effect to, and as if Henderson never contemplated, the merger, including the impact of negotiating or executing the merger, the
expenses that may be incurred in connection with consummating the merger, the potential synergies that may be achieved by Janus Henderson as a result of the merger, the effect of any business or strategic
decision or action that has been or will be taken as a result of the merger agreement having been executed, or the effect of any business or strategic decisions or actions which would likely have been taken if the
merger agreement had not been executed but which were instead altered, accelerated, postponed or not taken in anticipation of the merger.

        None of Henderson, Janus or their respective affiliates, advisors, officers, directors or other representatives can provide any assurance that actual results will not differ from the Henderson Management
Forecast, and, except as required by applicable securities laws, none of them undertakes any obligation to update, or otherwise revise or reconcile, the Henderson Management Forecast to reflect circumstances
existing after the date such forward-looking information was generated or to reflect the occurrence of future events even in the event that any or all of the assumptions underlying the Henderson Management
Forecast are shown to be in error. Except as required by applicable securities laws, Henderson does not intend to make publicly available any update or other revision to the Henderson Management Forecast,
even in the event that any or all assumptions are shown to be in error. None of Henderson or its affiliates, advisors, officers, directors or representatives has made or makes any representation regarding
Henderson's ultimate performance compared to the information contained in the Henderson Management Forecast or that forecast results will be achieved. Henderson has made no representation to Janus, in the
merger agreement or otherwise, concerning the Henderson Management Forecast. The Henderson Management Forecast does not take into account any circumstances or events occurring after the date that they
were prepared. The inclusion of this information should not be regarded as an indication that the Henderson board of directors, Henderson, or any other recipient of this information considered, or now
considers, the Henderson Management Forecast to be material information of Henderson.

Opinion of Janus's Financial Advisor 

Loeb Spencer House

        Janus has retained Loeb Spencer House to act as Janus's financial advisor in connection with the merger. Loeb Spencer House Partners was formed in 2015 as a strategic alliance between Loeb Partners
Corporation in New York and Spencer House Partners LLP in London to advise financial institutions globally, with a focus on asset management and wealth management. Janus selected Loeb Spencer House to
act as Janus's financial advisor in connection with the merger on the basis of the experience of Loeb Spencer House's professionals in transactions similar to the merger and the reputation of those professionals
in the investment banking community.

        On October 1, 2016, at a meeting of the board of directors of Janus held to evaluate the merger, Loeb Spencer House rendered its oral opinion to the Janus board, which was confirmed by delivery of a
written opinion dated October 1, 2016, that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth therein, the exchange ratio set forth in the merger agreement was fair from a
financial point of view to holders of shares of Janus common stock (other than Janus or any wholly-owned subsidiary of Janus or Henderson and its affiliates).

        The full text of the written opinion of Loeb Spencer House, dated October 1, 2016, which sets forth assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken in
connection with the opinion, is attached as Annex C. The following summary of Loeb Spencer House's opinion is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the opinion. Loeb Spencer House
provided its opinion for the benefit of the Janus board (in its capacity as such) in connection with its evaluation of the consideration to be paid to holders of shares of Janus common stock in the merger from a
financial point of view. Loeb Spencer House's opinion did not address the relative merits of the merger compared to any other transaction or business strategy in which Janus might engage or the merits of the
underlying decision by Janus to pursue the merger. The Loeb Spencer House opinion is not intended to be and does not constitute a recommendation as to how any holder of shares of Janus common stock
should vote with respect to the merger or any other matter.

        In connection with rendering the opinion described above and performing its related financial analyses, Loeb Spencer House:

• reviewed the financial terms and conditions of a draft, dated September 30, 2016, of the merger agreement; 

• reviewed certain publicly available historical business and financial information relating to Janus and Henderson;

Table of Contents

• reviewed various internal forward-looking financial data, synergy analyses and other data provided to it by the management of Janus relating to the business of Janus; 

• reviewed various internal forward-looking financial data and other data provided to it by the management of Henderson relating to the business of Henderson; 

• reviewed publicly available research reports regarding the business and prospects of Janus and Henderson; 

• held discussions with members of the senior management of Janus and Henderson with respect to the business and prospects of Janus and Henderson, respectively; 

• reviewed public information with respect to certain other companies in lines of business Loeb Spencer House believed to be generally relevant in evaluating the business of Janus and Henderson;

• reviewed historical stock prices and trading volumes of Janus common stock and Henderson ordinary shares; and 

• conducted such other financial studies, analyses and investigations as Loeb Spencer House deemed appropriate.

        For purposes of its opinion, Loeb Spencer House assumed and relied upon the accuracy and completeness of information that was publicly available or supplied or otherwise made available to it by Janus
or Henderson without independent verification of such information, and assumed no liability therefor. Loeb Spencer House did not conduct any independent valuation or appraisal of any of the assets or
liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of Janus or Henderson or concerning the solvency of Janus or Henderson under any applicable laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters, and it was not
furnished with any such valuation or appraisal, nor did it make any physical inspection of the properties or assets of Janus or Henderson. With respect to the projected financial and operating data and synergy
analyses relating to Janus and Henderson, Loeb Spencer House assumed that such data and analyses had been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and good faith
judgments of the respective managements of Janus and Henderson as to the future financial performance of Janus and Henderson, as applicable, under the assumptions stated therein. Loeb Spencer House
expressed no view as to any projected financial and operating data or synergies or any judgments, estimates or assumptions on which they were based. Loeb Spencer House relied at the Janus board's direction,
without independent verification, upon the assessments of the management of Janus and Henderson as to the future financial and operating performance of Janus and Henderson, and assumed that Janus and
Henderson would realize the benefits that each expected to realize from the merger.

        Loeb Spencer House's opinion was necessarily based on economic, legal, monetary, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to it as of, the date of its opinion. Loeb
Spencer House's opinion noted that circumstances or events occurring after the date of its opinion may affect its opinion, and it assumed no responsibility for updating or revising its opinion based on
circumstances or events occurring after the date of its opinion. Loeb Spencer House did not express any opinion as to what the price of the Henderson ordinary shares actually will be when issued in the merger
or as to the prices at which shares of Janus common stock or Henderson ordinary shares may trade at any time subsequent to the announcement of the merger. Loeb Spencer House was not authorized by the
Janus board to solicit, and did not solicit, indications of interest in a possible transaction with Janus from any third party.

        In rendering its opinion, Loeb Spencer House assumed, with the consent of the Janus board, that the merger would be consummated on the terms described in the merger agreement, without any waiver or
modification of any material terms or conditions. Representatives of Janus advised Loeb Spencer House, and Loeb Spencer House assumed that the merger agreement, when executed, would

conform to the draft reviewed by Loeb Spencer House in all material respects. Loeb Spencer House assumed that the representations and warranties made by Janus, Henderson and merger sub in the merger
agreement were and will be true and correct in all respects material to its opinion. Loeb Spencer House also assumed, with the consent of the Janus board, that obtaining the necessary governmental, regulatory
or third-party approvals and consents for the merger would not result in any delay, limitation, restriction or condition, including any divestiture requirements or amendments or modifications, that would have an
adverse effect on Janus, Henderson, the merger or the benefits of the merger to Janus, the holders of Janus common stock or Henderson. Loeb Spencer House's opinion noted that it is not a legal, tax or
regulatory advisor. Loeb Spencer House is a financial advisor only and relied upon, without independent verification, the assessment of Janus and its legal, tax and regulatory advisors with respect to legal, tax
and regulatory matters. Loeb Spencer House expressed no opinion as to any terms or other aspects (other than the exchange ratio to the extent expressly specified in its opinion) of the merger, including, without
limitation, the form or structure of the merger or any agreements or arrangements entered into in connection with, or contemplated by, the merger. Loeb Spencer House expressed no opinion as to the fairness of
any consideration paid in connection with the merger to the holders of any other class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of Janus. In addition, Loeb Spencer House expressed no view or opinion as to
the fairness of the amount or nature of, or any other matter relating to, the compensation to any officers, directors or employees of any parties to the merger agreement, or class of such persons, relative to the
exchange ratio or otherwise.

        The following is a summary of the material financial analyses delivered by Loeb Spencer House to the Janus board in connection with rendering the opinion described above. The following summary,
however, does not purport to be a complete description of the financial analyses performed by Loeb Spencer House, nor does the order of analyses described represent relative importance or weight given to
those analyses by Loeb Spencer House. Some of the summaries of the financial analyses include information presented in tabular format. The tables must be read together with the full text of each summary and
read alone, such tables do not constitute a complete description of Loeb Spencer House' financial analyses. Except as otherwise noted, the following quantitative information, to the extent that it is based on
market data, is based on market data as it existed on or before October 1, 2016 and is not necessarily indicative of current market conditions.

Relative Trading Analysis

        Loeb Spencer House reviewed the historical trading prices for the shares of Janus common stock and Henderson ordinary shares and calculated the implied daily exchange ratio for the (i) 30-day period,
(ii) 70-day period (from June 24, 2016, the day following the U.K. European Union membership referendum) and (iii) 12-month period, in each case ending September 30, 2016. Based on a comparison of the
low and high implied exchange ratios during the 30-day, 70-day and 12-month periods ending September 30, 2016, Loeb Spencer House derived a range of implied exchange ratios of Henderson ordinary shares
to one share of Janus common stock of 4.41 to 4.76, 4.41 to 5.34 and 2.94 to 5.34, respectively. The exchange ratio of 4.7190 Henderson ordinary shares (prior to adjustment for the share consolidation) to be
received for each share of Janus common stock, as provided for in the merger agreement, was within each of the foregoing ranges.

Market Comparables Analysis

        Loeb Spencer House reviewed and compared certain financial information for Janus to corresponding financial information, ratios and public market multiples for certain publicly held companies that
operate in, or are exposed to, businesses similar to those of Janus.

        Based on a comparison of the upper and lower limits of these reference ranges of implied value per share of Janus common stock and Henderson ordinary shares (converted to U.S. dollars at the FactSet
Research Systems exchange rate on September 30, 2016), Loeb Spencer House derived a range of implied exchange ratios of Henderson ordinary shares to shares of Janus common stock (1) utilizing the Janus
Management Forecast and the Henderson Management forecast of (i) 3.59 to 4.42 based on P/E multiples and (ii) 3.98 to 5.32 based on EBITDA multiples; and (2) utilizing consensus median estimates of
(i) 3.90 to 4.91 based on P/E multiples and (ii) 4.21 to 5.63 based on EBITDA multiples. The exchange ratio of 4.7190 Henderson ordinary shares to be received for each share of Janus common stock, as
provided for in the merger agreement, was within or above each of the foregoing ranges.

        Although the selected companies were used for comparison purposes, no business of any selected company is either identical or directly comparable to either Janus's or Henderson's business. Accordingly,
Loeb Spencer House's comparison of selected companies to Janus and Henderson and analysis of the results of such comparisons was not purely mathematical, but instead necessarily involved complex and
subjective considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and operating characteristics and other factors that could affect the relative values of the selected companies.

Discounted Cash Flow Analysis

Janus:

        Janus does not as a matter of course make public forecasts as to future performance, revenues, earnings or other results due to the unpredictability and uncertainty of the underlying assumptions and
estimates. However, in connection with the review of the merger, Janus's management prepared certain illustrative non-public, unaudited internal financial information regarding Janus's future operations. This
unaudited illustrative financial information, which we refer to as the Janus Management Forecast, was prepared and provided in September 2016, treating Janus on a stand-alone basis. The Janus Management
Forecast was not prepared for the purpose of public disclosure. The Janus Management Forecast was prepared using U.S. GAAP accounting policies. The Janus Management Forecast was not prepared with a
view toward public disclosure or with a view towards complying with the guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation and presentation of prospective
financial information, but in the view of Janus management, it reflected the best available estimates and judgments at the time the Janus Management Forecast was prepared taking into account their inherent
limitations. The inclusion of the Janus Management Forecast below is not an indication that Janus or the Janus board considered, or currently considers, such information to be a predictor of actual future results.
The summary of the Janus Management Forecast is being included in this proxy statement/prospectus because this information was provided by Janus to Janus's financial advisor, for the purposes of considering
and evaluating the merger and the merger agreement. Neither Janus's independent registered public accounting firm nor any other independent accountant has examined, compiled or performed any procedures
with respect to the accompanying financial information, or expressed any opinion or any other form of assurance on such information or its achievability and they assume no responsibility for and have
disclaimed any association with such information. The independent registered public accounting firm report issued by Deloitte & Touche LLP, Denver, Colorado, incorporated by reference in this proxy
statement/prospectus relates to Janus's historical financial information. It does not extend to the Janus Management Forecast and should not be read to do so.

        Loeb Spencer House conducted a discounted cash flow analysis for Janus based on the Janus Management Forecast by:

• calculating the present value as of September 30, 2016 of the estimated stand-alone unlevered free cash flows that Janus could generate for 2016 through 2020 using discount rates ranging from
10.0% to 12.0% based on estimates of the weighted average cost of capital of Janus; and 

• adding terminal values calculated (1) using a perpetual growth rate methodology, with perpetuity growth rates ranging from 3.0% to 4.0%; and (2) using a long-term earnings multiple
methodology, with the terminal value calculated as the average of (i) the terminal value calculated by applying a selected range of terminal value EBITDA multiples of 9.5x to 10.5x to the year
ending December 31, 2020 estimated EBITDA of Janus and (ii) the terminal value calculated by applying a selected range of the terminal value P/E multiples of 17.6x to 19.4x to the year ending
December 31, 2020 estimated net income of Janus; in each case, discounting the terminal values derived from the application of these methodologies to September 30, 2016, using discount rates
ranging from 10.0% to 12.0% based on estimates of the weighted average cost of capital of Janus.

        These analyses resulted in the following reference range of implied equity value per share of Janus common stock:

Henderson:

        Loeb Spencer House conducted a discounted cash flow analysis for Henderson based on the Henderson Management Forecast by:

• calculating the present value as of September 30, 2016 of the estimated stand-alone unlevered free cash flows that Henderson could generate for fiscal year 2016 through fiscal year 2020 using
discount rates ranging from 10.5% to 13.0% based on estimates of the weighted average cost of capital of Henderson; and 

• adding terminal values calculated (1) using a perpetual growth rate methodology, with perpetuity growth rates ranging from 3.0% to 4.0%; and (2) using a long-term earnings multiple
methodology, with the terminal value calculated as the average of (i) the terminal value calculated by applying a selected range of terminal value EBITDA multiples of 9.5x to 10.5x to the fiscal
year ending December 31, 2020 estimated EBITDA of Henderson and (ii) the terminal value calculated applying a selected range of the terminal value P/E multiples of 14.4x to 16.0x to the
fiscal year ending December 31, 2020 estimated net income of Henderson; in each case, discounting the terminal values derived from the application of these methodologies to September 30,
2016, using discount rates ranging from 10.5% to 13.0% based on estimates of the weighted average cost of capital of Henderson.

        These analyses resulted in the following reference range of implied equity value per share of Henderson ordinary shares:

        Based on comparing the upper and lower limits of these reference ranges of implied equity value per share of Janus common stock and Henderson ordinary shares (converted to U.S. dollars at the FactSet
Research Systems exchange rate on September 30, 2016), Loeb Spencer House derived a range of implied exchange ratios of Henderson ordinary shares to shares of Janus common stock of 4.51 to 4.55 using
the perpetuity growth rate methodology and 4.59 to 4.60 using the long-term earnings multiple methodology, as compared to the exchange ratio of 4.7190 Henderson ordinary shares to be received for each
share of Janus common stock as provided for in the merger agreement, which was above both such ranges.

Earnings Contribution Analysis

        Loeb Spencer House analyzed the implied earnings contribution of Janus and Henderson to the combined company using the Janus Management Forecast and Henderson Management Forecast,
respectively, of net income of Janus and Henderson for years 2017 through 2020 and the consensus median estimate of net income for Janus and Henderson for the years 2017 through 2018:

        From the implied earnings contribution, Loeb Spencer House derived a range of implied exchange ratios of Henderson ordinary shares to shares of Janus common stock of 4.48 to 4.85 based on the Janus
Management Forecast and the Henderson Management Forecast and 4.42 to 5.45 based on the consensus median estimates, as compared to the exchange ratio of 4.7190 Henderson ordinary shares to be
received for each share of Janus common stock as provided for in the merger agreement, which was within each of such ranges.

Other Factors

        Loeb Spencer House also observed certain additional factors that were not considered part of Loeb Spencer House's financial analyses with respect to its opinion but were provided to the board of directors
of Janus for informational purposes, including the following:

Illustrative Future Earnings Accretion for Janus Shareholders

        Loeb Spencer House performed an illustrative analysis of the potential future earnings accretion for Janus shareholders, using the Janus Management Forecast, the Henderson Management Forecast and
synergy estimates provided by Janus management. For each of the years 2017 through 2020 ending December 31, Loeb Spencer House compared the projected net income of Janus on a stand-alone basis to the
projected net income of the pro forma combined company, including estimated synergies, taking into account Janus shareholders' pro forma ownership of the combined company based upon the exchange ratio.
This analysis indicated the combination would be accretive to the holders of shares of

Illustrative Hypothetical Net Present Value Accretion

        Loeb Spencer House performed an illustrative analysis of the hypothetical net present value accretion for Janus shareholders, using the Janus Management Forecast, the Henderson Management Forecast
and synergy and transaction cost estimates provided by Janus management. For this analysis, Loeb Spencer House compared the stand-alone discounted cash flow valuation for Janus utilizing the perpetuity
growth terminal value method with the combined discounted cash flow valuation for each of Janus and Henderson, plus the discounted present value of synergies and minus the discounted present value of
transaction costs, taking into account Janus's shareholders pro forma ownership of the combined company based upon the exchange ratio. On a per share basis, the stand-alone discounted value per share ranging
from $12.71 to $19.22 compared to a range of $14.49 to $22.08 reflecting net cost synergies and a range of $15.55-$23.79 reflecting total net synergies.

        The implied present value of future prices per share of Janus common stock was reviewed for illustrative purposes only. The illustrative future prices per share of Janus common stock should not be viewed
as an accurate representation of what actual prices per share of Janus common stock will be. Actual prices per share of Janus common stock for any period may be greater or less than the illustrative future
prices per share of Janus common stock reviewed by Loeb Spencer House, and the differences may be material. Future share prices are inherently uncertain, being based upon numerous factors or events that are
not possible to predict.

Miscellaneous

        The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. Selecting portions of the analyses or of the summary set forth above,
without considering the analyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view of the processes underlying Loeb Spencer House's opinion. In arriving at its fairness determination, Loeb Spencer House considered
the results of all of its analyses and did not attribute any particular weight to any factor or analysis considered by it. Rather, Loeb Spencer House made its determination as to fairness on the basis of its
experience and professional judgment after considering the results of all of its analyses. No company or transaction used in the above analyses as a comparison is directly comparable to Janus or Henderson or
the contemplated combination.

        Loeb Spencer House prepared these analyses solely for purposes of Loeb Spencer House's providing its opinion to the Janus board as to the fairness from a financial point of view to the holders of shares of
Janus common stock (other than Janus or any wholly-owned subsidiary of Janus or Henderson and its affiliates) of the exchange ratio set forth in the merger agreement. These analyses do not purport to be
appraisals nor do they necessarily reflect the prices at which businesses or securities actually may be sold or traded. Analyses based upon forecasts of future results are not necessarily indicative of actual future
results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by these analyses. Because these analyses are inherently subject to uncertainty, being based upon numerous factors or events beyond the
control of the parties or their respective advisors, none of Janus, Henderson, Loeb Spencer House or any other person assumes responsibility if future results are materially different from those forecast.

        The exchange ratio was determined through arm's-length negotiations between Janus and Henderson and was approved by the Janus board. Loeb Spencer House provided advice to Janus during these
negotiations. Loeb Spencer House did not, however, recommend any specific exchange ratio to Janus or the Janus board or that any specific exchange ratio constituted the only appropriate

exchange ratio for the combination. The decision to enter into the merger agreement was solely that of Janus's board of directors.

        As described above, Loeb Spencer House's opinion to the Janus board was one of many factors taken into consideration by the Janus board in making its determination to approve the merger agreement and
should not be viewed as determinative of the views of Janus's board of directors or management with respect to the merger or the exchange ratio. The foregoing summary does not purport to be a complete
description of the analyses performed by Loeb Spencer House in connection with the fairness opinion and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the written opinion of Loeb Spencer House attached as
Annex C.

        Loeb Spencer House is acting as financial advisor to the Janus board in connection with the merger and will receive a fee for such services based on a percentage of the value of the consideration to be
received by the holders of Janus common stock which is expected to be up to approximately $9 million based on the trading price of Henderson ordinary shares at the close of business on September 30, 2016,
the last trading day prior the announcement of the transaction, and a fee of $750,000, which was payable upon its rendering of its opinion. In addition, Janus has agreed to reimburse Loeb Spencer House's
expenses and indemnify Loeb Spencer House and its affiliates and their respective directors, officers, members, employees, agents and controlling persons against certain liabilities arising out of its engagement,
including liabilities under federal securities laws.

        During the two year period prior to October 1, 2016, Loeb Spencer House did not provide financial advisory services to Janus or Henderson. Loeb Spencer House may provide financial or other services to
Janus or Henderson in the future and in connection with any such services it may receive compensation. In the ordinary course, Loeb Spencer House and its affiliates and employees may trade equity or debt
securities, for its or their own accounts or for the accounts of customers, of Janus, Henderson and certain of their respective affiliates and, accordingly, may at any time hold a long or short position in such
securities.

Interests of Janus Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger 

        Certain of the directors and executive officers of Janus negotiated the terms of the merger agreement, the Janus board approved the merger agreement and the Janus board recommended that Janus
stockholders vote in favor of the Janus merger proposal, the Janus compensation proposal, each of the amendment proposals and the Janus adjournment proposal. Janus directors and executive officers have
certain financial interests in the merger that may be different from, or in addition to, or in conflict with, those of Janus stockholders generally. These interests include the continued service of certain of Janus's
current directors and executive officers as directors and executive officers of Janus Henderson following consummation of the merger, as discussed in more detail below in "—Certain Governance Matters
Following the Merger" beginning on page 130, the treatment in the merger of Janus Options, Janus RSU Awards, Janus PSU Awards, Janus Restricted Share Awards, Janus MFU Awards, change-in-control and
severance agreements, certain deferred compensation payments and other rights held by Janus directors and executive officers, and the indemnification of former Janus directors and executive officers by Janus
Henderson.

        The Janus board was aware of and considered these potential interests, among other matters, in evaluating and negotiating the merger agreement, in determining that the merger agreement and the
transactions contemplated thereby were advisable and fair to and in the best interests of the Janus stockholders, and in recommending to you that you vote to approve the Janus merger proposal, the Janus
compensation proposal, each of the amendment proposals and the Janus adjournment proposal. Janus stockholders should be aware of these interests when they consider recommendations of the Janus board
that they vote in favor of the Janus merger proposal, the Janus compensation proposal, each of the amendment proposals and the Janus adjournment proposal.

Consideration Payable to Janus Directors and Executive Officers Pursuant to the Merger

        As a group, the Janus directors and executive officers beneficially owned an aggregate of approximately 2,558,593 shares of Janus common stock as of March 15, 2017 (not including any outstanding Janus
equity awards discussed below). If the Janus directors and executive officers continue to hold all of the shares of Janus common stock beneficially owned by them as of March 15, 2017, upon consummation of
the merger, and after adjustment for the share consolidation, the directors and executive officers would receive an aggregate of approximately 1,207,400 Janus Henderson ordinary shares. Dispositions of shares
of Janus common stock by Janus directors and officers, vesting of currently unvested Janus Restricted Share Awards and the exercise or settlement of other Janus equity awards, in each case prior to
consummation of the merger, will change the total amount of share consideration the Janus directors and executive officers will receive in respect of their shares of Janus common stock upon consummation of
the merger.

Treatment of Outstanding Equity Awards in the Merger

        Under the merger agreement, Janus equity awards outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, whether vested or unvested, including awards held by Janus directors and executive
officers, will be converted into corresponding Janus Henderson equity awards with respect to a number of Janus Henderson ordinary shares calculated using the exchange ratio, subject to adjustment to account
for the share consolidation, as more fully described in "—Description of the Merger Agreement—Merger Consideration" beginning on page 146. For converted options, the exercise price of such options will be
determined by dividing the per-share exercise price of the Janus options by the exchange ratio.

        Janus Restricted Share Awards held by Janus directors are subject to immediate vesting upon any voluntary separation from service, death, disability or change in control of Janus (including the
consummation of the merger), and Janus RSU Awards granted to directors in connection with the deferral of stock awards under the Janus Amended and Restated Director Deferred Fee Plan are paid out in
either a single payment or in installments upon any termination from service as a Janus director. Upon termination of a Janus executive officer's employment without cause or by the executive officer for "good
reason" (including a material diminution in duties, a reduction in compensation, or a relocation of the executive officer's principal place of employment), in either event within twenty-four months following a
change in control of Janus (including the consummation of the merger), the converted equity awards will become fully vested (to the extent not already vested).

        The following two tables set forth the number of shares of Janus common stock underlying outstanding Janus equity awards held by Janus directors and executive officers (based on target levels of
performance for Janus PSU Awards) as of March 10, 2017. The table also sets forth the value of these awards, assuming a price per share of Janus common stock of $14.71, the average per share closing price of
Janus common stock over the first five business days following the October 3, 2016 public announcement of the merger agreement.

Non-Employee Director Equity Awards

Executive Officer Equity Awards

Janus Mutual Fund Units

        Pursuant to the Amended and Restated Janus Capital Group Inc. Mutual Fund Share Investment Plan, Janus grants eligible employees (including Janus executive officers) long-term incentive awards in the
form of cash-based mutual fund units, which we refer to as Janus MFU Awards, that are subject to a four year ratable vesting schedule and credited with income, gains and losses based on the performance of
the Janus mutual fund investments selected by the recipient from a list of Janus-designated mutual funds.

        Janus MFU Awards are subject to accelerated vesting if there is a change in control of Janus (including the consummation of the merger) and within two years of the change in control, the recipient's
employment is terminated either by Janus without cause or by the recipient for "good reason" (including a material diminution in duties, a reduction in compensation, or a relocation of the recipient's principal
place of employment). Upon vesting, the recipient will receive the cash value of the Janus MFU Award adjusted for earnings or losses attributed to the mutual funds to which the award was indexed.

Change in Control and Severance Agreements

Change in Control Agreement with Richard Weil

        Janus is party to a change in control agreement with Mr. Weil providing for severance benefits in the event of a qualifying termination of employment following consummation of a "change in control"
(which includes the consummation of the merger). The change in control agreement provides that, if, within two years following a change in control, Mr. Weil's employment is terminated by Janus (other than
for cause or due to death or disability) or by Mr. Weil for "good reason" (as defined below), Janus will pay to Mr. Weil the following: (i) two times his cash compensation (including his target annual cash bonus)
in the calendar year immediately preceding his termination of employment (or, if higher, in the calendar year prior to the change in control), (ii) two times the value of Janus's contributions made on his behalf to
the Janus 401(k) and ESOP in the four calendar quarters prior to his termination of employment (or if higher, in the four calendar quarters prior to the change in control), (iii) continued medical, dental, and
vision insurance benefits for up to two years for him and his dependents, and (iv) outplacement services for three months. The change in control agreement does not provide for a gross-up payment arising from
any excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code, and payments under the change in control agreement will be reduced if such reduction results in a higher after-tax payment to the executive officer than if the full
amounts were paid.

        For purposes of Mr. Weil's change in control agreement, "good reason" means the occurrence of any one of the following events: (i) a material negative change in the nature or status of his responsibilities,
(ii) a material negative change in his aggregate target compensation or an adverse change to the compensation calculation methodology, (iii) a relocation of his principal place of employment to a location more
than forty miles from his current principal place of employment or a requirement to be based anywhere other than such principal place of employment that results in a material negative change to him, (iv) any
purported termination of his employment which did not comply with the applicable notice of termination requirements under the change in control agreement, or (v) a failure to assign his employment-related
agreements to a successor company. Pursuant to a letter agreement between Mr. Weil and Janus, dated September 29, 2016, Mr. Weil has agreed that the mutually agreed changes in his title, reporting
relationship, duties, responsibilities and principal place of employment described therein would not constitute "good reason" for purposes of any of Mr. Weil's change in control, employment, severance, long
term incentive or other agreements with Janus or its affiliates.

Change in Control Agreements with Jennifer J. McPeek and Enrique Chang

        Janus is party to change in control agreements with Ms. McPeek and Mr. Chang providing for severance benefits in the event of a qualifying termination of employment following the consummation of a
change in control of Janus (which includes the consummation of the merger). The change in control agreements provide that, if, within two years following a change in control, the executive officer's
employment is terminated by Janus (other than for cause or due to death or disability) or by the executive officer for "good reason" (as defined below), Janus will pay to the executive officer the following:
(i) one and a half times the sum of his or her base salary plus annual cash bonus earned with respect to the calendar year ending prior to the date of such termination and (ii) outplacement services for three
months. In addition, in the event the executive officer's employment is terminated for any reason within two years following a change in control, Janus will pay to the executive officer an amount equal to his or
her regular annual bonus compensation earned in respect of the calendar year ending prior to the date of such termination, pro-rated for the year of termination. The change in control agreement does not provide
for a gross-up payment arising from any excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code, and any payments under the change in control agreement will be reduced if such reduction results in a higher after-tax
payment to the executive officer than if the full amounts were paid.

        For purposes of these executive officers' change in control agreements, "good reason" means the occurrence of any one of the following events: (i) a material negative change in the nature, status or scope
of his or her responsibilities (other than specific changes agreed to in connection with the merger), (ii) a material negative change in his or her base salary, or (iii) the relocation of his or her principal place of
employment that results in an increase in his or her daily commute by more than 40 miles in one direction (other than as agreed to in connection with the merger, in the case of Mr. Chang).

        The following is an estimate of amounts that might become payable to Ms. McPeek and Mr. Chang under their change in control agreements, assuming that the merger was consummated on March 10,
2017 and that the executive officers experienced a qualifying termination of employment on such date:

Other Executive Officers

        Messrs. Koepfgen and Cheh are not parties to written change in control or severance agreements with Janus, and as a result, neither one is contractually entitled to a severance payment upon his termination
of employment with Janus.

Payments Pursuant to Janus Deferred Compensation Plans

Janus Income Deferral Program

        Amounts deferred by Janus executive officers under the Janus Amended and Restated Income Deferral Program will be distributed to participating Janus executive officers in a lump sum in connection with
the occurrence of a change in ownership of Janus (including the consummation of the merger), regardless of whether such executive officer remains employed at Janus Henderson following the consummation
of the merger. Ms. McPeek is the only Janus executive officer currently participating in the Income Deferral Program and will receive a cash lump sum payment equal to $312,867 in respect of her fully vested
account balance under such plan in connection with the consummation of the merger.

Janus Director Deferred Fee Plan

        Amounts deferred by Janus directors under the Janus Director Deferred Fee Plan will be distributed to participating Janus directors whose service terminates upon the consummation of the merger.
Mr. Fredericks currently participates in the Janus Director Deferred Fee Plan and will receive a payment equal to $388,302 in respect of his fully vested account balance under such plan in connection with his
termination of service on the Janus board following closing of the merger.

Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance of Janus Directors and Officers

        The merger agreement requires Janus Henderson to indemnify and hold harmless each individual who was as of the date of the merger agreement, or becomes prior to the effective time, a director or officer
of Janus or any of its subsidiaries and each person who was serving as a director or officer of another person at the request of Janus or any of its subsidiaries, each referred to as an indemnified party, to the same
extent as such indemnified parties were indemnified as of the date of the merger agreement pursuant to the organizational documents of Janus or any of its subsidiaries, and any indemnification agreements in
existence as of the date of the merger agreement.

        The merger agreement also requires Janus Henderson, for a period of six years following the effective time, to either cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of directors' and officers' liability
insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by Janus or any of its subsidiaries or provide substitute policies for not less than the existing coverage and having other terms not less favorable to the
insured persons with respect to claims arising from facts or events occurring on or before the effective date, except that in no event will the annual cost for maintaining such policies in any one policy year
exceed 300% of the annual premium payable by Janus for such insurance for the prior 12 months, referred to as the maximum amount. Janus may obtain a six-year "tail" policy under its existing directors and
officers insurance policy in lieu of the foregoing, for a cost not to exceed the maximum amount.

Merger Related Compensation 

        In accordance with Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K, the table below sets forth the estimated amounts of compensation that are based on or otherwise relate to the consummation of the merger and that may
become payable to Janus's named executive officers. These amounts are attributable to "double-trigger" arrangements and have been calculated assuming that (i) the merger was consummated on March 10,
2017 and (ii) each Janus named executive officer experienced a qualifying termination of employment as of such date.

        See the section above entitled "—Interests of Janus Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger" beginning on page 122 for further information about the compensation disclosed in the table below. The

actual amounts, if any, received by a Janus named executive officer may differ in material respects from the amounts set forth below.

Golden Parachute Compensation 

Interests of Henderson Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger 

        Members of the Henderson board and Henderson's executive officers may have interests in the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. These interests may create potential conflicts of interests.

        The Henderson board was aware that such potential interests might exist. However, the decision of the Henderson board to approve the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement was solely guided by the best interests of shareholders, employees and other stakeholders of Henderson.

        As of March 17, 2017, Henderson's board members and executive officers and their affiliates did not own any shares of Janus common stock.

agreement with each Janus named executive officer. 

(2) Represents the value of unvested Janus equity awards held by Janus named executive officers that become fully vested upon a qualifying termination of employment within two years following a change in control pursuant to the terms

stock over the first five business days following the first public announcement of the merger agreement. The value of the unvested PSU Awards held by Mr. Weil is calculated assuming performance at target levels. Upon a change in
control, PSU awards granted to Mr. Weil in 2014 will be converted into time-based awards based on actual achievement of the performance criteria as of (or approximate to) the effective time, subject to his continued employment
through the original vesting date, provided that upon a qualifying termination prior to such vesting date, such awards will become fully vested. Any PSU Awards granted after 2014 will remain subject to the achievement of the
applicable performance criteria following a change in control, provided that upon a qualifying termination prior to the vesting date, such awards will vest based upon achievement of the performance criteria as of the termination date.
The options held by Mr. Koepfgen are fully vested and will not be accelerated in connection with the consummation of the merger or a qualifying termination thereafter. 

(3) Represents, as applicable, the value of continued medical/dental/vision benefits for two years in the case of Mr. Weil ($53,262), and the value of outplacement assistance for three months in the case of Mr. Weil, Ms. McPeek, and Mr.

Table of Contents

        The material interests of certain members of the Henderson board and Henderson's executive officers are discussed in more detail below.

Employment Arrangements Following the Merger

        Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, the Janus Henderson board will be comprised of 12 directors. Six members of the Janus Henderson board will be current directors of Henderson, including
Andrew Formica, who will serve as a director and co-Chief Executive Officer, and Richard Gillingwater, who will serve as Chairman of the Janus Henderson board. The remaining six members of the Janus
Henderson board will be current directors of Janus. See "Corporate Governance Structure of Janus Henderson Following the Merger."

        In addition, certain current executive officers of Henderson will have positions as executive officers of Janus Henderson. Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, the executive committee of Janus
Henderson will consist of 10 members, including the following Henderson executive officers:

• Andrew Formica, Chief Executive of Henderson, will serve as co-Chief Executive Officer of Janus Henderson; 

• Phil Wagstaff, Henderson's Global Head of Distribution, will serve as Global Head of Distribution of Janus Henderson; 

• Rob Adams, Henderson's Executive Chairman Pan Asia, will serve as Head of Asia Pacific of Janus Henderson; 

• Roger Thompson, Henderson's Chief Financial Officer, will serve as the Chief Financial Officer of Janus Henderson; and 

• Jacqui Irvine, Henderson's General Counsel and Company Secretary, will serve as Group General Counsel and Company Secretary.

        See the section entitled "Corporate Governance Structure of Janus Henderson After the Merger" beginning on page 248 for further details.

Henderson Severance and Retention Programs

        The terms of the merger agreement permit Henderson to make severance payments up to an aggregate amount of $4 million and pay retention bonuses up to an aggregate amount of $11 million to such
employees of Henderson and its affiliates as determined by Henderson in its sole discretion. No executive director of Henderson has entered into an agreement entitling him to the payment of any severance or
retention amount pursuant to the foregoing discretionary authority.

Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance

        Currently, Henderson provides an indemnity to its directors, to the extent permitted by the Jersey Companies Law, as well as maintains insurance coverage against certain liabilities for all Henderson's
directors and officers. Following the merger, Henderson's directors and executive officers will be entitled to certain ongoing indemnification and coverage under directors' and officers' liability insurance policies
from Janus Henderson the scope of which will be generally similar to indemnification and insurance coverage provided to former Janus directors and officers under the merger agreement.

Other Compensation Arrangements

        Pursuant to the merger agreement, during the one year period following the closing date of the merger, Janus Henderson will be required to provide each employee who is employed by Henderson, Janus or
their subsidiaries prior to the effective time and who remains employed by Janus Henderson

thereafter with a base salary no less favorable than the base salary provided to such employee immediately prior to the effective time, incentive compensation opportunities that are substantially comparable in
the aggregate to those provided to such employee immediately prior to the effective time and other employee benefits that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to those provided to such employee
immediately prior to the effective time.

        Henderson is a party to employment agreements with its senior executive officers. The employment agreements do not provide for any enhanced payment in connection with or following the merger. In
addition, Henderson provides certain benefits, pension arrangements, Short-Term Incentive Plan, which we refer to as STI, and Long-Term Incentive Plan, which we refer to as LTIP, for its senior executive
officers. For further details, see "Corporate Governance Structure of Janus Henderson After the Merger" beginning on page 248. The merger will not constitute a change of control in Henderson for the purpose
of such arrangements. The closing of the merger will not accelerate the vesting or settlement of any outstanding awards or benefits, and all such arrangements will continue to operate in accordance with their
applicable terms other than that following the merger, the Compensation Committee of Janus Henderson will review performance targets applicable to outstanding awards to consider any adjustments that it
deems appropriate to reflect the performance of the combined company, provided that such adjustments will not be to the advantage of participants or more difficult to satisfy.

Certain Governance Matters Following the Merger 

        At the effective time of the merger, the Janus Henderson board will consist initially of 12 directors. Six of the 12 directors will be persons that are current directors of Henderson: Andrew Formica, the
current Chief Executive of Henderson, Richard Gillingwater, the current Chairman of Henderson, who will serve as Chairman of the Janus Henderson board, Sarah Arkle, Kalpana Desai, Kevin Dolan, and
Angela Seymour-Jackson. Six of the 12 directors will be persons that are current directors of Janus: Richard Weil, the current Chief Executive Officer of Janus, Glenn Schafer, the current Chairman of Janus,
who will serve as Deputy Chairman of the Janus Henderson board, Jeff Diermeier, Eugene Flood Jr., Larry Kochard and Tatsusaburo Yamamoto. Dai-ichi is entitled to nominate a director to the Janus
Henderson board pursuant to the terms of the amended investment and cooperation agreement. Mr. Yamamoto is the initial Dai-ichi Representative. Not less than four directors designated by each of Henderson
and Janus will be "independent" in accordance with the standards of the NYSE and the ASX Principles. See "—Corporate Governance Structure of Janus Henderson After the Merger—Directors of Janus
Henderson After the Merger."

        As of the effective time of the merger, Mr. Formica and Mr. Weil each will become co-Chief Executive Officer of Janus Henderson. Also at the effective time, the individuals set forth below will become
executive officers of Janus Henderson, serving in the respective offices set forth beside each individual's name below. The executive officers, together with the co-Chief Executive Officers, will constitute the
executive committee of Janus Henderson.

which are subject to change or differing interpretation, possibly with retroactive effect. This summary does not describe any U.S. state, local, or non-U.S. income or other tax consequences (including estate, gift
and Medicare contribution tax consequences) of the merger and of owning, holding and disposing of Janus Henderson ordinary shares.

        This discussion is not intended to be a complete analysis and does not address all potential tax consequences that may be relevant to you. Moreover, this discussion does not apply to you if you are subject
to special treatment under the Code, including because you are:

• a foreign person or entity; 

• a tax-exempt organization, financial institution, mutual fund, dealer or broker in a securities or insurance company; 

• a trader who elects to mark its securities to market for U.S. federal income tax purposes; 

• a person who holds shares of Janus common stock, or will hold Janus Henderson ordinary shares, as the case may be, as part of an integrated investment such as a straddle, hedge, constructive
sale, conversion transaction or other risk reduction transaction; 

• a person who holds shares of Janus common stock, or will hold Janus Henderson ordinary shares, as the case may be, in an individual retirement or other tax-deferred account; 

• a person whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar; 

• an individual who received shares of Janus common stock, or who acquires Janus Henderson ordinary shares, as the case may be, pursuant to the exercise of employee stock options or otherwise
as compensation or in connection with the performance of services;

• a partnership or other flow-through entity (including an S corporation or a limited liability company treated as a partnership or disregarded entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes) and
persons who hold an interest in such entities; or 

• a person subject to the alternative minimum tax.

        In addition, this discussion does not address the tax consequences to you if you will become a "five-percent transferee shareholder" of Janus Henderson within the meaning of the applicable Treasury
regulations under Section 367 of the Code. In general, a five-percent transferee shareholder is a person who holds shares of Janus common stock and will own directly, indirectly or constructively through
attribution rules, at least five percent of either the total voting power or total value of Janus Henderson ordinary shares immediately after the merger. If you believe you could become a five-percent transferee
shareholder of Janus Henderson, you should consult your tax advisor about the special rules and time-sensitive tax procedures, including the requirement to file a gain recognition agreement, which might apply
regarding your ability to obtain tax-free treatment in the merger.

        For purposes of this summary, a U.S. holder is a beneficial owner of Janus common stock and, after the effective time, Janus Henderson ordinary shares who is:

• an individual citizen or resident of the U.S.; 

• a corporation or other entity taxable as a corporation created in or organized under the laws of the U.S. or any political subdivision thereof; 

• an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income tax without regard to its source; or 

• a trust if a court within the U.S. is able to exercise primary supervision over its administration and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all of the substantial decisions of such
trust.

        If a partnership, or other entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, exchanges its shares of Janus common stock in the merger, the tax treatment of a partner in the
partnership will depend upon the status of that partner and the activities of the partnership. Partners in a partnership that intends to exchange its shares of Janus common stock in the merger are urged to consult
their tax advisors as to the particular U.S. federal income tax consequences applicable to them.

        You are urged to consult your tax advisor as to the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger, including the income tax consequences arising from your own facts and circumstances,
and as to any estate, gift, state, local or non-U.S. tax consequences arising out of the merger and the ownership and disposition of Janus Henderson ordinary shares.

U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders of the Merger, Including the Exchange of Janus Common Stock for Henderson Ordinary Shares

Application of Section 368 of the Code

        The following discussion regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger assumes that the merger will be consummated as described in the merger agreement and this proxy
statement/prospectus and that, following the effective time of the merger, Henderson will cause Janus to comply with certain reporting requirements set forth in Treasury Regulations under section 367 of the
Code.

Table of Contents

        The parties intend the merger to be treated as tax-free reorganization under section 368(a) of the Code. If the merger is so treated, and provided, as described below, that the fair market value of Henderson,
at the time of the merger, equals or exceeds the fair market value of Janus, as specially determined for purposes of section 367 of the Code, then the merger will have the following U.S. federal income tax
consequences:

• The exchange of Janus common stock for Henderson ordinary shares in the merger will not result in the recognition of any gain or loss with respect to your Janus stock (except with respect to
cash received in lieu of fractional shares, as discussed below). 

• If you have differing bases or holding periods in respect of your Janus common stock, you must determine the bases and holding periods in the Henderson ordinary shares received in the merger
separately for each identifiable block (that is, stock of the same class acquired at the same time for the same price) of Janus common stock you exchange. 

• The aggregate tax basis of any Henderson ordinary shares you receive in exchange for all of your Janus common stock in the merger, including fractional Henderson ordinary shares deemed
received and redeemed or sold, as discussed below, will be the same as the aggregate tax basis of your Janus common stock. 

• The holding period of any Henderson ordinary shares (including fractional Henderson ordinary shares deemed received and redeemed or sold as discussed below) you receive in the merger will
generally include the holding period of the Janus common stock you exchanged for such Henderson ordinary shares. 

• Because Henderson will not issue any fractional Henderson ordinary shares in the merger, if you exchange Janus common stock in the merger and would otherwise have received a fraction of a
Henderson ordinary share, you will receive cash. In such a case, you will be treated as having received a fractional share and having received such cash either (i) in redemption of the fractional
share or (ii) as consideration for the sale of such share. The amount of any capital gain or loss you recognize will equal the amount of cash received with respect to the fractional share less the
ratable portion of the tax basis of the Janus common stock surrendered that is allocated to the fractional share. Capital gain or loss will generally be long-term capital gain or loss if your holding
period in the Janus common stock is more than one year on the date of closing of the merger. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.

Application of Section 367 of the Code

        Section 367(a)(1) of the Code and the applicable Treasury regulations thereunder provide that where a U.S. shareholder exchanges stock in a U.S. corporation for stock in a non-U.S. corporation in a
transaction that would otherwise constitute a tax-free reorganization, the U.S. shareholder is required to recognize gain, but not loss, realized on such exchange unless certain requirements are met. In this case,
the principal requirement is that the fair market value of Henderson, at the time of the merger, must equal or exceed the fair market value of Janus, as specially determined for purposes of section 367 of the
Code. Although the parties intend that this requirement be satisfied, that determination cannot be known definitively until the closing date of the merger.

        Based on the exchange ratio, Janus has a lower value than Henderson. Nevertheless, section 367 requires certain adjustments to values to be made as of the closing date. For example, the fair market value
of Janus for purposes of this test must include the aggregate amount of certain prior distributions (including stock repurchases) by Janus during the 36 months prior to the closing of the merger, and the fair
market value of Henderson must not include certain passive assets acquired outside the ordinary course of business during the 36 months prior to the closing of the merger. Based on the exchange ratio, and
taking such section 367 adjustments into account, with data available as of March 9, 2017, Janus and Henderson believe that the fair market value of Henderson is larger than the fair market

value of Janus as of such date for these purposes, but no assurances may be given regarding the actual results on the closing date.

        If section 367(a)(1) of the Code were to apply to the merger, a U.S. holder of Janus common stock would recognize gain (but not loss) in an amount equal to the excess, if any, of the fair market value as of
the closing date of the merger of any Henderson ordinary shares received in the merger, plus cash received in lieu of fractional shares, over such U.S. holder's tax basis in the shares of Janus common stock
surrendered by the U.S. holder in the merger. Any gain so recognized would generally be long-term capital gain if the U.S. holder had held the Janus common stock for more than one year at the time the merger
is completed.

        If the merger qualifies as a tax-free reorganization but is subject to section 367(a)(1) of the Code, neither Janus, Henderson nor Janus Henderson would be subject to U.S. federal income taxation with
respect to the merger.

Failure to Qualify as a Reorganization

        If the IRS were successfully to challenge the qualification of the merger as a tax-free reorganization, you would generally be required to recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between your adjusted
tax basis in the Janus common stock you surrender in the merger and an amount equal to the fair market value, as of the effective time of the merger, of any Henderson ordinary shares received or to be received
in the merger, plus any cash received in lieu of fractional shares. Any gain or loss so recognized would be long-term capital gain if the U.S. holder had held the shares of Janus common stock for more than one
year at the closing date. Generally, in such event, your tax basis in the Henderson ordinary shares you received in the merger would equal their fair market value as of the date of the merger, and your holding
period for the Henderson ordinary shares would begin on the day after the merger.

        In addition, if the merger fails to qualify as a tax-free reorganization under section 368(a) of the Code, neither Janus, Henderson nor Janus Henderson would be subject to U.S. federal income taxation with
respect to the merger.

Tax Opinion

        Janus has requested that Skadden render its opinion to Janus, which will be dated on or after the closing date of the merger and be based on certain facts, representations, covenants, and assumptions, that
the merger should be treated as a tax-free reorganization under section 368(a) of the Code and that section 367(a)(1) should not apply to the merger. Whether such opinion can be given will depend on the facts
as of the closing date. The obligation of Janus and Henderson to consummate the merger, however, is not conditioned upon the receipt of such opinion from Skadden or any other counsel, nor have the parties
applied for a ruling from the IRS. In addition, if such opinion is rendered, no assurance can be provided that the IRS or a court will agree with the conclusions set forth therein.

Tax Consequences of the Merger to Janus

        Janus will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the merger; however, Janus (or any U.S. successor entity) will continue to be subject to U.S. federal income tax after the merger. Although not
expected, Janus (and its U.S. affiliates) may be subject to limitations on the utilization of certain tax attributes, as described below.

Tax Consequences of the Merger to Janus Henderson

        Following the acquisition of a U.S. corporation by a non-U.S. corporation, as described in more detail below, section 7874 of the Code (referred to as section 7874) can apply to cause a non-U.S.
corporation to be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes or can apply to

Table of Contents

limit the ability of the acquired U.S. corporation and its U.S. affiliates (each referred to as an expatriated entity) to utilize certain U.S. tax attributes.

        Section 7874 provides that if, following an acquisition of a U.S. corporation by a non-U.S. corporation, at least 80% of the acquiring non-U.S. corporation's stock (by vote or value) is considered to be held
by former shareholders of the U.S. corporation by reason of holding stock of such U.S. corporation (such percentage referred to as the "ownership percentage" and such test referred to as the "ownership test"),
and the "expanded affiliated group" which includes the acquiring non-U.S. corporation does not have substantial business activities in the country in which the acquiring non-U.S. corporation is created or
organized, then the non-U.S. corporation would be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes even though it is a corporation created and organized outside the U.S. This test is referred to
herein as the 80% test.

        If Janus Henderson were treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, it could be liable for substantial additional U.S. federal income tax on its operations and income following the
closing of the merger. Additionally, if Janus Henderson were treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, non-U.S. Janus Henderson shareholders would generally be subject to U.S.
withholding tax on the gross amount of any dividends paid by Janus Henderson to such shareholders.

        In addition, if the ownership percentage is equal to or greater than 60% but less than 80%, then section 7874 would generally impose a minimum level of tax on any "inversion gain" of an expatriated entity
after the acquisition. Generally, inversion gain is defined as (i) the income or gain recognized by reason of the transfer of property by an expatriated entity and related U.S. persons to a non-U.S. related person
during the 10-year period following the merger, and (ii) any income received or accrued during such period by reason of a license of any property by an expatriated entity and related U.S. persons to a non-U.S.
related person. In general, the effect of this provision is to deny the use of net operating losses, foreign tax credits or other tax attributes to offset the inversion gain. Further, certain Janus stock compensation
held directly or indirectly by management would be subject to an excise tax at a rate equal to 15%. In addition, under U.S. Treasury temporary regulations, Janus Henderson's ability to integrate certain non-U.S.
operations or to access cash earned by non-U.S. subsidiaries may be limited. This test is referred to herein as the 60% test.

        Based on currently available data, the parties do not expect section 7874, either the 60% test or the 80% test, to apply to the merger. Whether the ownership test has been satisfied, however, is determined
only after the closing of the merger. For example, for purposes of determining the ownership percentage of the former Janus stockholders, the former Janus stockholders will be deemed to own an amount of
Janus Henderson ordinary shares in respect of certain prior distributions (including stock repurchases) by Janus prior to the closing of the merger. Further, there is limited guidance regarding the application of
section 7874, and changes in law between the date of this proxy/prospectus and the closing of the merger could also alter this analysis.

        Janus has requested that Skadden render its opinion to Janus, which will be dated on or after the closing date of the merger and be based on certain facts, representations, covenants, and assumptions, that
the merger should not be subject to section 7874. Whether such opinion can be given will depend on the facts as of the closing date. Moreover, there can be no assurance that the IRS will agree with the position
that Janus Henderson is to be treated as a non-U.S. corporation or that Janus Henderson is not to be subject to the other adverse tax consequences associated with having an ownership fraction that is equal to or
greater than 60% but less than 80%. In addition, the receipt of such opinion from Skadden with respect to section 7874 is not a condition to the closing of the merger, nor have the parties applied for a ruling
from the IRS.

Table of Contents

        Regardless of the application of section 7874, Janus Henderson is expected to be treated as a U.K. resident company for U.K. tax purposes after the merger as a result of the central management and control
of Janus Henderson continuing to be exercised from the U.K.

        The remaining discussion assumes that Janus Henderson will not be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes under section 7874.

U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences for U.S. Holders of Holding Janus Henderson Ordinary Shares

Dividends

        Subject to the discussion below under "Passive Foreign Investment Company Considerations," any cash distributions paid on Janus Henderson ordinary shares out of its current or accumulated earnings and
profits, as determined under U.S. federal income tax principles, will generally be includible in the gross income of a U.S. holder as dividend income. Because Janus Henderson does not intend to determine its
earnings and profits on the basis of U.S. federal income tax principles, U.S. holders should expect that any distribution paid will generally be reported to them as a "dividend" for U.S. federal income tax
purposes.

        Subject to certain holding period requirements and other conditions (and assuming that Janus Henderson is not a passive foreign investment company for the taxable year in which the dividend is paid or
the preceding taxable year), dividends paid to certain non-corporate U.S. holders may qualify for the preferential rates of taxation if Janus Henderson is eligible for the benefits of the United States-United
Kingdom Tax Treaty or the ordinary shares are readily tradable on an established market in the U.S. Such dividends will not, however, be eligible for the dividends received deduction generally allowed to
corporate U.S. holders.

Sale or Other Disposition of Janus Henderson Ordinary Shares

        Subject to the discussion below under "Passive Foreign Investment Company Considerations," a U.S. holder will generally recognize capital gain or loss upon the sale or other disposition of Janus
Henderson ordinary shares in an amount equal to the difference between the amount realized upon the disposition and the holder's adjusted tax basis in such Janus Henderson ordinary shares. The ability to
deduct any loss may be subject to limitations. If you are an individual, capital gain or loss will generally be long-term if your holding period in the Janus Henderson ordinary shares is more than one year and
will generally be U.S. source gain or loss for U.S. foreign tax credit purposes.

Passive Foreign Investment Company Considerations

        A non-U.S. corporation, such as Janus Henderson, will be classified as a passive foreign investment company, or PFIC, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, if either (i) 75% or more of its gross income
consists of certain types of "passive" income or (ii) 50% or more of the fair market value of its assets (determined on the basis of a quarterly average) produce or are held for the production of passive income.
Henderson believes that it was not a PFIC for its taxable year prior to the merger, and Janus and Henderson do not expect Janus Henderson to be a PFIC for its first taxable year that includes the merger or in the
foreseeable future. Because PFIC status is a fact-intensive determination made on an annual basis and depends on the composition of Janus Henderson's assets and income at such time, however, no assurance
can be given that Henderson is not, and Janus Henderson will not become, classified as a PFIC. Furthermore, because the value of the gross assets of Janus Henderson is likely to be determined in large part by
reference to the market capitalization of Janus Henderson, a decline in the value of Janus Henderson's ordinary shares may result in Janus Henderson becoming a PFIC. There can also be no assurance that the
IRS will agree with any conclusion of the combined company that it is not treated as a PFIC.

136



8/28/2019 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1065865/000104746917001846/a2231435zdefm14a.htm

Table of Contents

        If Janus Henderson were classified as a PFIC for any year during which a U.S. holder holds Janus Henderson ordinary shares, Janus Henderson would generally continue to be treated as a PFIC for all
succeeding years during which such U.S. holder holds Janus Henderson ordinary shares.

        If Janus Henderson were classified as a PFIC for any taxable year during which a U.S. holder holds Janus Henderson ordinary shares, a U.S. holder would generally be subject to additional taxes equal to
interest charges generally applicable to underpayments of tax on certain distributions and sales, characterization of a portion of any gain from the sale or exchange of Janus Henderson ordinary shares as
ordinary income, and other disadvantageous tax treatment with respect to Janus Henderson ordinary shares. Negative consequences may also apply with respect to deemed dispositions of stock in any lower-tier
PFICs.

        A U.S. holder may be able to make a mark-to-market election to mitigate some of these adverse tax consequences. A qualified electing fund election, or QEF election, could also alleviate certain of the tax
consequences referred to above. It is, however, expected that the conditions necessary for making a QEF election will not apply in the case of the Janus Henderson ordinary shares, because Janus Henderson
may not make available the information necessary for U.S. holders to report income and certain losses in a manner consistent with the requirements for such elections.

        If you own Janus Henderson ordinary shares during any taxable year in which Janus Henderson is a PFIC, you may be subject to certain reporting obligations with respect to Janus Henderson ordinary
shares, including reporting on Internal Revenue Service Form 8621. A failure to file such form may result in penalties and may suspend the running of the statute of limitations on the tax return.

        Each U.S. holder is urged to consult its tax advisor concerning the U.S. federal income tax consequences of holding and disposing of Janus Henderson ordinary shares if Henderson is or Janus Henderson
becomes classified as a PFIC, including the possibility of making a mark-to-market or other election and the applicability of annual filing requirements.

Certain Reporting Requirements

        U.S. holders who hold at least five percent (by vote or value) of the outstanding Janus common stock immediately before the merger will be required to file a statement with their U.S. federal income tax
return, which statement must identify the parties to the reorganization, the date of the reorganization, and the fair market value, determined immediately before the exchange, of all the shares of Janus held by
such holder that are transferred in the merger, along with the holder's basis, determined immediately before the exchange, in such shares. In addition, U.S. holders are required to retain permanent records,
including information regarding the amount, basis, and fair market value of all transferred property.

        Certain U.S. holders may be required to report to the IRS information with respect to their investment in the ordinary shares not held through an account with certain financial institutions. U.S. holders who
fail to report required information could become subject to substantial penalties.

        U.S. holders are urged to consult with their own tax advisors regarding reporting requirements applicable to the merger and to the holding of Janus Henderson ordinary shares.

The Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act

        The U.S. has enacted rules, commonly referred to as FATCA, that generally impose a new reporting and withholding regime with respect to certain U.S. source payments (including dividends and interest),
gross proceeds from the disposition of property that can produce U.S. source interest and dividends, and certain payments made by entities that are classified as financial institutions under FATCA. The
governments of the U.K. and the U.S. have entered into an agreement with respect to the implementation of FATCA. Henderson is registered with the IRS as a compliant financial institution under this
agreement, and Janus Henderson also intends to register and comply with applicable rules

under FATCA and this agreement. Accordingly, it is not expected that Janus Henderson will be subject to withholding under FATCA on any payments it receives. Similarly, as currently drafted, it is not expected
that withholding under FATCA will apply to payments on the Janus Henderson ordinary shares. However, significant aspects of whether or how FATCA will apply to non-U.S. issuers like Janus Henderson
remain unclear, and no assurance can be given that withholding under FATCA will not become relevant with respect to payments on the ordinary shares in the future. Even if FATCA were to become relevant to
payments on the ordinary shares, it would not be applicable earlier than January 1, 2019. Investors should consult their own tax advisors regarding the potential impact of FATCA, including the agreement
relating to FATCA between the governments of the U.K. and the U.S., to an investment in the ordinary shares.

U.K. Tax Considerations

        The following statements are intended only as a general guide to those U.K., which we refer to as the U.K., tax considerations described below and do not purport to be a complete analysis of all potential
U.K. tax consequences of holding or disposing of Janus Henderson ordinary shares. They are based on current U.K. legislation and what is understood to be the current practice and interpretation of HM
Revenue and Customs as at the date of this proxy statement/prospectus, any of which may change, possibly with retroactive effect.

        The statements in this section apply only to holders of Janus Henderson ordinary shares who are resident in and, in the case of an individual, domiciled in (and only in) the U.K. for all tax purposes, which
we refer to as the U.K. tax resident (except insofar as express reference is made to the treatment of non-U.K. tax residents), who hold Janus Henderson ordinary shares as an investment (other than in an
individual savings account or self-invested pension plan) and who are the absolute beneficial owners of those shares and any dividends paid on them.

        The tax position of certain categories of Janus Henderson shareholders who are subject to special rules (such as persons who acquired (or are deemed to have acquired) their shares in connection with an
office or employment, persons subject to the remittance basis of taxation, dealers in securities, insurance companies and collective investment schemes) is not considered.

        The statements do not constitute legal or tax advice. Nothing in this section is intended to address any U.K. tax consequences of the merger between Janus and Henderson, including but not
limited to the disposal of Janus shares of common stock, for any Janus shareholders, whether U.K. tax resident or resident elsewhere. Janus Henderson shareholders or Janus shareholders who are
in any doubt about their taxation position or who may be subject to tax in a jurisdiction other than the U.K. should consult their own professional advisors.

Withholding tax on dividends

        Janus Henderson is not required to withhold U.K. tax at source from dividend payments made on the Janus Henderson ordinary shares, irrespective of the residence of the Janus Henderson shareholders or
their particular circumstances.

Taxation of dividends paid on the Janus Henderson ordinary shares

Janus Henderson shareholders—non-residents

        Janus Henderson shareholders who are not U.K. tax resident should not be subject to U.K. tax in respect of dividends paid on Janus Henderson ordinary shares unless such shareholders are carrying on a
trade, profession or vocation in the U.K. through a branch or agency (or, in the case of a corporate, a permanent establishment) in connection with which the Janus Henderson ordinary shares are used, held or
acquired. Such Janus Henderson shareholders may be subject to non-U.K. taxation on any gain under local law and should consult with their own professional advisors.

Table of Contents

Janus Henderson shareholders—individuals

        Janus Henderson shareholders who are U.K. tax resident individuals pay no income tax on the first £5,000 of dividend income (in aggregate) received in a U.K. tax year, which we refer to as the dividend
allowance. To the extent dividends received (in aggregate) exceed the dividend allowance in a U.K. tax year, the applicable rates of income tax for the tax year ending April 5, 2017 are: (i) 7.5%. for basic rate
taxpayers; (ii) 32.5%. for higher rate taxpayers; and (iii) 38.1%. for additional rate taxpayers.

        In determining whether and, if so, to what extent dividend income falls above or below the threshold for the higher rate of income tax or, as the case may be, the additional rate of income tax, the
shareholder's total taxable dividend income for the tax year in question (including the part subject to the dividend allowance) will be treated as the highest part of the shareholder's total income for income tax
purposes. In addition, dividends within the dividend allowance which would otherwise have fallen within the basic or higher rate bands will use up those bands respectively and so will be taken into account in
determining whether the threshold for higher rate or additional rate income tax is exceeded.

Janus Henderson shareholders—corporate entities

        Janus Henderson shareholders within the charge to U.K. corporation tax which are "small companies" (broadly, companies which employ fewer than 50 persons and whose annual turnover and/or annual
balance sheet total does not exceed EUR 10 million) will not generally be subject to U.K. corporation tax on dividends paid by Janus Henderson, subject to certain conditions.

        Other Janus Henderson shareholders within the charge to U.K. corporation tax will not be subject to U.K. corporation tax on dividends paid by Janus Henderson so long as the dividends fall within an
exempt class and certain conditions are met. For example, (i) dividends paid on shares that are not redeemable and do not carry any present or future preferential rights to dividends or to Janus Henderson's
assets on its winding up, and (ii) dividends paid to a person holding less than a 10% interest in Janus Henderson, should generally fall within an exempt class. These exemptions are not comprehensive and are
also subject to anti-avoidance rules.

        If the conditions for exemption are not met or cease to be satisfied, dividends received by Janus Henderson shareholders within the charge to U.K. corporation tax will be subject to U.K. corporation tax at
the prevailing rate (currently 20%).

Taxation of chargeable gains on disposal of Janus Henderson ordinary shares

        A disposal or deemed disposal of all or part of the Janus Henderson ordinary shares by a Janus Henderson shareholder may give rise to a capital gain or an allowable loss, subject to their circumstances and
any available exemptions or reliefs.

Janus Henderson shareholders—non-residents

        Janus Henderson shareholders who are not U.K. tax resident will not generally be subject to U.K. tax on capital gains realized on a disposal or deemed disposal of Janus Henderson ordinary shares unless
they are carrying on a trade, profession or vocation in the U.K. through a branch or agency (or, in the case of a corporate, a permanent establishment) in connection with which the Janus Henderson ordinary
shares are used, held or acquired. Such Janus Henderson shareholders may be subject to non-U.K. taxation on any gain under local law and should consult with their own professional advisors.

        A Janus Henderson shareholder who is an individual and has ceased to be a resident of the U.K. for tax purposes for a period of five years or less and who disposes or is deemed to dispose of all or part of
the Janus Henderson ordinary shares during that period may be subject to a U.K. tax liability on their return to the U.K., subject to any available exemptions or reliefs. Special rules may apply to shareholders
who are subject to tax on a "split-year" basis.

Janus Henderson shareholders—individuals

        Janus Henderson shareholders that are U.K. tax resident individuals will not incur a liability to pay capital gains tax in respect of a capital gain realized on the disposal or deemed disposal of the Janus
Henderson ordinary shares unless their total capital gains in the relevant U.K. tax year exceed the annual exemption, which is currently £11,100 for the tax year ending April 5, 2017.

        The rate of capital gains tax will depend on the Janus Henderson shareholder's total taxable income and gains in the relevant tax year. A Janus Henderson shareholder who is subject to income tax at a rate
not exceeding the basic rate will generally be subject to capital gains tax at 10%. of the gain (to the extent the annual exempt amount has been exceeded). A Janus Henderson shareholder who is subject to
income tax at either the higher rate or additional rate will generally be subject to capital gains tax at a rate of 20% of the gain (to the extent the annual exempt amount has been exceeded).

Janus Henderson shareholders—corporate entities

        Janus Henderson shareholders that are within the charge to U.K. corporation tax may be entitled to claim an indexation allowance to reduce a chargeable gain on the disposal or deemed disposal of the
Janus Henderson ordinary shares. Janus Henderson shareholders who realise a chargeable gain on the disposal or deemed disposal of the Janus Henderson ordinary shares will be subject to U.K. corporation tax
on that gain, currently at a rate of 20% subject to any available exemptions or reliefs.

U.K. Stamp Duty and SDRT

        The statements in this section regarding U.K. stamp duty and stamp duty reserve tax, which we refer to as SDRT, apply to Janus Henderson shareholders irrespective of their residence and are intended as a
general guide only. Special rules may apply to certain categories of persons, including intermediaries, brokers, dealers and persons connected with depositary receipt arrangements and clearance services.

        No U.K. stamp duty is chargeable on the issuance of Janus Henderson ordinary shares in respect of the transactions contemplated by this proxy statement/prospectus.

        U.K. stamp duty may in certain circumstances be required to be paid in respect of written instruments effecting the transfer on sale of Janus Henderson ordinary shares to the extent that the instrument is
executed in any part of the U.K. or relates to property situated or any matter or thing done or to be done in the U.K.

        No SDRT should be payable in respect of any agreement to transfer the Janus Henderson ordinary shares provided that the Janus Henderson ordinary shares are not registered and do not become registered
in a register kept in the U.K. by or on behalf of Janus Henderson. Janus Henderson has confirmed that it does not and does not intend to keep such a register in the U.K.

        No liability to U.K. stamp duty or SDRT will arise on the issue of CDIs to Janus Henderson shareholders. No U.K. Stamp Duty will be payable on transfers of CDIs, provided that there is no instrument of
transfer. No SDRT should be payable in respect of any agreement to transfer CDIs, provided that neither the CDIs nor the Janus Henderson ordinary shares are registered or become registered in a register kept
in the U.K. by or on behalf of Depositary Nominee or Janus Henderson. Janus Henderson currently does not intend that any register of CDIs or Janus Henderson ordinary shares will be kept in the U.K.

Jersey Tax Considerations

        The following summary of the anticipated tax treatment in Jersey of Janus Henderson and holders of Janus Henderson ordinary shares is based on Jersey taxation law and practice as they are understood to
apply at the date of this document. It does not constitute, nor should it be considered to be, legal or

tax advice and does not address all aspects of Jersey tax law and practice (including without limitation such tax law and practice as they apply to any land or building situated in Jersey, or as they apply to certain
types of person, such as persons holding or acquiring shares in the course of trade, collective investment schemes or insurance companies). Holders of Janus Henderson ordinary shares should consult their
professional advisors on the implications of acquiring, buying, holding, selling or otherwise disposing of Janus Henderson ordinary shares under the laws of any jurisdictions in which they may be liable to
taxation. Holders of Janus Henderson ordinary shares should be aware that tax rules and practice and their interpretation may change.

Taxation of Janus Henderson and of Non-Jersey Residents

        On the basis that Janus Henderson is neither a financial services company nor a utility company for the purposes of the Income Tax (Jersey) Law 1961, as amended, Janus Henderson is subject to income
tax in Jersey at a rate of zero per cent. On the basis that Janus Henderson is centrally managed and controlled, and is resident for tax purposes, in the U.K., Janus Henderson will not be liable to Jersey income
tax other than on Jersey source income (except where such income is exempted from income tax pursuant to the Income Tax (Jersey) Law 1961, as amended).

        Dividends on Janus Henderson ordinary shares may be paid by Janus Henderson without withholding or deduction for or on account of Jersey income tax and holders of Janus Henderson ordinary shares
(other than residents of Jersey) will not be subject to any tax in Jersey in respect of the holding, sale or other disposition of such shares. It is possible that the current tax regime applicable in Jersey may be
amended and Janus Henderson could become subject to taxation in Jersey. Please see below under the heading "Shareholders of a Jersey Company" in relation to the status of Jersey resident holders of Janus
Henderson ordinary shares.

Goods and Services Tax

        The States of Jersey introduced a Goods and Services Tax, which we refer to as GST, with effect from May 6, 2008. A company may opt out of the GST regime by applying to become an "international
services entity," which we refer to as ISE, as provided by the Goods and Services Tax (Jersey) Law 2007. ISE status is obtained upon meeting certain requirements and paying a prescribed annual fee. As an
ISE, a company is exempted both from registering for GST and from accounting for GST on supplies made and received in Jersey solely for the purpose of its business. It is anticipated that Janus Henderson
will maintain ISE status and the Janus Henderson board intends to conduct the business of the combined company such that no GST will be incurred by Janus Henderson.

Shareholders of a Jersey Company

        Any shareholders of a Jersey company who are resident for tax purposes in Jersey will incur income tax on any dividends paid on the shares held by them.

        No stamp duty is levied on the transfer inter vivos, exchange or repurchase of shares, but there is a stamp duty payable when Jersey grants of probate and letters of administration are required. In the case of
a grant of probate or letters of administration, stamp duty is levied according to the size of the estate (wherever situated in respect of a holder of shares who is domiciled in Jersey, or situated in Jersey in respect
of a holder of shares domiciled outside Jersey) and is payable on a sliding scale at a rate of up to 0.75% of such estate and such duty is capped at £100,000.

        Jersey does not otherwise levy taxes upon capital, inheritances, capital gains or gifts nor are there other estate duties.

Accounting Treatment 

        The merger will be accounted for as a business combination under U.S. GAAP (ASC 805, which we refer to as the Standard). The Standard requires as the first step in the application of acquisition
accounting for one of the combining entities to be identified as the acquirer (ASC 805-10-25-4). Henderson will be treated as the acquiring entity for accounting purposes. In identifying Henderson as the
acquiring entity for accounting purposes, Henderson took into account the voting rights of all equity instruments, the intended corporate governance structure of the combined company, and the size of each of
the companies. In assessing the size of each of the companies, Henderson evaluated various metrics, including, but not limited to: market capitalization, revenue, operating profit, assets and assets under
management. No single factor was the sole determinant in the overall conclusion that Henderson is the acquirer for accounting purposes, rather all factors were considered in arriving at such conclusion.

Regulatory Approvals 

U.S. Antitrust

        Under the HSR Act, the merger cannot be consummated until, among other things, notifications have been filed and certain information has been furnished to the FTC and the Antitrust Division, and
specified waiting period requirements have been satisfied. On October 27, 2016, Henderson and Janus filed their respective HSR Notifications with the FTC and the Antitrust Division. Early termination of the
waiting period was granted on November 23, 2016.

Other Regulatory Approvals

        The obligations of each of Janus and Henderson to effect the merger are also subject to obtaining other regulatory approvals in various jurisdictions in which Henderson and Janus operate their respective
business, including obtaining (i) approval from FINRA pursuant to NASD Rule 1017, (ii) the required approvals from the FCA for Henderson to acquire control of each subsidiary of Janus that is authorized by
the FCA pursuant to Section 189(4)(a) of FSMA, (iii) the approval by the JFSC of this proxy statement/prospectus, the registration statement of which this proxy statement/prospectus forms a part and any other
relevant document deemed to be a prospectus pursuant to the Jersey Companies Law, and the issue by the JFSC of any consent required pursuant to the Control of Borrowing (Jersey) Order 1958 for Henderson
to lawfully assume the Janus awards and plans, and (iv) consents, non-objections and/or approvals from the applicable governmental authorities in Canada, Hong Kong, Ireland, Singapore, Switzerland, and, if
applicable, Australia, India and Jersey and certain other non-U.S. jurisdictions, as well as obtaining approvals, consents and/or non-objections from the applicable governmental authorities in Jersey, Switzerland
and, if applicable, Ireland necessary in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Dai-ichi agreements.

Exchange of Shares in the Merger 

        After the effective time, there will be no further registration of transfers of shares of Janus common stock. Janus does not issue stock certificates evidencing common stock; Janus common stock is held in
uncertificated form which eliminates the physical handling and safekeeping responsibilities inherent in owning stock certificates and eliminates the need to return a duly executed stock certificate to effect a
transfer. From and after the effective time, each holder of a book-entry share representing shares of Janus common stock outstanding immediately prior to the effective time will no longer have any rights with
respect to such shares, except for the right to receive the merger consideration, or as otherwise provided in the merger agreement or by applicable laws. Each share of Janus common stock owned by Janus at the
effective time will be cancelled without any payment of merger consideration.

Table of Contents

        If you are a Janus stockholder, you will not be entitled to receive any dividends or other distributions with respect to Henderson ordinary shares until the merger is completed and you have surrendered your
book-entry shares for Janus common stock in exchange for whole Henderson ordinary shares and/or cash in lieu of fractional shares.

        If you would otherwise be entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Henderson ordinary shares as a result of the merger (after aggregating all fractional Henderson ordinary shares issuable to you), in lieu
of the fraction of a share and in connection with the exchange of your book-entry shares of Janus common stock you will be paid in cash, based on then prevailing market prices and in accordance with the terms
of the merger agreement.

        Each of Henderson, Janus as the surviving company and the exchange agent will be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to the merger agreement such
amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law.

Janus Stockholders

        Physical certificates representing Henderson ordinary shares will not be issued pursuant to the merger. Rather than issuing physical certificates for such shares to Janus stockholders, the exchange agent will
cause Janus Henderson ordinary shares to be credited in book-entry form to direct registered accounts maintained by Janus Henderson's transfer agent for the benefit of the respective holders (or, in the case of
shares tendered through DTC, to the account of DTC so that DTC can credit the relevant DTC participant and such participant can credit its respective account holders). Promptly following the crediting of
shares to your respective direct registered account, you will receive a statement from Janus Henderson's transfer agent evidencing your holdings, as well as general information on the book-entry form of
ownership.

Pre-Closing Dividends; Post-Closing Dividend Policy 

        Prior to the closing of the merger, Henderson intends to declare and pay a final cash dividend for the financial year ended December 31, 2016 of 7.30 pence per Henderson ordinary share. The payment of
the dividend is subject to approval by Henderson shareholders at the shareholder meeting to be held on April 26, 2017. If approved by Henderson shareholders, such dividend will be paid on May 19, 2017.

        Janus has declared and paid to Janus stockholders quarterly cash dividends of US$0.11 and US$0.11 per share of Janus common stock for the third and fourth quarter of 2016, respectively.

        In addition, each of the Henderson and Janus boards of directors also currently intends to declare and pay to Henderson shareholders or Janus stockholders, as applicable, prior to closing of the merger, an
interim dividend in respect of the first quarter of the financial year ending December 31, 2017. The Henderson and Janus boards will determine the amount of any such first quarter 2017 dividend following the
end of the first quarter of 2017.

        Janus Henderson is expected to continue to follow a progressive dividend policy, increasing the dividend broadly in-line with adjusted operating income growth over the medium term and with a pay-out
ratio consistent with Henderson's past practice. Following the closing of the merger, it is intended that Janus Henderson will declare and pay quarterly dividends beginning in the second quarter of 2017.

        However, the amount of dividends, if any, that are declared or paid to Janus Henderson shareholders in periods after closing of the merger cannot yet be determined and will depend on a number of factors.
The Janus Henderson board will have sole discretion to determine whether any interim dividends will be declared, the amount of any such interim dividend, the amount of any final dividend recommended to its
shareholders (which may be paid subject to the approval of Janus

Henderson shareholders by way of an ordinary resolution) and when any dividend will be paid. We expect that such determination would be based on a number of considerations, including, but not limited to,
Janus Henderson's results of operations, capital management plans, the market price of Janus Henderson ordinary shares, the combined company's access to capital markets, as well as legal requirements,
industry practice and other factors deemed relevant by the Janus Henderson board. There can be no assurance that Janus Henderson shareholders will receive or be entitled to dividends commensurate with the
historical dividends of Janus or Henderson. For a further discussion of the risks related to the payment of dividends after the merger, see "Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Merger" beginning on page 71.

Share Consolidation 

        Subject to approval by the Henderson shareholders at the Henderson shareholder meeting, upon the effectiveness of the Janus Henderson Amended Memorandum at the effective time of the merger, which
we refer to as the share consolidation effective time, the Henderson ordinary shares and CDIs outstanding immediately prior to the share consolidation effective time will be consolidated into a smaller number
of shares or CDIs, as applicable, such that a Henderson shareholder will own one Janus Henderson ordinary share (or one Janus Henderson CDI) for each 10 issued Henderson ordinary shares (or CDIs, as
applicable) held by that Henderson shareholder immediately prior to the share consolidation effective time.

        No fractional shares or CDIs will be issued in connection with the share consolidation. Fractional entitlements arising because a Henderson shareholder of record holds a number of pre-consolidation
Henderson ordinary shares not evenly divisible by 10 will be aggregated with the number of shares allocated to the CDI depositary in excess of the total number of shares to which CDI holders would have been
entitled had they been Henderson shareholders of record immediately prior to the share consolidation, and all such shares will be sold on the market for the best price reasonably obtainable. The net proceeds of
such sale, after the deduction of the expenses of the sale (including any fees in relation to currency conversions), will be paid in due proportion to the relevant Henderson shareholders of record or CDI holders
(as applicable), in the case of CDI holders, such that they are paid the amount that they would have received in respect of the sale of fractional shares had they been a Henderson shareholder of record
immediately prior to the share consolidation.

        The approval of the share consolidation by the Henderson shareholders at the Henderson shareholder meeting is inter-conditional with the approval of the merger, the Henderson share issuance proposal,
the Henderson amended articles proposal, the Henderson name change proposal and the Henderson LSE de-listing proposal, which means that for any of such matters to take effect, they must all be passed.

        As a result of the share consolidation, and in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement, the exchange ratio (being 4.7190 existing Henderson ordinary shares for each share of Janus common
stock) will be adjusted so that at closing of the merger each Janus stockholder will receive 0.4719 Janus Henderson ordinary shares for each share of Janus common stock.

        Janus stockholders will also be entitled to receive cash in lieu of any fractional entitlement to new Janus Henderson ordinary shares based on the then prevailing market price.

Listing of Henderson ordinary shares on NYSE 

        It is a condition to the closing of the merger that the Henderson ordinary shares issued pursuant to the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement be approved for listing on the NYSE, subject to
official notice of issuance. Henderson must use reasonable best efforts to obtain the listing and admission to trading of the Janus Henderson ordinary shares to be issued as merger consideration at or prior to the
effective time.

Delisting of Henderson Ordinary Shares from LSE 

        It is a condition to the closing of the merger that Henderson shareholders approve the cancellation of the listing of the Henderson ordinary shares on the premium segment of the Official List maintained by
the UKLA and of trading of such shares on the LSE's main market for listed securities.

        If such shareholder approval is not obtained and Henderson and Janus agree to waive the delisting condition described above, under the merger agreement, Henderson will be required to have its ordinary
shares re-admitted to the Official List and to trading on the LSE's main market for listed securities.

De-Listing from NYSE and Deregistration of Janus Common Stock 

        When the merger is completed, the Janus common stock listed on the NYSE will cease to be quoted on the NYSE and will subsequently be deregistered under the Exchange Act. Janus expects to continue
to comply file reports under Section 13(a) or Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act, as applicable and to the extent required until such time.

No Appraisal Rights 

        In accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL, no appraisal rights are available to holders of Janus common stock in connection with the merger.

Litigation Relating to the Transaction 

        The merger agreement requires each party to promptly advise the other party of any litigation brought by any stockholder or shareholder of that party, as applicable, against such party or any of its directors
(in their capacity as such) relating to the merger agreement or any of the transactions contemplated thereby. Each party will give the other party the opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any
such litigation by any stockholders or shareholders, and no such settlement will be agreed to without the other party's prior written consent, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. As of
the date of this proxy statement/prospectus there has been no stockholder or shareholder litigation relating to the merger agreement or any of the transactions contemplated thereby filed against Janus or
Henderson.

the parties to the merger agreement, which are summarized below. These representations and warranties have been made solely for the benefit of the other parties to the merger agreement and:

• were not intended as statements of fact, but rather as a way of allocating the risk to one of the parties if those statements prove to be inaccurate; 

• have been qualified by certain confidential disclosures that were made to the other party in connection with the negotiation of the merger agreement, which disclosures are not reflected in the
merger agreement; and 

• may apply standards of materiality in a way that is different from what may be viewed as material by you or other investors.

        Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the representations and warranties in the merger agreement and described below may have changed since the date of the merger agreement and
subsequent developments or new information qualifying a representation or warranty may have been included in this proxy statement/prospectus. Accordingly, the representations and warranties and other
provisions of the merger agreement should not be read alone, but instead should be read together with the information provided elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus and in the documents incorporated
by reference into this proxy statement/prospectus. See "Where You Can Find More Information" beginning on page 300.

Closing

        The closing will occur at 10:00 a.m., New York Time, on the fifth business day after all closing conditions contained in the merger agreement have been fulfilled or (to the extent permitted by applicable
law) waived (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be fulfilled at closing, but subject to fulfillment or waiver of such conditions), unless another time or date is agreed in writing by the parties
thereto. We refer to the day on which the closing occurs in this document as the "closing date." For a description of the conditions to the closing, see "—Description of the Merger Agreement—Conditions to
Closing of the Merger" beginning on page 160.

Effective Time

        Subject to the provisions of the merger agreement, as soon as practicable on the closing date, the parties will cause the merger to be consummated by filing with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware a certificate of merger, duly executed and completed in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL and shall make all other filings required under the DGCL in connection with the merger.
The merger will become effective at such time on the closing date as shall be agreed by Henderson and Janus and specified in the certificate of merger, such time being referred to as the effective time.

Merger Consideration

Janus Common Stock

        Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the merger agreement, at the effective time, each share of Janus common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time (excluding any
shares of Janus common stock that are held in treasury) will be converted into the right to receive 4.7190 Henderson ordinary shares (referred to as the exchange ratio), with cash in lieu of any fractional
Henderson ordinary shares based on then prevailing prices on the stock exchange on which Janus Henderson ordinary shares are listed, which we refer to as the merger consideration, subject to the following
adjustments. Effective immediately prior to the closing of the merger, subject to approval by the Henderson shareholders at the Henderson shareholder meeting, Henderson will implement the share
consolidation at a ratio of one Janus Henderson ordinary share (or CDI, as applicable) for every

Table of Contents

10 Henderson ordinary shares (or CDIs, as applicable) outstanding (so that at closing of the merger each Janus stockholder will receive 0.4719 Janus Henderson ordinary shares for each share of Janus common
stock). In addition, subject to approval by the Henderson shareholders at the Henderson shareholder meeting, effective upon the date of the Henderson shareholder meeting, the par value of Henderson ordinary
shares will be redenominated from pounds sterling into U.S. dollars. Following the redenomination, subject to approval by the Henderson shareholders at the Henderson shareholder meeting, upon completion of
certain registration procedures with the Jersey Registrar of Companies, the par value of Henderson ordinary shares will be reduced to ensure that the par value is a round number.

Janus Options

        Subject to certain adjustments as may be necessary to satisfy the requirements of the Code, as of the effective time, each Janus Option outstanding immediately prior to the effective time, whether vested or
unvested, will be converted (as converted, a converted stock option) into an option exercisable for that number of Janus Henderson ordinary shares equal to the product of (i) the aggregate number of shares of
Janus common stock for which such Janus Option was exercisable multiplied by (ii) the exchange ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole share. The exercise price per share of such converted stock option will be
adjusted so that it is equal to (A) the exercise price per share of such Janus Option immediately prior to the effective time divided by (B) the exchange ratio, rounded up to the nearest cent.

Janus RSU Awards

        Each Janus RSU Award that is outstanding immediately prior to the effective time, whether vested or unvested, will be converted, as of the effective time, into a Janus Henderson restricted share unit award
with respect to Janus Henderson ordinary shares on the terms and conditions (including any continuing vesting requirements) under the applicable plan and award agreement in effect immediately prior to the
effective time, with the aggregate number of Janus Henderson restricted share units held by each holder (rounded up to the nearest whole unit) determined by multiplying (i) the number of shares of Janus
common stock subject to such Janus RSU Award immediately prior to the effective time by (ii) the exchange ratio.

Janus PSU Awards

        Each Janus PSU Award that is outstanding immediately prior to the effective time, whether vested or unvested, will be converted, as of the effective time, into a Janus Henderson restricted share unit award
with respect to Janus Henderson ordinary shares on the terms and conditions (including any continuing vesting requirements) under the applicable plan and award agreement in effect immediately prior to the

Janus Restricted Share Awards

        Each Janus Restricted Share Award that is outstanding immediately prior to the effective time will be converted, as of the effective time, into a restricted Janus Henderson ordinary share award on the terms
and conditions (including any continuing vesting requirements) under the applicable plan and award agreement in effect immediately prior to the effective time, with the aggregate number of restricted Janus
Henderson ordinary shares held by each holder (rounded up to the nearest whole share) determined by multiplying (i) the number of shares of Janus common stock subject to such Janus Restricted Share Award
immediately prior to the effective time by (ii) the exchange ratio.

Janus Employee Stock Purchase Plan

        Each outstanding award under the Janus ESPP will be converted at the effective time into corresponding awards for a number of Janus Henderson ordinary shares on the same basis as the Janus Options,
provided that Janus and Henderson will cooperate prior to the effective time to determine the appropriate treatment of the Janus ESPP in connection with the consummation of the merger, which may include
termination of the Janus ESPP at the effective time.

Merger Sub Common Stock

        Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the merger agreement, at the effective time, each share of common stock of Merger Sub, par value $0.01 per share, issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the effective time will be cancelled and, in exchange for the cancellation of the shares of Merger Sub common stock and the funding of the merger consideration by Henderson, Janus, as the surviving
corporation in the merger will issue an equivalent number of fully paid and non-assessable shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, all of which shares will be held by Henderson, and which will
constitute the only outstanding shares of common stock of Janus, as the surviving corporation, immediately following the effective time.

Representations and Warranties

        The merger agreement contains representations and warranties made by Henderson to Janus and by Janus to Henderson. Certain of the representations and warranties in the merger agreement are subject to
materiality or material adverse effect qualifications (that is, they will not be deemed to be untrue or incorrect unless their failure to be true or correct is material or would result in a material adverse effect). In
addition, certain of the representations and warranties in the merger agreement are subject to knowledge qualifications, which means that those representations and warranties would not be deemed untrue or
incorrect as a result of matters of which certain officers of the party making the representation did not have knowledge.

        The merger agreement provides that a "material adverse effect" means, with respect to Janus or Henderson, as the case may be, any fact, circumstance, effect, change, event or development, which we refer
to as an effect, that materially adversely affects the business, properties, financial condition or results of operations of such party and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole. However, no effect to the extent resulting
from or arising out of the following will be taken into account in determining whether there has been a material adverse effect with respect to Janus or Henderson:

• any failure, in and of itself, by such party to meet any internal or published projections, forecasts, budgets, plans, estimates or predictions in respect of revenues, earnings or other financial or
operating metrics for any period (provided that the facts or occurrences giving rise to or contributing to such failure may be deemed to constitute, or be taken into account in determining whether
there has been or will be, a material adverse effect on such party, unless otherwise excluded by the definition of material adverse effect);

respective subsidiaries to, carry on their respective businesses in the ordinary course consistent with past practice in all material respects and, to the extent consistent therewith, use reasonable best efforts to

• solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage (including by furnishing information in connection with any inquiry or proposal with respect to an alternative transaction), or knowingly take any other
action designed to facilitate, any inquiries regarding, or the making of, any proposal the consummation of which would constitute (1) any transaction or series of transactions pursuant to which a
third party acquires or would acquire, directly or indirectly, beneficial ownership of more than 20% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock (in case of Janus), ordinary shares (in
case of Henderson) or securities (or options, rights or warrants to purchase, or securities convertible into or exchangeable for, such securities) representing 20% or more of the voting power of

entitled "—Description of the Merger Agreement—Efforts to Obtain Required Stockholder Vote" beginning on page 157), Henderson or Janus receives a proposal that its board of directors determines in good
faith (after consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor of U.S. or U.K. nationally recognized reputation) constitutes or could reasonably be expected to result in a "superior proposal" (as defined
below) and which did not result from a material breach of the non-solicitation obligations set forth in the merger agreement, then Henderson or Janus, as applicable, may (i) furnish information with respect to
itself and its subsidiaries to the person (or group of persons) making such proposal and its representatives and financing sources pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement containing terms as to
confidentiality generally no less restrictive than the terms of the confidentiality agreement entered into between Henderson and Janus (provided that (x) such information must have been previously provided to
the other party or must be promptly provided to the other party prior to or substantially concurrently with the time it is provided to such person and (y) such confidentiality agreement need not contain any
"standstill" or other similar terms that prohibit the counterparty thereto or any of its affiliates or representatives from making any proposal for an alternative transaction, acquiring such party or taking any other
similar action) and (ii) participate in discussions or negotiations regarding such proposal with the person (or group of persons) making such proposal and its representatives and financing sources.

        The merger agreement also requires each party to (i) notify the other party promptly, and in any event within 24 hours of receipt, of any request for substantive information or of any proposal relating to an
alternative transaction, the material terms and conditions of such request or proposal (including any changes thereto) and the identity of the person making such request or proposal; (ii) keep the other party
reasonably informed of the status and details (including amendments or proposed amendments) of any such request or proposal on a current basis; and (iii) provide the other party, as soon as reasonably
practicable, copies of all material substantive correspondence and other material written materials exchanged with the person making the proposal that describes in any material respect any of the material terms
or conditions of any such request or proposal.

        For purposes of the merger agreement, "superior proposal" means any bona fide written proposal (on its most recently amended or modified terms, if amended or modified) made by a third party to enter
into an alternative transaction (with all references to 20% in the definition of "alternative transaction" above being treated as references to 50%) that (i) did not result from a material breach of the applicable
non-solicitation obligations set forth in the merger agreement, (ii) is on terms that the board of directors of such party determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor of
U.S. or U.K. nationally recognized reputation) to be superior from a financial point of view to the party's stockholders or shareholders, as applicable, than the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement
and the Dai-ichi agreements, taking into account all terms and conditions of such proposal (including any changes to the merger agreement that may be proposed by the other party to this merger agreement in
response to such proposal) and (iii) the conditions to the consummation of which are reasonably capable of being satisfied and is otherwise reasonably likely to be consummated, taking into account all
financial, regulatory, legal and other aspects of such proposal.

the case of Janus, and the Henderson share issuance proposal, the Henderson amended articles proposal, the Henderson de-listing proposal, the Henderson permitted dividend proposal and the Henderson name
change proposal, in the case of Henderson.

        The merger agreement provides that, subject to the exceptions described below, each of the Henderson board and the Janus board will not (i) withdraw, qualify or modify, or propose publicly to withdraw,

Henderson permitted dividend proposal and the Henderson name change proposal, in the case of Henderson, (ii) approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend, any alternative
transaction (we refer to any action in clause (i) or this clause (ii) as a "board recommendation change"), provided that nothing shall restrict or otherwise limit Henderson or Janus from making accurate

party with reasonable advance notice and a copy of the proposed disclosure, the fact that a proposal the consummation of which would constitute an alternative transaction has been made, the identity of the
party making such proposal or the material terms of such proposal (and such disclosure shall not be deemed a board recommendation change) so long as none of the disclosure through which such factual
information is conveyed, individually or in the aggregate, is contrary to or materially inconsistent with, in any respects, the recommendation made by such party's board or (iii) cause the applicable party or any
of its controlled affiliates to enter into any letter of intent, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement or other agreement related to any alternative transaction (other than a confidentiality agreement otherwise

recognized reputation) that the failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law, effect a board recommendation change. However, such
board of directors may not effect a board recommendation change unless it has given the other party at least four business days' written notice specifying the material terms and conditions of such proposal,
identifying the person making such proposal and stating that it intends to take such action, or in the event of a subsequent modification to the material terms and conditions of such superior proposal, after the
later of (x) the fourth business day following the other party's receipt of the initial written notice of the superior proposal and (y) the second business day following the other party's receipt of written notice
advising such other party of the modification to such terms and conditions; provided that during such four or two business day notice period, as applicable, such party engages (to the extent requested by the
other party) in good faith negotiations with the other party to amend the merger agreement in such a manner that the proposal to enter into an alternative transaction no longer constitutes a superior proposal.

        In addition, notwithstanding the foregoing restrictions, at any time prior to obtaining the relevant stockholder or shareholder approval, as applicable, the Henderson board or the Janus board, as applicable,
may, if it determines in good faith (and after consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor of U.S. or U.K. nationally recognized reputation) that it is required to do so pursuant to its fiduciary duties
under applicable law, effect a board recommendation change. However, such board of directors may not take any such action unless it has given the other party at least four business days' written notice advising
such other party of all material information with respect to the basis for such action and stating that it intends to take such action and providing its rationale therefor.

        If either Janus or Henderson effects a change of recommendation, such party has no termination right and will be required to submit the Janus merger proposal (in case of Janus) or the merger proposal, the
Henderson amended articles proposal, the Henderson name change proposal, the Henderson permitted dividend proposal and the Henderson LSE de-listing proposal (in case of Henderson) to a vote of their
stockholders and shareholders, respectively, at their respective special and shareholder meetings unless the merger agreement is earlier terminated in accordance with its terms.

        The parties have agreed that, to the extent that the U.K. Panel on Takeovers and Mergers determines that any of the above provisions either require Henderson to take an action that is not permitted, or
restrict Henderson from taking an action that is required, under Rule 21.2 of the City Code, such provision shall be disregarded in respect of both parties.

Efforts to Obtain Required Stockholder Vote

        Janus has agreed to hold a special meeting of the Janus stockholders as promptly as practicable after this registration statement on Form F-4 is declared effective for the purpose of obtaining the Janus
required stockholder approval of the Janus merger proposal, provided that Janus will postpone or adjourn such special meeting once for up to thirty days upon the request of Henderson if necessary to solicit
additional proxies for the purpose of obtaining the Janus required stockholder approval. Subject to the ability of the Janus board to effect a board recommendation change, Janus is required to, through the Janus
board, recommend to the Janus stockholders the Janus merger proposal.

        Henderson has agreed to hold a meeting of the Henderson shareholders as promptly as practicable after obtaining formal approval of the Henderson Shareholder Circular for the purpose of obtaining the
Henderson required shareholder approvals, provided that Henderson will propose postponement or adjournment of such special meeting once for up to thirty days upon the request of Janus if necessary to solicit
additional proxies to obtain the Henderson required shareholder approvals. Subject to the ability of the Henderson board to effect a board recommendation change, Henderson is required to, through the
Henderson board, recommend to the Henderson shareholders the Henderson share issuance proposal, the Henderson amended articles proposal, the Henderson de-listing proposal, the Henderson permitted
dividend proposal and the Henderson name change proposal.

        Both Henderson and Janus are required to use their reasonable best efforts to hold the Henderson shareholder meeting and the Janus special meeting on the same date.

Efforts to Complete the Merger

        Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the merger agreement, Henderson and Janus have each agreed to use their reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause
to be done, and to assist and cooperate with each other in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, as soon as possible following the date of the merger agreement, the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and the Dai-ichi agreements, including using reasonable best efforts to:

• obtain all necessary waivers, consents and approvals from governmental entities, including under antitrust laws prior to the effective time; 

• obtain all necessary consents, registrations, approvals, permits, authorizations and waivers, necessary to be obtained from, or renewed with, third parties; 

• execute and deliver any additional customary instruments necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and the Dai-ichi agreements; and 

• unless the Janus board or the Henderson board has effected a change in recommendation of in compliance with the merger agreement, obtain the Janus required stockholder approval or
Henderson required shareholder approvals, as applicable.

Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance

        Henderson has agreed to indemnify and hold harmless each individual who was as of the date of the merger agreement, or becomes prior to the effective time, a director or officer of Janus or any of its
subsidiaries and each person who was serving as a director or officer of another person at the

request of Janus or any of its subsidiaries, each referred to as an indemnified party, to the same extent as such indemnified parties were indemnified as of the date of the merger agreement pursuant to the
organizational documents of Janus or any of its subsidiaries, and any indemnification agreements in existence as of the date of the merger agreement.

        Henderson has also agreed, for a period of six years following the effective time, to either cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of directors' and officers' liability insurance maintained by
Janus or its subsidiaries and fiduciary liability insurance or provide substitute policies for not less than the existing coverage and having other terms not less favorable to the insured persons with respect to
claims arising from facts or events occurring on or prior to the effective date, except that in no event will the annual cost for maintaining such policies in any one policy year exceed 300% of the annual premium
payable by Janus for such insurance for the prior 12 months, referred to as the maximum amount. Janus may obtain a six-year "tail" policy under its existing directors and officers insurance policy in lieu of the
foregoing, for a cost not to exceed the maximum amount.

Employee Benefits Matters

        During the one year period commencing on the closing date and ending on the first anniversary of the closing date of the merger (the continuation period), Janus Henderson will, or will cause its
subsidiaries to, provide each individual who is employed by Janus, Henderson or their respective subsidiaries immediately prior to the effective time and who remains employed thereafter by Janus Henderson
or any of its subsidiaries (each, a continuing employee) with (i) a base salary or wage rate that is no less favorable than the base salary or wage rate provided to such continuing employee immediately prior to
the effective time, (ii) aggregate incentive compensation opportunities that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to those provided to such continuing employee immediately prior the effective time, and
(iii) employee benefits that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to those provided to such continuing employee immediately prior the effective time; provided that neither Henderson nor any of its
subsidiaries will be required to provide incentive compensation or employee benefits to continuing employees in the form of equity-based compensation. During the continuation period, Janus Henderson will,
or will cause its subsidiaries to, provide each continuing employee who experiences a termination of employment with Janus Henderson or any of its subsidiaries with severance payments and benefits that are
no less favorable than the severance payments and benefits that such continuing employee would have received under the terms of the severance plans, programs or arrangements of Janus, Henderson or their
respective subsidiaries, as applicable, as in effect immediately prior to the effective time.

        In addition, Janus and Henderson have agreed that, subject to applicable law:

• each continuing employee will be credited with his or her years of service with Janus, Henderson or any of their respective subsidiaries before the effective time, to the same extent as such
continuing employee was entitled, before the effective time, to credit for such service under any similar Janus benefit plans or Henderson benefit plans (including, without limitation, any equity
compensation, paid time off, and severance plans or policies), except to the extent such credit would result in a duplication of benefits and except for benefit accruals under any defined benefit
pension plan; and 

• to the extent administratively and commercially practicable, and subject to applicable law: 

• each continuing employee will be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all Janus Henderson benefit plans which are welfare benefit plans to the extent
coverage under such Janus Henderson benefit plan replaces coverage under a comparable Janus benefit plan or Henderson benefit plan, in which such continuing employee participated
immediately before the effective time (referred to as the old plans);

• for purposes of each Janus Henderson benefit plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any continuing employee, Janus Henderson or its subsidiaries will
use commercially reasonable efforts to cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such Janus Henderson benefit plan to be waived for such
continuing employee and his or her covered dependents; and 

• Janus Henderson or its subsidiaries will cause any eligible expenses incurred by such continuing employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the old
plan ending on the date such continuing employee's participation in the corresponding Janus Henderson benefit plan begins to be taken into account under such Janus Henderson benefit
plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such continuing employee and his or her covered dependents for the
applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such Janus Henderson benefit plan.

Other Covenants and Agreements

        The merger agreement contains certain other covenants and agreements, including covenants relating to:

• cooperation between Janus and Henderson in connection with the implementation of mutually agreed pre-merger financing arrangements;

• taking actions to consummate the merger and eliminate or minimize the effects of any antitakeover or similar statute or regulation that is or becomes applicable to the transactions contemplated

under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act;

        In addition, the merger agreement may be terminated by Henderson or Janus, at any time prior to the other party's receipt if its required stockholder approvals, upon the occurrence of the following events,
which we refer to as triggering events:

• the board of the other party shall have effected a board recommendation change, as described in the section entitled "—Description of the Merger Agreement—Changes in Board
Recommendations" beginning on page 155; 

• the other party shall have failed to include in this proxy statement/registration statement or, in the case of a Janus triggering event, Henderson shall have failed to include in the shareholder
circular, the recommendation of its board; 

• the board of the other party fails to reaffirm publicly its recommendation of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and the Dai-ichi agreements within five business days (or, if
earlier, prior to its shareholder or stockholder meeting, as applicable) after reasonably requested by the other party; 

• a tender or, in the case of a Henderson triggering event, exchange offer relating to the other party's shares of common stock or ordinary shares, as applicable, shall have been commenced and such
party shall not have sent to its shareholders or stockholders, as applicable, within 10 business days after the commencement of such tender or exchange offer (or, if earlier, prior to its shareholder
or stockholder meeting, as applicable), a statement rejecting such tender or exchange offer and reaffirming its recommendation of the Janus required stockholder approval or the Henderson
required shareholder approvals, as applicable; 

• an alternative transaction with respect to the other party is publicly announced and the other party fails to issue a press release that reaffirms its recommendation of the transactions contemplated
by the merger agreement and the Dai-ichi agreements within five business days (or, if earlier, prior to its shareholder or stockholder meeting, as applicable) after the other party requests in writing
that such recommendation be affirmed publicly; or 

• the other party or its representatives shall have breached the non-solicitation provisions of the merger agreement in any material respect.

        If the merger agreement is terminated, the agreement will become void, without liability or obligation on the part of any of the parties, except in the case of willful breach of the merger agreement. The
provisions of the merger agreement relating to fees and expenses, effects of termination, confidentiality, governing law, jurisdiction and specific performance, as well as the confidentiality agreement entered
into between Henderson and Janus and certain other provisions of the merger agreement will continue in effect notwithstanding termination of the merger agreement.

Expenses and Termination Fees

        Generally, each party is required to pay all fees and expenses incurred by it in connection with the merger and the other transactions and agreements contemplated by the merger agreement, except that each
of Henderson and Janus will bear and pay one-half of the costs and expenses (other than the fees and expenses of each party's attorneys and accountants, which shall be borne by the party incurring such
expenses) incurred by Henderson and Janus in connection with (i) the filing, printing and mailing of this Form F-4 and this proxy statement (including SEC filing fees), (ii) the filing, printing and mailing of the

time of such breach by Janus in the case of the preceding clause (i)(B), there shall have been publicly made directly to the Janus stockholders generally or there shall otherwise
have become publicly known or any person shall have publicly announced an intention to make an offer or proposal for a transaction that if consummated would constitute an
alternative transaction (except that all references in the definition of alternative transaction to "20%" shall be deemed replaced with "50%"), which we refer to as a Janus
qualifying transaction, which shall not have been withdrawn on or prior to the Janus stockholders meeting, in the case of the preceding clause (i)(A) or the time of such breach in
the case of the preceding clause (i)(B); or 

(ii) by Henderson or Janus for the merger not having been consummated by the outside date if any of the Henderson required shareholder approvals have been obtained at the

within the earlier of (x) 30 days after receiving written notice or (y) five business days prior to the outside date; provided that Janus is not then in material breach of any

        The merger agreement also provides that in the event that any termination fee is paid in accordance with the foregoing, such payment shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of such party and its
representatives and affiliates (other than in the case of a willful breach of the merger agreement by the other party).

        In addition, if either Janus or Henderson terminates the merger agreement in the event the Janus required stockholder approval or the Henderson required shareholder approvals are not obtained, Janus (in
the case the Janus required stockholder approval is not obtained) or Henderson (in the case

termination fee payable as described above.

Amendments, Extensions and Waivers

        Amendment.    Subject to compliance with applicable law, the merger agreement may be amended by the parties at any time before or after receipt of the requisite stockholder or shareholder approvals;
provided that (i) after such stockholder or shareholder approvals have been received, there may not be, without further approval of the Henderson shareholders or Janus stockholders, as applicable, any
amendment that changes the amount or the form of the consideration to be delivered to Henderson shareholders or Janus stockholders or that by law otherwise expressly requires the further approval of the
Henderson shareholders or Janus stockholders, as the case may be, and (ii) except as provided in clause (i), no amendment of the merger agreement may be submitted to be approved by the Henderson
shareholders or Janus stockholders.

        Extension; Waiver.    At any time prior to the effective time, a party may, in writing, (i) extend the time for performance of any obligation or act of the other party, (ii) waive any inaccuracy in a

conditions contained in the merger agreement.

No Third-Party Beneficiaries

Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance" beginning on page 157, the indemnified parties.

Specific Performance

        The parties have agreed in the merger agreement that irreparable damage would occur and that monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy in the event that any of the provisions
of the merger agreement are not performed in accordance with their specific terms or are otherwise breached. The parties have agreed that prior to any termination of the merger, they will be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of the merger agreement and to enforce specifically the performance of its terms and provisions, without proof of actual damages, in addition to any other remedy to
which they are entitled at law or in equity. The parties have further agreed not to assert that a remedy of specific enforcement is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to law or inequitable for any reason, nor to assert
that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy for any breach.

DAI-ICHI AGREEMENTS 

Amended and Restated Investment and Strategic Cooperation Agreement 

        In conjunction with the execution of the merger agreement, Henderson, Janus and Dai-ichi entered into an Amended and Restated Investment and Strategic Cooperation Agreement, which we refer to as the
amended investment and cooperation agreement, which amends and restates the Investment and Strategic Cooperation Agreement by and between Dai-ichi and Janus, dated August 10, 2012, which we refer to
as the prior investment and cooperation agreement. In general, the terms of the amended investment and cooperation agreement are consistent with the terms of the prior investment and cooperation agreement,
subject to certain adjustments.

        Prior to the effective time, the terms of the amended investment and cooperation agreement apply to Janus and, after the effective time, Janus Henderson will succeed to the rights and obligations of Janus
thereunder. For purposes of the amended investment and cooperation agreement and this proxy statement/prospectus, the "company" means (1) prior to the effective time, Janus and (2) following the effective
time, Janus Henderson. If the merger is not consummated, the terms of the prior investment and cooperation agreement will be reinstated.

Ownership Limit

        Dai-ichi has agreed not to acquire more than 20% of the issued and outstanding shares of the company, which we refer to as the ownership limit, and to reduce its percentage ownership to the ownership
limit should its percentage ownership exceed the ownership limit at any time.

Invested Assets; Distribution

        Under the terms of the amended investment and cooperation agreement, subject to certain conditions, Dai-ichi has agreed to maintain investments in investment products of the company and its affiliates of
not less than $2 billion and, no later than 12 months following the effective time, cause additional cash in the amount of up to $500 million to be invested in new investment products of the company and its
affiliates, which will be determined based on good faith discussions between the company and Dai-ichi. A certain proportion of Dai-ichi's investments will continue to be held in seed capital investments. In
addition, the company and Dai-ichi have agreed to cooperate in good faith and use commercially reasonable efforts to sell investment products through each other's distribution channels.

Board Designation Right

        Dai-ichi has the right to designate a Dai-ichi Representative for appointment to the company's board of directors until such right is terminated in accordance with the terms of the amended investment and
cooperation agreement. Dai-ichi's right to designate a Dai-ichi Representative may be terminated under certain circumstances set forth in the amended investment and cooperation agreement, and in particular is
dependent on Dai-ichi maintaining a shareholding in the company above the applicable percentage (as described below).

Standstill Restrictions

        Dai-ichi is subject to certain standstill restrictions and, subject to certain exceptions, cannot, in each case without the consent of the company's board of directors and, prior to the effective time, Henderson,
among other things, initiate tender or exchange offers for securities of the company or its subsidiaries, seek the nomination or election of any individual as a director of the company (other than Dai-ichi's right
to designate Dai-ichi Representative as described above), participate in any recapitalization, restructuring, liquidation, dissolution or other similar extraordinary transaction with

respect to the company or its subsidiaries, acquire or obtain any economic interest in securities of the company (other than the acquisition of up to 20% of the issued and outstanding shares of the company as
permitted by the amended investment and cooperation agreement) or dispose any ordinary of the company in an unsolicited tender offer (other than under certain circumstances as permitted by the amended
investment and cooperation agreement). Following the effective time, for so long as the company is subject to the U.K. Takeover Code, Dai-ichi will be permitted to accept (or vote in favor of) any offer to
acquire the company's shares. In addition, the standstill restrictions are suspended if Dai-ichi owns less than 3% of the issued and outstanding shares of the company and, with certain exceptions, terminated
upon change of control of the company.

Transfer Restrictions

        Dai-ichi is subject to certain limitations on its ability to transfer its company shares and cannot, without the company's consent, transfer its company shares within three years of the date of the amended
investment and cooperation agreement, except that it may transfer its company shares to the extent necessary to comply with applicable law, effectively binding written or oral administrative guidance from a
governmental authority in Japan or an order by such a governmental authority, upon an insolvency event with respect to either the company or Dai-ichi, upon certain events of financial distress with respect to
Dai-ichi or the company or where certain conditions in relation to the nature of the proposed transfer set forth in the amended investment and cooperation agreement are met. The company is generally entitled
to a right of first offer or a right of first refusal, depending on the nature of the proposed transfer, with respect to Dai-ichi's proposed transfer of its company shares.

Preemptive Rights

        In the event that the company proposes to issue new company shares, for so long as (i) prior to the merger, Dai-ichi owns at least 15% of the issued and outstanding shares of Janus common stock and
(ii) following the merger, Dai-ichi maintains its shareholding in the company at the level immediately after the effective time (subject to dilution in certain circumstance) (we refer to such percentage describe in
clause (i) and clause (ii) as the "applicable percentage"), Dai-ichi has the right to purchase up to such number of company shares that would allow Dai-ichi to maintain a percentage ownership of the issued and
outstanding company shares that is, after giving effect to the issuance of the new securities, no less than the percentage ownership Dai-ichi had prior to such issuance. Dai-ichi is entitled to exercise its
preemptive rights in respect of the company's issuance of new securities to provide equity compensation for employment for its directors, officers or employees only if such issuance would cause Dai-ichi's
percentage ownership to decrease to less than the applicable percentage. In each case, Dai-ichi does not have preemptive rights to the extent that an issuance of the additional company shares to Dai-ichi would
require approval of the shareholders of the company pursuant to Rule 312 of the New York Stock Exchange Listed Company Manual or any successor rule thereof or ASX Listing Rule 7.1 or any successor rule
thereof, unless such approval has been obtained.

Registration Rights

        At any time following the effective time, and without limiting the restrictions on transfers described above, Dai-ichi will be entitled to customary registration rights, including the right to require the
company to file up to two registration statements to register company shares owned by Dai-ichi, which we refer to as the Registrable Shares, and unlimited prospectus supplements in connection with any take-
down from an effective shelf registration statement. In addition, Dai-ichi has certain "piggyback" registration rights with respect to the Registrable Shares to participate in certain securities offerings by the
company.

Termination

        The amended investment and cooperation agreement may be terminated by either the company or Dai-ichi under specified circumstances, including if (i) there is an insolvency event with respect to the
other party, (ii) if such termination is necessary to comply with applicable law, effectively binding written or oral administrative guidance from a governmental authority or an order by a governmental authority,
(iii) there is a material uncured breach of the amended investment and cooperation agreement by the other party, (iv) during any consecutive five business day period, Dai-ichi owns less than the applicable
percentage of the issued and outstanding shares of the company (subject to certain exceptions), or (v) the company terminates Dai-ichi's right to designate a Dai-ichi Representative to the company's board of
directors. In addition, each of the company and Dai-ichi may terminate the amended investment and cooperation agreement following the third anniversary of the date of the merger, upon 90-days written notice
to the other party (which notice may not be given prior to the third anniversary of the date of the merger).

        The amended investment and cooperation agreement may be terminated by the company if there is a change in Japanese generally accepted accounting principles or other applicable accounting principles
that would significantly increase the burden to the company in complying with its obligations to furnish certain financial and operating information to Dai-ichi, or if the company or any of its affiliates becomes
subject to direct regulation by, or sanctions from, any Japanese governmental authority that it would not be subject to in the absence of the strategic alliance.

        The amended investment and cooperation agreement may also be terminated by Dai-ichi if the company informs Dai-ichi that it is unable to comply with its obligations to furnish certain financial and
operating information or there is a change in applicable law in Japan that requires Dai-ichi to receive information that it is not already receiving from the company, such inability to comply or change in
applicable law would or would reasonably be expected to result in Dai-ichi being in violation of applicable law, and the parties following good faith discussions are unable to agree on appropriate changes to the
company's obligations to furnish certain information that would avoid Dai-ichi being in violation of applicable law. Dai-ichi may also terminate the amended investment and cooperation agreement if (i) its
percentage ownership has been diluted to less than applicable percentage of the issued and outstanding company shares due to the company's issuance of new securities and Dai-ichi was unable to prevent such
dilution by exercising its preemptive rights, using commercially reasonable efforts to purchase shares on the open market or, following the effective time, exercising its remaining options under the option
agreement or (ii) Dai-ichi or any of its affiliates becomes subject to direct regulation by, or sanctions from, any governmental authority (other than a Japanese, Jersey, U.K., Australian or U.S. governmental
authority) that it would not be subject to in the absence of the strategic alliance.

Option Agreement 

        In conjunction with the execution of the merger agreement, Henderson and Dai-ichi entered into an option agreement, dated as of October 3, 2016, pursuant to which, conditional on closing of the merger,
Henderson will grant Dai-ichi: (i) 11 tranches of conditional options with each tranche allowing Dai-ichi to subscribe for or purchase 500,000 Janus Henderson ordinary shares at a strike price of 2,997.2 pence
per share (the terms of such options having been adjusted in accordance with the terms of the Dai-ichi option agreement to take account of the effect of the share consolidation), and (ii) subject to the approval of
Henderson shareholders (to be sought at the Henderson shareholder meeting in relation to the merger), nine tranches of conditional options with each tranche allowing Dai-ichi to subscribe for or purchase
500,000 Janus Henderson ordinary shares at a strike price of 2,997.2 pence per share (the terms of such options having been adjusted in accordance with the terms of the Dai-ichi option agreement to take
account of the effect of the share consolidation). The options will be exercisable by Dai-ichi following the closing of the merger for a period measured as the

two-year period ending on the 24-month anniversary of the date of the option agreement. The price that Dai-ichi will pay at closing for the purchase of the options is £19,778,800.00 (provided that, if the
requisite Henderson shareholder approval is not obtained at the Henderson shareholder meeting in relation to the merger, no amount shall be due from Dai-ichi in respect of the nine unapproved options). In
aggregate, the options sold to Dai-ichi would, if exercised at closing of the merger (and subject to relevant regulatory approvals), entitle Dai-ichi to purchase an additional approximately 5% of the ordinary
shares of Janus Henderson. The option agreement will terminate if, among other things, the merger agreement or the amended investment and cooperation agreement is terminated.

Voting and Support Agreement 

        In conjunction with the execution of the merger agreement, Henderson, Janus and Dai-ichi entered into a voting and support agreement, pursuant to which, among other things, Dai-ichi has agreed to vote
the shares of Janus common stock held by it in support of the merger. The voting and support agreement will terminate if, among other things, the merger agreement is terminated.

        As of March 15, 2017, Dai-ichi beneficially owned, in the aggregate, 36,382,545 shares of Janus common stock, which represented approximately 19.74% of the issued and outstanding shares of Janus
common stock on such date.

HENDERSON NAME CHANGE 

        As of the effective time, Henderson will file for registration to change the name of Henderson from "Henderson Group plc" to "Janus Henderson Group plc", which we refer to as the Henderson name
change.

        Approval of the Henderson name change requires the affirmative vote of two-thirds of the shareholders voting (in person or represented by proxy) at the Henderson shareholder meeting. It is a condition to
the closing of the merger, that the Henderson shareholders approve the Henderson name change.

JANUS PROPOSAL 1: THE JANUS MERGER PROPOSAL 

        Pursuant to the merger agreement, at the effective time, Merger Sub, a wholly owned, direct subsidiary of Henderson, will merge with and into Janus, with Henderson continuing as the surviving
corporation. As a result, Janus will be a wholly owned, direct subsidiary of Henderson and the Janus common stock will be delisted from the NYSE, deregistered under the Exchange Act and cease to be
publicly traded.

        Holders of shares of Janus common stock should read carefully this document in its entirety, including the appendices, for more detailed information concerning the merger agreement and the merger. In
particular, holders of shares of Janus common stock are directed to the merger agreement, a copy of which is attached as Annex A to this document.

        Closing of the merger is conditioned on approval of the Janus merger proposal.

Vote Required and Janus Board Recommendation

        The affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of Janus common stock entitled to vote on the Janus merger proposal at the Janus special meeting is required to approve the Janus merger
proposal.

IF YOU ARE A JANUS STOCKHOLDER, THE JANUS BOARD UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE "FOR" JANUS PROPOSAL 1.

JANUS PROPOSAL 2: THE JANUS COMPENSATION PROPOSAL 

        Under Section 14A of the Exchange Act and the applicable SEC rules issued thereunder, Janus is required to submit a proposal to its stockholders for a non-binding, advisory vote to approve certain
compensation that may become payable to its named executive officers in connection with the closing of the merger.

        The Janus compensation proposal gives you the opportunity to vote, on a non-binding, advisory basis, on the compensation that may be paid or become payable to Janus's named executive officers in
connection with the merger. The compensation relating to the Janus compensation proposal is summarized in the table in the section entitled "The Merger—Merger Related Compensation" beginning on page
127, including the footnotes to the table and the related narrative. The Janus board encourages you to review carefully the merger-related compensation information with respect to Janus's named executive
officers disclosed in this proxy statement/prospectus.

        The vote on the Janus compensation proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote on the Janus merger proposal. A stockholder may vote to approve the Janus merger proposal and vote not to approve
the Janus compensation proposal, and vice versa. Because the Janus compensation proposal is advisory only, the outcome of such vote will not be binding on Janus or Janus Henderson. Accordingly, if the
merger agreement is adopted by Janus stockholders and the merger is completed, the compensation with respect to the named executive officers of Janus will be payable, subject only to the conditions applicable
thereto, regardless of the outcome of the vote on the Janus compensation proposal.

        Approval of the Janus compensation proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the Janus stockholders present, in person or represented by proxy, and entitled to vote at the Janus special
meeting.

        If you are a Janus stockholder present, in person or represented by proxy, at the Janus special meeting and fail to vote or mark your proxy or voting instructions to abstain, it will have the same effect as a
vote "AGAINST" the Janus compensation proposal.

Vote Required and Janus Board Recommendation

        The affirmative vote of a majority of the Janus stockholders present, in person or represented by proxy, and entitled to vote at the Janus special meeting is required to approve, on an advisory basis, the
Janus compensation proposal, but such vote will not be binding on Janus or Janus Henderson.

        The Janus board unanimously recommends that Janus stockholders approve the following resolution:

        "RESOLVED, that the compensation that may be paid or become payable to the named executive officers of Janus Capital Group Inc. in connection with the merger, as disclosed pursuant to Item 402(t) of
Regulation S-K in the table in the section of the proxy statement/prospectus entitled "The Merger—Merger Related Compensation," including the associated narrative discussion, and the agreements and plans
pursuant to which such compensation may be paid or become payable, are hereby APPROVED."

JANUS PROPOSALS 3 THROUGH 7: THE AMENDMENT PROPOSALS 

        Each stockholder of Janus will become a shareholder of Janus Henderson upon completion of the merger and the ordinary shares of Janus Henderson received by the Janus stockholders will be governed by
the Janus Henderson Amended Memorandum and Janus Henderson Amended Articles. Accordingly, Janus stockholders are being provided the opportunity to cast a non-binding advisory vote on the following
amendments to the Henderson Memorandum of Association and Henderson Articles of Association:

        1.     an amendment to the Henderson Memorandum of Association implementing the share consolidation of Henderson ordinary shares at a ratio of one new Janus Henderson ordinary share (or CDI) for
every 10 Henderson ordinary shares (or CDIs, as applicable) outstanding, to be implemented effective upon the closing of the merger;

        2.     an amendment to the Henderson Memorandum of Association increasing the authorized share capital of the company from £274,363,847.00 to $720,000,000;

        3.     an amendment to the Henderson Articles of Association removing preemptive rights for Janus Henderson shareholders on new issuances of Janus Henderson ordinary shares;

        4.     an amendment to the Henderson Articles of Association removing the requirement that the Janus Henderson board seek the approval of Janus Henderson shareholders to issue Janus Henderson
ordinary shares; and

        5.     an amendment to the Henderson Articles of Association requiring directors of Janus Henderson to be re-elected at each annual Janus Henderson shareholder meeting.

        The vote on each of the amendment proposals is a vote separate and apart from the vote on the Janus merger proposal. A stockholder may vote to approve the Janus merger proposal and vote not to approve
any of the amendment proposals, and vice versa. Because each of the amendment proposals is advisory only, the outcome of any such vote will not be binding on Janus or Janus Henderson and is not a condition
to the completion of the merger. Accordingly, if the merger agreement is adopted by Janus stockholders and the merger is completed, the amendments to the Henderson Memorandum of Association and
Henderson Articles of Association will become effective, subject only to the conditions applicable thereto, regardless of the outcome of the vote of the Janus stockholders on the amendment proposals. However,
Janus seeks the support of Janus stockholders and believes that stockholder support is appropriate because the Janus stockholders will become Janus Henderson shareholders upon completion of the merger.
Accordingly, holders of Janus common stock are being asked to vote on the non-binding amendment proposals.

        For more information on the existing rights of Janus stockholders and their post-merger rights as shareholders of Janus Henderson, please see "Comparison of Rights of Holders Janus Henderson Ordinary
Shares and Shares of Janus Common Stock" beginning on page 274 and "Description of Janus Henderson Ordinary Shares and Janus Henderson Amended Articles of Association" beginning on page 218.

        Approval of each of the amendment proposals requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the Janus stockholders present, in person or represented by proxy, and entitled to vote at the Janus special
meeting.

        If you are a Janus stockholder present, in person or represented by proxy, at the Janus special meeting and fail to vote or mark your proxy or voting instructions to abstain, it will have the same effect as a
vote "AGAINST" each of the amendment proposals.

        IF YOU ARE A JANUS STOCKHOLDER, THE JANUS BOARD UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE "FOR" JANUS PROPOSALS 3, 4, 5 , 6 and 7.

        The Janus special meeting may be adjourned to another time and place to permit further solicitation of proxies, if necessary or appropriate, to obtain additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes to
approve the Janus merger proposal. The Janus board does not intend to propose adjournment of the special meeting if there are sufficient votes to approve the Janus merger proposal.

        Janus is asking you to authorize the holder of any proxy solicited by the Janus board to vote in favor of any adjournment of its special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if

        Clients entrust money to Henderson—either their own or money they manage for their clients—and expect Henderson to deliver the benefits specified in their mandate or by the prospectus for the fund in
which they invest. Henderson measures the amount of these funds as assets under management (which we refer to as AUM). Growth in AUM is a key output of its strategy. Henderson's AUM increases or
decreases primarily depending on its ability to attract and retain client investments, and on investment performance, market and currency movements. To the extent that Henderson invests in new asset
management teams or businesses or divests from existing ones, this is also reflected in AUM.

        Clients pay Henderson a management fee, which is usually calculated by reference to a percentage of AUM. In addition, Henderson may receive a performance fee from clients when its managers deliver
strong investment performance. As at December 31, 2016, Henderson had 107 funds with the potential to generate performance fees. Management and performance fees are Henderson's most important sources
of revenue. Henderson believes that the more diverse the range of investment strategies from which management and performance fees are derived, the more successful its business model will be.

History and Strategic Transactions 

        Henderson was founded in 1934 to administer the estate of Alexander Henderson, the first Baron Faringdon, and is proud to be named after its first client. Its shares were first listed on the London Stock
Exchange in 1983.

        In 1998, Henderson was acquired by Australian wealth manager AMP. Under AMP's ownership, Henderson began to build its global business, opening offices in the U.S., Asia and Continental Europe.
Henderson was spun out of AMP in 2003 and was then listed on the London Stock Exchange and the ASX Limited.

        In the aftermath of the 2007-2009 global financial crisis, and with Andrew Formica appointed Chief Executive in 2008, Henderson consolidated its position in its core U.K. retail market in 2009 with the
acquisition of New Star Asset Management Group PLC.

        In 2011, Henderson acquired Gartmore Group Limited. Gartmore had well-established long only equity and alternative asset management capabilities, as well as a client base in the U.K., Continental
Europe, North America, Japan and South America.

        In 2013, Henderson articulated a five year strategy, based on growth and globalization, designed to deliver a global footprint, infrastructure and mindset for the benefit of the company's clients. Henderson
aimed to deliver a sustained period of organic growth, supplemented by value accretive acquisitions. It invested in new investment teams, broader distribution reach and a global operating model.

Table of Contents

        In fiscal years 2014 and 2015, Henderson achieved net new client money growth of 11%. Henderson supplemented this organic growth with acquisitions. In October 2014, Henderson acquired Geneva
Capital Management, a U.S. small and mid-cap growth equity manager, which we refer to as Geneva. In November 2015, Henderson completed its acquisitions of Perennial Fixed Interest and Perennial Growth
Management (together referred to as Perennial), which significantly expanded the company's footprint in Australia.

        Henderson's key divestitures in 2014 and 2015 began with the sale of its Property business to TIAA-CREF and the formation of a joint venture, TH Real Estate, which we refer to as THRE, in which it
acquired a 40% interest. In June 2015, Henderson sold its 40% interest in THRE to TIAA-CREF. This, together with the roll off of Henderson's private equity business in 2014, allowed Henderson to focus its
business on investing in more liquid asset classes.

        At December 31, 2016, Henderson is beyond half-way of its five year growth and globalization strategy, having delivered strong investment performance to clients in an increasingly diverse range of
investment styles, with a broader client base and a strong financial position. The merger with Janus will further enhance the global reach, client base and investment diversification of the company.

Industry Context 

        The asset management industry's overriding purpose is to create and maintain wealth for clients. Global political and economic conditions affect both flows of client funds and underlying investment
conditions. During 2016, client demand and operational considerations for asset managers have been shaped by the U.K.'s decision to leave the European Union. While the long-term impact of Brexit on the
U.K. economy has yet to be established, in the short term, Brexit has led to volatility in the U.K. capital markets and depreciation of pounds sterling relative to the U.S. dollar.

        In addition, established long term trends impacting the asset management industry include the following:

• the shift of the retirement burden from the state and corporate institutions to the individual, driven by structural welfare pension reforms, and the demographics of an aging population; 

• the shift in investment demand from traditional products to passive, multi-asset and outcome-oriented products and mandates; and 

• the demand from regulators and clients for fee transparency, which in turn has increased pressure on asset managers to deliver value.

        Regulatory scrutiny across the industry is also increasing, with regulators in different jurisdictions applying ever increasing and more complex regulations. This has resulted in an increase in the cost of
doing business for asset managers across the globe. The key to addressing all of these challenges lies in a firm's ability to build two vital characteristics into its operating model: economies of scale and
diversification. These will be key benefits of Henderson's merger with Janus.

Strengths 

        Henderson has a number of competitive strengths that it believes differentiate it within the markets it serves.

• A business model focusing first and foremost on clients. 

• Focus on active—not passive—fund management by investment managers with unique individual perspectives, who are free to implement their own investment views, within a strong risk
management framework. In actively managed investment products managers select securities for

a given portfolio, whereas in passively managed products portfolio decisions are made based on pre-established criteria, such as tracking an index.

• A strong culture promoting active investment management, based on the values of collaboration, conviction and responsibility, which enables Henderson to adapt effectively to changes in market
conditions and makes Henderson a sought after place to work. 

• Successful investment track records in both traditional and alternative investment styles, across a diverse product range. 

• Growing global footprint with retail and institutional clients. 

• An attractive, aspirational brand centered around the proposition of Knowledge. Shared, made relevant by Henderson's growing reputation for delivering relevant digital content to clients in a
timely fashion. 

• A deeply held sense of corporate responsibility, focused on responsible investment and client engagement, but also on Henderson's people, the communities in which it works and the
environment.

Strategy 

        Henderson's strategy focuses on achieving growth and globalization by delivering excellent performance and service to an increasingly diverse client base. When Henderson established its five year
strategy in 2013, it aimed to achieve a sustained period of organic growth, attracting net new money from clients at a higher rate than that of Henderson's industry peers. Organic growth was to be supplemented
by value accretive acquisitions. At December 31, 2016, following the mid-point of this five year growth and globalization strategy, Henderson had created a fundamentally stronger, more diverse business.
Henderson's merger with Janus accelerates this strategy, the four key priorities of which are as follows:

• Deliver first-class investment performance and service to clients.  Henderson's strategy focuses on the needs of its clients, delivering strong investment performance and service to them through
active investment management and responsible relationship management, wherever they are in the world. 

• Expand global investment offering to meet the current and future needs of clients.  Henderson deploys its asset management expertise across its core capabilities to find attractive and innovative
opportunities for clients, and to provide products which consistently meet the current and future needs of clients. As an example, Henderson has recently focused on the organic development of
its Emerging Markets Equity team to complement the 2014 build out of its Emerging Markets Debt team. 

• Diversify the business.  Henderson has long held ambitious plans for growth and is expanding its investment management and distribution reach to deliver value to a broader client base.
Henderson's global expansion in recent years has been accelerated by the acquisitions of Geneva in the U.S. in 2014, and of 90 West Asset Management, which we refer to as 90 West, and
Perennial in Australia in 2015. 

• Operate efficiently.  Henderson's operating model is designed to meet client needs, attract and retain excellent professionals across the business and deliver profitable growth. Henderson aims to
build operating leverage and capital strength as the business grows. Henderson has developed a scalable operating platform to facilitate future growth as its business has become more globalized.
It has implemented significant investment in regulatory expertise to manage constant change in its business. In addition, Henderson takes a disciplined approach to the management

of financial resources in order to generate a regulatory capital surplus and facilitate return of capital to shareholders.

AUM Diversification 

        Henderson has a well-diversified AUM profile by channel, investment capability and client location. Since the launch of Henderson's growth and globalization strategy in 2013, the greatest change in AUM
has been in the geographic mix of Henderson's client base, with close to 50% of AUM now managed for clients outside the U.K. However Henderson remains much more heavily focused on Europe than the
asset management industry as a whole. The merger with Janus will align the geographic profile of the combined company with that of the asset management industry as a whole, and positions it well to access
the areas of greatest client demand. Janus also brings strength in complementary investment capabilities, notably U.S. equities, mathematical equities, global equities, U.S. fixed income, global macro fixed
income, multi-asset and exchange traded products.

        The table below shows AUM by channel, capability and client location as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2013.

Investment Offerings 

European Equities

        Henderson is one of the top five largest providers of Luxembourg and U.K.-domiciled active European equity funds. Its highly experienced managers work as part of a team, but apply individual processes
and styles. The company's fund range encompasses value and growth, long only and long/

short and a range of market capitalization specialties, as well as different geographic exposures (Eurozone, continental or Pan European). At December 31, 2016, Henderson's European Equities capability had
AUM of $24.3 billion, run by a team of 21 investment specialists.

Global Equities

        The Global Equities capability has a wide range of strategies targeting multiple investment channels. It is made up of a series of expert teams specializing in different sectors, regions and styles. These
include teams that invest worldwide and manage high-capacity global products covering the emerging markets, equity income, growth, natural resources, technology and property equities, as well as regional
and country-focused teams including those based in Australia and the U.S. Ideas and research are shared across teams, but managers invest based on their convictions rather than conforming to a house view. At
December 31, 2016, the Global Equities team was comprised of 120 investment specialists and had AUM of $42.0 billion.

Global Fixed Income

        Henderson is a leading manager of global fixed income assets, with a reputation for innovation. The group's team structure, which harnesses unconstrained idea generation, together with the experience of
specialized areas such as derivatives and asset backed securities, positions the group well to exploit opportunities across global fixed income markets. At December 31, 2016, the Global Fixed Income team
comprised 75 investment specialists and had AUM of $34.7 billion.

        Henderson's fixed income division is organized into specialist "alpha" teams tasked with generating investment ideas within their areas of expertise. These teams comprise portfolio managers and analysts
and cover three key areas: interest rates (developed and emerging markets), corporate bonds (investment-grade and high yield) and secured credit. The emphasis is on unconstrained idea generation, with the
alpha teams putting forward their best ideas (both long and short), utilizing the full remit of their research and analytical skills and sharing their views on markets, securities and capital structure.

Multi-Asset

        Henderson's Multi-Asset team of 10 investment specialists manages portfolios suiting a range of risk appetites, incorporating third-party funds and investment vehicles as well as direct holdings. At
December 31, 2016, the Multi-Asset team had AUM of $6.3 billion.

Alternatives

        Henderson's Alternatives capability comprises a broad range of offerings managed by stand-alone teams. These include absolute return in U.S., U.K. and European equity long/short strategies as well as a
credit alpha fixed income offering; global commodities, including agriculture, natural resources and managed futures; and hedge funds across a range of strategies. Henderson also has a well-regarded U.K.
Property fund, which is managed through a sub-advisory agreement with THRE. At December 31, 2016, Alternatives AUM totaled $17.5 billion, run by a team of 15 investment specialists.

Sales and Marketing 

        Henderson divides its global distribution focus broadly between Institutional and Retail. Institutional clients are primarily pension funds. Retail clients are principally intermediaries such as registered
investment advisors in the U.S., fund platforms and discretionary wealth managers in the U.K., and global banks in Europe and Asia. In certain markets, such as U.K. Retail, Henderson serves end investors, but
it seeks predominantly to work with professional investors.

Table of Contents

        Henderson believes it is well positioned to serve the increasingly sophisticated demands of clients in the global asset management industry. Henderson believes that there is no longer a clear divide between
how retail and institutional investors select investment products, nor are there clear differences between distribution models in different countries. Clients have also become more sophisticated in their selection
of fund managers. Henderson believes that this move up the sophistication spectrum, or "institutionalization" of the buying process, favors firms like it that offer a diverse breadth of investment strategies and
products.

        While Henderson seeks to leverage its global model where possible, it also recognizes the importance of tailoring its services to the needs of clients in different regions. For this reason, Henderson
maintains a local presence in most of the markets in which it operates and provides investment material that takes into account local customs, preferences and language needs. Henderson has a global
distribution team of over 250 client-facing staff.

        Henderson's brand centers on the proposition of Knowledge. Shared, which leverages Henderson's deep pool of intellectual capital to deliver investment thought leadership and transparency to clients,
thereby building and strengthening trusted relationships.

Products and Services 

        Henderson's global product team maintains oversight of a broad range of products, including locally domiciled pooled funds in the U.S., the U.K., Luxembourg, Japan, Singapore and Australia, hedge
funds, segregated mandates and closed-ended vehicles. The team provides governance for all funds and strategies, and gauges the suitability of new offerings as well as ensuring that existing products remain
suited to the clients to which they are marketed.

        The below table provides a breakdown of AUM by product as of December 31, 2016.

Intellectual Property 

        Henderson has used, registered, and/or applied to register certain trademarks, service marks and trade names to distinguish the company's sponsored investment products and services from those of its
competitors in the jurisdictions in which it operates, including the U.K., the U.S., the European Union, Australia, China, Japan and Singapore. These trademarks, service marks and trade names are important to
Henderson and, accordingly, the company enforces its trademark, service mark and trade name rights. The Henderson brand has been, and continues to be, extremely well received both in the asset management
industry and with clients.

Seasonality 

        Henderson's revenue streams are not seasonal in nature, with management fees and other income generally accruing evenly through the year. Performance fees are recognized when the prescribed
performance hurdles have been achieved and it is probable that the fee will be earned as a result. The hurdles coincide with the underlying fund year ends. The year ends of most of the SICAV funds fall in the
first half of the calendar year. In addition, given the uncertain nature of performance fees, they tend to fluctuate from period to period. Finance income includes interest received and investment income. While
interest received accrues over the year, investment income, which includes movements in seed capital investments, can fluctuate period to period. This fluctuation depends upon how that particular investment
performs each month.

Competition 

        The investment management industry is relatively mature and saturated with competitors that provide services similar to Henderson. As such, Henderson encounters significant competition in all areas of
its business. Henderson competes with other investment managers, mutual fund advisers, brokerage and investment banking firms, insurance companies, hedge funds, venture capitalists, banks and other
financial institutions, many of which are larger, have proprietary access to certain distribution channels, have a broader range of product choices and investment capabilities, and have greater capital resources.
Additionally, the marketplace for investment products is rapidly changing, investors are becoming more sophisticated, the demand for and access to investment advice and information is becoming more
widespread, passive investment strategies are becoming more prevalent, and more investors are demanding investment vehicles that are customized to their individual requirements. Henderson believes its
ability to successfully compete in the investment management industry significantly depends upon its ability to achieve consistently strong investment performance, provide exceptional client service and
strategic partnerships, and develop and innovate products that will best serve its clients.

Regulation 

        Henderson is subject to extensive regulation in every market in which it operates, as are some of the products and services it offers. In some cases its clients are also regulated and they may engage
Henderson's assistance to comply with those obligations. Virtually every aspect of Henderson's business is subject to various laws and regulations that continue to change and evolve over time as do the
supervisory requirements and expectations of regulators. The following summary covers financial services legislation under which Henderson entities are authorized to conduct their activities or under which
certain funds managed by Henderson entities are required to operate. However, as with any participant in the financial markets members of the Henderson group are subject to a range of other legal and
regulatory requirements in conducting their business or which otherwise affect their business including, for example, the EU Market Abuse Regulation (prohibiting inappropriate market conduct), the EU Money
Laundering Directive (on the detection and prevention of money laundering), the EU Transparency Directive (covering, among other things, disclosure of votes held in listed issuers) and the European Market
Infrastructure Regulation (on the reporting and clearing of derivative transactions).

U.K.

        The FCA regulates Henderson Group plc and certain of its subsidiaries and products and services it offers in the U.K. FCA authorization is required to conduct any investment management related business
in the U.K. under the FSMA. The FCA's rules and guidance under that act govern a firm's capital resources requirements, senior management arrangements, systems and controls, conduct of business and
interaction with clients and the markets. The FCA also regulates the design and

manufacture of investment funds intended for public distribution and, on a more limited basis, those that are for investment by professional investors.

Europe

        In addition to the above, certain of Henderson's U.K.-regulated entities must comply with a range of EU regulatory measures. Some of these apply directly to U.K. firms while others have been
implemented through member states' law. They include the EU Markets in Financial Instruments Directive, which we refer to as the MiFID. MiFID regulates the provision of investment services and conduct of
investment activities throughout the European Economic Area. MiFID establishes detailed requirements for the governance, organization and conduct of business of investment firms and regulated markets. It
also includes pre- and post-trade transparency requirements for equity markets and extensive transaction reporting requirements. These requirements will be substantially revised and extended to non-equities
from January 3, 2018 as a result of the implementation of the revised Markets in Financial Instruments Directive, which we refer to as MiFID II. MiFID II will have a substantial impact on the EU financial
services sector, including asset managers. The U.K. has adopted the MiFID rules into national legislation, principally via the FSMA and the FCA's rules. The other EU member states in which Henderson has a
presence have also implemented MiFID in their local legal and regulatory regimes.

        The EU's Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive, which we refer to as the AIFMD, was required to be transposed into EU member state law by July 2013 with a transitional period until July
2014. AIFMD regulates managers of, and service providers to, alternative investment funds, which we refer to as AIFs that are domiciled and offered in the EU and that are not authorized as retail funds under
the Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities Directive, which we refer to as UCITS. Henderson has two subsidiaries regulated as Alternative Investment Fund Managers. The AIFMD
also regulates the marketing within the EU of all AIFs, including those domiciled outside the EU. In general, AIFMD has a staged implementation up to 2018. Compliance with the AIFMD's requirements may
restrict AIF marketing and imposes compliance obligations in the form of remuneration policies, capital requirements, reporting requirements, leverage oversight, valuation, stakes in EU companies, the
domicile, duties and liability of custodians and liquidity management.

        UCITS are investment funds regulated at the EU level under the UCITS Directive V, which we refer to as UCITS V. UCITS are capable of being freely marketed throughout the EU on the basis of a single
authorisation in a member state—so-called passporting. UCITS V covers a range of matters relating to UCITS including the fund structure and domicile of UCITS, service providers to UCITS and marketing
arrangements.

U.S.

        Certain of Henderson's subsidiaries are subject to the rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC, FINRA, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which we refer to as the CFTC, the National
Futures Association, the Department of Treasury and the Department of Labor, and to various corporate governance and disclosure, privacy, anti-money laundering, anti-terrorist financing, and economic, trade
and other sanctions laws and regulations, both domestically and internationally. In some cases, Henderson's non-U.S. operations may also be subject to regulation by U.S. regulators, such as the Department of
Justice, the CFTC and the SEC (for example with respect to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977).

        Certain of Henderson's subsidiaries are registered with the SEC under the Advisers Act, the CFTC and/or licensed by various non-U.S. regulators. In addition, certain of Henderson's U.S. funds are
registered with the SEC under the Investment Company Act. These registrations, licenses and authorizations impose numerous obligations, as well as detailed operational requirements, on such

subsidiaries and such funds. The Advisers Act imposes numerous obligations on Henderson's registered investment adviser subsidiaries, including record keeping, operating and marketing requirements,
disclosure obligations and prohibitions on fraudulent activities. The Investment Company Act imposes similar obligations on the registered investment companies advised by Henderson's subsidiaries.

Luxembourg

        A Henderson subsidiary, Henderson Management S.A., which we refer to as HMSA, is authorized and regulated in Luxembourg by the Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier as a UCITS
Management Company. Two umbrella funds, namely Henderson Horizon Fund and Henderson Gartmore Fund, have appointed HMSA as their management company. Henderson Horizon Fund and Henderson
Gartmore Fund are open-ended investment companies incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg in the form of a SICAV authorized as a UCITS.

Singapore

        In Singapore, Henderson's subsidiary is subject to, among others, the Securities and Futures Act, the Financial Advisers Act and the subsidiary legislation promulgated pursuant to these acts, which are
administered by the Monetary Authority of Singapore. Henderson's asset management subsidiary and its employees conducting regulated activities specified in the Securities and Futures Act and/or the
Financial Advisers Act are required to be licensed with the Monetary Authority of Singapore.

Australia

        In Australia, Henderson's subsidiaries are subject to various Australian federal and state laws and are regulated by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, which we refer to as the ASIC.
ASIC regulates companies, financial markets and financial services in Australia. ASIC imposes certain conditions on licensed financial services organizations that apply to the company's subsidiaries, including
requirements relating to capital resources, operational capability and controls. As the CDIs are quoted and traded on the financial market operated by ASX, Henderson is also required to comply with the ASX
listing rules and the ASX Principles.

Hong Kong

        In Hong Kong, Henderson's subsidiary is subject to the Securities and Futures Ordinance, which we refer to as the SFO, and its subsidiary legislation, which governs the securities and futures markets and
regulates, among others, offers of investments to the public and provides for the licensing of dealing in securities and asset management activities and intermediaries. This legislation is administered by the
Securities and Futures Commission, which we refer to as the SFC. The SFC is also empowered under the SFO to establish standards for compliance as well as codes and guidelines. Henderson's subsidiary and
its employees conducting any of the regulated activities specified in the SFO are required to be licensed with the SFC, and are subject to the rules, codes and guidelines issued by the SFC from time to time.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF HENDERSON 

Business Overview 

        For an overview of Henderson's business, please refer to the section entitled "Business of Henderson" beginning on page 176.

        For purposes of this section each reference to the "Group" refers to Henderson Group plc and its consolidated subsidiaries.

Segment Considerations

        Although Henderson is a global investment manager and manages a range of investment products, operating across various product lines, distribution channels and geographic regions, information is
reported to the chief operating decision-maker, the Henderson board, on an aggregated basis. Strategic and financial management decisions are determined centrally by the Henderson board and, on this basis,
the Group is a single segment investment management business.

Revenue

        Revenue primarily consists of management fees and performance fees. Management fee revenues are generally based upon a percentage of the market value of assets under management and are calculated
as a percentage of either the daily, month end or quarter end average asset balance in accordance with contractual agreements. Accordingly, fluctuations in the financial markets have a direct effect on the
Group's operating results. Assets under management may outperform or underperform the financial markets.

        Performance fees are specified in certain fund and clients contracts and are based on investment performance either on an absolute basis or compared to an established index over a specified period of time.
This is often subject to a hurdle rate. Performance fees are recognized at the end of the contractual period (typically quarterly or annually) if the stated performance criteria are achieved.

2016 Summary 

        In 2016, Henderson achieved operating income of $232.1 million, a decrease of 26.9% (2015: $317.3 million) driven by lower revenue. Revenue was $999.9 million, down 13.4% (2015: $1,155.1 million).
This reduction was driven primarily by lower performance fees of $54.8 million (2015: $150.8 million) in a period of significant market volatility. Management fees—the Group's principal revenue stream—
decreased by 5.1% to $867.8 million (2015: $914.7 million), primarily driven by adverse FX movements in 2016 as pounds sterling, the Group's functional currency, weakened against the U.S. dollar.
Management fee margins fell to 66.9 bps largely due to mix shifts following outflows from retail products and institutional inflows, and other one-off effects.

        Total operating expenses decreased by 8.4% to $767.8 million (2015: $837.8 million) driven by a decrease in distribution expenses and employee compensation and benefits expenses. This was offset by
increased one-off expenses following the proposed merger with Janus in 2016.

        Net income decreased by 46.5% to $177.3 million (2015: $331.4 million), reflecting lower operating income, lower investment gains recognized compared to 2015 and an increased tax charge for the
period.

        Henderson's ordinary dividend in respect of 2016 increased to 10.5 pence per share (2015: 10.3 pence per share).

Table of Contents

        The Group's functional currency is pounds sterling and, as a result of presenting the financial statements in U.S. Dollars, is subject to foreign currency fluctuations. Analysis excluding this translation effect
can be found below under "—Non-GAAP Financial Measures."

Investment Performance of Assets Under Management 

        In 2016, market conditions proved to be challenging for the investment management teams. On a three year basis, 77% of assets outperformed, demonstrating the Group's ability to deliver exceptional long
term track records for clients. On a one year basis, performance was weaker, with 50% of assets outperforming.

        One year performance was weakest in the European Equities and Global Equities capabilities. At the beginning of 2016, some of Henderson's largest European funds saw a period of poor investment
performance as concerns over China and a rally in the energy sector heavily impacted markets. In Global Equities, performance in many funds suffered throughout the year because of a lack of exposure to the
United States and the U.S. dollar.

        However, the Group has a wide range of investment teams with independent investment styles and theses, which means that even in tough market conditions, there are a range of investment ideas to discuss
with clients.

Assets Under Management 

        The Group's assets under management (AUM) as at December 31, 2016 were $124.7 billion, a decrease of $10.8 billion or 8% from December 31, 2015, driven by adverse FX movements of $13.1 billion
and net outflows of $5.3 billion, partially offset by positive market movements of $7.6 billion.

        FX movements reduced AUM by $13.1 billion. In this period, the dollar strengthened against all major currencies. As at December 31, 2016, approximately 80% of Henderson's AUM was non-USD
denominated, resulting in an adverse currency effect, particularly in products exposed to pounds sterling, which weakened significantly during the year following the U.K.'s referendum on EU membership in
June 2016.

        Asset and flows by capability for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 are as follows (in millions):

        By capability, European Equities AUM decreased by $5.8 billion or 19.2% from $30.1 billion at December 31, 2015, to $24.3 billion at December 31, 2016, driven by net outflows in the period and adverse
FX movements on non-U.S. dollar denominated assets, partially offset by positive market movements. Global Equities AUM increased by $0.4 billion to $42.0 billion at December 31, 2016, primarily due to net
inflows and market gains being offset by adverse FX movements on non-US dollar denominated assets. Global Fixed Income AUM decreased by $1.9 billion, with slightly positive net flows and favorable
market movements, more than offset by adverse FX movements. Multi-asset AUM decreased by $0.9 billion driven by adverse FX movements and net outflows, partly offset by positive market movements. In
Alternatives, the Group saw a 13.1% decline in AUM to $17.5 billion at December 31, 2016, reflecting net outflows and adverse FX movements, slightly offset by positive markets.

political events unfolded, most notably the U.K.'s referendum on EU membership and the U.S. Presidential election.

        In the U.K., the Group saw increased outflows in the aftermath of the U.K.'s referendum on EU membership on June 23, 2016, as clients pulled back from investing in European assets. The Group saw an
acceleration of outflows from the Henderson UK Property Fund and trading was suspended on July 5, 2016 allowing the fund to dispose of assets and rebuild liquidity. The fund re-opened on October 14, 2016,
with modest redemptions. The Group's product range helped to mitigate the impact of the U.K. referendum, with good demand for U.K. absolute return and fixed income strategies. The Group also benefited
from positive flows in the Australian Retail fund range, captured within the Group's "UK OEICs/Unit Trusts/Other" product line.

        Retail SICAV flows turned negative in 2016, as clients reduced their exposure to European assets and held higher proportions of their portfolios in cash. Outflows were dominated by European focused
funds, but the Group saw positive flows into low volatility strategies as clients sought downside protection.

        US mutual fund flows were broadly flat for the first half of the year but turned negative following the U.K. referendum. Fund outflows accelerated in the second half of the year, reflecting a reversal in
demand for non-U.S. assets and the outcome of the U.S. Presidential election.

        The Institutional business had a successful year, with positive net flows of $0.6 billion.

        Despite net outflows at the start of the year driven by previously notified redemptions and the closure of funds in areas of limited client demand, flows were particularly strong in the second half of the year,
reflecting the Group's continued success in its core U.K. business and an increasingly global client base in Continental Europe, the U.S. and Australia. Most notably, the Group saw early success in its Global
Emerging Markets strategy.

        In recent years, the Group has been building global Institutional-grade strategies and in 2016, it was encouraging to see increasingly diverse sources of flow by client, geography and strategy. The pipeline
of new business—notified but unfunded—remains strong following the recent announcement of the recommended merger with Janus.

Average Assets Under Management

        The following table presents the average assets under management, split by Channel for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 (in millions):

Valuation of Assets Under Management

        The fair value of assets under management is based on the values of the underlying cash and investment securities of the Henderson Funds, Trusts and Segregated Mandates. A large proportion of these
securities are listed or quoted on a recognized securities exchange or market and are regularly traded thereon; these investments are valued based on unadjusted quoted market prices. Investments

including, but not limited to, over-the-counter derivative contracts, which are dealt in or through a clearing firm, exchange or financial institution will be valued by reference to the most recent official settlement
price quoted by the appointed market vendor and in the event no price is available from this source, a broker quotation may be used. Physical property held is valued monthly by a specialist independent
appraiser.

        When a readily ascertainable market value does not exist for an investment, the fair value is calculated based on the expected cash flows of its underlying net asset base, taking into account applicable
discount rates and other factors. Judgement is used to ascertain if a formerly active market has become inactive and in determining fair values when markets have become inactive. A Fair Value Pricing
Committee is responsible for determining or approving these unquoted prices, which are reported to those charged with governance of the Funds and Trusts.

        In funds which invest in markets that are closed at their valuation point, an assessment is made daily to determine whether a fair value pricing adjustment is required to the funds' valuation. This may be due
to significant market movements in other correlated open markets, scheduled market closures or unscheduled market closures as a result of natural disaster or government intervention.

        Third party administrators hold a key role in the collection and validation of prices used in the valuation of the securities. Daily price validation is completed using techniques such as day on day tolerance
movements, invariant prices, excessive movement checks and intra vendor tolerance checks. The Henderson Data Management Team performs oversight of this process and completes annual due diligence on
the processes of third parties.

        Henderson leverages the expertise of its fund management teams across the business to cross invest assets to create value for its clients. Where cross investment occurs, assets and flows are identified and
the duplication is removed from Henderson's results.

Results of Operations 

        Information is reported to the chief operating decision-maker, the Henderson board, on an aggregated basis. Strategic and financial management decisions are determined centrally by the Henderson board
and, on this basis, the Group is a single segment investment management business.

Revenues

Management fees

        Management fees decreased by $46.9 million (5.1%) from 2015 to 2016, despite average AUM increasing by 1.3% year on year. Although average institutional AUM increased by 6.1%, average retail
AUM decreased by 1.5% resulting in a mix shift from higher margin retail to lower margin institutional. In addition, management fee margins decreased as retail clients continued to switch AUM to clean-fee
share classes (classes where advisor commissions and platform charges are unbundled from the fund fee, the fees charged in clean fee share classes are solely for the fund manager. Clean fee share classes were
created in response to the Retail Distribution Review regulation in the U.K.). As a

result, distribution costs also fell during the period. One-off fee adjustments also contributed to the reduction in management fees. Consequently, total fee margins declined from 71.6 bps in 2015 to 66.9 bps in
2016.

        The impact of FX, markets and 2016 outflows caused a net decrease in management fees, which was offset by a net favorable full year impact of 2015 inflows and the full year favorable impact of
acquisitions.

        Management fees increased by $27.4 million (3.1%) from 2014 to 2015. Average assets under management were 5% higher in 2015 compared to 2014 mainly due to net inflows for 2015 and the full year
impact of 2014 inflows. The disposal of the discontinued Property business of $19.7 billion of assets on April 1, 2014 reduced management fees by $23.5 million. The wind down of Private Equity funds
reduced management fees in 2015 compared to 2014 by $18.3 million, with assets under management at year end reduced from $1.3 billion at December 31, 2014 to $0.1 billion at December 31, 2015. In
addition, other net acquisition and disposal activity (excluding equity method investment AUM) in 2015 contributed $7.1 billion of AUM with 2014 contributing $2.2 billion.

        Weighted average management fee rates, by capability consisted of the following for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014:

        Total management fee margins decreased by 4.7 bps, (6.6%) from 2015 to 2016. The decrease was driven by a decline in Global Fixed Income and Global Equities due to the acquisition of Perennial in
Australia in November 2015 at lower than average margins. This, combined with the average AUM mix in 2016 marginally moving from retail towards institutional (at lower than average margins), and the
continued switching of retail clients to clean-fee share-classes (as a result of the Retail Distribution Review in the U.K), have further contributed to reductions across most capabilities (note that this also reduces
distribution costs). Alternatives margins have increased by 3.8% as a result of positive net inflows from the UK Absolute Return OEIC and SICAV funds in 2016 and the wind-down of the Private Equity
business which resulted in a one-off fee reduction in 2015.

        Total management fee margins decreased by 1.6 bps (2.2%) from 2014 to 2015. The decrease was driven by a 7.8% decline in Global Fixed Income due to the funding of a $2.7 billion mandate in February
2015 to an existing client which was fee neutral, and the acquisition of Perennial in Australia in November 2015 at lower than average margins. In addition margins in Global Equities declined by 5.4% due to
the full year impact of the acquisition of Geneva, a U.S. equity institutional fund manager, in November 2014. Alternatives margins increased by 16.5% following the disposal of the Property business in 2014
which was at lower than average margins, offset slightly by the wind down of the Private Equity business. Multi Asset margins increased by 11.8% following the disposal of Intrinsic in December 2014 which
was at a lower than average margin for Multi Asset. Higher Retail AUM in 2015 had a positive mix impact on margins across most capabilities, however this was partially offset by switching to clean-fee share-
classes (as a result of the Retail Distribution Review in the U.K.).

Performance fees

        Performance fees are derived across a number of product ranges including both pooled funds and segregated mandates. Pooled fund performance fees are recognized on a quarterly or annual basis, while
segregated mandates are generally recognized on an annual basis. Performance fees by product type consisted of the following for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 (in millions):

        For the year ended December 31, 2016, performance fees decreased by $96.0 million compared to 2015, primarily due to lower SICAV fees which for long only funds typically only pay out a performance
fee if relative and absolute performance is positive. Key funds driving the lower SICAV fees included lower performance fees on the UK Absolute Return SICAV fund and no fees on both the Henderson
Horizon Pan European Alpha and Henderson Horizon Pan European Equity funds. Offshore Absolute Return fees decreased by 64.3% in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to lower performance fees on
pooled hedge funds and managed accounts and the closure of Alphagen Japan Absolute Return fund. 52 funds yielded a performance fee in 2016 (2015: 78) out of 107 funds with performance fee potential.

        For the year ended December 31, 2015, performance fees increased by $6.5 million compared to 2014, primarily due to higher performance fees in the SICAV fund range, offset by lower Offshore Absolute
Return performance fees and no Property Fund performance fees following the sale of the Property business in the first half of 2014. 78 funds yielded a performance fee in 2015 (2014: 76) out of over 120 funds
with performance fee potential.

Other revenue

        Other revenue largely comprises the U.K. OEICs & Unit Trust General Administration charge (GAC), which reimburses the Group for certain administration activities undertaken on behalf of the U.K.
retail fund range. Other revenue decreased $12.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 2015 of which $10.1 million is due to the adverse impact of translation of non U.S. dollar
denominated income.

        Other revenue increased $15.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014. This is due to the increase in 12b-1 fees, an increase in revenue from Crux Asset Management following
the disposal of the European Special Situations fund and an increase in GAC due to higher average AUM on the U.K. OEICs and Unit Trust product range. This is largely offset by an adverse impact of
translation of non U.S. dollar denominated income and transaction fees in 2014, not recurring in 2015 that related to the divested Property business.

Operating expenses

Employee compensation and benefits

        During the year ended December 31, 2016, employee compensation and benefits decreased $43.6 million (13.7%), compared to 2015, which was primarily driven by the favorable impact of translation of
non U.S. dollar denominated expense of $35.9 million. Fixed staff costs increased by $19.4 million, predominantly reflecting the full year impact of significant investment in additional headcount in 2015 both
organically, and through acquisition ($11.6 million) which included a full year of the Perennial acquisition and Australian operations build out in 2015. The remainder of the increase related to wage increases.
Bonus costs decreased $27.1 million largely reflecting weaker business performance, primarily with respect to shorter term investment performance, including lower performance fees and net outflows of retail
AUM in the period.

        During the year ended December 31, 2015, employee compensation and benefits increased $4.8 million, compared to 2014. Fixed employee compensation increased $20.7 million, predominantly reflecting
significant investment in additional headcount both organically and through acquisition of $10.8 million, which included a full year impact of the Geneva acquisition in 2014, and two months from the Perennial
acquisition and Australian operations build out in 2015. The remainder of the increase related to wage increases and an increase in pension costs. Bonus costs increased $21.3 million as result of the Group's
remuneration schemes being structured to reward strong business performance, principally good investment performance and record net inflows of AUM. Offsetting these factors was the favorable translation
effect of non U.S. dollar expenses of $22.6 million and the Property business costs incurred for the first quarter of 2014 until the Group's disposal of the Property business of $14.6 million.

Long-term incentive compensation

        Long term incentive compensation increased by $1.6 million from 2015 to 2016. $11.3 million of the increase is primarily due to higher amortization of bonus deferrals which were in turn a function of
increasing bonus awards throughout the last three years. This was partially offset by lower social security costs on award vestings as a result of a decrease in share price, lower costs relating to awards with total
shareholder return ('TSR') market performance conditions and by the favorable impact of translation of non U.S. dollar denominated expense of $9.7 million.

        Long-term incentive compensation increased $10.6 million from 2014 to 2015. $18.5 million was primarily due to higher amortization of bonus deferrals as outlined above. Additionally, a higher share
price increased social security costs on award vestings. Offsetting these factors was the favorable translation effect of non U.S. dollar expenses of $5.5 million and the Property business costs incurred for the
first quarter of 2014 until the Group's disposal of the business of $2.4 million.

Distribution expenses

        Distribution expenses are paid to financial intermediaries for the distribution of Henderson's retail investment products and are typically calculated based on the amount of the intermediary sourced AUM.
For the year ended December 31, 2016, distribution expenses decreased by $26.5 million which was mainly due to AUM switching towards clean-fee share classes (as a result of the Retail Distribution Review
in the U.K.) and lower average Retail AUM caused a further decrease, offset by one-off adjustments.

        For the year ended December 31, 2015, distribution expenses increased by $16.3 million mainly due to higher average assets under management, with average Retail AUM increasing approximately 10%
year on year.

Amortization and depreciation

        Amortization and depreciation expense increased by $4.4 million compared to 2015. $4.9 million is due to the impairment of Gartmore Investment Management Contracts from the planned disposal of the
Volantis UK Small Cap alternative team assets in 2017, a full year's amortization from the acquisition of Perennial $1.5 million and other adverse increases of $2.9 million following the on-going investment in
platforms. These were offset by a $2.2 million reduction to Gartmore client relationship amortization and a $2.7 million favorable translation impact of non U.S. dollar denominated expenses.

        Amortization and depreciation expense increased $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014. This was primarily driven by a full year's amortization of client relationships
recognized as part of the Geneva acquisition.

Investment administration

        Investment administration costs have decreased by $2.1 million, 4.3% compared to 2015, due to a favorable $5.5 million translation impact of non U.S dollar denominated expenses. This was offset by the
full year impact of increased expense from Australian acquisitions ($2.2 million) and higher middle office costs ($1.2 million).

        For the year ended December 31, 2015, investment administration expenses decreased by $1.7 million compared to 2014, mainly due to the favorable impact of translation of $3.6 million and one quarter's
costs in 2014 relating to the Property business. This was offset by one-off outsourced administration charges of $3.1 million incurred in 2015.

General, administrative and occupancy

        General, administrative and occupancy decreased by $3.8 million, 3.0%, compared to 2015. The Group was impacted by FX on translation to the reporting currency of $14.4 million and to the functional
currency $5.2 million. Other favorable variances included $6.0 million of costs due to lower recruitment activity and a number of one off legal and professional costs incurred in 2015. This was offset by
$7.5 million of deal costs associated with the proposed Janus merger, increases in information technology costs of $6.1 million driven by ongoing investment and support of the IT infrastructure and platforms
and office expenses increases of $1.2 million due to the Australian acquisitions and upgrades to the Singapore office. The remaining $7.0 million increase comprised various adverse variances, including an
increase in irrecoverable U.K. Value Added Tax, increase to marketing expenditure following higher sales activity and other smaller items across several expense categories.

        For the year ended December 31, 2015, general, administrative and occupancy decreased by $1.3 million compared to 2014. The first quarter 2014 costs of the divested Property business were
$11.8 million which did not recur in 2015. A favorable impact was due to FX of $1.8 million (favorable translation to the reporting currency of $9.3 million offset by adverse translation to the functional
currency ($7.5 million)). These were offset by $4.0 million higher legal and professional costs in 2015 relating to regulatory fees, costs associated with the Private Equity business wind down and a number of
Group and regulation change projects progressing throughout 2015. In addition information technology costs were $3.0 million higher, including market data expenses as a result of additional users, ongoing
investment and support of the IT infrastructure and higher network costs as a result of increased headcount and offices (including those relating to the Perennial acquisition). The remaining $5.3 million increase
comprised various items, including an increase to marketing costs and other adverse variances.

Non-operating income and expenses 

Interest expense

        Interest expense mainly consists of interest on the 7.25% Senior Notes due 2016, which we refer to as the 2016 Senior Notes. Following the repayment of the 2016 Senior Notes in March 2016, the expense
has decreased by $13.5 million compared to 2015, including a favorable translation impact of $2.3 million.

        For the year ended December 31, 2015, interest expense increased by $0.8 million compared to 2014, mainly due to a full year of deferred consideration finance charges relating to the Geneva acquisition
and one-off interest costs, offset by a $1.4 million favorable translation impact.

Investment (losses)/gains, net

        The components of investment (losses)/gains, net for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, were as follows (in millions):

        Investment gains decreased by $51.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to 2015, mainly as a result of gains made in 2015 not recurring. This was primarily due to a gain on sale of
equity method investments of $18.9 million which related to the disposal of the THRE joint venture during 2015 and a gain on sale of available-for-sale investments of $18.3 million on the disposal of the
property fund seed capital investments. In addition in 2016, the firm recorded an unrealized loss on a legacy Asian private equity investment of $17.7 million, mainly as a result of macro-economic issues in
India.

        Investment gains decreased by $246.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to 2014, mainly due to the gain on the disposal of the Property business in 2014. On April 1, 2014, the
Group completed transactions which resulted in the disposal of the Property business and simultaneously recognized a 40% share in a newly formed joint venture, THRE, which was accounted for as an equity
method investment. The Group recognized a gain on disposal of the Property business of $245.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 and subsequently recognized a gain of $18.9 million on
disposal of its 40% share of THRE during the year ended December 31, 2015. During 2014, the Group also disposed of its 50% stake in Intrinsic, which was accounted for as an equity method investment,
recognizing a gain on sale of $18.9 million.

Other non-operating(loss)/income, net

        The components of other non-operating (loss)/income, net for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, are as follows (in millions):

        The loss from equity method investments increased to $3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to a loss of $1.0 million for 2015. This was mainly due to an impairment of Northern
Pines ahead of its wind-up.

Table of Contents

        The loss from equity method investments declined to $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to a loss of $3.4 million for 2014. This was mainly due to THRE establishment costs
which were recognized in 2014, offset by a lower share of income in 2015 following the disposals of THRE in the first half of 2015 and Intrinsic in the second half of 2014.

Income Tax Provision

        For the year ended December 31, 2016, the Group's effective tax rate increased to 16.3% (tax charge of $34.6 million) from 1.8% (tax charge of $6.1 million) for the year ended December 31, 2015. The
increase in the effective tax rate was due to a number of 2015 tax benefits that either did not occur in 2016 or did not occur at the same level in 2016 and changes in the Group's global mix of pre-tax profits and
business growth in higher tax jurisdictions. In addition, 2016 included non-deductible deal costs associated with the proposed merger with Janus which accounted for the remainder of the effective tax rate
movement between the two years. In 2015, the Group benefitted from $7.6 million relating to the Group's disposal of THRE and the Property business, the tax impact of which was finalized in 2015,
$10.5 million on settlement of positions with the U.K. tax authorities and $3.4 million on other prior year adjustments.

        For the year ended December 31, 2015, the Group's effective tax rate decreased to 1.8% (tax charge of $6.1 million) from 9.3% (tax charge of $52.6 million) for the year ended December 31, 2014. The
decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to 2015 tax benefits that either did not occur in 2014 or did not occur at the same level in 2014. In 2015, the tax benefits included $8.1 million relating to the
reduction in corporation tax rates in the U.K. giving rise to credits on the revaluation of certain deferred tax balances, $12.4 million tax benefits arising from the exercise of share based compensation awards
granted to employees and $10.5 million tax credits on settlement of positions with the U.K. tax authorities.

        For the year ending December 31, 2017, the completion of the merger is anticipated to increase the Group's effective tax rate. Further, the impact of future enacted tax rate or tax law changes in the
jurisdictions of our operations, changes in the Group's mix of pre-tax profits and future tax benefit arising from the exercise of share based compensation awards granted to our employees are difficult to predict
and can significantly affect the Group's eventual effective tax rate for the year.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

        Henderson reports its financial results in accordance with U.S. GAAP. However, in the opinion of the Henderson board the profitability of the Group and its ongoing operations is best evaluated using
additional non-GAAP financial measures. Management uses these performance measures to evaluate the business and adjusted values are consistent with internal management reporting.

external parties who perform functions on behalf of, and distribute, the Group's managed AUM. In 2014, this figure represents the distribution expenses excluding those associated
with the discontinued Property business.

(2) On April 1, 2014, the Group completed transactions which resulted in the disposal of the Property business and simultaneous recognition of a 40% share in the newly formed joint
venture, THRE. Prior to the disposal, the Group continued to consolidate the Property business and recognized net income from its operations for the first quarter of 2014. The
Property business was not able to be classified as a discontinued operation due to the holding of the 40% share in THRE and consequently maintaining exposure to the business.
However, the Henderson board does not believe that the first quarter's Property business result represented the ongoing operations of the Group. 

(3) Investment management contracts have been identified as a separately identifiable intangible asset arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries and businesses. Such contracts are
recognized at the net present value of the expected future cash flows arising from the contracts at the date of acquisition. For segregated mandate contracts, the intangible asset is
amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected life of the contracts. The Henderson board believe these non-cash and acquisition related costs do not represent the ongoing
operations of the Group. 

(4) Other acquisition related items primarily represent void property costs inherited on the acquisition of the New Star and Gartmore businesses in 2009 and 2011 respectively. They
reflect the net present values of the excess of lease rentals and other payments over the amounts expected to be recovered from subletting these properties. This category also
includes deferred consideration costs, being earn-out costs of key owner / employees secured from previous acquisitions and contingent consideration payable to the vendors of
those businesses. The Henderson board believes these costs do not represent the ongoing operations of the Group. 

(5) Transaction related costs and net gains on disposals represented the following transactions: establishment of THRE (2014), disposal of Intrinsic (2014), acquisition of Geneva
Capital LLC (2014), acquisition of Perennial (2015), 90 West (2015) and proposed merger integration and transaction costs with Janus (2016), due to complete in 2017. The
Henderson board believes these costs and gains do not represent the ongoing operations of the Group. 

(6) In 2014, other non-recurring items included a partial refund to the Group of $4.8 million relating to amounts previously paid in respect of the 2010/2011 Keydata cross subsidy levy
to the U.K. Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS). In 2015, a $0.2 million gain was recognized on the revaluation of the Group's previous 41.4% stake in 90 West, based
on the transaction price on May 29, 2015 when the Group acquired the remaining 58.6% of shares of 90 West. In 2016, the Group impaired its investment in Northern Pines as a
result of the wind up of the business ($3.7 million). The Henderson board believes these gains and costs do not represent the ongoing operations of the Group as they were one off in
nature. 

(7) On April 1, 2014, the Group completed transactions which resulted in the disposal of the Property Business. This reflects the profit on disposal, net of any deal and separation costs. 

(8) Operating income divided by revenues. 

(9) Adjusted operating income divided by adjusted revenues. 

(10) The tax impact of the non-GAAP adjustments are calculated based on the U.S. or foreign statutory tax rate as they relate to each non-GAAP adjustment. A number of the non-GAAP
adjustments are either not taxable or not deductible for tax purposes and these primarily include the following: deferred consideration costs (footnote 4); establishment costs and
profit on disposal of THRE, disposal of Intrinsic, certain costs associated with the acquisition of Geneva

Constant Dollar analysis of Net Income

        The Group's functional currency is pounds sterling and as a result of presenting the financial statements in U.S. Dollars is subject to foreign currency fluctuations. In the tables below, the Group reports net
income attributable to Henderson on a 'constant dollar' basis assuming the 2015 and 2014 comparatives are translated at the 2016 and 2015 rates, respectively.

        Constant dollar reporting is a non-GAAP financial measure that shows the impact of changes in exchange rates on the translation from the Group's functional currency to its reporting currency, to facilitate
a comparative view that assists the reader in better understanding underlying core operating performance. Movements in the balances presented below have been explained in the earlier analysis.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

        Henderson's capital structure, together with available cash balances, cash flows generated from operations, and further capital and credit market activities, if necessary, should provide the Group with
sufficient resources to meet present and future cash needs, including operating and other obligations as they fall due and anticipated future capital requirements.

        Henderson is subject to regulatory oversight by the SEC, FINRA, the FCA and other international regulatory bodies. The Group ensures it is compliant with its regulatory obligations at all times. The FCA,
currently the Group's lead regulator, imposes consolidated capital requirements on the Group's operations. In February 2017, following feedback from the FCA from its periodic review of the Group's capital
position, Henderson's standalone capital requirement was £216.0 million, resulting in capital

above the Group's regulatory requirement of £69.0 million ($85.3 million) as at December 31, 2016 (2015: £100.0 million ($147.4 million)) based upon Henderson's internal calculations.

Short-Term Liquidity and Capital Resources 

        The following table summarizes key balance sheet data relating to Henderson's liquidity and capital resources as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 (in millions):

        Cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of cash at bank. Cash and cash equivalents and investment securities held by consolidated VIEs are not available for general corporate purposes and have been
excluded from the table above.

        The Group believes that existing cash and cash from operations should be sufficient to satisfy its short-term capital requirements. Expected short-term uses of cash include ordinary operating expenditures,
seed capital investments, dividend payments, income tax payments and deal and integration costs in relation to the proposed merger. Henderson may also use available cash for other general corporate purposes
and acquisitions.

Common Stock Repurchases

        There were no share repurchases under share repurchase programs during 2016. On September 8, 2015 the Henderson board announced a £25.0 million share repurchase program. During the year ended
December 31, 2015, the Group repurchased and immediately cancelled 4,363,334 ordinary shares at an average price of £2.80 ($4.13) per share and 4,649,467 CDIs at an average price of AUD$5.87 ($4.51) per
share. The total cost of the share buy backs was £25.0 million ($38.2 million). The Group has no commitments to repurchase additional capital stock. Any future repurchases of ordinary shares or CDIs will
depend upon prevailing market conditions, the Group's liquidity requirements, contractual and legal restrictions, and other factors.

Dividends

        The payment of cash dividends is within the discretion of the Henderson board and depends on many factors, including, but not limited to the Group's results of operations, financial condition, capital
requirements, general business conditions and legal requirements. Dividends are subject to semi-annual declaration by the Henderson board. The Group declares dividends in pounds sterling.

        Dividends declared and paid during the year ended December 31, 2016, representing the final 2015 and interim 2016 dividends respectively were:

        During 2015, Henderson declared and paid two dividends of 6.40p and 3.10p per share, representing the final 2014 and interim 2015 dividends respectively.

        On February 8, 2017, the Henderson board recommended a final dividend in respect of the year ended December 31, 2016 of 7.30 pence per share.

        Subsequent to execution of the merger agreement, Janus and Henderson agreed to separately pay regular quarterly cash dividends in respect of the first quarter 2017 during the second quarter 2017, subject
to respective board approvals.

Long-Term Liquidity and Capital Resources

        The following table presents long-term contractual obligations and associated maturities at December 31, 2016 (in millions):

        The information presented above does not include commitments for capital expenditures in the normal course of business. The Group expects to fund its long-term commitments using existing cash, cash
generated from operations or by accessing capital and credit markets as necessary.

        For additional details on the Group's operating lease commitments see Note 18—"Commitments and Contingencies" to the Consolidated Financial Statements of Henderson Group plc and its subsidiaries
for the year ended December 31, 2016.

        The Group's latest triennial valuation of its defined benefit pension plan has resulted in a deficit on a technical provision's basis of $35.8 million (£29.0 million). The Group has agreed with the trustees of
the plan to make contributions of $10.4 million (£8.4 million) per year for four years starting from 2017 to recover the deficit.

        The Group believes that it will have sufficient resources to satisfy its long-term liquidity requirements.

7.25% Senior Notes due 2016

        In March 2011, Henderson issued £150.0 million ($240.4 million) of 7.25% Senior Notes due 2016, which were unsecured and repayable in full on March 24, 2016. The 2016 Senior Notes were repaid in
full at their maturity on March 24, 2016. The 2016 Senior Notes paid interest at 7.25% semi-annually on March 24 and September 24. The Group was in compliance with all covenants attached to the 2016
Senior Notes up to the date of their maturity. The covenants included the requirement to provide notice of any actual or potential default event and the preparation of audited accounts for each accounting period.

Contingent Consideration

        Contingent consideration was a component of the purchase price of both Geneva, acquired on October 1, 2014 and Perennial, acquired on November 1, 2015. See Note 5—"Acquisitions" to the
Consolidated Financial Statements of Henderson Group plc and its subsidiaries for the year ended December 31, 2016.

        The consideration on acquisition of Geneva was structured as an upfront payment of up to $130.0 million, with two further contingent tranches of up to $45.0 million and $25.0 million, payable over six
years. The Group made an initial upfront payment of $120.5 million during 2014 based on the revenue run rate at a date just before acquisition, measured against defined revenue targets set out in the sale and
purchase agreement, together with a payment of $3.8 million for the net assets of Geneva. The $9.5 million shortfall between the $120.5 million initial payment and the $130.0 million maximum

can still become payable if Geneva's revenues meet the revenue targets over the next five years. As a result, the Group has a deferred contingent liability of between $nil and $79.5 million. The fair value of the
contingent consideration is estimated at each reporting date by forecasting revenue, as defined by the sale and purchase agreement, over the contingency period, and determining whether targets will be met.
Significant unobservable inputs used in the valuation are limited to forecast revenues which factor in expected growth in AUM based on performance and industry trends. Increases in forecast revenue increase
the fair value of the consideration, while decreases in forecast revenues would decrease the fair value. Contingent consideration of $20.3 million was included in "other non-current liabilities" on Henderson's
Consolidated Balance Sheet as at December 31, 2016.

        The Perennial contingent consideration is payable in 2017 and 2019 if revenues of the Perennial equities business meet certain targets. The total maximum payment over the entire contingent consideration
period is $10.9 million as of December 31, 2016. In addition, there is a maximum amount of $37.4 million payable in two tranches in 2019 and 2020, which have employee service conditions attached ("earn
out") and are based on net management fee revenue. The earn-out is recognized as a compensation expense. At December 31, 2016, the total of contingent consideration and earn out had a fair value of
$5.2 million, which is included in "other non-current liabilities" on Henderson's Consolidated Balance Sheet as at December 31, 2016.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

        Other than contractual obligations relating to certain operating lease agreements outlined in Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements of Henderson Group plc and its subsidiaries for the year ended
December 31, 2016, the Group is not party to any off-balance sheet arrangements that may provide, or require the Group to provide, financing, liquidity, market or credit risk support that is not reflected in the
Group's Consolidated Financial Statements.

Other Sources of Liquidity

        On February 10, 2016, a Group subsidiary entered into a one year revolving credit facility for £30.0 million to ensure that the Group had sufficient access to liquidity following repayment of the 2016
Senior Notes. On February 3, 2017, the Group subsidiary renewed this facility for an additional one year period. There have been no amounts drawn down under the facility. The subsidiary has been in
compliance with all covenants relating to the facility throughout its term to date, which included maintaining minimum equity of £150.0 million within the subsidiary and ensuring external borrowings do not
exceed 30% of the subsidiary's net worth.

        On February 16, 2017, the Group entered into a five-year, $200.0 million unsecured, multi-currency revolving credit facility, which we refer to as the Janus Henderson Facility, with Bank of America
Merrill Lynch International Limited as agent. The Janus Henderson Facility includes an option for Janus Henderson to request an increase to the overall amount of the Janus Henderson Facility of up to an
additional $50.0 million. The Janus Henderson Facility has a maturity date of February 16, 2022 with two one year extension options which can be exercised at the discretion of Janus Henderson with the
lenders' consent on the first and second anniversary of the date of the agreement, respectively. The Janus Henderson Facility is guaranteed by Janus (but only for such period as of Janus's 4.875% Notes due
2025 and Janus's 0.75% Convertible Notes due 2018 are outstanding, in each case with Janus as issuer).

        The Janus Henderson Facility will be effective upon closing of the merger and may be used for general corporate purposes. The Janus Henderson Facility bears interest on borrowings outstanding at the
relevant interbank offer rate plus a spread, which is based on Janus's credit rating provided that if, following closing of the merger, Janus Henderson obtains two or more credit ratings, then the credit

rating in respect of Janus Henderson shall then be the relevant credit rating for the purposes of determining applicable margin.

        The Janus Henderson Facility contains a financial covenant with respect to leverage. The financing leverage ratio cannot exceed 3.00x EBITDA. At the latest practicable date, before the date of this proxy
statement/prospectus, Henderson was in compliance with all covenants and, as the Janus Henderson Facility becomes available from closing, there were no borrowings under the Janus Henderson Facility.

        Upon closing of the merger, the Group's existing £30.0 million facility will terminate.

Cash Flows 

        A summary of cash flow data for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 was as follows (in millions):

Operating Activities

        Fluctuations in operating cash flows are attributable to changes in net income and working capital items, which can vary from period to period based on the amount and timing of cash receipts and
payments. Operating cash flows include the receipt of management fees and performance fees, offset by the payment of operating expenses and income taxes. Operating cash flows have reduced from
$388.9 million in the year ending December 31, 2015, to $235.1 million in the year ending December 31, 2016, primarily due to a $154.1 million reduction in net income.

        Cash outflows from financing activities were $338.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2016 (2015: $221.5 million, 2014: $168.1 million), primarily reflecting the repayment of the £150.0 million
2016 Senior Notes of $203.4 million and dividends paid of $157.5 million.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

        The Group's consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.

        The Group continually evaluates the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements. In general, management's estimates are based on historical experience,
information from third-party professionals, as appropriate, and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances. Actual results could differ from those
estimates made by management. The Group's critical accounting policies and estimates include investment securities, acquisition accounting including contingent consideration, goodwill and intangible assets,
post-employment benefits, stock-based payments and income taxes. For additional information about the Group's accounting policies see Note 2—"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" to the
Consolidated Financial Statements of Henderson Group plc and its subsidiaries for the year ended December 31, 2016.

Valuation of Investment Securities

        The Group records investment securities classified as trading or available-for-sale at fair value. Fair value is generally determined using observable market data based on recent trading activity. Where
observable market data is unavailable due to a lack of trading activity, the Group uses internally developed models to estimate fair value and independent third parties to validate assumptions, when appropriate.
Estimating fair value requires significant management judgement, including benchmarking to similar instruments with observable market data and applying appropriate discounts that reflect differences between
the securities that the Group is valuing and the selected benchmark. Any variation in the assumptions used to approximate fair value could have a material adverse effect on Henderson's Consolidated Balance
Sheet and results of operations.

        The Group periodically evaluates the carrying value of equity method investments and investment securities classified as available-for-sale for potential impairment. In determining if an impairment exists,
the Group considers the duration, extent and circumstances of any decline in fair value. Where a fall in the value of an investment is prolonged or significant, it is considered an indication of impairment.

        Henderson evaluates the securities in an unrealized loss position in the available-for-sale portfolio for other-than-temporary impairment ("OTTI") on the basis of the duration of the decline in value of the
security and severity of that decline as well as the Group's intent and ability to hold these securities for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the market value. For equity method
investments, if circumstances indicate that an OTTI may exist, the investments are evaluated using market values where available, or the expected future cash flows of the investment.

        If it is determined that the impairment on an equity security is other-than-temporary, the investment is written down to fair value. An impairment loss equal to the difference between the carrying value of
the security and its fair value is recognized as an impairment charge within investment gains/(losses), net in Henderson's Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. For available-for-sale investments,
any amounts previously recognized in "other comprehensive income" in respect of cumulative changes in fair value are taken to net income on impairment.

Table of Contents

        There were no impairment charges recognized on investment securities for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 or 2014.

Acquisition Accounting

        The acquisition of Perennial on November 1, 2015 required certain judgements and estimates to be made around the future performance of the business when accounting for the contingent deferred
consideration payable in the future. The contingent consideration is payable in 2017 and 2019 if the revenues of the Perennial equities business meet certain targets. In addition, there are two tranches of
consideration payable in 2019 and 2020 which are dependent on net management fee revenue and which have service conditions attached ("earn out"). The fair value of the contingent consideration and the earn
out are calculated at each reporting date by forecasting Perennial's revenues over the contingency period and determining whether the forecast amounts meet the defined targets. The significant unobservable
input used in the valuation is forecast revenue.

Accounting for Goodwill and Intangible Assets

        The recognition and measurement of goodwill and intangible assets requires significant management estimates and judgement, including the valuation and expected life determination in connection with
the initial purchase price allocation and the ongoing evaluation for impairment. The judgement exercised by management in arriving at these valuations includes the selection of market growth rates, fund flow
assumptions, expected margins and costs.

        Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of the identifiable net assets of acquired companies and is not amortized. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually (or more frequently if
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired). The recoverable value of goodwill for the Group at December 31, 2016 has been determined by a fair value calculation, using cash
flows based on the Group's annual budget and a five year forecast approved by the Henderson board and a terminal value for the period thereafter.

        The key assumptions applied to the Group's annual budget and five year forecast are market performance and net fund flows. Management determined these key assumptions by assessing current market
conditions and through the utilization of forward looking external evidence. The terminal value has been calculated assuming a long-term growth rate of 2% per annum in perpetuity, based on the Group's view
of long-term nominal growth, which does not exceed market expectations. A pre-tax risk adjusted discount rate of 11.8% per annum has been applied. The resultant fair value calculation has been compared
with the carrying value of the Group's goodwill to determine if any goodwill impairment arises.

        The calculation shows significant headroom in the recoverable value of goodwill. Sensitivities were performed by adjusting key assumptions for reasonable possible changes, with the model continuing to
show significant headroom. Recent market transactions and the Group's current market capitalization provide additional evidence that the recoverable value of goodwill is in excess of the carrying value.

        Indefinite-lived intangible assets represent certain investment management agreements. The assignment of indefinite lives to investment management agreements is based on the assumption that they are
expected to generate cash flows over an indefinite period. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of the assets to their recorded values. The latest impairment test
of indefinite-lived intangible assets identified an impairment loss of $4.9 million on Gartmore investment management contracts from the planned disposal of the Volantis UK Small Cap team assets in 2017,
which was recognized during the year ended December 31, 2016 (2015 and 2014: $nil).

Table of Contents

        Definite-lived intangible assets represent certain other investment management contracts, which are amortized over their estimated lives using the straight-line method. The estimated lives of the definite-
lived contracts held vary and range from three years to eight years. Definite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment only when there are indications of impairment. There were no indicators of
impairment or impairment charges recognized on definite lived intangible assets during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 or 2014.

        The acquisition of Perennial required certain judgements and estimates to be made around the future performance of the business when accounting for the investment management contracts acquired. The
key estimates applied in valuing the investment management contracts were market growth and attrition rates which have been based around industry data for equities and fixed income and data specific to the
acquired business.

Stock-Based Payment Transactions

        Stock-based compensation cost is based on the grant date fair value of awards expected to vest at the end of the stated service period and consists of the total value of the awards. For each of the plans that
the Group operates, the grant date fair value is determined using either the Black-Scholes option pricing model or the Monte Carlo model.

        The assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option pricing model include dividend yield, expected volatility, risk-free interest rate and expected life. The dividend yield and expected volatility were
determined using historical Group data. The risk-free interest rate is based on the three-year U.K. treasury coupon at the time of the grant. The expected life of the appreciation rights is the same as the service
conditions applicable to all Group awards. The Group also uses the Monte Carlo model to determine the fair value of awards granted under the LTIP from 2015 onwards. The assumptions used in the Monte
Carlo model include dividend yield, share price volatility and discount rate.

Retirement Benefit Plans

        The Group provides employees with retirement benefits through both defined benefit and defined contribution plans.

        The defined benefit obligation is determined annually by independent qualified actuaries using the projected unit credit method and is measured as the present value of the estimated future cash outflows
using a discount rate based on AA rated corporate bond yields of appropriate duration. The plan assets are recognized at fair value. The funded status of the defined benefit pension plan, which we refer to as the
plan, being the resulting surplus or deficit of defined benefit assets less liabilities, is recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, net of any taxes that would be deducted at source.

        Actuarial gains and losses arise as a result of differences between actual experience and actuarial assumptions. The "10% corridor" method for recognizing actuarial gains and losses has been adopted by
the Group. This means that cumulative actuarial gains or losses up to an amount equal to 10% of the higher of the liabilities and the assets of the scheme (the "corridor") have no immediate impact on net
income and are instead recognized through other comprehensive income. Cumulative gains or losses greater than this corridor are amortized to net income over the average remaining future working lifetime of
the active members in the plan.

        Net periodic benefit cost is recorded as a component of net income in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income and includes service cost, interest cost and the expected return on plan assets.

        The costs of, and period end obligations under, defined benefit pension plans are determined using actuarial valuations. The actuarial valuation involves making a number of assumptions including those
related to the discount rate, the expected rate of return on assets, future salary increases, mortality rates and future pension increases. Due to the long-term nature of these plans, such estimates are subject to
significant uncertainty.

        For further discussion of the Group's pension plan see Note 15—"Retirement Benefit Plans" to the Consolidated Financial Statements of Henderson Group plc and its subsidiaries for the year ended
December 31, 2016.

Income Taxes

        The Group operates in several countries, states and other taxing jurisdictions through various subsidiaries and branches, and must allocate income, expenses and earnings under the various laws and
regulations of each of these taxing jurisdictions. Accordingly, the provision for income taxes represents the total estimate of the liability that the Group has incurred for doing business each year in all of the
locations. Annually the Group files tax returns that represent filing positions within each jurisdiction and settles return liabilities. Each jurisdiction has the right to audit those returns and may take different
positions with respect to income and expense allocations and taxable earnings determinations. Because the determinations of the annual provisions are subject to judgements and estimates, it is possible that
actual results will vary from those recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements. As a result, it is likely that additions to, or reductions of, income tax expense will occur each year for prior reporting
periods as actual tax returns and tax audits are settled.

        In the assessment of uncertain tax positions, significant management judgement is required to estimate the range of possible outcomes and determine the probability, on a more-likely-than-not basis, of
favorable or unfavorable tax outcomes and the potential interest and penalties related to such unfavorable outcomes. Actual future tax consequences on settlement of the Group's uncertain tax positions may be
materially different to management's current estimates.

        Deferred tax assets, net of any associated valuation allowance, have been recognized based on management's belief that taxable income of the appropriate character, more likely than not, will be sufficient
to realize the benefits of these assets over time. In the event that actual results differ from expectations, or if historical trends of positive operating income changes, the Group may be required to record a
valuation allowance on some or all of these deferred tax assets, which may have a significant effect on the financial condition and results of operations of the Group. In assessing whether a valuation allowance
should be established against a deferred income tax asset, the Group considers the nature, frequency and severity of recent losses, forecasts of future profitability, the duration of statutory carryback and
carryforward periods, among other factors.

        See Notes 2 and 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements of Henderson Group plc and its subsidiaries for the year ended December 31, 2016 for additional information on accounting policies for
income taxes and valuation allowances.

Management Fees

        Management fee revenues are generally based upon a percentage of the market value of assets under management and are calculated as a percentage of either the daily, month end or quarter end average
asset balance in accordance with contractual agreements. Accordingly, fluctuations in the financial markets have a direct effect on the Group's operating results. Although fluctuations in the financial markets
have a direct effect on the Group's operating results, assets under management may outperform or underperform the financial markets. As such, quantifying the impact of correlation between assets under
management and the Group's operating results may be misleading.

Performance Fees

        Performance fee revenue is derived from a number of funds and clients. As a result, the Group's revenues are subject to volatility beyond market-based fluctuations discussed in the investment management
fees section above. Performance fees are specified in certain fund and clients contracts and are based on investment performance either on an absolute basis or compared to an established index over a specified
period of time. This is often subject to a hurdle rate. Performance fees are recognized at the end of the contractual period (typically quarterly or annually) if the stated performance criteria are achieved. The
Group's performance fees are dependent on internal performance and market trends and will therefore be subject to year on year volatility. The Group recognized performance fees of $54.8 million and
$150.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 respectively. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, $36.6 billion and $41.3 billion of assets under management were subject to performance fees,
respectively.

Investment Securities

        At December 31, 2016, the Group was exposed to market price risk as a result of investment securities on its Consolidated Balance Sheet. The following is a summary of the effect that a hypothetical 10%
increase or decrease in market prices would have on Henderson's investment securities subject to market price fluctuations as of December 31, 2016 (in millions):

Derivative Instruments

        The Group maintains an economic hedge program that uses derivative instruments to mitigate market volatility of certain seeded investments. Market fluctuations are mitigated using derivative instruments
including futures, index swaps and total return swaps. The Group also operates a rolling program of foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the non-functional currency exposures arising from certain
seed capital investments.

        The Group was party to the following derivative instruments as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 (in millions):

        Changes in fair value of derivative instruments are recognized in investment gains (losses), net in Henderson's Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. Changes in fair value of foreign currency
forward contracts which relate to consolidated seed entities are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income under net investment hedge accounting.

Foreign Currency Exchange Sensitivity

        Foreign currency risk is the risk that the Group will sustain losses through adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates. As the Group's functional currency is pounds sterling, the Group is
exposed to foreign currency risk through its exposure to non-pound sterling income, expenses, assets and liabilities of its overseas subsidiaries as well as net assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other
than pounds sterling. The currency exposure is managed by monitoring foreign currency positions. The Group uses foreign currency forward contracts to reduce or eliminate the currency exposure on certain
individual transactions. The Group also seeks to use natural hedges to reduce exposure. Where there is a mismatch on material currency flows and the timing is reasonably certain, the positions are actively
hedged. Where there is insufficient certainty, the currency is translated back into pounds sterling on receipt. A rolling program of foreign currency forward contracts has been implemented to mitigate the
currency exposures arising from certain seed capital investments (being available-for-sale financial assets and trading securities) and consolidated structured entities.

        The table below illustrates the impact of GBP weakening by 10% on all unhedged financial assets and liabilities denominated in currencies material to the Group other than pounds sterling (in millions):

        The reverse would be the case if GBP were to strengthen by 10%.

        The Group's reporting currency is U.S. dollars. Foreign exchange differences also arise on translation from the Group's functional currency of pounds sterling to U.S. dollars and are recognized in other
comprehensive income. These differences are not reflected in the table above.

DESCRIPTION OF JANUS HENDERSON ORDINARY SHARES AND JANUS HENDERSON AMENDED ARTICLES OF ASSOCIATION 

        The following is a summary of the material terms of both the Janus Henderson ordinary shares as set forth in the Janus Henderson Amended Memorandum and the Janus Henderson Amended Articles to
be approved at the shareholder meeting to be held on April 26, 2017 and the material provisions of the laws of Jersey, Channel Islands. This summary does not purport to be complete and may not contain all of
the information about the Janus Henderson Amended Memorandum and the Janus Henderson Amended Articles that is important to you. The rights and obligations of the Janus Henderson ordinary shares are
governed by the express terms and conditions of the Janus Henderson Amended Memorandum and the Janus Henderson Amended Articles and not by this summary or any other information contained in this
proxy statement/prospectus. Henderson shareholders and Janus stockholders are urged to read the Janus Henderson Amended Memorandum and the Janus Henderson Amended Articles carefully and in their
entirety. This summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Janus Henderson Amended Memorandum and the Janus Henderson Amended Articles, copies of which are attached as Annex B to this proxy
statement/prospectus and incorporated by reference herein.

Share Capital 

        As at March 17, 2017, the issued and fully paid share capital of Henderson was 1,131,842,110 ordinary shares of £0.125 each. As at March 17, 2017, Henderson had an authorized share capital of
£274,363,847 divided into 2,194,910,776 ordinary shares of £0.125 each.

        Subject to approval by the Henderson shareholders at the Henderson shareholder meeting, the par value of Henderson ordinary shares will be redenominated from pounds sterling into U.S. dollars. The
redenomination will be reflected in the Henderson interim memorandum that will replace the Henderson Memorandum of Association effective upon the date of the Henderson shareholder meeting.

        Following the redenomination into U.S. dollars, subject to approval by the Henderson shareholders at the Henderson shareholder meeting, the par value of Henderson ordinary shares will be reduced for
administrative purposes to ensure that the par value is a round number. The reduction of the par value of Henderson ordinary shares will become effective on or around May 2, 2017 when a copy of the special
resolution approved at the Henderson shareholder meeting and certain supporting documents will be delivered to the Jersey Registry and registered by the Jersey Registrar of Companies.

        As of the effective time, subject to the approval of Henderson shareholders, the Janus Henderson Amended Memorandum and the Janus Henderson Amended Articles will replace the Henderson interim
memorandum and the Henderson Articles of Association, respectively.

        At closing of the merger, the authorized share capital of Janus Henderson will be increased to $720,000,000, divided into 480,000,000 shares of $1.50 each. At closing of the merger, Henderson estimates
that, exclusive of ordinary shares underlying outstanding options and adjusted to account for the share consolidation, there will be 200,154,341 ordinary shares issued and outstanding.

        There are no preferential voting shares; all shares are ordinary shares and have equal voting rights and no right to a fixed income. Janus Henderson ordinary shares carry the right to receive dividends that
have been declared by Janus Henderson. The holders of Janus Henderson ordinary shares have the right to receive notice of, and to attend and vote at, all general meetings of Janus Henderson. If Janus
Henderson is wound up, the directors or the liquidator (as the case may be) may, with the sanction of a special resolution of the shareholders of Janus Henderson and any other sanction required by the Jersey
Companies Law, divide among the members in specie the whole or any part of the assets of Janus Henderson and may, for that purpose, value any assets and determine how the division shall be carried out as
between the members or different classes of members. The directors or

the liquidator may, with the like sanction, vest the whole or any part of the assets in trustees on such trusts for the benefit of the members as they/he with the like sanction shall determine, but no member shall
be compelled to accept any assets on which there is a liability. Except in relation to dividends that have been declared and rights on a winding up of Janus Henderson, Janus Henderson shareholders have no
rights to share in the profits of Janus Henderson.

        Janus Henderson CDIs are units of beneficial ownership in shares constituted under Australian law which may be held and transferred through the CHESS system. For further information regarding the
CDIs, see "—CHESS Depositary Interests" below. All references to shares in this document shall be deemed, where the context permits, also to be references to the CDIs.

        Henderson's registered address in Jersey is 47 Esplanade, St Helier, Jersey, Channel Islands JE1 0BD. The address of Henderson's register of members in Jersey is Queensway House, Hilgrove Street,
St Helier, Jersey, Channel Islands JE1 1ES.

Janus Henderson Amended Articles 

        The Janus Henderson Amended Articles contain, among other things, provisions to the following effect:

Objects and Purpose 

        Janus Henderson's objects are not restricted by the Janus Henderson Amended Articles. Accordingly, pursuant to the laws of Jersey, Channel Islands, Janus Henderson's objects are unrestricted.

Voting Rights 

        At a general meeting, subject to any rights or restrictions attached to any shares:

• on a show of hands every member and every duly appointed proxy present has one vote; and 

• on a poll every member present in person or represented by proxy shall have one vote for every ordinary share of which he is the holder.

        Each CDI Holder is entitled to direct the Depositary Nominee (being the entity through which title to the Janus Hendersen ordinary shares is held (where the Depositary Nominee, following closing of the
merger, in turn holds its title through a chain of title with Cede & Co. holding legal title) to which the CDI Holders are ultimate beneficial owners), in respect to the number of CDIs held by them:

• as to how it should vote at a general meeting; 

• to appoint the CDI Holder as its proxy (allowing the CDI Holder to vote in person at the general meeting); or 

• to appoint as its proxy a person nominated by the CDI Holder.

        If any sum remains unpaid in relation to any Janus Henderson shareholder's holding, that shareholder is not entitled to vote in relation to that holding until such sum is paid.

        Neither the laws of Jersey, Channel Islands, nor the Janus Henderson Amended Articles impose any limitation on the rights of non-U.K. residents or foreign shareholders to own Janus Henderson ordinary
shares, including the rights to hold or exercise voting rights on the Janus Henderson ordinary shares.

Table of Contents

Variation of Rights 

        The rights attached to any class of Janus Henderson ordinary shares may only be varied either: (i) with the written consent of the holders of three-quarters in nominal value of the issued shares of that class;
or (ii) with the sanction of a resolution passed by a majority of three-quarters of the holders of the shares of that class present and voting (in person or represented by proxy) at a separate general meeting of such
holders.

Transfer of Shares 

        Janus Henderson ordinary shares may be held in either certificated or uncertificated form.

        The instrument of transfer of a certificated share may be in any usual form or in any other form which the Janus Henderson board may approve. The instrument of transfer must be signed by or on behalf of
the transferor and, unless the share is fully paid, by or on behalf of the transferee.

        The Janus Henderson board may refuse to register the transfer of a certificated share unless the instrument of transfer is:

• lodged at Janus Henderson's registered office or another place appointed by the board and accompanied by the certificate and such other evidence as the board may reasonably require to show the
right of the transferor to make the transfer; 

• is in respect of only one class of shares; and 

• is in favor of not more than four transferees.

        If the Janus Henderson board refuses to register a transfer of a share in certificated form, it must send the transferee notice of its refusal within two months after the date on which the instrument of transfer
was lodged with Janus Henderson.

        The registration of transfers of shares or any class of shares may be suspended at such times and for such periods (not exceeding 30 days in any year) as the Janus Henderson board may determine.

        Transfers of uncertificated shares may be effected by means of a relevant system.

Forfeiture and Lien 

        The Janus Henderson board may call for any amounts that are unpaid in respect of ordinary shares. If a member fails to pay the amount due within the requisite time period, then, following notice by the
Janus Henderson directors requiring payment of the unpaid amount with any accrued interest and any expenses incurred, such ordinary share (including all dividends declared and not paid before the forfeiture)
may be forfeited by a resolution of the Janus Henderson board to that effect.

        A member whose ordinary shares have been forfeited will cease to be a member in respect of the ordinary shares, but will remain liable to pay Janus Henderson all monies which were payable at the date of
forfeiture together with interest. The Janus Henderson board may enforce payment without any allowance for the value of the ordinary shares at the time of forfeiture or for any consideration received on their
disposal.

        An ordinary share forfeited or surrendered becomes the property of Janus Henderson and gives Janus Henderson the right to sell, re-allot or otherwise dispose of such ordinary shares on such terms and in
such manner as the Janus Henderson board determines.

        Janus Henderson has a first and paramount lien on every Janus Henderson ordinary share that is not fully paid. The Janus Henderson board may waive any lien and may resolve that any share shall be
wholly or partly exempt from such a lien.

Table of Contents

Dividends 

        Janus Henderson may by ordinary resolution declare dividends to be paid to its shareholders, but no dividend shall exceed the amount recommended by the Janus Henderson board. The Janus Henderson
board may also pay interim dividends if the Janus Henderson board believes that they are justified by the profits or the cash flow position of Janus Henderson.

        Janus Henderson may also, by ordinary resolution and on the recommendation of the Janus Henderson board, direct that a dividend will be satisfied wholly or partly by the distribution of assets, including
paid up shares or debentures of another company.

        Unless the share rights provide otherwise, all dividends must be apportioned and paid pro rata according to the amounts paid on the shares during any portion of the period in respect of which the dividend
is paid.

        Under the Jersey Companies Law, dividends may be paid from any source (other than from nominal capital account and capital redemption reserve), subject to a requirement for the directors who are to
authorize the payment of any dividend to make a statutory solvency statement.

        The Janus Henderson board may, if authorized by an ordinary resolution, offer any holder of shares the right to elect to receive, in lieu of a dividend, an allotment of new ordinary shares, credited as fully
paid.

        No dividend or other monies payable on or in respect of a share shall bear interest as against Janus Henderson.

        Any dividend unclaimed for 12 years from the date on which it was declared or became due for payment, if resolved by the Janus Henderson board, shall be forfeited.

Alteration of Share Capital 

        Janus Henderson may, by special resolution of its shareholders: increase its share capital; consolidate and sub-divide; convert shares into or from stock; re-denominate any of its shares into another currency
or reduce its share capital, capital redemption reserve or share premium account in any way.

Purchase of Own Shares 

        Subject to the provisions of the Jersey Companies Law, Janus Henderson may purchase any of its own shares in any way and at any price and may hold such shares as treasury shares.

Shareholder Meetings 

        Janus Henderson must hold an annual general meeting of shareholders every year within a period of seven months of the end of its financial year (which is December 31), at such place or places, date and
time as may be decided by the Janus Henderson directors.

        The Janus Henderson board may convene general meetings whenever they think fit in accordance with the requirements of the Jersey Companies Law.

        Under the Jersey Companies Law, shareholders of Janus Henderson holding 10% or more of the company's voting rights and entitled to vote at the relevant meeting may legally require the directors to call
a meeting of shareholders. This must be held as soon as practicable but in any case not later than two months after the date of the requisition. The requisition shall state the objects of the meeting. If the directors
do not within 21 days from the date of the deposit of the requisition proceed to call a meeting to be held within two months of that date, the requisitionists, or any of them representing more than half of the total
voting rights of all of them, may themselves call a meeting, but a meeting

day prior to the date of the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual general meeting, provided, however, that if the date of an annual meeting is more than 30 calendar days before or more
than 60 calendar days after the date of the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual general meeting, notice by the member must be so delivered in writing not earlier than the close of
business on the 120th calendar day prior to such annual general meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of (i) the 90th calendar day prior to such annual general meeting, and
(ii) the 10th calendar day after the day on which public announcement of the date of such annual general meeting is first made by Janus Henderson. General meetings may be held at such time
and place as determined by the Janus Henderson directors. All general meetings must be convened by at least 14 clear days' notice.

        The notice must be sent to all members and CDI Holders at the same time. Janus Henderson may determine that the members entitled to receive a notice of a general meeting are the members on the
register at the close of business on a day determined by Janus Henderson.

        The notice must specify the time, date and place of the meeting (including of any satellite meeting) and the general nature of the business to be dealt with.

        For the purpose of determining whether a person is entitled as a member to attend or vote at a meeting and how many votes such person may cast, Janus Henderson may also specify in the notice a date not
more than 60 days nor less than 10 days before the date fixed for the meeting, as the date for the determination of the shareholders entitled to receive notice of, attend or vote at the meeting or appoint a proxy.
Janus Henderson may specify a separate time by which a CDI Holder must be on the CDI register in order to direct the Depositary Nominee to vote or appoint a proxy.

        No business may be transacted at any general meeting unless a quorum (the holders of at least one-third in nominal value of the issued shares (excluding any shares held in treasury)) is present at the time
when the meeting proceeds to business.

Conditions of Admission 

        The Janus Henderson board and the chairman of any general meeting may make any arrangement and impose any requirement or restriction it or he considers appropriate to ensure the security of a general
meeting including, without limitation, requirements for identification to be produced by those attending the meeting, searches and the restriction of items that may be taken into the meeting place. The board
and, at any general meeting, the chairman are entitled to refuse entry to a person who refuses to comply with these arrangements, requirements or restrictions.

Share Qualification for Janus Henderson Directors 

        A Janus Henderson director is not required to hold any shares in the capital of Janus Henderson by way of qualification. However, a Janus Henderson director who is not a member of Janus Henderson is
entitled to attend and speak at general meetings.

Janus Henderson Directors' Fees, Expenses, Pensions and Other Benefits 

        Janus Henderson directors' fees are determined by the Janus Henderson directors from time to time except that the base fees of non-executive directors may not exceed $3.0 million per annum in aggregate
or such higher amount as determined by ordinary resolution of the Janus Henderson shareholders.

        Any director who holds any executive office or performs services which in the opinion of the Janus Henderson board are outside the scope of the ordinary duties of a Janus Henderson director, may be paid
extra remuneration, including fee, salary, commission or otherwise as the Janus Henderson board may determine.

        The Janus Henderson directors may also reimburse any director for reasonable expenses incurred in attending and returning from meetings of the Janus Henderson board, any committee of the Janus
Henderson board or general meetings or otherwise in connection with the business of Janus Henderson. The emoluments of any director holding executive office for his services as such are determined by the
Janus Henderson board, and may be of any description, including without limitation admission to, or continuance of, membership of any scheme (including any share acquisition scheme) or fund instituted or
established or financed or contributed to by Janus Henderson for the provision of pensions, life assurance or other benefits for employees or their dependants, or the payment of a pension or other benefit to him
or his dependants on or after retirement or death, apart from membership of any such scheme or fund.

Executive Directors 

        The Janus Henderson board may appoint one or more directors to be the holder of any executive office on such terms as they may determine and, without prejudice to the terms of any contract entered into
in any particular case, may at any time revoke or vary the terms of any such appointment. Janus Henderson may not enter into any contract of employment with an executive director with a fixed term of longer
than two years unless approved by ordinary resolution.

        The appointment of any Janus Henderson director to executive office will automatically terminate if the person ceases to be a Janus Henderson director without prejudice to any right of such person to
receive damages under his or her service contract with Janus Henderson.

        The Janus Henderson directors may delegate any powers exercisable by them to any executive Janus Henderson director upon such terms and conditions, and with such restrictions, as they think fit. They
may, at their discretion, alter or revoke any of such delegated powers.

Janus Henderson Directors' Retirement 

        Under the Janus Henderson Amended Articles, all directors are subject to annual re-election by shareholders. Any retirement will not have effect until the conclusion of the meeting, except where a
resolution is passed to elect some other person in the place of the retiring Janus Henderson director or a resolution for his or her re-election is put to the meeting and lost. Accordingly, a retiring Janus Henderson
director who is re-elected will continue in office without a break in service.

Removal of a Janus Henderson Director by Resolution 

        Janus Henderson may by ordinary resolution remove any director from office. No special notice need be given of any such resolution and no director proposed to be removed has any special right to protest
against his removal.

        Such removal can take place notwithstanding any contrary provision in the Janus Henderson Amended Articles or any contract, but is without prejudice to any claim the Janus Henderson director may have
for damages for breach of any such contract.

Janus Henderson Directors' Interests 

        A Janus Henderson director who, to his knowledge, is in any way (directly or indirectly) interested in any contract, arrangement, transaction or proposal to be entered into or proposed to be entered into by
Janus Henderson where such interest conflicts or may conflict to a material extent with the interests of Janus Henderson must declare the nature of his interest.

        Subject to the provisions of Jersey company law, and provided the Janus Henderson Amended Articles are complied with, a director:

• may enter into or otherwise be interested in any contract, arrangement, transaction or proposal with Janus Henderson, or in which Janus Henderson is otherwise interested; 

• may hold an additional office for Janus Henderson (except as auditor of Janus Henderson or as auditor of a subsidiary of Janus Henderson) and may act by himself or through his firm in a
professional capacity for Janus Henderson; 

• may be a director or other officer of, or employed by, or a party to, any transaction or arrangement with, or otherwise interested in, any company in which Janus Henderson is interested; and 

• will not be liable to account to Janus Henderson for any profit, remuneration, or other benefit received in respect of any such office, employment, contract, arrangement, transaction or proposal.

        A director may not vote on (but may still be counted in the quorum in relation to) any resolution of the Janus Henderson board or of a committee of the Janus Henderson board concerning any contract,
transaction, or other arrangement in which he has, to his knowledge, a material interest. In particular, a director may not vote on any resolution of the Janus Henderson board or of a committee of the Janus
Henderson board concerning his own appointment or remuneration.

Duty of Confidentiality of Janus Henderson Directors 

        If a Janus Henderson director receives information while not acting in his or her position as a Janus Henderson director, in respect of which he owes a duty of confidentiality to a person other than Janus
Henderson, he or she shall not be required to disclose such information to Janus Henderson or use such confidential information for the performance of his or her duties as a Janus Henderson director. However,
where such duty of confidentiality arises out of a situation in which the Janus Henderson director has an actual or potential conflict of interest, it must first have been declared to and approved by the Janus
Henderson board.

Powers of the Janus Henderson Directors 

        Subject to the provisions of Jersey company law, the Janus Henderson Amended Articles and to any directions given by special resolution of Janus Henderson shareholders, the business of Janus
Henderson is managed by the board, which can exercise all the powers of Janus Henderson.

Table of Contents

        The Janus Henderson board may delegate any of its powers to any committee consisting of one or more directors. Such committees may include persons other than directors who may enjoy voting rights
provided that such persons make up less than half the membership of the committee.

        The Janus Henderson board also has the power to establish local boards or appoint managers or agents to manage any of the affairs of Janus Henderson.

Communications with Members 

        A document sent by Janus Henderson to a member by post shall be deemed to have been received:

• on the day following that on which the document was posted if sent by first class post (or equivalent) to an address within the same country; 

• on the third day following that on which the document was posted if sent to an address in a different country; and 

• in any other case on the second day following that on which the document posted.

        A document or information sent or supplied by Janus Henderson to a member in electronic form shall be deemed to have been received by the member on the day following that on which the document was
sent to the member (regardless of whether Janus Henderson becomes aware that the member has failed to receive such document or subsequently sends a hard copy of such document by post to the member).

        Proof that a document or information was properly addressed, prepaid and posted shall be conclusive evidence that the document or information was sent. Proof that a document or information sent or
supplied by electronic means was properly addressed shall be conclusive evidence that the document or information was sent or supplied.

        The accidental failure to send, or the non-receipt by any person entitled to, any notice of or other document or information relating to any meeting or other proceeding shall not invalidate the relevant
meeting or proceeding.

Disclosure of Shareholding Ownership 

        Holders of beneficial interests in shares of Janus Henderson must comply with the beneficial ownership disclosure obligations contained in section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules promulgated
thereunder.

        Janus Henderson may by notice in writing require any person whom Janus Henderson knows or has reasonable cause to believe to be interested in shares, or to have been so interested at any time during the
three years prior, to confirm whether that is the case and give further information as to their interest as requested.

        Where a person fails to comply with the above notice within the relevant period or has made a statement which is false or inadequate as the Janus Henderson board may determine at its sole discretion,
Janus Henderson may give the holder of those shares a direction notice and/or an application notice.

        The direction notice may direct that the shares in respect of which the default occurred, such holder will not be entitled to attend or vote at a general meeting nor, where the shares represent at least 0.25%
in nominal value of Janus Henderson's issued share capital, receive dividends or distributions. The direction notice may also direct that uncertificated shares be converted into certificated form.

Table of Contents

        The application notice will say that Janus Henderson may apply to the Royal Court of Jersey for an order compelling the relevant holder to comply with the notice requesting information.

Mandatory Bids 

        There are no provisions in the Janus Henderson Amended Articles that would have an effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of Janus Henderson. However, under the City Code on
Takeover and Mergers, referred to herein as the City Code, which applies to Janus Henderson, if an acquisition of interests in Janus Henderson ordinary shares (as defined in the City Code) increases the
aggregate interests of an acquirer and its concert parties (as defined in the City Code) to shares carrying 30% or more of the voting rights in Janus Henderson, the acquirer and, depending on the circumstances,
its concert parties, would be required (except with the consent of the Panel on Takeovers and Mergers) to make a cash offer for the Janus Henderson ordinary shares at a price not less than the highest price paid
to acquire interests in the Janus Henderson ordinary shares by the acquirer or its concert parties during the previous 12 months. This requirement would also be triggered by any acquisition of interests in shares
by a person already interested (together with its concert parties) in shares carrying between 30% and 50% of the voting rights in Janus Henderson if the effect of such acquisition were to increase that person's
interests in shares carrying voting rights.

CHESS Depositary Interests 

        CDIs are quoted and traded on the financial market operated by ASX. Janus Henderson ordinary shares will be able to be traded on the NYSE, but will not be able to be traded on the financial market
operated by the ASX. This is because ASX's electronic settlement system, known as CHESS, cannot be used directly for the transfer of securities of issuers, such as Janus Henderson, incorporated in countries
whose laws do not recognize CHESS as a system to record uncertificated holdings or to electronically transfer legal title. CDIs have been created to facilitate electronic settlement and transfer in Australia for
companies in this situation.

        CDIs are a type of depositary receipt which provide the holder with ultimate beneficial ownership of the underlying ordinary shares of Janus Henderson. Following closing of the merger, the legal title to
these ordinary shares is held by Cede & Co., with CHESS Depositary Nominees Pty Ltd (ABN 75 071 346 506), a wholly owned subsidiary of ASX, which we refer to as the Depositary Nominee, being the
holder through a chain of title through which a CDI Holder holds its interest in the Janus Henderson ordinary shares.

        Each CDI represents a beneficial interest in one Janus Henderson ordinary share and, unlike Janus Henderson ordinary shares, each CDI can be held, transferred and settled electronically within CHESS.

        CDIs are traded electronically on the financial market operated by the ASX. However, there are a number of differences between holding CDIs and Janus Henderson ordinary shares. The major differences
are that:

• CDI Holders do not have legal title in the underlying Janus Henderson ordinary shares to which the CDIs relate. Following closing of the merger, legal title to the Janus Henderson ordinary
shares will be held by Cede & Co. with the Depositary Nominee being the holder through a chain of title through which a CDI Holder holds its interest in the Janus Henderson ordinary shares.
CDI Holders have beneficial ownership of the underlying Janus Henderson ordinary shares and legal and beneficial ownership of the CDIs; and 

• CDI Holders are not able to vote personally as shareholders at a meeting of Janus Henderson. Instead, CDI Holders are provided with a voting instruction form which will enable them to instruct
the Depositary Nominee in relation to the exercise of voting rights. In addition, a CDI

Table of Contents

Holder is able to request the Depositary Nominee to appoint the CDI Holder or a third party nominated by the CDI Holder as its proxy so that the proxy so appointed may attend meetings and
vote personally as the Depositary Nominee's proxy.

        Alternatively, CDI Holders can convert their CDIs into Janus Henderson ordinary shares in sufficient time before the relevant meeting, in which case they will be able to vote personally as shareholders of
Janus Henderson.

Summary of Rights and Entitlements

Introduction

        CDIs are units of beneficial ownership in non-Australian securities, with legal title to the securities being held by an Australian depositary entity, the Depositary Nominee, before closing of the merger, and,
following closing of the merger, legal title being held by another nominee entity through which the Depositary Nominee holds its interest in the securities.

        Each CDI Holder receives a holding statement which sets out the number of CDIs held by it and the reference number of the holding. These holding statements are provided to holders when a holding is
first established and if there is a change in their holding of CDIs.

        A summary of the rights and entitlements of CDI Holders is set out below.

Ratio of CDIs to Janus Henderson ordinary shares

        Each CDI represents one underlying Janus Henderson ordinary share.

Voting

        In order to vote at a meeting of Janus Henderson, a CDI Holder may:

• instruct the Depositary Nominee, as owner of the Janus Henderson ordinary shares through which a CDI Holder holds its interest in Janus Henderson ordinary shares, to vote the Janus Henderson
ordinary shares represented by their CDIs in a particular manner—the voting instruction form must be completed and returned to the share registry for the CDIs prior to a record date fixed for the
purpose, which we refer to as the CDI Voting Instruction Receipt Time, and notified to CDI Holders in the voting instructions included in a notice of meeting; or 

• instruct the Depositary Nominee, as owner of the Janus Henderson ordinary shares through which a CDI Holder holds its interest in Janus Henderson ordinary shares, to appoint the CDI Holder
or a third party nominated for that purpose by the CDI Holder as its proxy so that the proxy so appointed may attend meetings and exercise the votes attached to the shares represented by their
CDIs as the Depositary Nominee's proxy. The voting instruction form must be completed and returned to the share registry for the CDIs prior to the CDI Voting Instruction Receipt Time; or 

• convert their CDIs into a holding of Janus Henderson ordinary shares and vote these at the meeting (this must be undertaken prior to a record date fixed by the Janus Henderson board for
determining the entitlement of members to attend and vote at the meeting and, if the holder later wishes to sell their investment on ASX, it would first be necessary to convert those Janus
Henderson ordinary shares back to CDIs). Further details on the conversion process are set out below.

        Voting instruction forms and details of these alternatives are included in each notice of meeting sent to CDI Holders by Janus Henderson.

Transmutation of CDIs to Janus Henderson ordinary shares

        CDI Holders may at any time transmute (i.e. convert) their CDIs to a holding of Janus Henderson ordinary shares by instructing the share registry for the CDIs, either:

• directly in the case of CDIs held on the issuer sponsored subregister (CDI Holders can complete a "CDI Cancellation AU-US Register form" and return to the share registry for the CDIs); or 

• through their "sponsoring participant" (usually their broker) in the case of CDIs which are held on the CHESS subregister (in this case, the sponsoring broker will arrange for completion of the
form and its return to the share registry for the CDIs).

        In both cases, once the share registry for the CDIs has been notified, it will arrange the transfer of the relevant number of Janus Henderson ordinary shares from the Depositary Nominee into the name of
the CDI Holder.

        This process will normally be completed within three to five days once the share registry for the CDIs receives a duly completed and valid instruction. The share registry for the CDIs or a broker can assist
CDI Holders to convert CDIs to Janus Henderson ordinary shares. The share registry for the CDIs will not charge a fee for the conversion (although a fee may be payable by market participants).

        Holding Janus Henderson ordinary shares will, however, prevent a person from selling their Janus Henderson ordinary shares on ASX, as only CDIs will be traded on the financial market operated by ASX.

Transmutation of Janus Henderson ordinary shares to CDIs

        Janus Henderson ordinary shares may be transmuted (i.e. converted) into CDIs and traded on the financial market operated by ASX. Holders of Janus Henderson ordinary shares may at any time transmute
those Janus Henderson ordinary shares to CDIs by contacting the share registry for the CDIs and completing a CDI Issuance (U.S. Register to Australian CDI Register) form, lodging this with the share registry
for the CDIs along with their share certificate or Direct Registration System advice.

        The share registry for the CDIs will arrange for the transfer of the Janus Henderson ordinary shares from the holder's name into the name of the Depositary Nominee and issue CDIs in the name of the
relevant holder. Holdings statements will then be issued to the CDI Holder.

        A broker or the share registry for the CDIs can assist a shareholder of Janus Henderson to transmute Janus Henderson ordinary shares to CDIs. Again, the share registry for the CDIs will not charge a fee
for the conversion (although a fee may be payable by market participants).

Dividends and Other Shareholder Entitlements

        Janus Henderson is required to treat CDI Holders, in respect of dividends and other entitlements, as if they were the holders of the underlying Janus Henderson ordinary shares.

        CDIs have all the direct economic benefits of legal ownership (such as the right to receive the same dividends, rights issues and bonus issues) to which direct holders of Janus Henderson ordinary shares are
entitled. Due to the need to convert dividends from US dollars to Australian dollars, CDI Holders may potentially be advantaged or disadvantaged by exchange rate fluctuations, depending on whether the
Australian dollar weakens or strengthens against the US dollar during the period between the declaration of the dividend and conversion into Australian dollars.

Takeovers

        If a takeover bid is made in respect of any of the Janus Henderson ordinary shares of which the Depositary Nominee is the registered holder, the Depositary Nominee is prohibited from accepting the offer
made under the takeover bid except to the extent that acceptance is authorized by the CDI Holders in accordance with the ASX Settlement Operating Rules, as defined below. The Depositary Nominee must
accept a takeover offer if a CDI Holder instructs it to do so. The ASX Settlement Operating Rules mean the operating rules issued by ASX Settlement Pty Ltd (ABN 49 008 504 532) as amended or replaced
from time to time and as modified by any express written waiver or exemption given by ASX Settlement Pty Ltd.

Other Rights

        As CDI Holders will not appear on the Janus Henderson share register as legal holders of Janus Henderson ordinary shares, any other right conferred on CDI Holders may be exercised by means of them
instructing the Depositary Nominee.

Meetings

        Where CDI Holders instruct the Depositary Nominee to appoint the CDI Holder or another person nominated for that purpose as its proxy in accordance with the procedures summarized above, the proxy
so appointed will be able to attend and vote at meetings as the Depositary Nominee's proxy.

Fees

        A CDI Holder should not incur any additional fees or charges as a result of holding CDIs rather than Janus Henderson ordinary shares.

Trading in CDIs

        CDI Holders who wish to trade in CDIs will be transferring beneficial title to the shares rather than legal title. The transfer will be settled electronically by delivery of the relevant CDI holding through
CHESS.

REMUNERATION OF HENDERSON DIRECTORS AND SENIOR MANAGEMENT 

        The information in this section relates to historical compensation and policies of Henderson only and does not reflect any modifications to, or the post-closing structure of, the combined company's
compensation policies anticipated as a result of the merger.

Remuneration principles 

        Henderson's remuneration policy is focused on pay for performance and in driving shareholder returns over the long term, while prudently managing risk. In doing so, the remuneration committee of the
Henderson board, which we refer to as the Henderson Remuneration Committee, and the Henderson board recognize that Henderson's remuneration policies and practices must enable the company to attract,
motivate and retain exceptional people, while aligning their interests with those of shareholders. The Henderson Remuneration Committee works closely with the Henderson risk committee to ensure that
performance is not achieved by taking unnecessary risks that fall outside the Henderson board's risk appetite. The key drivers of Henderson's remuneration philosophy and strategy are to:

• Attract and retain individuals critical to the long-term success of Henderson by providing total reward opportunities which, subject to performance, are competitive within the company's defined
markets both in terms of quantum and structure, and reflect individual contribution to business performance and sound risk management. 

• Maintain an appropriate balance between both fixed and variable pay, and short and long-term elements of remuneration, to minimize the probability of excessive risk taking and to align with the
company's strategic objectives and time horizons. 

• Reinforce a strong performance culture through rewards which are differentiated based on Henderson, division, team and individual performance. 

• Align management interests with those of Henderson's shareholders and clients through building appropriate share and fund ownership over time. 

• Ensure that reward related processes are compliant with industry regulations, legislation and market best practice and have effective risk management controls.

        Henderson's remuneration principles are reinforced by achieving an appropriate balance of the following remuneration elements:

• Base pay.  Core fixed pay element to attract and retain employees with the personal attributes, skills and experience required to deliver the company's strategy. 

• Benefits.  Provision of competitive, cost and tax effective benefits, geared towards the promotion of employee well-being, to attract and retain employees with the personal attributes, skills and
experience required to deliver the company's strategy. 

• Pension.  Provision of market competitive pension arrangements, in a way that does not create an unacceptable level of financial risk or cost to Henderson, to assist with employee recruitment
and retention, and to assist employees in building wealth for their retirement years. 

• Short-Term Incentive Plan (STI).  Reward performance on an annual basis, by reference to Henderson's financial performance and individual strategic and personal contribution, thereby aligning
employee interests with the annual business plan and to the interests of shareholders. A material proportion of the STI award is deferred to satisfy regulatory requirements in addition to aligning
the interests of the employee with those of the shareholders and clients via mutual linkage to the Henderson share price and investment performance of selected Henderson funds.

Notes

• Remuneration of Executive Directors is for the calendar year or, if applicable, from the date of appointment or to the date of resignation. 

• Benefits consist of the provision of life assurance, critical illness insurance, private medical insurance and lunch allowance. 

• Pension includes any additional employer contribution in respect of a Self-Invested Personal Pension, and as applicable, a cash allowance taken in lieu of contribution to the
Henderson pension scheme. 

• STI is the gross annual discretionary award for the performance year before mandatory deferral is applied. 

• LTI includes LTIP awards vesting during the year (including dividend equivalents awarded during the year), Save As You Earn, which we refer to as SAYE, and Restricted
Share Plan, which we refer to as RSP, awards which vested during the year and (for 2015 only) Employee Share Ownership Plan, which we refer to as ESOP, matching
shares vesting during the year. 

• 2015 reported LTI awards have been restated to reflect the actual share price at the date of vesting (£2.50 and £2.39 for LTIP 2013 and ESOP 2011, respectively) versus
£2.88 which was the share price used in the 2016 report (being the average share price over the last quarter of 2015). 

• "Other" comprises amounts paid in relation to dividends earned on beneficial interests in Henderson share plans. 

• For Mr. Wagstaff, the following notes apply: 

• The base salary shown is the amount paid since his appointment as Executive Director on May 24, 2016—the full year amount is £331,000; 

• the bonus shown above is the amount awarded in relation to the period since his appointment as Executive Director—the full year amount (£940,000) reflects the
period prior to his appointment, during which the structure and mix of his remuneration was markedly different; 

• the LTI award reflects the outcome of the 2014 LTIP award, plus the vesting of an award under the Restricted Share Plan; 

• the RSP award was granted upon his appointment to Henderson in March 2012. The performance conditions were as follows: 

• Net sales (85% weighting)—net sales at December 31, 2016 (as a percentage of AUM at July 1, 2012), with zero vesting for net sales below 4% and 100%
vesting for net sales at/above 12%; and 

• Non-financial (15%)—percentage at the discretion of the Chief Executive taking into account non-financial metrics including TCF and risk across the
Distribution area as well as the Executive's general performance of his duties.

Fixed pay and benefits 

        The Chief Executive's and Chief Financial Officer's base pay was increased by 3% to £432,500 and £350,000 respectively with effect from April 1, 2016, such increases being in line with average increases
awarded to the wider employee population. The Global Head of Distribution's base pay was increased to £275,000 with effect from April 1, 2016 and then to £375,000 with effect from June 1, 2016 to reflect his
appointment to the Henderson board and the resulting material change to the structure and mix of his compensation.

        The benefits consist of life insurance, critical illness insurance and private medical insurance, plus a lunch allowance, in line with benefits provided to other employees.

Pension entitlements and contributions 

        The Executive Directors participate in the non-contributory section of the Henderson Group Pension Scheme that provides defined contribution benefits on the same basis as other employees. The
Executive Directors are each entitled to a contribution, currently 10.5% of base pay, into Henderson's defined contribution pension plan. Due to the application of HMRC pension limits (Lifetime Allowance and
Annual Allowance), both the Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer elected to take the cash alternative during 2015. In the case of Mr. Wagstaff, he elected to take the cash alternative with effect from
April 1, 2016.

        In 2016, Henderson paid a pension cash allowance of £45,090 to Mr. Formica and a pension cash allowance of £31,275 to Mr. Thompson. In respect of Mr. Wagstaff, Henderson paid a cash allowance of
£16,500 for the period since his appointment as Executive Director. For the full year, additional contributions of £6,759 were made to Mr. Wagstaff's pension in the period up to March 31, 2016, and a cash
allowance of £2,062 paid in the period after that date up to May 24, 2016.

STI for the year ended December 31, 2016 

        For the purpose of determining the 2016 bonus, the Henderson Remuneration Committee assessed the performance of the business overall and of each of the Executive Directors.

Financial performance 

        Henderson delivered financial results which were robust in the context of challenging and volatile market conditions and external events which were outside of the company's control.

        The overall assessment of financial performance under the STI scorecard is a total score of 45.4% of maximum (22.7% out of a possible 50% as shown under "—STI performance measures—Financial"
below).

232

The maximum award was 932,030 shares: assessment—7.5% net sales equating to 61% of the net sales element (51.7% of total award) plus 100% for the non-financial
element (15% of total award)—resulting in total vesting of 621,353 shares valued using a share price of £2.39 which is the average share price over the last quarter of 2016.

STI performance measures 

Financial 

Strategic and personal contributions 

        During the year ended December 31, 2016, the progress on business strategy strongly exceeded expectations with a number of strategic initiatives being driven by the Executive Directors, in particular by
the Chief Executive, including:

• Third positive year of progress against the five year growth and globalization strategy, which remains well communicated and understood by investors. Henderson is well on course to meet the
original stretching target of doubling AUM in five years; 

• Responding to the Henderson board's challenge to accelerate growth in a process which eventually led to the proposed merger with Janus; 

• Increased geographic diversification, with the U.K. now representing circa 50% of Henderson's client base; 

• Successful development of new investment strategies, notably in Emerging Markets; 

• Delivery of the successful integration of acquisitions in the U.S. and Australia, and the disposal of Volantis; and 

• Maintained similar underlying profits to 2015 despite performance fees being significantly lower and the challenging political and economic conditions.

        The Executive Directors each exceeded their agreed personal objectives.

        In particular, Andrew Formica has:

• Delivered on Henderson's growth and globalization strategy, with results in line with plan; 

• Built a very cohesive Executive Committee which is now working well;

• Together with other Executive Directors, has been a key driver of Henderson's People Strategy as reflected in consistently low turnover rates and high staff engagement scores which significantly
out-score sector benchmark.

        The individual STI outcomes, relative to the maximum STI opportunity (357.2%/203.6%/199.4% of base salary for the Chief Executive, Chief Financial Officer and Global Head of Distribution,
respectively, before any risk adjustment) are shown graphically below.

        The Henderson Remuneration Committee determined the STI incentive bonuses of the Executive Directors against a balanced scorecard of:

• Financial measures (net flows, one and three year investment performance, and growth in operating margin, underlying profit before tax, management fee revenue and ROE), and 

• Non-financial measures (strategic contribution and performance against personal objectives).

        The targets are set as part of the annual planning process overseen and ultimately approved by the Henderson board. The Target represents the planned outcome for Henderson with Maximum aligned with
the stretch target and Threshold representing a minimum requirement for any incentive bonus to be paid. The same process is used to guide incentive decisions more widely across the Executive Committee.

        For the Chief Executive, the performance against each of these measures is set out in the graphic above. The weighted outcome of these measures as a percentage of maximum bonus opportunity

Table of Contents

        As part of the annual review process, the Henderson Remuneration Committee considered the recommendations of the Henderson risk committee in relation to the nature, incidence and materiality of risk
issues arising during the year and an overall assessment of risk management relative to the risk appetite statement. As a result of that review, the Henderson Remuneration Committee determined that a negative
adjustment of £1 million should be made (2015: no adjustment) and the STI outcomes for the Executive Directors were amended accordingly to reflect a proportion of the above adjustment. A further
adjustment was applied to the vesting outcome of the 2014 LTIP.

        The Henderson Remuneration Committee also has the discretion to adjust the final STI outcome (upwards or downwards at either an overall funding level and/or in respect of awards to specific Executive
Directors) to ensure that the outcome of the STI scorecard is fair in the context of overall company performance, business performance and individual strategic/personal objectives, or in the event that an
exceptional event occurred outside of the Executive Directors' control which, in the Henderson Remuneration Committee's opinion, may have materially affected the STI outcome. The Henderson Remuneration
Committee decided that no such adjustment was required.

        The awards for Executive Directors were subject to Henderson's mandatory deferral policy.

        The resulting STI awards (annual bonuses) for 2016 were as follows:

Notes

(1) The Henderson Remuneration Committee determined that each of the Executive Directors' STI awards should be reduced relative to the calculated amount by 2% to reflect the risk
adjustment set out above. This is a higher percentage reduction than was applied across the incentive pool as a whole. 

(2) As Identified Staff under AIFMD a proportion of Executive Directors' non-deferred (i.e "Cash") STI award set out in the table is delivered in the form of Retained Units. These are
units in relevant AIFs which are immediately vested on award but must be retained for a minimum period of six months. For these purposes, Henderson awards units in a basket of
11 AIFs which are deemed to be representative of the overall AIFMD activities of the company. The amounts delivered in this form are £42,968, £21,840 and £13,884 for
Mr. Formica, Mr. Thompson and Mr. Wagstaff respectively. 

(3) The STI bonus awarded to the Chief Executive was impacted by the strength of his personal and strategic contributions, as well as the outcome of the financial scorecard referred to
above. His award was offset by the risk adjustment referred to above, as a result of which his overall STI award is reduced by 3% relative to 2015. 

(4) For the Chief Financial Officer, shareholders are reminded that, in respect of 2015, Mr. Thompson waived an amount (£109,000) of his calculated STI bonus in the interests of
consistency with wider reward outcomes across the company. Therefore, although the bonus awarded to him, after adjustment for the risk adjustment, appears to reflect a 7.6%
increase from his prior year incentive award, in reality it reflects a 7.7% reduction relative to his prior year calculated award. 

(5) The figure shown for the Global Head of Distribution reflects the STI bonus for the period from May 24, 2016 at which time he was appointed an Executive Director. The full year

LTI vesting in respect of performance periods ended in 2016 

        The performance period for the first tranche of the 2014 LTIP ended on December 31, 2016. The table below shows the calculation to determine the percentage vesting based on the TSR result over the
performance period. This accounts for vesting of 95% of the award. The Henderson Remuneration Committee was satisfied that this reflected the financial and operating performance of the business over the
period. In addition, the Henderson Remuneration Committee assessed performance against a range of risk and sustainability measures which account for the other 5% of the award and determined that this
element should be reduced to 3% of the maximum 5% available. This reflects the Henderson Remuneration Committee's recognition of a small number of legacy control and governance issues which have been
identified and addressed (or are in the process of being addressed). The responsibility for these shortcomings ultimately rests with the senior cadre of the firm who make up the material proportion of
participants within this plan, and it was concluded that the timing of these legacy issues correlated with the performance period of the 2014 LTIP. Therefore, the Henderson Remuneration Committee felt that a
reduction in the element relating to the risk and sustainability metrics was justified.

        The table below shows the vesting details of the first tranche of LTIP 2014 for the Executive Directors. The awards vest on April 1, 2017. The value of the vested shares is based on a share price of £2.39,
this being the average share price during the last quarter of 2016 in accordance with the regulations.

(£940,000) includes the STI award for the period prior to his appointment, during which the structure and mix of his remuneration was markedly different.

(6) The deferred company shares referred to in the table above will be awarded at a price equal to the average purchase price of the underlying shares acquired to satisfy all awards (to
all participants) under the Deferred Equity Plan (DEP) immediately prior to the date of award (expected to be on or around April 3, 2017). 

(7) The deferred fund interests referred to in the table above will be awarded at the unit value of the relevant fund(s) at the date that the fund investment is made (expected to be on or
around April 3, 2017).

LTI awards made during 2016 

        Under the LTIP, the Henderson Remuneration Committee may make awards to Executive Directors up to a maximum number of ordinary shares determined by the Henderson Remuneration Committee at
the date of grant. Vesting of awards is partly after three years (two thirds of initial award) and partly after four years (one third of initial award). Under the 2016 LTIP, the vesting of awards is subject to the
achievement of relevant performance targets over the measurement period, and continued employment. Vested shares under the plan are subject to additional holding periods (two years for the first vested
tranche and one year for the second vested tranche) such that the minimum period between grant and release is five years. Vested awards may be exercised at any time within the holding period or the following
five years, otherwise the award automatically lapses.

        The performance measures under the 2016 LTIP are:

• TSR performance measured equally against the FTSE 350 and the ASX 100 (50% in aggregate); 

• Net flows (15%); 

• Three year investment performance (15%); 

• Growth in operating margin (10%); and 

• Success in implementing the People Strategy (10%).

        In addition, the Henderson Remuneration Committee must be satisfied that the above performance conditions appropriately reflect the company's underlying financial performance over the measurement
period.

        The Henderson Remuneration Committee has the power to vary or lapse individual unvested awards in cases of poor risk management, or where results have been misstated or where there has been serious
misconduct, a material failure in risk management or a downturn in financial performance. The Henderson Remuneration Committee also has the ability in certain cases to claw back vested awards.

        In March 2016, the following LTI awards were granted to Executive Directors(1):

239

(2) In addition to the vested award under LTIP 2014, the single figure LTI disclosure (£1,502,489) for Phil Wagstaff includes the vesting of 621,353 shares in March 2017, by reference
to the performance period ending on December 31, 2016, under an award granted to him on joining Henderson in March 2012.

Outstanding LTI and other share scheme awards 

        The table below shows the vesting results of LTIP awards for 2012 to 2014 (first tranche). The second tranche of the 2014 plan and the 2015 and 2016 plans may vest, depending on performance over the
measurement period, in 2017 (2014 LTIP second tranche and LTIP 2015 first tranche), 2018 (2015 LTIP second tranche and LTIP 2016 first tranche) and 2019 (2016 LTIP second tranche, respectively). The

approved plan (i.e. at 500% and 300% of base salary for the Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer/Global Head of Distribution, respectively) to maximize their alignment
with the long-term interests of the company and its shareholders.

(3) The face value of the award is based on the share price at the date of award (£2.50). 

(4) The LTIP awards granted on March 24, 2016 were in the form of nil priced options. This gives the participants rights over shares at the time of vesting subject to the satisfaction of
relevant performance conditions over the plan measurement period. The resulting value of the award will be based on the number of options that vest and the prevailing share price
at the point of vesting. 

(5) The Global Head of Distribution was not an Executive Director at the date the 2016 LTIP was awarded, although he was awarded 282,000 nil priced options with a face value of
£705,000 on March 24, 2016, prior to his appointment.

        It should be noted that, at this stage, it is not proposed to amend the performance metrics of the in-flight LTIP plans to reflect the proposed merger. However, should the merger be approved, the
Remuneration Committee of the combined entity will review the prevailing measures to ensure that they remain relevant, reflect an appropriate level of stretch, and remain aligned with the long-term horizons
and strategic goals of the new entity. Henderson will undertake appropriate shareholder engagement and approval activities in the event that any changes to the metrics are proposed.

UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL INFORMATION 

        On October 3, 2016, Henderson Group plc ("Henderson") and Janus Capital Group Inc. ("Janus") entered into a proposed all-stock merger agreement (the "Merger"), pursuant to which the businesses of
Henderson and Janus will be combined under Henderson, which will be renamed Janus Henderson Group plc ("Janus Henderson"). As part of the Merger, each share of Janus common stock will be exchanged
for 4.7190 Henderson ordinary shares. Effective immediately prior to the closing of the Merger, Henderson will implement a share consolidation at a ratio of one Janus Henderson ordinary share for every 10
Henderson ordinary shares, so that at closing of the Merger each Janus shareholder will receive 0.47190 Janus Henderson ordinary shares.

        The Merger will be accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ("U.S. GAAP")
under Accounting Standards Codification Topic 805, Business Combinations ("ASC 805"). U.S. GAAP requires that one of the two companies in the Merger be designated as the acquirer for accounting
purposes based on the evidence available. Henderson will be treated as the acquiring entity for accounting purposes, and accordingly, the Janus assets acquired and liabilities assumed have been adjusted based
on preliminary estimates of fair value. Following completion of the transaction, Janus Henderson intends to report financial results in U.S. Dollars in accordance with U.S. GAAP and will operate on a
December 31 year end.

        The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information and related notes (the "Pro Forma Financial Information") is based on the historical consolidated financial statements of
Henderson and the historical consolidated financial statements of Janus, and has been prepared to reflect the Merger. The pro forma adjustments related to the Merger include:

• The merging of Henderson and Janus and the issuance of 4.7190 Henderson ordinary shares for each share of Janus common stock held prior to the Merger; 

• The 1:10 share consolidation immediately prior to the closing of the Merger; 

• Reflecting the assets and liabilities of Janus at their preliminary estimated fair values; 

• The receipt of option premium on the issuance of options to Dai-ichi Life Holdings, Inc. ("Dai-ichi") to purchase shares in Janus Henderson; and 

• Estimated transaction costs directly related to the transaction incurred by Henderson and Janus.

        The Pro Forma Financial Information is based on the most recent historical financial statements included or incorporated by reference in this proxy statement/prospectus. For both Henderson and Janus, this
is financial information as at and for the year ended December 31, 2016.

        The unaudited pro forma combined income statement for the year ended December 31, 2016 (the "2016 Pro Forma Income Statement") gives effect to the Merger as if it had occurred on January 1, 2016,
while the unaudited pro forma combined balance sheet (the "Pro Forma Balance Sheet") as of December 31, 2016 gives effect to the transaction as if it had occurred on that date. However, it does not include
adjustments for other acquisitions completed by Henderson or Janus during the periods presented, as these acquisitions were not considered significant individually or in the aggregate.

        The Pro Forma Financial Information should be read in conjunction with:

• Henderson's audited consolidated financial statements and related notes, as well as the related "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" as of
and for the year ended December 31, 2016, in each case included in this proxy statement/prospectus; and

• Janus's audited consolidated financial statements and related notes, as well as "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations", in each case contained
in Janus's Annual Report on Form 10-K as of and for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, incorporated by reference in this proxy statement/prospectus.

        Both Henderson's historical consolidated financial statements ("Henderson's financial statements") and Janus's historical consolidated financial statements ("Janus's financial statements") have been
prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The Pro Forma Financial Information includes reclassifications and adjustments to conform Janus's historical accounting presentation to Henderson's accounting
presentations, in each case for the relevant periods.

        The pro forma adjustments are based upon the best available information and certain assumptions that Henderson believes to be reasonable. There can be no assurance that the final allocation of the
purchase price and the fair values will not materially differ from the preliminary amounts reflected in the Pro Forma Financial Information. Adjustments included in the Pro Forma Financial Information are
based on items that are factually supportable and directly attributable to the Merger, and for the purposes of the Pro Forma Income Statement, are expected to have a continuing impact on the combined results.
The Pro Forma Financial Information is presented for informational purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the combined financial position or results of operations that would have been realized had
the Merger occurred as of the dates indicated, nor is it meant to be indicative of any anticipated combined financial position or future results of operations that the enlarged group will experience after the
completion of the Merger. The Pro Forma Financial Information does not reflect the cost of any integration activities or benefits from the Merger including potential synergies that may be derived in future
periods.

NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL INFORMATION 

Note 1. Basis of presentation 

        The Pro Forma Financial Information set forth herein is based upon the historical financial statements of Henderson and Janus and has been prepared to illustrate the effects of the Merger, as if it had
occurred on January 1, 2016 in respect of the Pro Forma Income Statement and as if it had occurred on December 31, 2016 in respect of the Pro Forma Balance Sheet. The Pro Forma Financial Information is
presented for illustrative purposes only and does not necessarily reflect the results of operations or the financial position of Janus Henderson that actually would have resulted had the Merger occurred at the
dates indicated, or project the results of operations or financial position of Janus Henderson for any future dates or periods.

        The Merger will be accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ("U.S. GAAP")
under Accounting Standards Codification Topic 805, Business Combinations ("ASC 805"). U.S. GAAP requires that one of the two companies in the Merger be designated as the acquirer for accounting
purposes based on the evidence available. Henderson will be treated as the acquiring entity for accounting purposes, and accordingly, the Janus assets acquired and liabilities assumed have been adjusted based
on preliminary estimates of fair value. Any excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identified assets acquired and liabilities assumed will be recognized as goodwill. The actual fair values will be
determined upon the consummation of the Merger and may vary from these preliminary estimates. In identifying Henderson as the acquiring entity for accounting purposes, Henderson took into account the
voting rights of all equity instruments, the intended and corporate governance structure of the combined company and the size of each of the companies. In assessing the size of each of the companies,
Henderson evaluated various metrics, including, but not limited to market capitalization, revenue, operating profit, assets and assets under management. No single factor was the sole determinant in the overall
conclusion that Henderson is the acquirer for accounting purposes; rather, all factors were considered in arriving at such conclusion. Following completion of the transaction, Janus Henderson intends to report
financial results in U.S. Dollars in accordance with U.S. GAAP and will operate on a December 31 year end.

        Pro forma adjustments reflected in the Pro Forma Balance Sheet are based on items that are factually supportable and directly attributable to the Merger. Pro forma adjustments reflected in the Pro Forma
Income Statement are based on items that are factually supportable, which are directly attributable to the Merger and which are expected to have a continuing impact on Janus Henderson's results of operations.
Any nonrecurring items directly attributable to the Merger are included in the Pro Forma Balance Sheet, but not in the Pro Forma Income Statement. In contrast, any nonrecurring items that were already
included in Henderson's or Janus's historical consolidated financial statements and not directly related to the Merger have not been eliminated—see Note 3. The Pro Forma Financial Information does not reflect
the cost of any integration activities or benefits from the Merger, including potential synergies that may be generated in future periods.

        Both Henderson's historical consolidated financial statements ("Henderson's financial statements") and Janus's historical consolidated financial statements ("Janus's financial statements") are prepared in
accordance with U.S. GAAP. The Pro Forma Financial Information includes reclassifications and adjustments to conform Janus's historical accounting presentation to Henderson's accounting presentations, in
each case for the relevant periods.

        The Pro Forma Financial Information is based on the most recent historical financial statements included or incorporated by reference in this proxy statement/prospectus. For both Henderson and Janus, this
is financial information as at, and for the year ended, December 31, 2016.

        The estimated income tax impacts of the pre-tax adjustments that are reflected in the Pro Forma Financial Information are calculated using an estimated blended statutory rate, which is based on
preliminary assumptions related to the jurisdictions in which the income (expense) adjustments will be recorded. The blended statutory rate and the effective tax rate of the combined group could be significantly
different depending on the post-transaction activities and geographical mix of profit before taxes.

Note 2. Adjustments to Janus's financial statements 

        The financial statements below illustrate the impact of adjustments made to Janus's financial statements in order to present them on a basis consistent with Henderson's accounting policies under
U.S. GAAP. These adjustments reflect Henderson's best estimates based upon the information currently available to Henderson, and could be subject to change once more detailed information is obtained.

(a) Pro forma classification adjustments have been made to Janus's statement of income in order to present it on a basis consistent with Henderson's. These adjustments have not changed Janus's total
revenue or total expense balances. These adjustments reflect Henderson's best estimates based upon information currently available to Henderson, and could be subject to change once more detailed
information is obtained. 

(b) Pro forma classification adjustments have been made to Janus's balance sheet in order to present it on a basis consistent with Henderson's. These adjustments reflect Henderson's best estimates based
upon information currently available to Henderson, and could be subject to change once more detailed information is obtained. 

(c) Under U.S. GAAP, an accounting policy choice exists between recognizing compensation expense in relation to equity settled share schemes with graded vesting and only service conditions attached via
either the graded vesting method or the straight line method. Henderson has elected to recognize such expenses using the graded vesting method under U.S. GAAP, whereas Janus has elected to use the
straight line method. This adjustment reflects the adjustment of Janus's compensation expense in respect of equity settled share based payments with graded vesting from the straight line to the graded
vesting method. As a result of the change in accounting policy, employee compensation and benefits expense increased by $6.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 and the current portion of
accrued compensation, benefits and staff costs recognized on the pro-form condensed combined balance sheet increased by $53.3 million with a corresponding decrease in retained earnings.
Additionally, as a result of this change in accounting policy, deferred tax liabilities included in the balance sheet at December 31, 2016 decreased by $19.8 million with a corresponding increase in
retained earnings and the provision for income taxes was reduced by $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. 

(d) In March 2016, the FASB issued accounting guidance that simplifies several aspects of the accounting for equity-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences of such transactions.
The guidance requires that on exercise of equity-based awards, tax benefits which are in excess or fall short of the cumulative book compensation expense should be recognized as an income tax benefit
or expense in the income statement. Henderson early adopted this guidance effective January 1, 2014, on a prospective basis, but Janus has not early adopted this guidance. Janus's statement of income
has been adjusted to reflect the early adoption of this guidance for the period presented on a prospective basis, resulting in a decrease in income tax expense of $0.6 million for the year ended
December 31, 2016.

Note 3. Significant nonrecurring items included in the historical financial statements 

        The following nonrecurring items are included in the historical financial statements of Henderson or Janus for the periods presented. These nonrecurring items are not directly related to the Merger, and as
such have not been adjusted for in the Pro Forma Financial Information.

        For the year ended December 31, 2016:

• Henderson recognized a $3.8 million ($3.8 million after tax) impairment on its equity method investment in Northern Pines ahead of its planned wind up. 

• Henderson incurred costs of $1.0 million ($0.9 million after tax) related to disposal transactions in the year, primarily related to the disposal of its alternative U.K. small cap team. 

• Henderson incurred costs of $1.1 million ($0.9 million after tax) in relation to the integration of its acquisitions of Perennial and 90 West.

        Henderson and Janus also incurred merger integration costs of $8.4 million and $5.3 million ($6.2 million and $3.3 million after tax) respectively which have not been adjusted for in the Pro Forma
Financial Information.

        There were no other significant nonrecurring items included in the historical financial statements of Janus for the year ended December 31, 2016 other than those directly related to the Merger, discussed at
Note 4(a) below.

Note 4. Pro forma adjustments related to the Merger 

(a) Transaction and related costs

        It has been estimated that total transaction and related costs of $65.0 million ($60.8 million after tax) will be incurred in connection with the Merger, which include advisory, legal, audit, valuation and other
professional fees. Henderson and Janus incurred $8.1 million and $8.0 million of transaction and related costs ($8.1 million and $7.1 million after tax) respectively during the year ended December 31, 2016. An
adjustment of $16.1 million ($15.2 million after tax) has been made to remove the expenses from the Pro Forma Income Statement. An adjustment of $45.6 million has been presented in the Pro Forma Balance
Sheet as a reduction to cash and a corresponding reduction to retained earnings to represent the estimated total after tax transaction and related costs, net of those that have already been incurred by Henderson
and Janus.

(b) Preliminary purchase consideration and allocation

        The Merger will be accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Under this method, the Janus assets acquired and liabilities assumed
have been recorded based on preliminary estimates of fair value. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, Henderson measures fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in
an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The final fair values will be determined upon the consummation of the transaction and may vary materially from these estimates.

Residual goodwill   393.2(vii)
Less: Janus's historical goodwill   (601.9)
Goodwill adjustment   (208.7)

(i) The total equity consideration was estimated using a GBP price of 231.0p for each share of Henderson common stock traded on the London Stock Exchange based on Henderson's
closing share price on March 17, 2017, which was the last practicable date prior to the issuance of this unaudited pro forma financial information, adjusted for the 1:10 share
consolidation, and then translated to USD using the March 17, 2017 mid-market exchange rate of 1.2376 to arrive at a price of $28.59. The actual purchase consideration will be
determined upon consummation of the Merger. A hypothetical 10% change in the price of Henderson's common stock, all other factors remaining constant, would result in a
corresponding increase or decrease in the total purchase consideration of approximately $246.4 million. 

(ii) Henderson will issue replacement awards to Janus employees as part of the Merger. As Janus has certain unvested stock based compensation arrangements with shares which are
considered to be outstanding shares at December 31, 2016, an adjustment of $61.0 million has been made to reduce the purchase consideration by the fair value of post-combination
services which are not recognized as a component of consideration transferred. At December 31, 2016, there were a total of 6.8 million shares included as outstanding above which
were not fully vested. A $3.0 million adjustment has also been made to increase the purchase consideration in relation to stock-based compensation arrangements where shares are
not considered to be outstanding, which represents the fair value attributable to pre-combination services. The resulting net adjustment is $58.0 million. 

(iii) The fair market value of total debt assumed represents the fair value of Janus's debt ($463.1 million) less the fair value of Janus's derivative instruments held against their convertible
debt ($7.5 million) which are recognized as part of other current assets and other current liabilities

on the Pro forma Balance Sheet. As at December 31, 2016, Janus recognized this debt at amortized cost of $406.3 million. An adjustment of $56.8 million will therefore be
recognized as a merger adjustment related to the debt, $20.2 million against the non-current portion of the long term debt and $36.6 million, representing the convertible option on
the convertible debt, against other current liabilities (described further in Note 4(e)). As a result of the total net fair value step-up of Janus's convertible debt and the associated
derivative instruments, a net deferred tax asset of $15.0 million has been recognized.

(iv) At completion, the fair value of Janus's intangible assets including internally developed computer software is estimated to be $2,838.1 million or a net increase of $1,497.0 million
compared to a carrying value of $1,341.1 million. The primary intangible assets include client relationships, investment management agreements, internally generated computer
software and trade names and trademarks, for which the fair value estimates of identifiable intangible assets have been determined based on publicly available benchmark data using
the income approach. 

Key assumptions include net inflows/outflows of client investments, market appreciation/depreciation of the underlying investments, profitability, discount rate and terminal growth.
For purposes of valuing the investment management agreements, Henderson used a rate of growth in client asset inflows consistent with recent experience and market appreciation
consistent with long-term historical market returns. These two key assumptions are the primary driver of the estimated fair value of the agreements. Profitability is expected to
remain in line with current average margins as a result of fee pressures offset by achieving scale through modest growth in assets and related management fees. Henderson used a
discount rate reflective of its cost of capital and terminal growth rate slightly above historical inflation. The assumptions used by Henderson to arrive at the estimated fair value of
the identifiable intangible assets have been derived primarily from publicly available information, including market transactions of varying degrees of comparability. However, a
detailed analysis has not been completed and actual results may differ from these estimates.

These adjustments have been tax affected using a blended statutory tax rate of 36.8% for the Pro Forma Income Statement.

(v) The fair value of the noncontrolling interest assumed represents the value recognized in Janus's December 31, 2016 consolidated balance sheet of $132.0 million ($88.9 million
nonredeemable noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interest of $43.1 million), increased by a fair value adjustment of $36.6 million to $168.6 million. This fair

(c)   Impact to stockholders' equity

        The estimated impact to total stockholders' equity is summarized as follows:

(d)   Option agreement with Dai-Ichi Life

        Henderson has entered into an agreement with Dai-ichi, giving them the option to acquire approximately 5% of new Janus Henderson shares subject to completion of the merger. An option premium of
£19.8 million ($24.5 million) will be receivable by Janus Henderson in respect of this agreement on completion of the merger. This has been recognized as a receipt of cash and an increase in equity of
$24.5 million on the Pro forma Balance Sheet.

(e)   Reclassification of derivative instruments on convertible debt

        Janus holds derivative instruments which partially hedge risk associated with convertible debt held. As a result of the merger, these instruments together with the conversion option on the convertible debt
(described in Note 4(b)(iii)) will be reclassified out of equity where they were held at a total cost of $9.1 million and recognized at fair value as assets of $36.5 million and liabilities of $65.6 million.

(vi) A net adjustment of $407.8 million to non-current deferred tax liabilities has been recorded on the net fair value step-up on Janus's identified intangible assets. This adjustment
includes the recognition of a deferred tax liability of $966.0 million relating to the estimated gross fair value of Janus's identified intangible assets at completion of $2,838.1 million,
offset by the reversal of Janus's deferred tax balance of $558.2 million on its historical value of identified intangible assets.             

(vii) The goodwill balance arising from the Merger is estimated to be $393.2 million, which results in a net adjustment to goodwill of ($208.7 million). The goodwill arising from the
Merger has been calculated as the excess of the total purchase consideration (including debt assumed and net of cash acquired) of $2,370.1 million over the fair value of the net
assets acquired.

This reclassification is required because the strike price of the instruments differs to the functional currency of the combined group. Movements in the fair value of these reclassified instruments of $7.9 million,
together with the associated tax expense of $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 have been recognized in the Pro forma Income Statement.

(f)    Interest expense

        As a result of the step-up in fair value of existing Janus debt, annual interest expense is reduced by $5.2 million, together with the associated tax expense of $1.9 million for the year ended December 31,
2016.

Note 5. Pro forma earnings per share 

        Pro forma earnings per share has been calculated to show the impacts of the Merger on a constant diluted and basic outstanding share basis, assuming shares issued in connection with the combination have
been outstanding at the beginning of the respective period presented.

        Immediately upon consummation of the Merger, Janus Henderson will issue replacement shares to holders of shares of Janus common stock, adjusted for the exchange ratio per the Merger Agreement.

        The weighted average number of shares used in computing basic earnings per share has been calculated using the weighted average number of Henderson shares issued and outstanding during the period
and the number of shares of Janus common stock issued and outstanding as at the period end, giving effect to the exchange ratio established in the Merger Agreement. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the
Janus Henderson pro forma basic earnings per share was calculated using 192.1 million weighted average shares, which reflects 1,091.1 million weighted average shares of Henderson issued and outstanding for
the period, adjusted to 109.1 million per the share consolidation, and the 175.9 million shares of Janus for the purposes of calculating earnings per share, converted to 83.0 million shares under the Merger
Agreement and share consolidation.

        The weighted average number of shares used in computing diluted earnings per share has been calculated using the adjusted average number of shares as per the paragraph above, adjusted for the dilutive
impact of stock options, restricted stock, warrants, convertible notes and other instruments relevant to Henderson, and of stock options, restricted stock, stock warrants and convertible notes relevant to Janus,
factoring in the exchange ratio set out in the Merger Agreement. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the Janus Henderson pro-forma diluted earnings per share was calculated using 196.1 million weighted
average shares, which reflects the adjusted 1,111.1 million weighted average shares of Henderson issued and outstanding for the period, adjusted to 111.1 million per the share consolidation, the 83.0 million
shares of Janus Henderson issued to Janus stockholders as per the paragraph above and the 4.2 million dilutive impact of Janus's dilutive instruments, converted to 2.0 million shares under the Merger
Agreement and share consolidation.

The authorized capital stock of Janus consists of 1,000,000,000 shares of common stock par value
$0.01 per share, and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $1.00 per share. All shares of
Janus common stock have equal rights and preferences.

As of the close of business on March 15, 2017, there were 184,297,796 shares of Janus common
stock and no shares of Janus preferred stock issued and outstanding.

The number of authorized shares of Janus common stock or preferred stock may be increased or
reduced (but not below the number of outstanding shares of common stock or preferred stock, as
applicable) pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of the entire Janus board.

Under the DGCL, the board of directors, without stockholder approval, may approve the issuance of
authorized but unissued shares of common stock.

 As at March 17, 2017, the issued and fully paid share capital of Henderson consists of 1,131,842,110
ordinary shares par value £0.125 per ordinary share.

As at March 17, 2017, the authorized share capital of Henderson was £274,363,847, divided into
2,194,910,776 ordinary shares of £0.125 each.

At closing of the merger, subject to the approval of Henderson shareholders, the authorized share
capital of Janus Henderson will be increased to $720,000,000, divided into 480,000,000 shares of
$1.50 each. At closing of the merger and as adjusted to account for the effect of the share
consolidation, Henderson estimates that, exclusive of ordinary shares underlying outstanding
options, there will be 200,154,341 ordinary shares issued and outstanding.

Preferred Stock
The Janus board is authorized, subject to the limitations prescribed by Delaware law, to issue shares
of preferred stock in one or more series and to establish the terms of such series.

In 2000, the Janus board designated 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock as Series A Preferred Stock.
No shares of Series A Preferred Stock are currently outstanding.

 Janus Henderson may issue shares with preferential rights with the approval of its shareholders by
ordinary resolution.

JANUS  JANUS HENDERSON
Certificated and Uncertificated Shares

Pursuant to the Janus bylaws, the shares of Janus common stock shall be represented by a certificate,
unless and until the Janus board adopts a resolution permitting shares to be uncertificated.

Notwithstanding the adoption of any such resolution providing for uncertificated shares, every
holder of Janus common stock represented by certificates and, upon request, every holder of
uncertificated shares, is entitled to have a certificate for the shares it owns signed by, or in the name
of Janus by (a) the Chairman of the Janus board, the Vice Chairman of the Janus board, the Chief
Executive Officer, the President or any Executive Vice President, and (b) the Chief Financial
Officer, the Treasurer, the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary, certifying the number of shares of
Janus common stock owned by such stockholder.

 Janus Henderson ordinary shares may be held in either certificated or uncertificated form.

Every holder of certificated shares is entitled, without payment, to have a certificate for the shares
that it owns executed under Janus Henderson's seal or in such other manner as the Janus Henderson
board may approve.

Preemptive Rights
Janus stockholders do not have preemptive rights to acquire newly issued shares of Janus common
stock.

 Janus Henderson shareholders will not have preemptive rights to acquire newly issued Janus
Henderson ordinary shares.

Redemption of Shares
There are no redemption, sinking fund or conversion rights with respect to the shares of Janus
common stock.

If Janus were to designate and issue shares of a series of preferred stock that is redeemable in
accordance with its terms, such terms would govern the redemption of such shares of preferred
stock.

 The Janus Henderson Amended Articles permit: (i) the issuance of redeemable shares; and (ii) Janus
Henderson to purchase its own shares.

If Janus Henderson were to issue redeemable shares (or convert non-redeemable shares), the
redemption of such shares would be governed by their terms, the Janus Henderson Amended
Articles and the Jersey Companies Law.

Any repurchase of shares by Janus Henderson would be governed by the Janus Henderson Amended
Articles and the Jersey Companies Law.

The applicable provisions of the Jersey Companies Law include (subject to certain exceptions) a
requirement for the directors who are to authorize the repurchase or redemption to make a statutory
solvency statement.

JANUS  JANUS HENDERSON
  In the case of a repurchase of shares, Janus Henderson may purchase on a stock exchange its own

fully paid shares (including CDIs) pursuant to a special resolution of its shareholders specifying the
maximum number of shares to be purchased; the maximum and minimum prices which may be paid;
and a date, not being later than 18 months after the passing of the resolution, on which the authority
to purchase is to expire.

Janus Henderson may purchase its own fully paid shares otherwise than on a stock exchange
pursuant to a special resolution of its shareholders but only if the purchase is made on the terms of a
written purchase contract which has been approved in advance by a resolution of its shareholders.
The shareholder from whom Janus Henderson proposes to purchase or redeem shares is not entitled
to take part in such shareholder vote in respect of the shares to be purchased.

Janus Henderson may fund a redemption or purchase of its shares from any source. Janus Henderson
cannot purchase its shares if, as a result of such purchase, only redeemable shares would remain in
issue.

A resolution passed at Henderson's 2016 annual general meeting provides the Henderson directors
with authority to purchase up to 113,184,210 shares or CDIs, representing 10% of Henderson's
issued share capital as at February 15, 2016, which will continue to apply to Janus Henderson until
the earlier of (i) its first annual general meeting and (ii) October 28, 2017.

It is intended that Janus Henderson will seek shareholder approval permitting the directors to
purchase up to 10% of Janus Henderson ordinary shares at the general meeting of Henderson to be
held on April 26, 2017, which, if approved, will replace the existing authority.

JANUS  JANUS HENDERSON
Right to Dividends

Under the DGCL and subject to any restrictions in the Janus Charter, the Janus board may declare
and pay dividends to the holders of the Janus capital stock out of surplus or, if there is no surplus,
out of net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared or the immediately preceding
fiscal year, or both, provided that such payment would not reduce capital below the aggregate
amount of capital represented by all classes of issued and outstanding stock having a preference as
to the distribution of assets.

Dividends may be paid in cash, in shares of Janus capital stock or in other property.

Each share of Janus common stock outstanding is entitled to participate equally in dividends as and
when declared by the Janus board.

 Pursuant to the Janus Henderson Amended Articles, dividends not exceeding an amount
recommended by the Janus Henderson board may be declared by ordinary resolution of Janus
Henderson shareholders. In addition, the Janus Henderson board may pay interim dividends if it
believes that they are justified by the profits or the cash flow position of Janus Henderson.

Dividends may be paid in cash or, if approved by ordinary resolution, in Janus Henderson ordinary
shares or other property.

Unless the share rights provide otherwise, all dividends must be apportioned and paid pro rata
according to the amounts paid on the shares during any portion of the period in respect of which the
dividend is paid.

Appraisal Rights
Under the DGCL, stockholders have appraisal rights in connection with mergers and consolidations,
provided the stockholder neither voted in favor of the merger or consolidated nor consented thereto
in writing and complied with certain procedural requirements of the DGCL. The right to demand
appraisal does not apply to shares of any class or series of stock if, at the record date fixed to
determine the stockholders entitled to receive notice of and to vote on the agreement of merger or
consolidation:

 No appraisal rights are available to shareholders of a company organized under the laws of Jersey.

• the shares were listed on a national securities exchange; or

• the shares were held of record by more than 2,000 stockholders.

  

Further, no appraisal rights are available for shares of stock of a constituent corporation surviving a
merger if the merger does not require a vote of the stockholders of the surviving corporation.
However, notwithstanding the above, appraisal rights are available for the shares of any class or
series of stock if the holders are required by the terms of an agreement of merger or consolidation to
accept for their stock anything other than:

• shares of stock of the surviving corporation;

• shares of stock of any other corporation which, at the effective date of the merger or

consolidation, will be listed on a national securities exchange, or held of record by more than
2,000 stockholders;

• cash in lieu of fractional shares of the corporations described in either of the above; or

• any combination of the shares of stock and cash in lieu of fractional shares described in any of the
three above.

  

Share Splits and Share Consolidations
Under the DGCL, Janus is entitled by amending the Janus Charter, subject to approval of holders of
the majority of the shares entitled to vote on the matter, to subdivide or combine the outstanding
shares of any class or series of a class of its shares into a greater or lesser number of outstanding
shares.

 Under the Jersey Companies Law, Janus Henderson is entitled by altering its memorandum of
association by special resolution of its shareholders to (i) consolidate and divide all or any of its
shares (whether issued or not) into shares of larger amount than its existing shares; and (ii) to
subdivide its shares, or any of them, into shares of smaller amount than is fixed by its memorandum
of association.

SHAREHOLDER MEETINGS
Time and Place of Meetings

Under the Janus bylaws, stockholder meetings shall be held at such time or place (in or outside of
Delaware) as designated from time to time by the board of directors and stated in a notice of the
meeting or in a duly executed waiver of notice thereof.

Under the DGCL, a written notice of the meeting shall state the place, date and hour of the meeting,
the means of remote communications, if any, by which stockholders and proxy holders may be
deemed to be present in person and vote at such meeting, and, in the case of a special meeting, the
purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called.

 General meetings may be held at such place or places, date and time as may be decided by the Janus
Henderson directors.

Notice of a general meeting must be sent to all members and CDI Holders. The notice must specify
the time, date and place of the meeting (including of any satellite meeting) and the general nature of
the business to be dealt with.

Voting Rights, Cumulating Voting
The holders of Janus common stock are entitled to one vote for each share on all matters submitted
to a vote of stockholders.

The DGCL provides that stockholders of a Delaware corporation do not have cumulative voting
rights in the election of directors unless such rights are granted in the certificate of incorporation of
the corporation. The Janus Charter does not provide for cumulative voting.

Any person authorized to vote may authorize another person or persons to act for him or her by
proxy. No proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three years from its authorization date, unless the
proxy provides for a longer period.

 There are no provisions in the Janus Henderson Amended Articles that restrict non-resident
shareholders from holding or exercising voting rights in relation of Janus Henderson ordinary
shares.

There are no provisions in the Jersey Companies Law relating to cumulative voting.

Action by Written Consent
The Janus Charter provides that stockholder action must be taken at a duly called annual or special
meeting of stockholders and may not be taken by written consent in lieu of a meeting.

 Unless prohibited by a company's articles of association, a unanimous written consent by each
shareholder entitled to vote on the matter may effect any matter that otherwise may be brought
before a shareholders' meeting, except for the removal of auditors. Such consent shall be deemed
effective when the instrument, or the last of several instruments, is last signed or on such later date
as is specified in the resolution. Furthermore, a company's articles of association may permit written
resolutions to be passed by such number of members that would be required to pass the resolutions
at a general meeting.

Unless prohibited by a company's articles of association, the members of a company have a power to
require a company to circulate a resolution that may properly be proposed and is to be proposed as a
written resolution.

The Janus Henderson Amended Articles do not prohibit an action to be taken by unanimous written
consent nor the circulation of a written resolution.

Quorum
For stock corporations, the certificate of incorporation or bylaws may specify the number to
constitute a quorum, but in no event shall a quorum consist of less than one-third of shares entitled
to vote at a meeting. In the absence of such specifications, a majority of shares entitled to vote shall
constitute a quorum.

The Janus bylaws provide that the holders of a majority of the stock issued and outstanding which
are entitled to vote, present in person or represented by proxy, except as otherwise provided by
statute, by the Janus Charter or the Janus bylaws, shall constitute a quorum at all meetings of the
stockholders for the transaction of business.

 Under the Janus Henderson Amended Articles, the holders of at least one-third in nominal value of
the issued shares (excluding any shares held in treasury) which are entitled to vote shall be a quorum
for all purposes.

No business may be transacted at any general meeting unless a quorum is present at the time when
the meeting proceeds to business.

If such quorum is not present at any meeting of the stockholders, the stockholders entitled to vote at
such meeting, present in person or represented by proxy, have power to adjourn the meeting, without
notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum is present or represented. If the
adjournment is for more than 30 days, or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the
adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record
entitled to vote at the meeting.

When a quorum is present at any meeting, unless otherwise required by law, the Janus Charter or the
Janus bylaws, or permitted by the rules of any stock exchange on which shares of the Janus common
stock are listed, any question brought before any meeting of the stockholders, other than the election
of directors, shall be decided by the vote of the holders of a majority of the total number of votes of
Janus capital stock represented at the meeting and entitled to vote on such question, voting as a
single class.

Annual Meetings of Stockholders

In accordance with the Janus bylaws, the annual meeting of stockholders shall be held on such day
of such month of each year (other than a Saturday, Sunday or holiday) as shall be determined by the
Janus board or, if the Janus board shall fail to act, by Janus's Chief Executive Officer. At the annual
meeting the stockholders shall elect directors and transact such other business as may be properly
brought before the meeting.

Written notice of each annual meeting of stockholders stating the place, date and hour of the meeting
shall be given to each stockholder entitled to vote at such meeting not less than 10 nor more than
60 days before the date of the meeting.

The Janus bylaws require that notice of any meeting of stockholders must be given to any
stockholder who shall attend such meeting in person or represented by proxy. Notice of any meeting
of stockholders shall not be required to be given to any stockholder who shall attend such meeting in
person or represented by proxy, except that such notice shall be required for any stockholder who
shall attend such meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to
the transaction of any business because the meeting was not lawfully called or convened.

 Janus Henderson must hold an annual general meeting of shareholders every year within a period of
seven months of the end of its financial year (which is December 31), at such place or places, date
and time as may be decided by the Janus Henderson directors.

General meetings may be held at such time and place as determined by the Janus Henderson
directors. All general meetings (including annual general meetings) must be convened by at least
14 clear days' notice.

Notice of the annual general meeting must be sent to all members and CDI Holders. For the purpose
of determining whether a person is entitled as a member to attend or vote at a meeting and how
many votes such person may cast, Janus Henderson may specify in the notice a date not more than
60 days nor less than 10 days before the date fixed for the meeting as the date for the determination
of the shareholders entitled to receive notice of, attend or vote at the meeting or appoint a proxy.

JANUS  JANUS HENDERSON
Special Meetings of Stockholders

Under Delaware law, stockholders generally do not have the right to call meetings of stockholders
unless that right is granted in the certificate of incorporation or bylaws. However, if a corporation
fails to hold its annual meeting within a period of 30 days after the date designated for the annual
meeting, or if no date has been designated for a period of 13 months after its last annual meeting, the
Delaware Court of Chancery may order a meeting to be held upon the application of any stockholder
or director.

In accordance with the Janus Charter, special meetings of stockholders may be called only by the
Chairman of the Janus board, Chief Executive Officer or President at the request in writing by the
Janus board pursuant to a resolution approved by a majority of the entire Janus board, upon not less
than 10 nor more than 60 days' written notice. This notice must state the purpose or purposes of the
proposed meeting and the business transacted at any special meeting shall be limited to the purpose
or purposes stated in the notice.

 Shareholders holding 10% or more of the company's voting rights and entitled to vote at the relevant
meeting may legally require the Janus Henderson directors to call a meeting of shareholders. The
JFSC may, at the request of any officer, secretary or shareholder, call or direct the calling of an
annual general meeting. Failure to call an annual general meeting in accordance with the
requirements of the Jersey Companies Law is a criminal offense on the part of a Jersey company and
its directors and secretary.

JANUS  JANUS HENDERSON
SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS

In accordance with the Janus bylaws, for business to be properly brought before an annual meeting
by a stockholder (other than the nomination of a person for election as a director), the stockholder
intending to propose the business, which we refer to as the Proponent, must give notice thereof in
writing to the Janus Secretary, which must be delivered to or mailed and received at the principal
executive offices of Janus not less than 90 days nor more than 120 days prior to the anniversary date
of the immediately preceding annual meeting of stockholders.

Notices from the stockholders must contain certain specified information concerning the persons to
be nominated or the matters to be brought before the meeting and information concerning the
stockholder submitting the proposal, including:

• a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the annual meeting and the reasons
for conducting such business;

• the name and address of the Proponent, and of any holder of record of the Proponent's shares as
they appear on Janus's books; the class and number of shares of Janus which are owned by the
Proponent;

• any material interest of the Proponent in such business;

• a description of any agreement, arrangement or understanding with respect to such business
between or among the Proponent and any of its affiliates or associates, and any others (including
their names) acting in concert with any of the foregoing; and

 As noted above, under the Jersey Companies Law, shareholders holding 10% or more of the
company's voting rights and entitled to vote at the relevant meeting may legally require the directors
to call a meeting of shareholders. This must be held as soon as practicable but in any case not later
than two months after the date of the requisition. The requisition shall state the objects of the
meeting. If the directors do not within 21 days from the date of the deposit of the requisition proceed
to call a meeting to be held within two months of that date, the requisitionists, or any of them
representing more than half of the total voting rights of all of them, may themselves call a meeting,
but a meeting so called shall not be held after three months from that date.

In addition to the requirements of the Jersey Companies Law, the Janus Henderson Amended
Articles provide that:

• if the requisition relates to any business that the member proposes to bring before the meeting,
such request must set forth:

• a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the meeting, the reasons for
conducting such business at the meeting, the text of the proposal;

• any material interest of such member or any shareholder associated person of such member
in such business; and

• a description of all agreements, arrangements and understandings between such member or
any shareholder associated person of such member and any other person or persons in
connection with the request by such member.

of or series of stock of Janus or otherwise, that has been entered into as of the date of the
Proponent's notice by, or on behalf of, the Proponent or any of its affiliates or associates.

The chairperson of the meeting has the power to determine if business is properly brought before
the meeting.

 • such requisition must be made in writing to the Janus Henderson secretary not earlier than the
close of business on the 120th calendar day nor later than the close of business on the
90th calendar day prior to the date of the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual general
meeting, provided, however, that if the date of an annual meeting is more than 30 calendar days
before or more than 60 calendar days after the date of the first anniversary of the preceding year's
annual general meeting, notice by the member must be so delivered in writing not earlier than the
close of business on the 120th calendar day prior to such annual general meeting and not later
than the close of business on the later of (i) the 90th calendar day prior to such annual general
meeting, and (ii) the 10th calendar day after the day on which public announcement of the date of
such annual general meeting is first made by Janus Henderson.

Shareholders do not otherwise have rights to add proposals to be considered at general or annual
general meetings under the Jersey Companies Law.

SHAREHOLDER SUITS
Class actions and derivative actions are generally available to the stockholders of a Delaware
corporation for, among other things, breach of fiduciary duty, corporate waste and actions not taken
in accordance with applicable law. In such actions, the court has discretion to permit the winning
party to recover attorneys' fees incurred in connection with such action.

 Under Article 141 of the Jersey Companies Law, a shareholder may apply to court for relief on the
grounds that the conduct of the company's affairs, including a proposed or actual act or omission by
the company, is "unfairly prejudicial" to the interests of shareholders generally or of some part of
shareholders, including at a minimum the shareholder making the application.

JANUS  JANUS HENDERSON
Generally, Janus may be sued under federal securities law, and under the DGCL, and stockholders
may bring derivative actions on behalf of Janus to enforce the rights of the corporation. A person
may institute and maintain a derivative suit only if such person was a stockholder at the time of the
transaction that is the subject of the suit or his or her shares thereafter devolved upon him or her by
operation of law. The DGCL also requires that the derivative plaintiff make a demand on the
directors of the corporation to assert the corporate claim before the suit may be prosecuted by the
derivative plaintiff, unless such demand would be futile.

 There may also be common or customary law personal actions available to shareholders.

Under Article 143 of the Jersey Companies Law (which sets out the types of relief a court may grant
in relation to an action brought under Article 141 of the Jersey Companies Law), the court may
make an order regulating the affairs of a company, requiring a company to refrain from doing or
continuing to do an act complained of, authorizing civil proceedings and providing for the purchase
of shares by a company or by any of its other shareholders.

RIGHTS OF INSPECTION
Under the DGCL, a stockholder or his or her agent has a right to inspect the corporation's stock
ledger, a list of all of its stockholders and its other books and records during the usual hours of
business upon written demand under oath stating his purpose (which must be reasonably related to
such person's interest as a stockholder).

If the corporation refuses to permit such inspection or refuses to reply to the request within five
business days of the demand, the stockholder may apply to the Delaware Chancery Court for an
order to compel such inspection.

 The register of shareholders and books containing the minutes of general meetings or of meetings of
any class of shareholders of a Jersey company must during business hours be open to the inspection
of a shareholder of the company without charge.

The register of directors and secretaries must during business hours (subject to such reasonable
restrictions as the company may by its articles of association or in general meeting impose, but so
that not less than two hours in each business day be allowed for inspection) be open to the inspection
of a shareholder or director of the company without charge.

JANUS  JANUS HENDERSON
BOARD OF DIRECTORS

Size and Classification
Under the DGCL, the number of board members shall be fixed by the bylaws, unless the certificate
of incorporation fixes the number of directors, in which case a change in the number shall be made
only by amendment of the certificate of incorporation. The DGCL requires that the board of
directors be comprised of at least one member.

Under the Janus Charter, the Janus board must consist of not less than three and not more than 18
persons. The exact number of directors within the above limitation may be fixed from time to time
by the Janus board pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of the entire Janus board. Janus
currently has 10 directors.

The Janus board is not classified.

Under Delaware law, directors need not be stockholders of Janus or residents of Delaware.

 Under the Janus Henderson Amended Articles, the number of directors may not be less than three or
more than 12 persons.

The Janus Henderson board is not classified.

A Janus Henderson director is not required to hold any shares in the capital of Janus Henderson by
way of qualification nor to be a resident of any particular jurisdiction.

Election
Under the Janus Charter and the Janus bylaws, each member of the Janus board is elected by Janus
stockholders annually for a term of one year and holds office until the next succeeding annual
meeting.

Save for the right of the Janus board to fill vacancies, the Janus bylaws provide that directors are
elected by a majority of the votes cast at the meeting for the election of directors at which a quorum
is present. However, if, as of the date that is 14 days in advance of the date that Janus files with the
SEC its definitive proxy statement for the relevant meeting of stockholders (regardless of whether or
not thereafter revised, amended or supplemented), the number of nominees exceeds the number of
directors to be elected, the directors shall be elected by the vote of a plurality of the shares
represented in person or by proxy at any such meeting and entitled to vote on the election of
directors (and in such case stockholders shall not be permitted to vote "against" a nominee).

 Janus Henderson directors are appointed by way of ordinary resolution of the shareholders.

Under the Janus Henderson Amended Articles, all directors are subject to annual re-election by
shareholders. Any retirement will not have effect until the conclusion of the meeting, except where a
resolution is passed to elect some other person in the place of the retiring Janus Henderson director
or a resolution for his or her re-election is put to the meeting and lost. Accordingly, a retiring Janus
Henderson director who is re-elected will continue in office without a break in service.

Table of Contents

288

JANUS  JANUS HENDERSON
A "majority of the votes" cast means that the number of shares voted "for" a director must exceed
the number of votes cast "against" that director. If a director does not receive a majority of the votes
cast, the director shall offer to tender his or her resignation to the Janus board.

  

Removal
Under Delaware law, any or all of the directors may be removed, with or without cause, by the
holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote unless the certificate of incorporation otherwise
provides.

The Janus Charter provides that directors may be removed from office in accordance with Delaware
law.

 Janus Henderson may by ordinary resolution remove any director from office. No special notice
need be given of any such resolution and no director proposed to be removed has any special right to
protest against his removal.

Such removal can take place notwithstanding any contrary provision in the Janus Henderson
Amended Articles or any contract, but is without prejudice to any claim the Janus Henderson
director may have for damages for breach of any such contract.

Vacancies
Any vacancy on the Janus board (whether because of death, resignation, retirement, removal, an
increase in the number of directors, or any other cause) is filled exclusively by a majority of the
directors then in office or by a sole remaining director.

Each director so chosen to fill the vacancy shall hold office until the next succeeding annual meeting
and until his or her successor is duly elected and qualified, or until his or her earlier resignation or
removal.

The Janus board may, by resolution, eliminate any vacant directorship thereby reducing the size of
the whole Janus board but in no event shall the size of the Janus board be less than three directors.

 Janus Henderson may by ordinary resolution appoint any person to be a director either to fill a
casual vacancy or as an additional director.

The Janus Henderson board may appoint a director to fill a casual vacancy or as an additional
director. Such person can hold office until the next annual general meeting where he would be
subject to re-election.

Powers of the Board of Directors
The business of Janus is managed under the direction of the Janus board which may exercise all
such powers of Janus and do all such lawful acts and things as are not prohibited by Delaware law,
the Janus Charter or the Janus bylaws directed or required to be exercised by the stockholders.

 Subject to the provisions of Jersey company law, the Janus Henderson Amended Articles and to any
directions given by special resolution of its shareholders, the business of Janus Henderson is
managed by the Janus Henderson board, which can exercise all the powers of Janus Henderson.

JANUS  JANUS HENDERSON
Fiduciary Duties of Directors

Under Delaware law, the business and affairs of a corporation are managed by or under the direction
of its board of directors. In exercising their powers to manage or oversee the management of the
corporation, directors owe fiduciary duties of loyalty and care to the corporation and its
stockholders.

Duty of care

The duty of care requires that a director make informed business decisions with the care that an
ordinarily prudent person would exercise under similar circumstances. Under this duty, a director
must inform himself of, and disclose to stockholders, all material information reasonably available
prior to making a business decision.

The duty of care also requires that directors exercise care in overseeing and investigating the
conduct of corporate employees.

 Under the Jersey Companies Law, a director of a Jersey company, in exercising the director's powers
and discharging the director's duties, has:

• a fiduciary duty to act honestly and in good faith with a view to the best interests of the company;
and

• a duty of care to exercise the care, diligence and skill that a reasonably prudent person would
exercise in comparable circumstances.

Customary law is also an important source of law in the area of directors' duties in Jersey as it
expands upon and provides a more detailed understanding of the general duties and obligations of
directors. The Jersey courts view English common law as highly persuasive in this area. In
summary, the following duties will apply as manifestations of the general fiduciary duty under the
Jersey Companies Law:

JANUS  JANUS HENDERSON
Duty of loyalty

The duty of loyalty requires that a director act in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believes
to be in the best interests of the corporation. A director must not use his or her corporate position for
personal gain or advantage. This duty prohibits self-dealing by a director and mandates that the best
interest of the corporation and its stockholders take precedence over any interest possessed by a
director, officer or controlling stockholder and not shared by the stockholders generally. Further,
Delaware courts will generally require the directors to demonstrate that a self-dealing transaction
was entirely fair to the corporation.

Business judgment rule

A party challenging the propriety of a decision of a board of directors typically bears the burden of
rebutting the applicability of the presumptions afforded to directors by the "business judgment rule,"
which presumes that disinterested directors have made decisions on an informed basis with a good
faith belief that the decisions are in the best interests of the corporation, in accordance with the
duties of care and loyalty. Under the business judgment standard, the Delaware court will uphold
director conduct unless such conduct cannot be attributed to any rational business purpose.
However, this presumption may be rebutted by evidence of a breach of one of the fiduciary duties. If
the presumption is rebutted the directors must show the procedural fairness of the transaction, and
that the transaction was of fair value to the stockholders of the corporation. If the presumption is not
rebutted, the business judgment rule attaches to protect the directors and their decisions.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Delaware courts may subject directors' conduct to enhanced scrutiny
in respect of, among other matters, defensive actions taken in response to a threat to corporate
control and approval of a transaction resulting in a sale of control of the corporation.

 Duty to act in good faith

A director has a duty to act in what he bona fide considers to be the best interests of the company.
He or she must not act for any collateral purpose. In keeping with such a position of trust, the courts
will give the individual director discretion to determine this, and are likely only to infer that he was
not acting in good faith if no reasonable director could have believed that the course of action was in
the best interests of the company.

Generally, as with other fiduciary duties, the duty of good faith is owed by every director
individually and not collectively as a board and is owed only to the company and not to any other
person, be it another company or an individual.

Duty to exercise powers for a proper purpose

Even if directors are acting in good faith and in the interests of the company and its members as a
whole, they must nevertheless use their powers for the purposes for which they were conferred.

Conflict of duty and interest

A director must avoid any actual or potential conflict between his own and the company's interests.
There are provisions in the Jersey Companies Law which require a director to disclose certain
interests which are detailed below.

Duty to account for profits

A director's fiduciary position generally precludes him from taking a personal profit from any
opportunities arising from his directorship, even if he is acting honestly and for the good of the
company. However, the articles may permit the director to be personally interested in arrangements
involving the company (subject to the requirement to have disclosed such interest). Directors are
only entitled to receive remuneration and payment of expenses if the articles of association expressly
permit.

JANUS  JANUS HENDERSON
Indemnification of Directors and Officers

Section 145 of the DGCL provides that a Delaware corporation may indemnify any person who was,
is or is threatened to be made, party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or
proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (other than an action by or in the
right of such corporation), by reason of the fact that such person is or was an officer, director,
employee or agent of such corporation or is or was serving at the request of such corporation as a
director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation or enterprise. The indemnity may include
expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and
reasonably incurred by such person in connection with such action, suit or proceeding, provided
such person acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to
the corporation's best interests and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no
reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct was illegal, and provided further such person
acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the
corporation's best interests, provided that no indemnification is permitted without judicial approval
if the officer, director, employee or agent is adjudged to be liable to the corporation.

Where an officer or director is successful on the merits or otherwise in the defense of any action
referred to above, the corporation must indemnify him against the expenses (including attorneys'
fees) which such officer or director has actually and reasonably incurred.

 The Jersey Companies Law does not contain any provision permitting Jersey companies to limit the
liabilities of directors for breach of fiduciary duty.

However, a Jersey company may exempt from liability, and indemnify directors and officers for,
liabilities:

• incurred in defending any proceedings (whether civil or criminal):

• in which judgment is given in the person's favor or the person is acquitted;

• which are discontinued otherwise than for some benefit conferred by the person or on the person's
behalf or some detriment suffered by the person;

• which are settled on terms which include such benefit or detriment and, in the opinion of a
majority of the directors of the company (excluding any director who conferred such benefit or on
whose behalf such benefit was conferred or who suffered such detriment), the person was
substantially successful on the merits in the person's resistance to the proceedings;

• any liability incurred otherwise than to the company if the person acted in good faith with a view
to the best interests of the company;

• any liability incurred in connection with an application made under Article 212 of the Jersey
Companies Law in which relief is granted to the person by the court; or

• any liability against which the company normally maintains insurance for persons other than
directors.

JANUS  JANUS HENDERSON
The Janus Charter provides that each person who was or is or is threatened to be made a party to, or
is otherwise involved in, any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director, officer, employee, agent,
trustee, committee member or representative of Janus (or is or was serving at the request of Janus as
a director, officer, employee, agent, trustee, committee member or representative of any other entity,
including service with respect to employee benefit plans) shall be indemnified and held harmless by
Janus, to the full extent permitted by Delaware law.

  

Janus has entered into indemnification agreements with certain of its officers and directors. Such
indemnification agreements provide for prompt indemnification to the fullest extent permitted by
law and for the prompt advancement of expenses, including attorneys' fees and all other costs and
expenses incurred in connection with any action, suit or proceeding in which the director or officer
is a witness or other participant, or to which the director or officer is a party, by reason (in whole or
in part) of service in such capacities.

  

Limitation of Director Liability
Section 102(b)(7) of the DGCL allows a corporation to provide in its certificate of incorporation that
a director of the corporation will not be personally liable to the corporation or its stockholders for
monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except where the director:

• breached the duty of loyalty to the corporation or its stockholders;

• failed to act in good faith, engaged in intentional misconduct or knowingly violated a law;

• authorized the payment of a dividend or approved a stock purchase or redemption in violation of
Section 174 of the DGCL; or

• obtained an improper personal benefit.

The Janus Charter provides for this limitation of liability.

 The Jersey Companies Law does not contain any provision permitting Jersey companies to limit the
liabilities of directors for breach of fiduciary duty.



8/28/2019 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1065865/000104746917001846/a2231435zdefm14a.htm

JANUS  JANUS HENDERSON
Section 145 of the DGCL authorizes a corporation to purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of
any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation or is or was
serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another
corporation or enterprise, against any liability asserted against him and incurred by him in any such
capacity, or arising out of his or her status as such, whether or not the corporation would otherwise
have the power to indemnify him under Section 145 of the DGCL.

  

Directors' Conflicts of Interest
Under the DGCL, a contract or transaction in which a director has an interest will not be voidable
solely for this reason if:

• the material facts with respect to such interested director's relationship or interest are disclosed or
are known to the board of directors, and the board of directors in good faith authorizes the
transaction by the affirmative vote of a majority of the disinterested directors, even though the
disinterested directors may be less than a quorum;

• the material facts with respect to such interested director's relationship or interest are disclosed or
are known to the stockholders entitled to vote on such transaction, and the transaction is
specifically approved in good faith by vote of the majority of shares entitled to vote thereon; or

• the transaction is fair to the corporation as of the time it is authorized, approved or ratified.

The mere fact that an interested director is present and voting on a transaction in which he or she
is interested will not itself make the transaction void. Under the DGCL, an interested director
could be held liable for a transaction in which such director derived an improper personal benefit.

 An interested director must disclose to the company the nature and extent of any interest in a
transaction with the company or one of its subsidiaries. Failure to disclose an interest entitles the
company or a shareholder to apply to the court for an order setting aside the transaction concerned
and directing that the director account to the company for any profit.

A transaction is not voidable and a director is not accountable notwithstanding a failure to disclose
an interest if the transaction is confirmed by special resolution and the nature and extent of the
director's interest in the transaction are disclosed in reasonable detail in the notice calling the
meeting at which the resolution is passed.

Although it may still order that a director account for any profit, a court shall not set aside a
transaction unless it is satisfied that the interests of third parties who have acted in good faith would
not thereby be unfairly prejudiced and the transaction was not reasonable and fair in the interests of
the company at the time it was entered into.

JANUS  JANUS HENDERSON
MERGERS AND CONSOLIDATIONS

General
Under the DGCL, a merger, consolidation, sale, lease, exchange or other disposition of all or
substantially all of the property of a corporation not in the usual and regular course of the
corporation's business, or a dissolution of the corporation, is generally required to be approved by
the holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote on the matter, unless the DGCL or the
certificate of incorporation provides otherwise. The Janus Charter does not provide otherwise except
as discussed in "Business Combinations with Interested Stockholders" below.

Mergers in which less than 20% of a corporation's stock is issued generally do not require
stockholder approval.

Any mortgage or pledge of a corporation's property and assets may be authorized without the vote or
consent of stockholders, except to the extent that the certificate of incorporation otherwise provides.

The DGCL does not contain a procedure comparable to a scheme of arrangement under the Jersey
Companies Law.

 A merger carried out in accordance with the Jersey Merger Regime set out under Part 18B of the
Jersey Companies Law (the "Jersey Merger Regime") requires shareholder approval by special
resolution passed by at least two-thirds of the shares being voted in person or by proxy at a meeting
(or such higher threshold as may be set out in a company's articles of association) or by unanimous
(or such lesser number as may set out in the company's articles of association provided that the
majority can be no less than two-thirds) written resolution signed by each of the shareholders
entitled to vote.

For the avoidance of doubt, the proposed merger that is the subject of this proxy
statement/prospectus does not constitute a merger for the purposes of the Jersey Companies Law and
is therefore not being carried out in accordance with the Jersey Merger Regime.

Business Combinations with Interested Stockholders
Janus is subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the DGCL. The DGCL generally prohibits a
publicly held company from engaging in a business combination with an "interested stockholder"
(generally a person who beneficially owns 15% or more of a corporation's voting stock) for a period
of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder,
unless:

• the business combination or the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an
interested stockholder was approved by the corporation's board of directors prior to the date the
interested stockholder acquired shares;

• the interested stockholder acquired at least 85% of the voting stock of the corporation in the
transaction in which it became an interested stockholder; or

 Although the Janus Henderson Amended Articles do not require shareholder approval of business
combinations, as noted above, the Jersey Companies Law (in the case of a merger carried out in
accordance with the Jersey Merger Regime) requires such approval by special resolution passed by
at least two-thirds of the shares being voted in person or by proxy at a meeting or by unanimous

JANUS  JANUS HENDERSON
• the business combination is approved by a majority of the corporation's board of directors and by

the affirmative vote of at least two thirds of the outstanding voting stock owned by disinterested
stockholders at an annual or special meeting and not by written consent.

A business combination generally includes mergers, asset sales, and other transactions resulting in
a financial benefit to the interested stockholder.

A corporation may elect not to be governed by Section 203 of the DGCL. Neither the Janus
Charter nor the Janus bylaws contain this election.

In addition, under the Janus Charter, the affirmative vote of at least 70% of Janus voting stock,
voting together as a single class, is required to enter into certain business combinations (defined
broadly to include mergers, consolidations, certain sales or other dispositions of assets, and
certain transactions that would increase certain interested stockholders' percentage ownership in
Janus) with an interested stockholder or its affiliates.

  

Parent-Subsidiary Mergers
Delaware law provides that a parent corporation, by resolution of its board of directors and without
any stockholder vote, may merge with any subsidiary of which it owns at least 90% of each class of
its capital stock. Upon any such merger, and in the event the parent corporation does not own all of
the stock of the subsidiary, dissenting stockholders of the subsidiary are entitled to certain appraisal
rights.

 The Jersey Companies Law provides that a parent company, by way of special resolution and (if
applicable) a merger agreement, may merge with any subsidiary.

JANUS  JANUS HENDERSON
DISSOLUTION

Under Delaware law, a corporation may voluntarily dissolve (i) if a majority of the board of
directors adopts a resolution to that effect and the holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding
shares entitled to vote thereon vote for such dissolution; or (ii) if all stockholders entitled to vote
thereon consent in writing to such dissolution.

Each share of Janus common stock outstanding is entitled to participate equally in any distribution
of net assets made to the stockholders in the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of Janus.

 Under the Jersey Companies Law, a company may be wound up voluntary (summary winding up),
under supervision (creditors' winding up), or by the courts of Jersey (winding up on just and
equitable grounds).

A special resolution of a company is required to approve:

• in the case of a summary (solvent) winding up:

• the commencement of a summary winding up

• appointment of a liquidator for the purposes of the winding up or the liquidator's removal
from office;

• authorization of the directors to exercise powers in respect of the company after the
appointment of a liquidator;

• approval of termination of the winding up; and

• directing, after the winding up and before dissolution of the company, the way that the
records of the company and of the liquidator may be disposed of.

  • in the case of a creditors' winding up:

• commencement of the winding up;

• making an arrangement, entered into between a company immediately preceding the
commencement of, or in the course of, the winding up and its creditors, binding on the
company; and

• authorization of the company to make an application by the liquidator to the court for an
order terminating the winding up.

  In the case of a winding up on just and equitable grounds, a company may be wound up by the
Jersey court if the court is of the opinion that it is (i) just and equitable to do so; or (ii) it is expedient
and in the public interest to do so.

  The liquidator (or the board, where no liquidator is appointed) may, with the authority of a special

resolution of its shareholders, divide among shareholders part or all of the company's assets, or
transfer any part of the company's assets to a trustee for the benefit of its shareholders.

AMENDMENTS TO ORGANIZATIONAL DOCUMENTS
Amendments to the Janus Charter

Generally, amendments to the certificate of incorporation of a Delaware corporation, except for a
limited number of amendments set out in Section 242 of the DGCL, require the affirmative vote of
the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote thereon or such greater vote as is
provided for in the certificate of incorporation. A provision in the certificate of incorporation
requiring the vote of a greater number or proportion of the directors or of the holders of any class of
shares than is required by Delaware corporate law may not be amended, altered or repealed except
by such greater vote.

The Janus Charter may be amended, altered, changed or repealed in the manner prescribed by the
DGCL, and all rights conferred upon stockholders are granted subject to this reservation; provided,
however, that:

• the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 70% of Janus voting stock, voting together as a
single class, is required to amend, alter, change or repeal certain provisions of the Janus Charter
listed in Article XII.A of the Janus Charter; and

• on and after the day that someone becomes an interested stockholder, the affirmative vote of the
holders of at least 70% of Janus voting stock is required to amend, alter, change or repeal certain
other provisions of the Janus Charter listed in Article XII.B of the Janus Charter.

 The memorandum of association and articles of association of a Jersey company each may only be
amended by special resolution approved by holders of at least 2/3 of the shares being voted in
person or by proxy at a shareholder meeting or by unanimous written consent signed by each of the
shareholders entitled to vote.

Amendments to the Janus bylaws

Under the Janus Charter, a majority of the entire board of Janus may adopt, amend or repeal the
Janus bylaws. The Janus bylaws may also be adopted, amended or repealed by Janus stockholders;
provided, however, that on and after the day that someone becomes an interested stockholder, the
affirmative vote of the holders of at least 70% of Janus voting stock is required to adopt, amend or
repeal, by stockholder action, any provisions of the Janus bylaws.

SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEABILITY OF CIVIL LIABILITIES UNDER U.S. SECURITIES LAWS 

        Henderson is a public limited company incorporated under the laws of Jersey, Channel Islands. All of Henderson's directors, executive officers and persons discharging managerial responsibilities, and
certain experts named in this proxy statement/prospectus, reside outside the U.S. A substantial portion of Henderson's assets and the assets of those non-resident persons are located outside the U.S. As a result,
it may not be possible for investors to effect service of process within the U.S. upon Henderson or those persons or to enforce against Henderson or them, either inside or outside the U.S., judgments obtained in
U.S. courts, or to enforce in U.S. courts, judgments obtained against them in courts in jurisdictions outside the U.S., in any action predicated upon civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the
U.S. Henderson has been advised by its Jersey solicitors, Carey Olson (as to the laws of Jersey, Channel Islands), that, both in original actions and in actions for the enforcement of judgments of U.S. courts,
there is doubt as to whether civil liabilities predicated solely upon the U.S. federal securities laws are enforceable in Jersey.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Henderson Group plc,

        In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of Henderson Group plc and its subsidiaries as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2016 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CHANGES IN EQUITY

(Amounts in Millions)

        The Group has included in retained earnings $37.3m of costs and $11.0m of proceeds from stock-based compensation plans during the year ended December 31, 2016 ($43.6m and $15.6m respectively in
the year ended December 31, 2015 and $42.3m and $12.0m respectively in the year ended December 31, 2014), as the Group's articles of association do not allow the Group to recognize these items in
'additional paid in capital'. The accumulated balances in relation to stock-based compensation plans for 2016, 2015 and 2014 were $–92.9m, $–66.7m and $–41.9m, respectively.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 1—Description of the Business

        Henderson Group plc, together with its subsidiaries (collectively 'the Group' or 'Henderson') is a global investment manager which provides investment management services throughout Europe, the
Americas and Asia. The Group manages a broad range of actively managed investment products for institutional and retail investors across five capabilities, being European Equities, Global Equities, Global
Fixed Income, Multi-asset and Alternatives including Private Equity and Property.

        Henderson Group plc is a public limited company incorporated in Jersey and tax resident and domiciled in the United Kingdom ('UK'). The Company's ordinary shares are traded on the London Stock
Exchange ('LSE') and CHESS Depository Interests ('CDIs') are traded on the Australian Securities Exchange ('ASX').

Note 2—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation

        The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ('U.S. GAAP'), which require the use of estimates,
judgements and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the periods presented. Although management believes that the estimates used are reasonable, actual results could differ from those estimates and the difference could be material.
The Group's significant estimates relate to the valuation of investment securities and the measurement of goodwill and intangible assets, contingent consideration as part of acquisition accounting, share based
payments, defined benefit pension plans and income taxes.

        The Group's consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern and historical cost basis, except for certain financial instruments that have been measured at fair value. The functional
currency of the Group is Great British Pounds ('GBP') and the Group's financial statements are presented in United States Dollars ('USD') with all values rounded to the nearest one hundred thousand dollar
($0.1m), except where otherwise indicated. All significant intercompany transactions, balances, revenues and expense are eliminated upon consolidation. See Note 4—'Consolidation' for the basis of
consolidation.

        The related parties of the Group include certain managed funds. The Group earns fees from the funds for which it acts as investment manager and the balance sheet includes amounts due from these
managed funds. On this basis, the majority of the Group's revenue, accrued income and accounts receivable are from these related funds. See Note 19—'Related Party Transactions'.

        Events subsequent to the balance sheet date have been evaluated for inclusion in the accompanying financial statements up until the issuance date. See Note 21—'Subsequent Events'.

        The financial statements were authorized for issue on February 28, 2017.

Reclassification

        Certain balances from prior years have been reclassified in order to conform to the current year presentation. This has included splitting out the components of movements in retained earnings relating to
stock-based compensation plans in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity and reclassifications between line items within the operating cash flow category of the Consolidated Statement of Cash
Flows.

Note 2—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

Segment Information

        Although Henderson is a global investment manager and manages a range of investment products, operating across various product lines, distribution channels and geographic regions, information is
reported to the chief operating decision-maker, the Board, on an aggregated basis. Strategic and financial management decisions are determined centrally by the Board and, on this basis, the Group is a single
segment investment management business.

Property, equipment and software

        Property, equipment and software is recorded at cost. Depreciation is recorded using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the related assets (or the lease term, if shorter). Depreciation
expense totaled $8.2m, $7.9m and $7.7m for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Property, equipment and software is summarized as follows (in millions):

        Internally generated software is recorded at cost and depreciated over its estimated useful life. Internal and external costs incurred in connection with researching or obtaining software for internal use are
expensed as incurred during the preliminary project stage, as are training and maintenance costs. Internal and external costs incurred for internal use software during the application development stage are
capitalized until such time that the software is substantially complete and ready for its intended use. Application development stage costs are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of
the software.

        Henderson evaluates its property, equipment and software assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The
evaluation is based on an estimate of the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposal. If expected future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of
the asset, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over the fair value of the asset. There were no impairments of property, equipment and software
for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.

Deferred Commissions

        Initial sales commissions paid to and received from financial intermediaries on sales of certain wholesale products are deferred and amortized over various periods, not exceeding one year. The
amortization period is based on the average expected life of the product on which the commission is

received. Deferred commissions are recognized as components of 'other current assets' and 'other current liabilities' on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Equity Method Investments

        The Group's investment in equity method investees, where the Group does not control the investee but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies (generally considered to be
ownership between 20% and 50%), as well as in joint ventures where there is joint control (and in both cases, where it is not the primary beneficiary of a VIE), are accounted for using the equity method of
accounting.

        Investments are initially recognized at cost when purchased for cash, or at the fair value of shares received where acquired as part of a wider transaction. The investments are subsequently carried at cost
adjusted for the Group's share of net income or loss and other changes in comprehensive income of the equity method investee, less any dividends or distributions received by the Group. The Consolidated
Statement of Comprehensive Income includes the Group's share of net income or loss for the year, or period of ownership, if shorter, within other non-operating income/(losses), net.

Financial Instruments

        Financial assets are recognized at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheet when the Group becomes party to the contractual provisions of an instrument. The fair value recognized is adjusted for
transaction costs, except for financial assets classified as trading where transaction costs are recognized immediately in net income. Financial assets are derecognized when the rights to receive cash flows from
the investments have expired or where they have been transferred and the Group has also transferred substantially all the risks and reward of ownership.

        Purchases and sales of financial assets are recognized at the trade date. Delivery and settlement terms are usually determined by established practices in the market concerned.

        Debt securities, equity securities and holdings in pooled funds are designated as either trading or available-for-sale and are measured at subsequent reporting dates at fair value. The Group determines the
classification of its financial assets on initial recognition.

        Unrealized gains and losses represent the difference between the fair value of the financial asset at the reporting date and cost or, if these have been previously revalued, the fair value at the last reporting
date. Realized gains and losses on financial assets are calculated as the difference between the net sales proceeds and cost or amortized cost using the specific identification method.

        Financial liabilities, excluding deferred consideration, derivatives, fund deferral liabilities and redeemable noncontrolling interests in consolidated funds which are stated at fair value, are stated at
amortized cost using the effective interest rate method. Financial liabilities stated at amortized cost include the Group's long-term debt. Amortized cost is calculated by taking into account any issue costs and
any discount or premium on settlement. Financial liabilities cease to be recognized when the obligation under the liability has been discharged or cancelled or has expired.

Trading securities

        Financial assets classified as trading are carried on the Group's Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value. These comprise: the Group's manager box position representing the Group's holding in various
open ended investment companies ('OEICs') and unit trusts used to cover any net shortfall in units created or liquidated for clients after the funds are priced; investments in the Group's fund products held by
employee benefit trusts; certain investments in unconsolidated seed capital investments; and certain investments in consolidated funds. Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of financial assets
classified as trading securities are included within investments gains/(losses) in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. Where investments in the Group's fund products are held against
outstanding deferred compensation liabilities, any movement in the fair value of these assets and corresponding movements in the deferred compensation liability are recognized in the Consolidated Statement
of Comprehensive Income.

Available-for-sale securities

        Financial assets classified as available-for-sale consist of certain unconsolidated seed capital investments and certain investments in consolidated funds. Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value
on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, with changes in fair value recorded as a component of other comprehensive income within the Group's Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income until realized.
When an asset is disposed of, the cumulative change in fair value, previously recognized in other comprehensive income, is taken to net income in the current accounting period.

Trade and other receivables

        Trade receivables, which generally have 30 day payment terms, are initially recognized at fair value, normally equivalent to the invoice amount. When the time value of money is material, the fair value is
discounted. Provision for specific doubtful debts is made when there is evidence that the Group may not be able to recover balances in full. Balances are written off when the receivable amount is deemed
uncollectable.

Cash and cash equivalents

        Cash and cash equivalents primarily consist of cash held at banks, on-demand deposits, highly liquid short-term government securities and investments in money market instruments with a maturity date of
three months or less. Cash balances maintained by consolidated Voting Interest Entities ('VREs') are not considered legally restricted and are included in cash and cash equivalents on the Consolidated Balance
Sheet. Cash balances held by consolidated Variable Interest Entities ('VIEs') are included in 'assets of consolidated VIEs' on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Impairment evaluation

        The Group periodically evaluates the carrying value of equity method investments and investment securities classified as available-for-sale for potential impairment. In determining if an impairment exists,
the Group considers the duration, extent and circumstances of any decline in fair value. Where a fall in the value of an investment is prolonged or significant, it is considered an indication of impairment.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Note 2—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

        Henderson evaluates the securities in an unrealized loss position in the available-for-sale portfolio for other-than-temporary impairment ('OTTI') on the basis of the duration of the decline in value of the
security and severity of that decline as well as the Group's intent and ability to hold these securities for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the market value. For equity method
investments, if circumstances indicate that an OTTI may exist, the investments are evaluated using market values where available, or the expected future cash flows of the investment.

        If it is determined that the impairment on an equity security is other-than-temporary, the investment is written down to fair value. An impairment loss equal to the difference between the carrying value of
the security and its fair value is recognized as an impairment charge within investment gains/(losses) in the Group's Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. For available-for-sale investments, any
amounts previously recognized in other comprehensive income in respect of cumulative changes in fair value are taken to net income on impairment.

        No impairment charges were recognized on investment securities for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.

Derivative Instruments

        The Group may, from time to time, use derivative financial instruments to mitigate price, interest rate, foreign currency and credit risk. The Group does not designate derivative instruments as hedges for
accounting purposes, with the exception of certain foreign currency forward contracts used for net investment hedging.

        Derivative instruments are measured at fair value and classified as either 'other current assets' or 'other current liabilities' on the Group's Consolidated Balance Sheet. Changes in the fair value of derivative
instruments are recorded within investment gains/(losses) in the Group's Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.

        The Group enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to mitigate the foreign exchange risk in respect of seed capital investments and on the translation of certain consolidated entities. In addition, the
Group enters into a number of derivative instruments including contracts for differences ('CFDs'), credit default swaps indices ('CDXs'), futures and total return swaps ('TRSs') to mitigate the risk of market
movements of specific available-for-sale and trading assets.

        The Group's consolidated seed investments may also be party to derivative instruments. These derivative instruments are disclosed separately from the Group's corporate derivative instruments. Refer to
Note 6—'Investment Securities'.

Noncontrolling Interests and Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests

        Noncontrolling interests that are not subject to redemption rights are classified in permanent equity. Redeemable noncontrolling interests are classified outside of permanent equity on the Consolidated
Balance Sheet and are measured at the estimated fair value as of the balance sheet date. Noncontrolling interests in consolidated seed investments are classified as redeemable noncontrolling interests where
there is an obligation on the fund to repurchase units at the investor's request. Refer to Note 13—'Noncontrolling Interests' for further information.

Note 2—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

Fair Value Measurements

        Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value of financial instruments
traded in active markets (such as publicly traded securities and derivatives) is based on quoted market prices at the reporting date. The quoted market price used for financial instruments is the last traded market
price for both financial assets and financial liabilities where the last traded price falls within the bid-ask spread. In circumstances where the last traded price is not within the bid-ask spread, management will
determine the point within the bid-ask spread that is most representative of fair value current bid price. The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined using valuation
techniques commonly used by market participants, including the use of comparable recent arms length transactions, discounted cash flow analysis and option pricing models. Estimating fair value requires
significant management judgement, including benchmarking to similar instruments with observable market data and applying appropriate discounts that reflect differences between the securities that the Group
is valuing and the selected benchmark.

        Measurements of fair value are classified within a hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value based on whether the inputs to those valuation techniques are
observable or unobservable.

        The valuation hierarchy contains three levels:

• Level 1—Valuation inputs are unadjusted quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. 

• Level 2—Valuation inputs are quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, quoted market prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and
other observable inputs directly or indirectly related to the asset or liability being measured. 

• Level 3—Valuation inputs are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement.

        The valuation of an asset or liability may involve inputs from more than one level of the hierarchy. The level in the fair value hierarchy within which a fair value measurement in its entirety falls is
determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.

Level 1 Fair Value Measurements

        Henderson's Level 1 fair value measurements consist primarily of the portion of derivatives, unconsolidated seed investments, investments held in consolidated funds and investments in the Group's fund
products (which are held, in employee benefit trusts, against outstanding deferred compensation arrangements) which have quoted market prices in active markets, as well as the Group's Senior Notes.

Level 2 Fair Value Measurements

        Henderson's Level 2 fair value measurements consist primarily of the portion of derivatives, investments held in consolidated funds and investments in the Group's fund products which have valuation
inputs classified as Level 2.

Level 3 Fair Value Measurements

        Henderson's assets and liabilities measured at Level 3 are primarily private equity investments, redeemable noncontrolling interests in consolidated funds, contingent deferred consideration and deferred
compensation liabilities which are held against investments in the Group's fund products, where the significant valuation inputs are unobservable.

        Private equity investments are valued using a combination of the enterprise value / EBITDA multiple method and the discounted cash flow method. Significant unobservable inputs include discount rates,
long-term revenue growth rates and pre-tax operating margin, taking into account management's experience and knowledge of market conditions of the specific industries.

        The fair value of redeemable noncontrolling interests in consolidated funds is primarily driven by the fair value of the investments in consolidated funds. Details of inputs used to calculate the fair value of
contingent deferred consideration can be found in Note 5—'Acquisitions'.

Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements

        Nonrecurring Level 3 fair value measurements include goodwill and intangible assets. The Group measures the fair value of goodwill and intangible assets on initial recognition using discounted cash flow
analysis that requires assumptions regarding projected future earnings and discount rates. Because of the significance of the unobservable inputs in the fair value measurements of these assets and liabilities,
such measurements are classified as Level 3. See the 'Goodwill and Intangible Assets, net' accounting policy set forth within Note 2 for further information.

Income Taxes

        The Group provides for current tax expense according to the tax laws in each jurisdiction in which it operates, using tax rates and laws that have been enacted by the Balance Sheet date.

        Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recorded for temporary differences between the financial statement and income tax basis of assets and liabilities as measured by the enacted income tax rates
that may be in effect when these differences reverse. The effect of changes in tax rates on the Group's deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized as income tax within net income in the period that includes
the enactment date. Significant management judgement is required in developing the Group's provision for income taxes, including the valuation allowances that might be required against deferred tax assets and
the evaluation of unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.

        The Group periodically assesses the recoverability of its deferred tax assets and the need for valuation allowances on these assets. The Group makes these assessments based on the weight of available
evidence regarding possible sources of future taxable income and estimates relating to the future performance of the business that results in taxable income.

        In evaluating uncertain tax positions, the Group considers the probability that the tax benefit can be sustained on examination by a taxing authority on the basis of its technical merits ('the recognition
threshold'). For tax positions meeting this threshold, the amount recognized in the financial statements is the benefit expected to be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority on the basis of a
cumulative-probability assessment of the possible outcomes. For tax positions not meeting the

recognition threshold, no financial statement benefit is recognized. The Group recognizes the accrual of interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions as a component of the income tax provision.

        With effect from January 1, 2014, the Group elected to early adopt new accounting guidance relating to the balance sheet classification of deferred taxes. The updated guidance requires that all deferred tax
assets, liabilities and any related valuation allowances be classified prospectively as non-current in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

        Also with effect from January 1, 2014, the Group elected to early adopt new accounting guidance on stock-based compensation accounting, including the income tax consequences of such transactions. The
updated guidance requires that on exercise of stock-based awards, tax benefits in excess, or amounts that fall short, of the cumulative book compensation expense should be recognized as an income tax benefit
or expense within net income.

Revenue Recognition

        Revenue includes management fees and performance fees, net of rebates. Management fees are recognized in the accounting period in which the associated investment management service is provided.
Performance fees for all fund ranges and segregated clients are recognized under Method 1, i.e. on crystallization and are therefore accounted for when the prescribed performance hurdles are achieved and it is
probable that a fee will be collected as a result. There are no performance fee contracts where revenue can be reversed or clawed back. There are no cumulative revenues recognized that would be reversed if all
of the existing investments became worthless.

        Management fees are generally based upon a percentage of the market value of assets under management and are calculated as a percentage of either the daily, month end or quarter end average asset
balance in accordance with contractual agreements. Performance fees are specified in certain fund and client contracts and are based on investment performance either on an absolute basis or compared to an
established index over a specified period of time. This is often subject to a hurdle rate.

        Management fees are primarily received monthly or quarterly while performance fees are usually received quarterly or annually by the Group, although the frequency of receipt varies between agreements.
Management and performance fee revenue recognized which has not yet been billed is recognized as accrued income within 'accrued income and accounts receivable' in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Management and performance fee revenue recognized and billed, but not yet received is recognized as accounts receivable within 'accrued income and accounts receivable' in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Commissions

        Commissions on management fees are accounted for on an accruals basis and are recognized in the accounting period in which the associated management fee is earned.

Operating Expenses

        Operating expenses are accrued and recognized as incurred.

Note 2—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

Stock-Based Compensation and Stock-based Payment Transactions

        The Group issues stock-based awards to employees, all of which are classified as equity-settled stock-based payments. Equity-settled stock-based payments are measured at the fair value of the shares at the
grant date. The awards are expensed, with a corresponding increase in reserves, on either a straight line basis or a graded basis (depending on vesting conditions) over the vesting period, based on the Group's
estimate of shares that will eventually vest.

        The grant date fair value for stock options is determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, and the grant date fair value of restricted stock is determined from the market price on the date of
grant. The Black-Scholes model requires management to determine certain variables; the assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option pricing model include dividend yield, expected volatility, risk-free interest
rate and expected life. The dividend yield and expected volatility are determined using historical Group data. The risk-free interest rate is based on the 3-year UK treasury coupon at the time of the grant. The
expected life of the appreciation rights is the same as the service conditions applicable to all Group awards.

        The Group also uses the Monte Carlo model to determine the fair value of awards granted under the LTIP scheme from 2015 onwards. The assumptions used in the Monte Carlo model include dividend
yield, share price volatility and discount rate.

Earnings per Share

        Basic earnings per share attributable to Henderson shareholders is calculated by dividing net income (adjusted for the allocation of earnings to participating restricted stock awards) by the weighted average
number of shares outstanding. Henderson has calculated earnings per share using the two-class method. There are some participating restricted stock awards which are paid non-forfeitable dividends. Under the
two-class method, net income attributable to Henderson is adjusted for the allocation of earnings to participating restricted stock awards.

        Diluted earnings per share is calculated in a similar way to basic earnings per share, but is adjusted for the effect of potential common shares unless they are anti-dilutive.

Business Combinations

        All business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of a business combination is the aggregate of the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred
or assumed and equity instruments issued by the acquirer as consideration. The fair value of a business combination is calculated at the acquisition date by recognizing the acquiree's identifiable assets, liabilities
and contingent liabilities that satisfy the recognition criteria, at their fair values at that date. The acquisition date is the date on which the acquirer effectively obtains control of the acquiree. The cost of a
business combination in excess of the fair value of net identifiable assets or liabilities acquired, including intangible assets identified, is recognized as goodwill. Any costs incurred in relation to a business
combination are expensed as incurred.

Contingent Consideration

        Contingent consideration, resulting from business combinations, is recognized at fair value at the acquisition date as part of the business combination and discounted where the time value of money is

material. The determination of the fair value is based on discounted cash flows, with the key assumptions being the probability of meeting each performance target and the discount factor applied. When the
contingent consideration meets the definition of a financial liability, it is subsequently remeasured to fair value at each reporting date through net income. Finance charges, where discounting has been applied,
are also recognized through net income. See Note 5—'Acquisitions' for further information about contingent consideration on acquisitions taking place during the reporting period.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net

        Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of the identifiable net assets of acquired companies and is capitalized in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

        Intangible assets consist primarily of investment management contracts acquired as part of business combinations. Investment management contracts have been identified as separately identifiable
intangible assets arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries or businesses. Such contracts are recognized at the present value of the expected future cash flows of the investment management contracts at the date
of acquisition. Investment management contracts may be classified as either indefinite-lived investment management contracts or finite-lived client relationships.

        Indefinite-lived intangible assets are comprised of investment management agreements where the agreements are with investment companies themselves and not with underlying investors. Such contracts
are typically renewed indefinitely and therefore the Group considers the contract life to be indefinite and, as a result, the contracts are not amortized. Definite-lived intangible assets are comprised of investment
management agreements where the agreements are with the underlying investor.

        Indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. Finite-lived client relationships are amortized on a straight-line basis over their remaining useful lives, currently estimated at between three
and eight years for existing contracts.

        Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired. The Group has determined that it has one reporting unit for
goodwill impairment testing purposes, which is consistent with internal management reporting and management's oversight of operations. For this purpose, management prepares a valuation for the Group's cash
generating unit based on its fair value. The fair value is based on forecasts approved by the Board, extrapolated for expected future growth rates and discounted at a risk-adjusted discount rate based on the
Group's pre-tax weighted average cost of capital. Where the fair value is less than the carrying amount, an impairment is recognized. Any impairment is recognized immediately through net income and cannot
subsequently be reversed.

        Intangible assets subject to amortization are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable and indefinite-lived assets are tested for
impairment annually or more frequently if changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.

        Goodwill and intangible assets require significant management estimates and judgement, including the valuation and expected life determination in connection with the initial purchase price allocation and
the ongoing evaluation for impairment.

Foreign exchange

        The functional currency of the Group is GBP and the reporting currency, for the purposes of these financial statements, is USD.

        Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the appropriate exchange rate prevailing at the date of the transaction. Foreign currency monetary balances at the reporting date are converted at the
prevailing exchange rate. Foreign currency non-monetary balances carried at fair value or cost are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value or cost is determined. Gains and losses arising
on retranslation are recognized as a component of net income, except for available-for-sale financial assets where the unhedged changes in fair value are recognized in other comprehensive income.

        On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Group's overseas operations whose functional currency is not GBP are translated at exchange rates prevailing at the reporting date. Income and expense
items are recognized at daily exchange rates. Exchange differences arising, if any, are taken through other comprehensive income to accumulated other comprehensive income. Where net investment hedge
accounting is applied using foreign currency forward contracts, the fair value movement on these contracts is also recognized within accumulated other comprehensive income. In the period in which an
operation is disposed of, translation differences previously recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income are recognized as a component of net income.

        On translation of the consolidated financial statements from the Group's functional currency of GBP to the reporting currency of USD, the assets and liabilities of the Group are translated using the
exchange rate prevailing at the reporting date, equity is translated at historic rate and income and expense items are translated using the average exchange rate, calculated based on each month end rate for the
financial period. Exchange differences arising are taken through other comprehensive income to accumulated other comprehensive income.

Post-employment retirement benefits

        The Group provides employees with retirement benefits through both defined benefit and defined contribution plans. The assets of these plans are held separately from the Group's general assets, in trustee
administered funds.

        Contributions to the defined contribution plan are expensed to net income within the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income as and when they become payable.

        Defined benefit obligations and the cost of providing benefits are determined annually by independent qualified actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The Group's annual measurement date of
the defined benefit plan is December 31. The defined benefit obligation is measured as the present value of the estimated future cash outflows using a discount rate based on AA rated corporate bond yields of
appropriate duration. The plan assets are recognized at fair value. The funded status of the defined benefit pension plans (the resulting surplus or deficit of defined benefit assets less liabilities) is recognized in
the Consolidated Balance Sheet, net of any taxes that would be deducted at source.

Note 2—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

        Actuarial gains and losses arise as a result of the difference between actual experience and actuarial assumptions. The '10% corridor' method for recognizing actuarial gains and losses has been adopted by
the Group. This means that cumulative actuarial gains or losses up to an amount equal to 10% of the higher of the liabilities or assets of the scheme ('the corridor') have no immediate impact on net income and
are instead recognized through other comprehensive income. Cumulative gains or losses greater than the corridor are amortized to net income over the average remaining future working lifetime of the active
members in the plan.

        Net periodic benefit cost is recorded as a component of net income in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income and includes service cost, interest cost, expected return on plan assets and any
actuarial gains and losses previously recognized as a component of other comprehensive income which have been amortized in the period. Net periodic benefit costs are recognized as an operating expense.

        See Note 15—'Retirement Benefit Plans' for further discussion of the Group's pension plans.

Common Stock

        Henderson's common stock of 12.5 pence each are classified as equity instruments. Equity shares issued by Henderson are recorded at the fair value of the proceeds received or the market price on the day
of issue. Direct issue costs, net of tax, are deducted from 'additional paid in capital' within equity.

        Treasury shares held are equity shares of Henderson acquired by or issued to employee benefit trusts. Treasury shares held are recorded at cost and are deducted from equity. No gain or loss is recognized in
the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income on the purchase, issue, sale or cancellation of Henderson's own equity shares.

        Shares purchased as part of a share repurchase program are immediately cancelled. The nominal value of each share purchased and cancelled is debited against common stock and the remaining balance,
being the difference between the price paid per share and the nominal value, is debited against retained earnings.

Consolidation

        For the Group's accounting policies on consolidation, see Note 4—'Consolidation'.

Note 3—Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted

        In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ('FASB') issued a new revenue recognition standard. The standard's core principle is that a company will recognize revenue to depict the transfer of
goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, the standard specifies the accounting for
certain costs to obtain or fulfill a contract with a customer and expands disclosure requirements for revenue recognition. The revenue standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after
December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. The Group is evaluating the effect of adopting this new accounting standard.

        In January 2016, the FASB issued amendments to its financial instruments standard, including changes relating to the accounting for equity investments, and the presentation and disclosure

requirements for financial instruments. Under the amended guidance, equity investments in unconsolidated entities (other than those accounted for using the equity method of accounting) will generally be
measured at fair value through net income. There will no longer be an available-for-sale classification (changes in fair value reported in other comprehensive income) for equity securities with readily
determinable fair values. The amended guidance also requires financial assets and financial liabilities to be presented separately in the notes to the financial statements, grouped by measurement category
(e.g. fair value, amortized cost, lower of cost or market value) and form of financial asset (e.g. loans, securities). The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim
periods within those fiscal years. The Group is evaluating the effect of adopting this new accounting standard.

        In February 2016, the FASB issued a new standard on accounting for leases. The new standard represents a wholesale change to lease accounting and introduces a lessee model that brings most leases on to
the balance sheet. The standard also aligns certain of the underlying principles of the new lessor model with those in the FASB's new revenue recognition standard. Furthermore, the new standard addresses
other concerns related to the current leases model. The standard is effective for calendar periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019. The Group is evaluating the effect of adopting this new accounting
standard.

        In March 2016, the FASB issued an amendment to its principal-versus-agent guidance in the FASB's new revenue standard. The key provisions of the amendment are assessing the nature of the entity's
promise to the customer, identifying the specified goods or services, application of the control principle and indicators of control. The amendment is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after
December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those annual reporting periods. In addition, entities are required to adopt the amendment by using the same transition method they used to adopt the new
revenue standard. The Group is evaluating the effect of adopting this new accounting standard.

        In June 2016, the FASB issued an amendment to its guidance on accounting for credit losses. The new guidance requires the application of a current expected credit loss model for financial assets measured
at amortized cost and an allowance for credit loss model for available-for-sale debt securities. The amendment is effective for reporting periods beginning on or after December 15, 2019. The Group is
evaluating the effect of adopting this new accounting standard.

        In August 2016, the FASB issued an ASU to clarify guidance on the classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments in the statement of cash flows. The FASB issued the ASU with the intent of
reducing diversity in practice regarding eight types of cash flows. The ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those annual reporting
periods. The Group is evaluating the effect of adopting this new accounting standard.

        In November 2016, the FASB issued an ASU to clarify guidance on the classification and presentation of restricted cash in the statement of cash flows. The ASU is effective for annual reporting periods
beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those annual reporting periods. The Group is evaluating the effect of adopting this new accounting standard.

        In January 2017, the FASB issued an ASU which simplifies the accounting for goodwill impairments by eliminating step two from the goodwill impairment test. The ASU requires goodwill impairments to
be measured on the basis of the fair value of the reporting unit relative to the reporting unit's carrying amount rather than on the basis of the implied amount of goodwill relative to the

tests occurring after January 1, 2017. The Group is evaluating the effect of adopting this new accounting standard.

Note 4—Consolidation

        In accordance with ASU 2015-02, the Group early adopted the amended consolidation accounting guidance which was mandatory for reporting periods beginning on or after December 15, 2015, with an
effective adoption date of January 1, 2014, using a modified retrospective approach.

        The consolidated financial statements of the Group comprise the financial statements of Henderson Group plc and its interests in its controlled subsidiaries and equity method investments as at
December 31 each year. Additionally, the consolidated financial statements include the consolidation of certain managed funds that meet the definition of a variable interest entity ('VIE') if the Group has been
deemed to be the primary beneficiary of these funds and of certain managed funds that meet the definition of a voting interest entity ('VRE').

        The net income and each component of other comprehensive income are attributed to the owners of the parent of the Group and to any noncontrolling interests. All intra-group assets and liabilities, equity,
income, expenses and cash flows relating to transactions between members of the Group are eliminated in full on consolidation.

        The results of consolidated entities acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income from the effective date of acquisition, being the date on
which the Group obtains control, and continue to be consolidated until the date that the control ceases. A change in the ownership interest of a consolidated entity, without a loss of control, is accounted for as an
equity transaction. If the Group loses control over a consolidated entity, it derecognizes the related assets (including goodwill), liabilities, noncontrolling interest and other components of equity while any
resultant gain or loss is recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.

        The Group performs an analysis of affiliates and investments held to determine if they are a VIE or a VRE which involves significant judgement and analysis. Factors considered in this assessment include
the entity's legal organization, the entity's capital structure and equity ownership, and any de facto agent implications of the Group's involvement with the entity. VIEs are consolidated if the Group is the
primary beneficiary of the entity and VREs are consolidated if the Group holds the majority voting interest. Certain events (such as additional contributions or redemptions, either by Henderson or third parties)
will trigger a review to reconsider the previous conclusions regarding the status of an entity as a VIE or a VRE. Additionally, management continually reconsiders whether the Group is considered a VIE's
primary beneficiary, and thus consolidates it.

Variable Interest Entities 

        Certain investments for which a controlling financial interest is achieved through arrangements that are not directly linked to voting interests are considered VIEs. Henderson reviews factors, including
whether or not i) the entity has equity that is sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated support from other parties and ii) the equity holders at risk have the

obligation to absorb losses, the right to receive residual returns and the right to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance, to determine if the investment
product is a VIE. The Group re-evaluates these factors as facts and circumstances change.

        The Group consolidates a VIE if it is the VIE's primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is defined as the variable interest holder that has a controlling financial interest in the VIE. A
controlling financial interest is defined as one that has i) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact its economic performance and ii) the obligation to absorb losses of the entity
or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE.

Consolidated Variable Interest Entities

        Henderson's consolidated VIEs as at December 31, 2016 are certain funds in which the Group has a seed investment and acts as the investment manager. The assets of these VIEs are not available to the
creditors of the Group and the investors in these VIEs have no recourse to the credit of the Group.

        Consolidated VIE assets and liabilities are presented after intercompany eliminations at December 31, 2016, and December 31, 2015, in the following table (in millions):

Unconsolidated Variable Interest Entities

        At December 31, 2016, the Group's carrying value of investment securities included on the Consolidated Balance Sheet pertaining to unconsolidated VIEs was $nil (2015: $nil). The Group's exposure to
unconsolidated VIEs represents the value of its economic ownership interest in the investment securities.

Voting Interest Entities 

Consolidated Voting Interest Entities

        The Group's consolidated VREs include its investments in subsidiaries and certain seed investments. Investments are accounted for as VREs where they do not meet the definition of a VIE and when the
Group is considered to control such investments, where control generally exists if there is a greater than 50% voting interest.

Note 5—Acquisitions

Acquisition of Perennial

        On November 1, 2015, Henderson acquired the entire share capital of Perennial, fixed income and equities managers located in Australia. The acquisition served to broaden the scope of the global fixed
income and equity teams, as well as to assist in the development of Henderson's distribution reach.

        The transaction included initial upfront cash consideration of $55.4m and contingent consideration with a present value of $0.6m, with the contingent consideration payable in 2017 and 2019 if revenues of
the Perennial equities business meet certain targets. The total maximum payment over the entire contingent consideration period is $10.9m as of December 31, 2016. In addition, there is a maximum amount of
$37.4m payable in two tranches in 2019 and 2020, which have employee service conditions attached ('earn out') which are accounted for as a compensation expense and are based on net management fee
revenue. The fair values of the contingent consideration and earn out are calculated at each reporting date by forecasting Perennial revenues over the contingency period and determining whether the forecast
amounts meet the defined targets. The significant unobservable input used in the valuation is forecast revenue. During the year ended December 31, 2016, fair value adjustments of contingent consideration of
$1.1m were recognized in net income. The earn out will be accrued over the service period. At December 31, 2016, the total of contingent consideration and earn out had a fair value of $5.2m (2015: $1.0m),
which is included in 'other non-current liabilities' on the Group's Consolidated Balance Sheet. The following pro forma information is unaudited: had Perennial been acquired on January 1, 2015, the business
would have contributed revenue and net income of $18.5m (2014: $16.2m) and $5.4m (2014: $6.0m) respectively. Perennial contributed revenue and net income of $3.1m and $0.9m respectively between the
acquisition date and December 31, 2015.

        The deal costs were included within operating expenses in Henderson's Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income in 2015.

Note 5—Acquisitions (Continued)

        The total purchase price, including the upfront payment and the present value of the expected contingent payments, was allocated as follows (in millions):

        Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired and is largely attributable to the existing workforce of Perennial as well as the opportunity for the Group to
leverage the distribution platforms on which Perennial funds are included for other products. The goodwill recognized as a result of the acquisition is not deductible for tax purposes.

        The intangible assets include investment management agreements and client relationships. Client relationships have an estimated useful life of eight years and are being amortized over this period.

Acquisition of Geneva

        On October 1, 2014, Henderson acquired the entire share capital of Geneva which added to the Group's US equities capability and US institutional client base.

        The consideration payable for Geneva was structured as an upfront payment of up to $130.0m with two further contingent tranches of up to $45.0m and $25.0m, payable over six years. The Group made an
initial upfront payment of $120.5m during 2014 based on the revenue run rate at a date just before acquisition, measured against defined revenue targets set out in the sale and purchase agreement, together with
a payment of $3.8m for the net assets of Geneva. The $9.5m shortfall between the $120.5m initial payment and the $130.0m maximum can still become payable if Geneva's revenues meet the revenue targets
over the next five years. As a result the Group has a deferred contingent liability of between $nil and $79.5m. The fair value of the contingent consideration is estimated at each reporting date by forecasting
revenue, as defined by the sale and purchase agreement, over the contingency period, and determining whether targets will be met. Contingent consideration of $20.3m (2015: $16.2m) was included in 'other
non-current liabilities' on the Group's Consolidated Balance Sheet as at December 31, 2016.

        Geneva contributed revenue and net income of $6.8m and $4.9m respectively between the acquisition date and December 31, 2014. The following pro forma information is unaudited: had Geneva been
acquired on January 1, 2014, the business would have contributed revenue and net income of $28.8m and $19.3m respectively in 2014.

Note 6—Investment Securities (Continued)

        The Group reviewed the gross unrealized losses on available-for-sale securities and determined that the losses were not other-than-temporary. No impairment charges were recognized for the years ended
December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. There were no unrealized loss positions greater than 12 months as at December 31, 2016 and 2015.

        Realized gains and losses related to the disposal of seed investments classified as available-for-sale securities were recognized within 'investment gains, net' on the Group's Consolidated Statement of
Comprehensive Income. The following is a summary of realized gains upon disposal of seed investments classified as available-for-sale securities for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 (in
millions):

Derivative Instruments

        The Group maintains an economic hedge program that uses derivative instruments to mitigate the market volatility of certain seeded investments. Market fluctuations are mitigated using derivative
instruments including futures, index swaps and TRSs. The Group operates a rolling program of foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the non-functional currency exposures arising from certain seed
capital investments.

        The Group was party to derivative instruments with the following notional values as of December 31, 2016 and 2015:

        The derivative instruments are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes, with the exception of certain foreign currency forward contracts used for net investment hedging. Changes in the fair value
of certain derivatives are recognized in 'investment gains/(losses), net' in the Group's Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. Changes in the fair value of foreign currency forward contracts which
relate to consolidated seed entities are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income under net investment hedge accounting.

Note 7—Goodwill and Intangible Assets

        Henderson's goodwill and intangible assets are summarized below (in millions):

        The opening goodwill balance originates from the various acquisitions the Group has undertaken. There were no accumulated impairment losses in relation to goodwill as at December 31, 2016 or 2015.

        Definite-lived intangible assets represent client relationships, which are amortized over their estimated lives using the straight-line method. The estimated lives of the client relationships vary and range
from three years to eight years. Indefinite-lived intangible assets represent certain investment management contracts where the Group expects both the renewal of the contracts and the cash flows generated by
them to continue indefinitely.

        Foreign currency translation movements in the table primarily relate to the translation of the intangible assets and goodwill balances from the Group's functional currency of GBP to the presentational
currency of USD using the closing foreign currency exchange rate at the end of each reporting period. The balance also relates to the translation of foreign currency intangible assets to the functional currency of
the Group.

        Amortization expense was $14.7m, $15.5m and $13.8m for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Expected future amortization expense is summarized below (in millions):

Impairment Testing

        The 2016 impairment test of indefinite lived intangible assets indicated an impairment loss of $4.9m (2015 and 2014: $nil) which has been recognized within 'amortization and depreciation' in net income
during the year ended December 31, 2016.

        The 2016 and 2015 impairment tests of goodwill and the 2015 impairment test of indefinite-lived intangible assets indicated that in each case, the estimated fair value exceeded the carrying value and as
such, no impairment losses were identified on these assets.

        Definite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment if there is an indication of impairment. No indicators of impairment were identified.

Note 8—Equity Method Investments

        Equity method investments of $0.2m and $4.3m were recognized on the Group's Consolidated Balance Sheet within 'other non-current assets' as at December 31, 2016 and 2015 respectively.

        The Group holds interests in the following equity method investments including joint ventures managed through shareholder agreements with third party investors, accounted for under the equity method:

        During 2016, the Group received a share of profit from its equity method investments of $0.7m. An impairment loss of $3.8m was also recognized in relation to the Group's shareholding in Northern Pines
as a result of the decision to wind up this joint venture. The Group's share of net loss from equity method investments recognized within net income was $3.1m at December 31, 2016 (2015: $1.0m, 2014:
$3.4m).

        During 2015, the Group completed two separate transactions in relation to its equity method investments. On May 29, 2015, the Group acquired the remaining 58.6% of the share capital of 90 West. As a
result, the Group obtained control rights to this equity interest triggering the entity to become a subsidiary of the Group and to be consolidated in the Consolidated Financial Statements. The total cost recognized
for the acquisition of 90 West was $9.3m, comprising net cash consideration of $3.3m, deferred consideration of $2.2m and the fair value of existing ownership of $3.8m.

        On June 1, 2015, the Group sold its 40% equity interest in THRE for consideration of $128.8m. The investment had a carrying value of $111.5m. The $18.9m gain on this transaction (including $1.6m
consideration for the share of net assets fair valued) is recorded within investment gains/(losses), net in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.

Note 11—Income Taxes (Continued)

        The Group's top holding company is tax resident in the UK and is subject to the tax laws and regulations of that country. The following is a reconciliation between the UK statutory corporation tax rate and
the effective tax rate on the Group's income from operations.

        The Group operates in several taxing jurisdictions around the world, each with its own statutory tax rate and set of tax laws and regulations. As a result, the future blended average statutory tax rate is
dependent on changes to such laws and regulations and the mix of profits and losses of the Group's subsidiaries. The Group expects the blended average statutory tax rate to increase subsequent to the proposed
merger with Janus Capital Group Inc.

        During 2016, the Group came to a settlement with HMRC in respect of an on-going audit of various subsidiaries in the UK involving a number of tax years, resulting in a small tax benefit for the Group.
During 2015, the Group came to a settlement with HMRC in respect of the treatment of certain compensation expenditure paid to our staff in prior years. This settlement allowed the Group to claim a deduction
in respect of compensation expenditure incurred in prior years, giving rise to a one-off tax credit of $10.5m in 2015. The tax benefit arising in 2014 resulted from the finalization of prior year returns by HMRC.

        In March 2016, the FASB issued accounting guidance that simplifies several aspects of the accounting for equity-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences of such transactions.
The guidance requires that on exercise of equity-based awards, tax benefits in excess of or falling short of the cumulative book compensation expense should be recognized as an income tax

benefit or expense in the income statement. The Group early adopted this guidance effective January 1, 2014, on a prospective basis. Adoption of the guidance resulted in the Group recognizing an income tax
benefit of $7.6m for the year ended December 31, 2016 and $11.5m for the year ended December 31, 2015 and $7.9m for the year ended December 31, 2014.

        During 2016, tax legislation enacted in the UK to reduce the corporation tax rate in future years resulted in a $4.0m net non-cash benefit (2015: $8.1m benefit and 2014: $1.5m expense) related to the
revaluation of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities. The UK corporation tax rate is due to reduce from 20% to 19% with effect from April 1, 2017 and then to 17% with effect from April 1, 2020.

will expire in 2018 and the balance will carry forward indefinitely. The decrease in tax loss carryforwards from 2015 to 2016 of $18.4m resulted from the impact of foreign currency translation on non-USD
denominated losses of $19.2m offset by adjustments due to tax return filings and additional tax losses arising in 2016.

        A valuation allowance has been established against the deferred tax assets related to the Group's tax loss carryforward where a history of losses in the respective tax jurisdiction makes it unlikely that the
deferred tax asset will be realized or where it is unlikely that the Group would generate sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character to realize the full benefit of the deferred tax asset. The decrease in
the valuation allowance from 2015 to 2016 primarily related to the impact of foreign currency translation on non-USD denominated balances.

        Goodwill recorded in connection with the Geneva acquisition has been reduced during the year by the amount of the tax benefit realized from tax-deductible goodwill.

        The enacted tax rate reductions during 2016 in the UK resulted in the Group realizing a net deferred tax benefit of $4.0m (2015: $8.1m) on the revaluation of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities,
primarily relating to the Group's deferred tax balances on acquired indefinite-lived intangibles, compensation and staff benefits and retirement benefits.

        The Group has made no provision for income taxes on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries as dividends distributed by foreign subsidiaries to their direct parent and ultimately to the Group's top
holding company attract no additional tax.

Unrecognized tax benefits

        The Group operates in several tax jurisdictions and a number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position, for which the Group has unrecognized tax benefits, is finally resolved. The following is a
reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of the Group's unrecognized tax benefits (in millions):

        The entire unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would favorably affect the Group's effective tax rate in future periods.

        The Group recognizes interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions as a component of the income tax provision. At December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 the total accrued interest balance relating to
uncertain tax positions was $0.7m, $1.2m and $0.8m respectively. Potential penalties at December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were insignificant and have not been accrued.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Note 11—Income Taxes (Continued)

        The Group is subject to U.S. federal income tax, state and local income tax, UK income tax and income tax in several other jurisdictions, all of which can be examined by the relevant taxing authorities. For
the Group's major tax jurisdictions, the tax years that remain open to examination by the taxing authorities at December 31, 2016 are 2013 and onwards for Federal tax and a number of States tax, with a handful
of States having open years from 2009 and onwards for Luxembourg; 2015 and onwards for the United Kingdom; and 2014 and onwards for the Netherlands.

        During 2016, the Internal Revenue Service ('IRS') commenced examination of the Group's U.S. federal tax filing for the year ended December 31, 2014. In addition, a number of tax years from 2005
onwards remain open for a limited number of subsidiaries in the UK while cases involving other taxpayers are being litigated through the judicial system, the results of which will resolve the Group's position
for these open years. While examination outcomes are subject to significant uncertainty, they are not expected to be material as the Group has recognized a tax benefit only for those positions that meet the more
likely than not recognition threshold. It is reasonably possible that the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits will change within the next twelve months due to completion of tax authorities' exams or the
expiration of statutes of limitations. Management estimates that the existing liability for uncertain tax positions could decrease by approximately $nil to $0.8m within the next twelve months, ignoring changes
due to foreign currency translation.

Note 13—Noncontrolling Interests (Continued)

Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests

        As of December 31, 2016, redeemable noncontrolling interests of $158.0m (2015: $82.9m) represented certain noncontrolling interests in consolidated funds in which the Group has invested seed capital.
Noncontrolling interests in funds are classified as redeemable noncontrolling interests where there is an obligation on the fund to repurchase units at the investor's request.

        Redeemable noncontrolling interests in consolidated fund products may fluctuate from period to period and are impacted by changes in the Group's relative ownership percentage, changes in the amount of
third-party investment in seeded products and volatility in the market value of the seeded products' underlying securities. Third-party redemption of investments are redeemed from the respective product's net
assets and cannot be redeemed from the assets of other seeded products or from the assets of the Group.

        The following table shows the movement in redeemable noncontrolling interests in consolidated funds for the year ended December 31, 2016 (in millions):

        Changes in ownership during the year ended December 31, 2016 represent the dilution of the Group's investment in consolidated funds as a result of increases in third party investments and the
deconsolidation of two consolidated funds as a result of disposal of the investments.

Note 14—Long-Term Incentive Compensation

        The Group operates a number of stock-based compensation plans, being the Restricted Share Plan, Employee Share Ownership Plan, Long-Term Incentive Plan, Deferred Equity Plan, Buy As You Earn
Share Plan, Company Share Option Plan, Executive Shared Ownership Plan and Sharesave Plan. Further details on the material plans in operation during 2016 are set out below:

Deferred Equity Plan ('DEP') 

        Employees who receive cash-based incentive awards over a preset threshold, have an element deferred. The deferred awards are deferred into the Company's shares, or into Group managed funds. The DEP
trustee purchases Company shares and units or shares in Group managed funds and holds them in trust. Awards are deferred for up to three years and vest in three equal tranches if employees satisfy
employment conditions at each vesting date. Those employees who elected to participate in the 2011 Employee Share Ownership Plan ('ESOP'), had their restricted shares, upon vesting, automatically transfer
into the 2011 ESOP as purchased shares. They attracted matching shares subject to the performance and employment conditions of that plan.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Note 14—Long-Term Incentive Compensation (Continued)

        The 2013 DEP had a matching share element where employees, excluding Executive Directors, were awarded one matching share for every three restricted shares held in trust on the third anniversary of
the award. One third of the restricted shares became unrestricted on each anniversary. If an employee requested to receive any of the unrestricted shares prior to the third anniversary, the related matching shares
were forfeit. Forfeiture conditions applied in the case of leavers. A matching share element is not included on any DEP schemes awarded for later years.

        The expense of deferred short-term incentive awards is recognized in net income over the period of deferral on a graded basis, the fair value of which is determined by prevailing share price or unit price at
grant date.

Employee Share Ownership Plan ('ESOP') 

        The 2011 ESOP enabled all staff, including Executive Directors, to defer part of their cash-based incentive awards up to a specified limit through the purchase of Company shares. The 2011 ESOP awarded
up to three matching shares for every share purchased depending on the performance of the Group's total shareholder return ('TSR') and Company share price. The matching shares vested on the third, fourth and
fifth anniversaries, if the conditions have been met on each anniversary. At the end of 2015, the TSR performance condition allowed for 2 matching shares on one third of the purchased shares that vested in
May 2016 (2014: 0.5 matching shares, 2013: 1.5 matching shares).

Restricted Share Plan ('RSP') 

        The RSP allows employees to receive shares in the Company for nil consideration at a future point, usually after three years, and are recognized in net income on a graded basis. The awards are made
typically for staff recruitment and retention purposes—all awards have employment conditions and larger awards generally have performance hurdles. The Remuneration Committee approves all awards to
Code Staff (being employees who perform a significant influence function, senior management and risk takers whose professional activities could have a material impact on a firm's risk profile), any awards
over £500,000 and award vestings that exceed £50,000. The fair value of the shares granted is the average intra trading price of the preceding five business days.

Buy As You Earn Share Plan ('BAYE') 

        The BAYE is a HMRC approved plan. Eligible employees purchase shares in the Company by investing monthly, up to £150 (annual limit £1,800), which is deducted from their gross salary. For each share
purchased ('partnership share'), for no additional payment, two free matching shares are awarded. Matching shares will be forfeited if purchased shares are withdrawn from the trust within one year. The
international version of the BAYE operates on a similar basis to that of the UK, but each purchased share is matched with one partnership share, which is not subject to forfeiture.

Sharesave Plan ('SAYE') 

        The SAYE is a HMRC approved plan. UK employees may participate in more than one scheme but only up to a maximum of £500 per month across all schemes. Employees who participate in the SAYE
contribute a monthly amount from their net salary to a savings account. The SAYE vesting period is three years for UK employees.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Note 14—Long-Term Incentive Compensation (Continued)

        At the end of the three year vesting period, the employees in the 2016 SAYE can exercise their share options using the funds in their savings account, to subscribe for shares at a preset price. This was £2.06
per share (2015 SAYE: £2.27 and 2014 SAYE: £2.14), a 20% discount to the average share price five business days prior to the award. Employees have up to six months after the three year vesting period to
exercise their options and subscribe for shares. Forfeiture provisions apply in the case of approved and unapproved leavers.

        The USA Employee Share Purchase Plan ('ESPP') operates on the same principles as the UK SAYE, but has a two year savings period and a lower discount at 15%. In 2016 the preset option price was
$3.12 (2015 ESPP: $3.55 and 2014 ESPP: $3.81). Employees may participate in more than one plan, but only up to a plan maximum of $312.50 per month across all plans.

Company Share Option Plan ('CSOP') 

        The CSOP is a HMRC approved share option plan with the maximum value of unvested options at any time limited to £30,000 for UK employees. No such restrictions apply for overseas employees.
Employees can buy Company shares after a three year vesting period at an option price fixed at the start of the scheme. There are no Group performance conditions attached to the options, only employment
conditions that must be satisfied, and the exercise period is two years, while US employees have three months to exercise. Executive Directors are not eligible to participate in the CSOP, but they may hold
awards made prior to their executive appointment. The CSOP plans are valued using the Black Scholes Option Pricing Model and recognized in net income on a straight line basis. The 2016 CSOP option price
was £2.61 (2015 CSOP: £2.85 and 2014 CSOP: £2.67). The 2013 CSOP became exercisable for UK employees in April 2016. The option price was £1.58. The 2014 CSOP was available to exercise for US
employees in April 2016 as the US CSOP is a two year plan.

Executive Shared Ownership Plan ('ExSOP') 

        The ExSOP is an employee share ownership plan and is aimed at encouraging employee share ownership at middle management level. Executive Directors do not participate in the ExSOP.

        Certain employees are invited to acquire jointly, with an employee benefit trust, the beneficial interest in a number of Company shares under the terms of a joint ownership agreement ('JOA'). Under a JOA,
the employee will benefit from any growth in value in excess of a hurdle price fixed at the time of the award subject to employment conditions being satisfied on the vesting date.

        The ExSOP scheme is valued using the Black Scholes Option Pricing Model and is recognized in net income on a straight line basis. For the 2016 ExSOP, the market price at grant was £2.50 (ExSOP 2015:
£2.82 and ExSOP 2014: £2.68) per share. The hurdle price was set at £2.84 (2015: £3.11 and 2014: £2.92) per share. The shares have a three year vesting period with a subsequent two year exercise period. The
2013 ExSOP became exercisable for employees in April 2016 with a market price at grant of £1.58 and a hurdle price at £1.72.

Long-Term Incentive Plan ('LTIP') 

        The LTIP awards provide selected employees restricted shares or £nil cost options that have employment conditions and performance conditions attached as shown below. Employees who have been
awarded such options have five years to exercise their options following the three year vesting

period for 2013 LTIP and five and four years to exercise their options following the three and four year vesting periods (respectively) for 2014 LTIP 2014. Two thirds of the 2015 and 2016 LTIP can be
exercised from the end of the year three and one third from the end of year four.

        If the Henderson Group TSR is between the 50th and 75th percentiles, the amount vesting will increase on a linear basis. The Remuneration Committee must also be satisfied the Henderson Group TSR
reflects the underlying performance of the Group. For the 2013 and 2014 LTIP, the performance hurdle was 95% relative to Henderson Group TSR and 5% on risk and sustainability metrics. Employees must
also satisfy employment conditions at each anniversary date for the shares to vest.

        The 2015 and 2016 LTIP award vesting and release of the award are subject to performance against the following performance conditions measured (as appropriate) over, or at the end of, the relevant three
or four year performance period (in respect of the first and second tranche of the award respectively):

        In respect of the first tranche of the award, an additional holding period of two years shall apply commencing on the relevant vesting date, during which time the participant may not sell, pledge, charge,
assign, dispose of or otherwise transfer ownership of the underlying share pertaining to the award, other than to meet mandatory liabilities to tax and/or social security contributions. In respect of the second
tranche of the award, an additional holding period of one year shall apply commencing on the relevant vesting date with similar conditions.

        The performance period for the 2013 LTIP was completed on December 31, 2015 and 98% of awards vested in April 2016. The performance period for the first tranche of 2014 LTIP was completed on
December 31, 2016 and 3% of awards will vest in April 2017. The Monte Carlo model has been used to value the options of the 2015 and 2016 plans with the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model used for
plans prior to 2015.

Note 15—Retirement Benefit Plans

Defined Contribution Plan 

        The Group operates a defined contribution retirement benefit plan. The assets of the plan are held separately from those of the Group in trustee administered funds.

        The total amounts charged to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income for the year ended December 31, 2016 in respect of the defined contribution plan was $11.7m (2015: $11.7m,
2014: $11.2m) which represents contributions paid or payable to this plan by the Group.

Defined Benefit Plans 

        The main defined benefit pension plan sponsored by the Group is the defined benefit section of the Henderson Group Pension Scheme ('HGPS') which closed to new members on November 15, 1999. The
HGPS is funded by contributions to a separately administered fund.

        Benefits in the defined benefit section of the HGPS are based on service and final salary. The plan is approved by HMRC for tax purposes and is operated separately from the Group and managed by an
independent Trustee board. The Trustee is responsible for payment of the benefits and management of the HGPS assets. The Group also has a contractual obligation to provide certain members of the HGPS
with additional defined benefits on an unfunded basis.

        The HGPS is subject to UK regulations, which require the Group and the Trustee to agree a funding strategy and contribution schedule for the scheme.

        The Group's latest triennial valuation of the HGPS has resulted in a deficit on a technical provisions basis of $35.8 million (£29.0 million). The Group has agreed with the trustees of the plan to make
contributions of $10.4 million (£8.4 million) per year for four years starting from 2017 to recover the deficit.

Note 15—Retirement Benefit Plans (Continued)

        The following key assumptions were used in determining the defined benefit obligation as at December 31, 2016 and 2015:

        The discount rate applied to the plan obligations is based on AA-rated corporate bond yields with similar maturities.

Plan assets 

        The fair values of the HGPS plan assets as at December 31, 2016 and 2015, by major asset class, are as follows (in millions):

        The assets of the HGPS are allocated to a growth portfolio and to bond assets. The majority of the growth portfolio is invested in pooled diversified funds, with the objective of achieving a level of growth
greater than the bond portfolio. The bond portfolio is managed on a segregated basis, with the primary objective of meeting the cash flows as they mature.

        The strategic allocation as at December 31, 2016 and 2015 was broadly 25% growth assets and 75% bond assets.

        With the exception of the property investments held as at December 31, 2015, all of the HGPS plan assets are quoted in active markets and therefore classified as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy. These
assets are valued through the use of quoted market prices in an active market. The property investments were classified as Level 3.

Note 15—Retirement Benefit Plans (Continued)

        The following table shows a reconciliation of the beginning and ending fair value measurement for Level 3 assets (in millions):

        There were no Level 3 investments held as at December 31, 2016.

        The expected rate of return on assets for the financial period ending December 31, 2016 was 3.4% p.a. based on financial conditions as at December 31, 2015 (2015: 3.2% p.a.). This rate is derived by
taking the weighted average of the long-term expected rate of return on each of the asset classes in HGPS's target asset allocation. The expected rate of return has been determined based on yields on either long-
dated government bonds or relevant corporate bonds, dependent on the class of asset in question, adjusted where appropriate based on the individual characteristics of each asset class.

Actuarial gains and losses 

        Cumulative amounts recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income and the actuarial gain, net of tax deducted at source, credited to other comprehensive income for the years ended
December 31, 2016 and 2015 are shown below (in millions):

        No actuarial gains were amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income during the years ended December 31, 2016 or December 31, 2015. No actuarial gains are expected to be amortized from
accumulated other comprehensive income into net periodic benefit cost during 2017.

        Rent expense was $12.9m, $11.8m and $10.5m for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, net of sub-lease payments received.

        Henderson's operating lease obligations represent property leases. A 20.5 year operating lease was entered into during 2008 on 201 Bishopsgate, London, which provides for reviews to open market rent on
every fifth anniversary of the lease and provided an initial rent-free period of 30 months. The rental expense on this lease is being recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease period and is included in
accrued liabilities in the Group's Consolidated Balance Sheet.

        On acquisition of New Star and Gartmore, the Group became party to three further material operating leases in relation to 1 Knightsbridge Green, London, 8 Lancelot Place, London and Rex House, Queen
Street, London. These offices were vacated and sub-leased by the Group. At the cease use date, the Group recognized the estimated future liability associated with the rental obligation as the net present value of
the expected future cash outflows, net of any sub-lease rentals receivable. This liability has been recorded within current and non-current 'other accrued liabilities' on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. As at the
reporting date, the lease in respect of 1 Knightsbridge Green had expired and the onerous leases in respect of the other two offices ran for a further period of six

years and nine years respectively. At December 31, 2016 and 2015 the carrying value of these obligations are as follows (in millions):

Merger agreement

        Under the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated 3 October 2016 ('Merger Agreement') relating to the business combination of Henderson Group plc (Henderson) and Janus Capital Group Inc (Janus) (the
Merger), customary representations and warranties were made by each of Henderson and Janus. The Merger Agreement also provides that if Henderson or Janus terminates the Merger Agreement because of a
failure of the shareholders of the other party to approve the Merger at the shareholder meeting, Henderson or Janus, as the case may be, will reimburse the other party for its actual out-of-pocket fees and
expenses subject to a cap of US$10 million and that, upon termination of the Merger Agreement under specified circumstances, including: (i) a change in the recommendation of the Henderson Board or the
Janus Board; or (ii) a termination of the Merger Agreement by Henderson or Janus, because of a failure of the shareholders of the other party to approve the Merger or because the Merger is not completed by
30 September 2017, in each case at a time when there was an offer or proposal for an alternative transaction with respect to such party (and such party enters into or completes an alternative transaction within a
12-month tail period), Henderson or Janus, as the case may be, will pay to the other party a termination fee equal to US$34 million in cash. There are no other circumstances in which a termination fee or
indemnity would become payable in respect of a party's breach of a representation or warranty.

Litigation and Other Regulatory Matters

        In the normal course of business, the Group is exposed to certain legal or tax matters, which could involve litigation and arbitration, and may result in contingent losses. Although there can be no
assurances, based on information currently available, management believes that it is probable that the outcome of matters that are pending or threatened will not have a material effect on the Group's
consolidated financial statements.

Note 19—Related Party Transactions

        Disclosures relating to equity method investments and the Group pension scheme can be found in Note 8 and Note 15 respectively. Transactions between Henderson Group plc and its controlled
subsidiaries have been eliminated on consolidation and are not disclosed in this note.

Note 21—Subsequent events

        On February 3, 2017, the Group renewed its £30.0m revolving credit facility. Currently there are no amounts drawn down.

        On February 8, 2017, Henderson Group plc declared a final 2016 dividend of 7.30p per share. This dividend will be paid on May 19, 2017 to shareholders on the register at May 5, 2017.

        On February 16, 2017, in anticipation of the proposed merger with Janus Capital Group Inc, the Group entered into a five year revolving credit facility for $200.0m to ensure the combined group has
sufficient access to liquidity. The facility is contingent upon completion of the merger.

        On April 26, 2017, the Group will propose a change to its Articles of Association for approval from its shareholders. This will allow the Group to recognize movements in relation to stock-based
compensation plans in additional paid-in capital, rather than directly in retained earnings, which is the Group's current policy. If the proposed changes to the Articles of Association are approved by the
shareholders then the existing accumulated balance in relation to stock-based compensation plans ($-92.9m as at December 31, 2016) will be reclassified from retained earnings to additional paid-in capital in
2017.

(c) Adjustment to Merger Consideration.    The Merger Consideration shall be adjusted appropriately to reflect the effect of any stock/share split, reverse stock split, share consolidation, share
subdivision, share bonus issue or stock/share dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Janus Common Stock or Henderson Ordinary Shares, as applicable),
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other like change with respect to the number of shares of Janus Common Stock or Henderson Ordinary
Shares issued and outstanding after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time.

(i) As of the Effective Time, each Janus Option outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, shall be converted (as converted, a Converted Stock
Option), by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of that Janus Option, into an option exercisable for that number of Henderson Ordinary Shares equal to
the product of (A) the aggregate number of shares of Janus Common Stock for which such Janus Option was exercisable multiplied by (B) the Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest
whole share. The exercise price per share of such Converted Stock Option shall be adjusted so that it is equal to (x) the exercise price per share of such Janus Option immediately prior to
the Effective Time divided by (y) the Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest cent; provided, however that the exercise price and the number of Henderson Ordinary Shares
purchasable pursuant to a Converted Stock Option shall be subject to such adjustments as may be necessary for the foregoing conversion to satisfy the requirements of Sections 409A, 422
and 424 of the US Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code) and Treasury Regulations Section 1.424-1. 

(ii) As of the conversion pursuant to Section 3.1(d)(i), each Converted Stock Option shall be subject to the same terms and conditions set forth in the applicable Janus Equity Plan and the
option agreement pursuant to which the corresponding Janus Option was granted, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time except as otherwise provided in Section 3.1(d)(i). 

(iii) Each Janus RSU Award, whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, as of the Effective Time, automatically and without any action on
the part of the holder thereof, be converted into a Henderson restricted share unit award with respect to Henderson Ordinary Shares on the terms and conditions (including any continuing
vesting requirements) under the applicable plan and award agreement in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, with the aggregate number of Henderson restricted share units held
by each holder (rounded up to the nearest whole unit) determined by multiplying (A) the number of shares of Janus Common Stock subject to such Janus RSU Award immediately prior to
the Effective Time by the (B) Exchange Ratio. 

(iv) Each Janus PSU Award, whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, as of the Effective Time, automatically and without any action on
the part of the holder thereof, be converted into a Henderson restricted share unit award with respect to Henderson Ordinary Shares on the terms and conditions (including any continuing
vesting requirements) under the applicable plan and award agreement in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, with the aggregate number of Henderson restricted share units held
by each holder (rounded up to the nearest whole unit) determined by multiplying (A) the number of shares of Janus Common Stock subject to such Janus PSU Award immediately prior to

Henderson restricted share unit award with respect to Henderson Ordinary Shares on the terms and conditions (including any continuing time-based vesting and/or performance based
vesting conditions applicable in accordance with the terms of the award) under the applicable plan and award agreement in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, with the
aggregate number of Henderson restricted share units held by each holder (rounded up to the nearest whole unit) determined by multiplying (A) the number of shares of Janus Common
Stock subject to such Janus PSU Award that are earned based on achievement of the applicable performance criteria as of (or approximate to) the Effective Time in accordance with the
terms and conditions of the applicable award agreement by (B) the Exchange Ratio.

(v) Each Janus Restricted Share Award that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, as of the Effective Time, automatically and without any action on the part of the
holder thereof, be converted into a restricted Henderson Ordinary Share award on the terms and conditions (including any continuing vesting requirements) under the applicable plan and
award agreement in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, with the aggregate number of restricted Henderson Ordinary Shares held by each holder (rounded up to the nearest
whole share) determined by multiplying (A) the number of shares of Janus Common Stock subject to such Janus Restricted Share Award immediately prior to the Effective Time by
(B) the Exchange Ratio. 

(vi) Effective as of the Effective Time, Henderson shall (A) assume the Janus Options, Janus Restricted Share Awards, Janus RSU Awards and Janus PSU Awards that are outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (collectively, the Janus Equity Awards) in accordance with the terms of this Section 3.1(d) and (B) for the purpose of complying with this
Section 3.1(d)(vi), either (i) assume sponsorship of the relevant Janus Equity Plan, provided that references to Janus therein shall thereupon be deemed references to Henderson and
references to Janus Common Stock therein shall be deemed references to Henderson Ordinary Shares with appropriate equitable adjustments to reflect the Transactions or (ii) adopt a new
equity plan on materially equivalent terms to the relevant Janus Equity Plan. Henderson shall take all necessary or appropriate actions to comply with the terms of Section 3.1(d),
including seeking any necessary regulatory or shareholder approvals. Prior to the Effective Time, Janus shall deliver written notice to each holder of a Janus Equity Award informing such
holder of the effect of the Merger on the Janus Equity Awards. 

(vii) Except as otherwise agreed to by the Parties in accordance with the following sentence, (A) as of the Effective Time, each outstanding award under the Janus's Employee Stock Purchase
Plan (the ESPP) shall be converted on the same basis as Company Options are converted in accordance with Section 3.1(d)(i) and Section 3.1(d)(ii) of this Agreement and (B) prior to the
Effective Time, Janus shall make such amendments to the ESPP as may be necessary to conform the ESPP to the current requirements of Section 423 of the Code and the treasury
regulations promulgated thereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the Effective Time, Henderson and Janus shall cooperate with each other to determine the appropriate
treatment of the ESPP in connection with the consummation of the Merger, which may include the termination of the ESPP upon, and subject to the occurrence of, the Effective Time.

shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of such registration in the name of a person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or Book-
Entry Share or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable.

(ii) Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 3.2, each Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon
such surrender the Merger Consideration and any amounts that such holder has the right to receive in respect of dividends or other distributions on Henderson Ordinary Shares in
accordance with Section 3.2(c). No interest shall be paid or shall accrue for the benefit of holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the Merger Consideration payable upon the
surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. 

(c) Dividends or Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares.    No dividends or other distributions with respect to Henderson Ordinary Shares with a record date after the Effective Time
shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Share with respect to any Henderson Ordinary Shares represented thereby, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional
shares shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to Section 3.2(e), in each case until the surrender of such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Share in accordance with
this ARTICLE III. Subject to the effect of Applicable Laws (as defined herein), following surrender of any such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Share, there shall be
paid to the holder of Henderson Ordinary Shares issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, the amount of any cash payable in lieu of a fractional share of
Henderson Ordinary Shares to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 3.2(e) and the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore
paid with respect to such Henderson Ordinary Shares, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior
to such surrender and a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such Henderson Ordinary Shares.

(d) No Further Ownership Rights in Janus Common Stock.    All Henderson Ordinary Shares issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with the
terms of this ARTICLE III shall be deemed to have been issued (and paid) in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Janus Common Stock, theretofore represented by such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Janus Common Stock that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to Henderson or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall
be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this ARTICLE III, except as otherwise provided by Applicable Law. 

(e) Fractional Shares. 

(i) No certificates or scrip representing fractional Henderson Ordinary Shares shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, and such fractional share
interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a holder of Henderson Ordinary Shares. 

(ii) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of shares of Janus Common Stock converted pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to
receive a fraction of Henderson Ordinary Shares (after aggregating all Certificates and Book-Entry Shares delivered by such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash (in a US dollar
amount), without interest, in an amount equal to such fraction as determined below. As promptly as practicable following the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall determine the
excess of (i) the number of full Henderson Ordinary Shares delivered to the Exchange Agent by Henderson for issuance to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares over (ii) the
aggregate number of full Henderson Ordinary Shares to be distributed to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares (such excess being herein referred to as the Excess Shares). As soon
as practicable after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent, as agent for such holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, shall sell the Excess Shares at then prevailing prices on the
Exchange, all in the manner provided herein. 

(iii) The sale of the Excess Shares by the Exchange Agent shall be executed on the Exchange and shall be executed in round lots to the extent practicable. Until the net proceeds of any such
sale or sales have been distributed to the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, the Exchange Agent shall hold such proceeds in trust for such holders. The net proceeds of any such
sale or sales of Excess Shares to be distributed to the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be reduced by any and all brokerage commissions, transfer Taxes and other out-of-
pocket transaction costs of the Exchange Agent incurred in connection with such sale or sales. The Exchange Agent shall determine the portion of such net proceeds to which each holder
of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled, if any, by multiplying (A) the amount of the aggregate net proceeds by (B) a fraction (1) the numerator of which is the amount of the
fractional share interest to which such holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares is entitled (after taking into account all Certificates and Book-Entry Shares then held by such holder)
and (2) the denominator of which is the aggregate amount of fractional share interests to which all holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are entitled. As soon as practicable after
the determination of the amount of cash, if any, to be paid to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares with respect to any fractional share interests, the Exchange Agent shall promptly
pay such amounts to such holders subject to and in accordance with this Section 3.2(e).

(iv) Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 3.2(e), Henderson may elect, at its option exercised prior to the Effective Time, to pay to the Exchange Agent an amount in cash in US
dollars, to be deposited on the first Business Day following the Effective Time, sufficient for the Exchange Agent to pay each holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares an amount in
cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (A) the fraction of a Henderson Ordinary Share to which such holder would otherwise have been entitled by (B) the closing price for a
Henderson Ordinary Share on the Exchange on the first Business Day immediately following the Effective Time. In such event, all references in this Agreement to the net proceeds from
the sale of the Excess Shares and similar references shall be deemed to refer to the payments calculated in the manner set forth in this Section 3.2(e)(iv). 

(f) Return of Merger Consideration.    Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 3.2(a) or any dividends or other distributions on
Henderson Ordinary Shares in accordance with Section 3.2(c) that remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for one year after the Effective Time shall be
delivered to Henderson, upon demand, and any holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares who have not theretofore complied with this ARTICLE III shall thereafter be entitled to look only
to Henderson for payment of their claim for any Henderson Ordinary Shares, any cash in lieu of fractional Henderson Ordinary Shares and any dividends or distributions with respect to
Henderson Ordinary Shares. 

(g) No Liability.    None of Janus, Henderson, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of any portion of the Merger Consideration
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. If any Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Share has not been
surrendered prior to seven years after the Effective Time, or immediately prior to such earlier date on which any Henderson Ordinary Shares, any cash in lieu of fractional Henderson Ordinary
Shares or any dividends or distributions with respect to Henderson Ordinary Shares in respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Entity (as defined herein), any such shares, cash, dividends or distributions in respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law,
become the property of Henderson, free and clear of all claims or interests of any person previously entitled thereto. 

(h) Withholding Rights.    Each of Henderson, the Surviving Corporation and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld or paid over to or deposited with the relevant Governmental Entity, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made. 

(i) Lost Certificates.    If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed,
the Exchange Agent shall deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration with respect to the shares of Janus Common Stock formerly represented
thereby, any cash in lieu of fractional Henderson Ordinary Shares, and unpaid dividends and distributions on Henderson Ordinary Shares deliverable in respect thereof, pursuant to this
Agreement.

to forward-looking statements and other disclosures that are predictive or forward-looking in nature) or as disclosed in the disclosure schedule delivered by Janus to Henderson at or prior to the execution and
delivery by Henderson and Merger Sub of this Agreement (the Janus Disclosure Schedule) and making reference to the particular subsection of this Agreement to which exception is being taken (provided,
that such disclosure shall be deemed to qualify that particular subsection and such other subsections of this Agreement to the extent that it is reasonably apparent from the face of such disclosure that such

power, as the case may be, and authority to carry on its business as now being conducted, except, as to subsidiaries, for those jurisdictions where the failure to be so organized, existing or in good
standing or to have such power and authority, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Janus. Each of Janus and its subsidiaries is
duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions which recognize such concept) in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the
ownership, leasing or operation of its properties makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except for those jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or licensed or to be in good
standing, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Janus. Janus has delivered to or made available to Henderson prior to the date of
this Agreement true and complete copies of any amendments to the Certificate of Incorporation of Janus (the Janus Certificate of Incorporation) and the Bylaws of Janus not filed as of the date
of this Agreement with the Janus Filed SEC Documents. 

(b) Corporate Authority; Non-contravention. 

(i) Janus has all requisite corporate power and authority to enter into this Agreement and, subject to the Janus Stockholder Approval (as defined herein), to consummate the Transactions. The

of Janus, subject (in the case of the Merger) to the Janus Stockholder Approval and the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the state of Delaware. The Board

(ii) The consolidated financial statements (including all related notes and schedules) of Janus and its subsidiaries included in the Janus SEC Documents (the Janus Financial Statements)
were prepared in all material respects in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) (except, in the case of unaudited statements, as permitted by the SEC) applied
on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly present in all material respects the consolidated financial position of Janus and
its consolidated subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the consolidated results of their operations and cash flows for the periods then ended (subject, in the case of unaudited statements,
to normal year-end audit adjustments which are not material and to any other adjustments described therein, including the notes thereto).

that all information (both financial and non-financial) required to be disclosed by Janus in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and that all such information required to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated to the
management of Janus, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to enable the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of Janus to make the

Shareholder Circular or any Henderson UK Prospectus will, at such time, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or

(viii) There are no loans by Henderson or any of its subsidiaries to any of their respective employees, officers, directors or other service providers outstanding in violation of any Applicable
Laws. 

(ix) The consummation of the Merger alone, or in combination with any other event, will not (a) trigger or give rise to any liability under any Henderson Plan (including any liability for
special, lump sum, or accelerated funding, payments or contributions) or accelerate the time of payment or vesting or increase the amount of compensation or benefits due to any
employee director or other individual service provider of Henderson or its subsidiaries (whether current, former or retired) or their beneficiaries, (b) trigger (or could reasonably be
expected to trigger) the commencement of any investigation by any competent Governmental Entity with authority in the relevant jurisdiction in relation to any Henderson Plan or
(c) trigger the winding up or termination of any Henderson Plan. No amount that could be received (whether in cash or property or the vesting of property), as a result of the
consummation of the Merger, by any employee, director or other individual service provider of Henderson or its subsidiaries under any Henderson Plan or otherwise would not be
deductible by reason of Section 280G of the Code or would be subject to an excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code. Neither Henderson nor any of its subsidiaries has any indemnity
obligation on or after the Effective Time for any Taxes imposed under Section 4999 or 409A of the Code. 

(x) With respect to each Henderson Plan, the fair market value of the assets of each such Henderson Plan that is funded, or the liability of each insurer for any such Henderson Plan that is
funded through insurance or the book reserve established for any such Henderson Plan, together with any accrued contributions, is sufficient to procure or provide for the accrued benefit
obligations with respect to all current and former participants in such Henderson Plan according to the actuarial assumptions and valuations most recently used to determine employer
contributions to such Henderson Plan, and no Transaction shall cause such assets or insurance obligations to be less than such benefit obligations. Since January 1, 2015, each such
Henderson Plan has been maintained and operated in all material respects in accordance with the applicable plan document and all Applicable Laws and other requirements, and if
intended to qualify for special Tax treatment, satisfies all requirements for such treatment.

neither Henderson nor any of its subsidiaries has consented to, or acted or agreed to act as guarantor under any withdrawal or apportionment arrangement under the Occupational Pension
Scheme (Employer Debt) Regulations 2005, or provided any guarantee in relation to liabilities under any registered pension scheme. 

(xii) Except for the Henderson Pension Plans (each of which is specifically identified as such in Section 4.2(l)(i) of the Henderson Disclosure Schedule), neither Henderson nor any connected
or associated person participates or has participated in any pension scheme (including but not limited to the Henderson Pension Plans), or been a party to an act or failure to act, which is

the Investment Company Act not to be met in respect of the Transactions, and shall not fail to take, and, after the Closing, shall cause its Affiliates not to fail to take, any action if the
failure to take such action would have the effect, directly or indirectly, of causing the requirements of any of the provisions of Section 15(f) of the Investment Company Act not to be met

compliance with Section 5.2(c), Janus and its Representatives may (A) furnish information with respect to Janus and its subsidiaries to the person (or group of persons) making such proposal (and
its Representatives and financing sources) (provided that all such information has previously been provided to Henderson or is promptly provided to Henderson prior to or substantially
concurrent with the time it is provided to such person) pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement containing terms as to confidentiality (it being understood that such confidentiality
agreement need not include any "standstill" or other similar terms that prohibit the counterparty thereto or any of its Affiliates or Representatives from making any proposal for a Janus
Alternative Transaction, acquiring Janus or taking any other similar action, but shall not prohibit Janus from providing information to Henderson prior to or substantially concurrent with the time
it is provided to such person, as provided above) that are generally no less restrictive to such person (or group of persons) than the terms of the confidentiality agreement, dated June 24, 2016, as
amended, entered into between Janus and Henderson (the Confidentiality Agreement), and (B) participate in discussions or negotiations regarding such proposal with the person (or group of
persons) making such proposal (and its Representatives and financing sources).

For purposes of this Agreement, Janus Alternative Transaction means any of (i) a transaction or series of transactions pursuant to which any person (or group of persons) other than Henderson
or its subsidiaries (including Merger Sub) (such person (or group of persons), a Janus Third Party), acquires or would acquire, directly or indirectly, beneficial ownership (as defined in
Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) of more than 20% of the issued and outstanding shares of Janus Common Stock or securities (or options, rights or warrants to purchase, or securities
convertible into or exchangeable for, such securities) representing 20% or more of the voting power of Janus, whether from Janus or pursuant to a tender offer or exchange offer or otherwise,
(ii) a merger, consolidation, share exchange or other transaction pursuant to which any Janus Third Party acquires or would acquire, directly or indirectly, assets or businesses of Janus or any of
its subsidiaries representing 20% or more of the revenues, net income or assets (in each case on a consolidated basis) of Janus and its subsidiaries taken as a whole or (iii) any disposition of assets
to a Janus Third Party representing 20% or more of the revenues, net income or assets (in each case on a consolidated basis) of Janus and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

(b) Except as permitted by this Section 5.2(b), neither the Board of Directors of Janus nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw, qualify or modify, or propose publicly to withdraw, qualify or
modify, or fail to make, in each case in a manner adverse to Henderson, the approval or recommendation by such Board of Directors or such committee of the Merger or this Agreement,
(ii) approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend, any Janus Alternative Transaction (any action in clause (i) or this clause (ii) being referred to as a Janus
Recommendation Change) (provided, that nothing herein shall restrict or otherwise limit Janus from making accurate disclosure to its stockholders of factual information regarding the business,
financial condition or results of operations of Janus or, so long as Janus provides Henderson with reasonable advance notice and a copy of the proposed disclosure, the fact that a proposal the
consummation of which would constitute a Janus Alternative Transaction has been made, the identity of the party making such proposal or the material terms of such proposal (and such

any respects, the recommendation made by the Janus Board of Directors), or (iii) cause Janus or any of its controlled Affiliates to enter into any letter of intent, agreement in principle, acquisition
agreement or other agreement related to any Janus Alternative Transaction (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to in Section 5.2(a)). Notwithstanding the immediately preceding
sentence, in the event that, prior to obtaining the Janus Stockholder Approval, the Board of Directors of Janus determines in good faith, after it has received a proposal that if consummated would
be a Janus Superior Proposal (and after consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor of US or UK nationally recognized reputation) that the failure to do so would be reasonably
likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law, the Board of Directors of Janus may (subject to compliance with this and the following sentences in this Section 5.2(b))
effect a Janus Recommendation Change from and after the day that is after the fourth Business Day following Henderson's receipt of written notice from Janus advising Henderson that the Board
of Directors of Janus has received a Janus Superior Proposal specifying the material terms and conditions of such Janus Superior Proposal, identifying the person making such Janus Superior
Proposal and stating that it intends to make a Janus Recommendation Change; provided that in the event of a subsequent modification to the material terms and conditions of such Janus Superior
Proposal, the Board of Directors of Janus may only effect a Janus Recommendation Change after the later of (x) the fourth Business Day following Henderson's receipt of the initial written notice
advising Henderson of the Janus Superior Proposal and (y) the second Business Day following Henderson's receipt of written notice from Janus advising Henderson of the modification to such
terms and conditions; and provided further that during such four or two Business Day notice period, as applicable, Janus engages (to the extent requested by Henderson) in good faith
negotiations with Henderson to amend this Agreement in such a manner that the proposal to enter into a Janus Alternative Transaction no longer constitutes a Janus Superior Proposal. For
purposes of this Agreement, a Janus Superior Proposal means any bona fide written proposal (on its most recently amended or modified terms, if amended or modified) made by a Janus Third
Party to enter into a Janus Alternative Transaction (with all references to 20% in the definition of Janus Alternative Transaction being treated as references to 50% for these purposes) that (A) did
not result from a material breach of Section 5.2(a), (B) is on terms that the Board of Directors of Janus determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor of
US or UK nationally recognized reputation) to be superior, from a financial point of view, to Janus's stockholders than the Transactions, taking into account all terms and conditions of such
proposal (including any changes to this Agreement that may be proposed by Henderson in response to such proposal to enter into a Janus Alternative Transaction), and (C) the conditions to the
consummation of which are reasonably capable of being satisfied and is otherwise reasonably likely to be consummated, taking into account all financial, regulatory, legal and other aspects of
such proposal. In addition, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at any time prior to the receipt of the Janus Stockholder Approval, if the Board of Directors of Janus
determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor of US or UK nationally recognized reputation) that it is required to do so pursuant to its fiduciary duties
under Applicable Law, the Board of Directors of Janus may effect a Janus Recommendation Change, but only at a time that is after the fourth Business Day following Henderson's receipt of
written notice from Janus advising Henderson of all material information with respect to the basis for any such Janus Recommendation Change and stating that it intends to make a Janus
Recommendation Change and providing its rationale therefor.

writing of any request for substantive information or of any proposal relating to a Janus Alternative Transaction, the material terms and conditions of such request or proposal (including any
changes thereto) and the identity of the person making such request or proposal. Janus shall (i) keep Henderson reasonably informed of the status and details (including amendments or proposed
amendments) of any such request or proposal on a current basis and (ii) provide to Henderson as soon as reasonably practicable after receipt or delivery thereof copies of all material substantive
correspondence and other material written materials exchanged between Janus or its subsidiaries or any of their Representatives, on the one hand, and any person making such request or
proposal, on the other hand, in each case that describes in any material respect any of the material terms or conditions of any such request or proposal. 

(d) Nothing contained in this Section 5.2 shall prohibit Janus or the Janus Board of Directors from (i) taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a)

disclosure of its position thereunder or (ii) otherwise complying with Applicable Law; provided, however, that any disclosure or statement that constitutes or contains a Janus Recommendation
Change shall be subject to the provisions of Section 5.2(b).

        Section 5.3    No Solicitation by Henderson     

(a) Subject to the other provisions of this Agreement (including this Section 5.3), Henderson shall not, shall not authorize or permit any of its controlled Affiliates or any of its or their officers,
directors or employees to, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause any Representatives retained by it or any of its controlled Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly through another person,
(i) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage (including by furnishing information in connection with any inquiry or proposal with respect to a Henderson Alternative Transaction (as defined
herein)), or knowingly take any other action designed to facilitate, any inquiries regarding, or the making of, any proposal the consummation of which would constitute a Henderson Alternative
Transaction, (ii) engage or participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding any proposal the consummation of which would constitute a Henderson Alternative Transaction, except to
notify such person (or group of persons) as to the existence of the provisions of this Section 5.3, or (iii) resolve, propose or agree to do any of the foregoing. Notwithstanding the immediately
preceding sentence, if, at any time prior to obtaining the Henderson Shareholder Approvals, the Board of Directors of Henderson determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel
and a financial advisor of US or UK nationally recognized reputation) that any such proposal that did not result from a material breach of this Section 5.3(a) constitutes or could reasonably be

(a) During the one year period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the first anniversary of the Closing Date (the Continuation Period), Henderson shall, or shall cause its subsidiaries
(including the Surviving Corporation) to, provide each individual who is employed by Janus, Henderson or their respective subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time and who remains

than the base salary or wage rate provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) aggregate incentive compensation opportunities that are substantially
comparable in the aggregate to those provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior the Effective Time, and (iii) employee benefits that are substantially comparable in the aggregate
to those provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior the Effective Time; provided that neither Henderson nor any of its subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation) shall be
required to provide incentive compensation or employee benefits to Continuing Employees in the form of equity-based compensation. During the Continuation Period, Henderson shall, or shall
cause its subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation) to, provide each Continuing Employee who experiences a termination of employment with Henderson or any of its subsidiaries

Time (the New Plans), and subject to Applicable Law, each Continuing Employee shall be credited with his or her years of service with Janus, Henderson or any of their respective subsidiaries
before the Effective Time, to the same extent as such Continuing Employee was entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for such service under any similar Janus Plans or Henderson Plans

benefit accruals under any defined benefit pension plan. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, to the extent administratively and commercially practicable and subject

extent coverage under such New Plan replaces coverage under a comparable Janus Plan or Henderson Plan, in which such Continuing Employee participated immediately before the Effective
Time (such plans, collectively, the Old Plans); and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Continuing Employee, Henderson
or its subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation) shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New
Plan to be waived for such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents, and Henderson or its subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation) shall cause any eligible expenses
incurred by such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date such Continuing Employee's participation in the
corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such

Confidentiality Agreement shall survive any termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms.

(h) The parties acknowledge and agree that the amount of the overall loss that Janus or Henderson may incur in the circumstances in which any Termination Fee is payable under this Section 8.2 is
not possible to ascertain as at the date of this Agreement and that, as such, the Termination Fee represents a genuine estimate by the parties of the amount of the overall loss that Janus or
Henderson (as the case may be) would incur in the circumstances in which a Termination Fee is payable to Janus or the Henderson. The parties shall use their reasonable best efforts to secure that
any Expenses Reimbursement and any Termination Fee payable under this Section 8.2 (for the purposes of this Section 8.2(h) a Relevant Sum) will not be subject to any tax imposed in
compliance with the Council Directive of 28 November 2006 on the common system of value added tax (EC Directive 2006/112) and any other tax of a similar nature whether imposed in a
member state of the European Union in substitution for, or levied in addition to, such tax, or imposed elsewhere (VAT). However, if it is finally determined by a Taxing Authority or tribunal or
court of competent jurisdiction that a Relevant Sum constitutes all or part of the consideration for a supply made for VAT purposes then if that VAT is held to be chargeable by the payor of the

provide an adequate remedy for any such breach.

territorial jurisdiction of the courts referred to in this Section 9.10 in any such Action by mailing copies thereof by registered or certified United States mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested, to its
address as specified in or pursuant to Section 9.2. However, the foregoing shall not limit the right of a party to effect service of process on the other party by any other legally available method.

    SHARE CAPITAL

Shares with special rights  4.  Subject to the provisions of the Companies Law and these Articles and without prejudice to any rights attached to any existing shares or class of shares, any share may be
issued with such rights or restrictions as the Company may by ordinary resolution determine or, subject to and in default of such determination, as the board shall
determine. The Company may, pursuant to the Companies Law, issue fractions of shares and any such fractional shares shall rank pari passu in all respects with other
shares of the same class issued by the Company.

Uncertificated shares  5.     

  (A)  Pursuant and subject to the Order, the board may permit title to some or all of the shares of any class to be evidenced otherwise than by a certificate and title to such
shares to be transferred in accordance with the relevant laws, rules and regulations and may make arrangements for that class of shares to become a participating class.
Title to some or all of the shares of a particular class may only be evidenced otherwise than by a certificate where that class of shares is at the relevant time a participating
class. The board may also, subject to compliance with the Order and the relevant laws, rules and regulations, determine at any time that title to some or all of the shares of
any class of shares may from a date specified by the board no longer be evidenced otherwise than by a certificate or that title to such shares shall cease to be transferred
by means of any particular relevant system. For the avoidance of doubt, shares which are uncertificated shares shall not be treated as forming a class which is separate
from certificated shares with the same rights.

  (B)  In relation to a class of shares which is a participating class and for so long as it remains a participating class, no provision of these Articles shall apply or have effect to
the extent that it is inconsistent in any respect with:

    (i)  the holding of shares of that class in uncertificated form;

    (ii)  the transfer of title to shares of that class by means of a relevant system;

    (iii)  the exercise of any powers or functions by the Company or the effecting by the Company of any actions by means of a relevant system; and

    (iv)  any provision of the Order.

  (C)  Some or all of the shares of a class which is at the relevant time a participating class may be changed from uncertificated form to certificated form, and from certificated
to uncertificated form, in accordance with and subject as provided for in or under the relevant laws, rules and regulations.

  (D)  Unless the board otherwise determines or the Order or the relevant laws, rules and regulations otherwise require, any shares issued or created out of or in respect of any
uncertificated shares shall be uncertificated shares and any shares issued or created out of or in respect of any certificated shares shall be certificated shares.

  (E)  Subject to the Companies Law, the directors may lay down regulations not included in these Articles which (in addition to, or in substitution for, any provisions in these
Articles):

    (i)  apply to the issue, holding or transfer of shares in uncertificated form;

    (ii)  set out (where appropriate) the procedures for conversion and/or redemption of shares in uncertificated form; and/or

    (iii)  the directors consider necessary or appropriate to ensure that these Articles are consistent with the Order or the relevant laws, rules and regulations.

  (F)  Such regulations will apply instead of any relevant provisions in these Articles which relate to the transfer, conversion and redemption of shares in uncertificated form
or which are not consistent with the Order, in all cases to the extent (if any) stated in such regulations.

  (G)  Where the Company is entitled under the Companies Law, the Order, the relevant laws, rules and regulations, these Articles or otherwise to dispose of, forfeit, enforce a
lien over or sell or otherwise procure the sale of any shares, the directors may, in the case of any shares in uncertificated form, take such steps (subject to the Companies
Law, the relevant laws, rules and regulations and these Articles) as may be required or appropriate, by instruction by means of a relevant system or otherwise and, if
need be, by virtue of an irrevocable power of attorney in favour of a director deemed to be given by the relevant member under the Powers of Attorney (Jersey) Law
1995 (such power of attorney to come into effect once the Company becomes so entitled), or by virtue of an irrevocable authorisation in favour of a director deemed to
be given by the name of the relevant member being entered as a member in the records of the relevant system, to effect such disposal, forfeiture, enforcement or sale
including (without limitation) by:

    (i)  requesting or requiring the deletion of any computer based entries in the relevant system relating to the holding of such shares;

    (ii)  altering such computer based entries so as to divest the holder of such shares of the power to transfer such shares other than to a person selected or
approved by the Company for the purpose of such transfer;

    (iii)  requiring any holder of such shares to take such steps as may be necessary to sell or transfer such shares as directed by the Company;

    (iv)  (subject to any applicable law) otherwise rectify or change the register in respect of any such shares in such manner as the directors consider appropriate
(including, without limitation, by entering the name of a transferee into the register as the next holder of such shares); and/or

    (v)  appointing any person to take any steps in the name of any holder of such shares as may be required to change such shares to certificated form and/or to
effect the transfer of such shares (and such steps shall be effective as if they had been taken by such holder).

  (H)  In relation to any shares in uncertificated form:

    (i)  the Company may utilise the relevant system to the fullest extent available from time to time in the exercise of any of its powers or functions under the
Companies Law, the Order or these Articles or otherwise in effecting any actions and the Company may from time to time determine the manner in
which such powers, functions and actions shall be so exercised or effected;

    (ii)  the Company may, by notice to the holder of that share, require the holder to change the form of that share to certificated form within the period
specified in the notice and to hold that share in certificated form for so long as required by the Company; and

    (iii)  the Company shall not issue a share certificate.

    The Company may by notice to the holder of any share in certificated form, direct that the form of such share may not be changed to uncertificated form for a period
specified in such notice.

Allotment powers  6.  Subject to the provisions of applicable law, and, in the case of redeemable shares, the provisions of Article 7:

    (a)  all unissued shares for the time being in the capital of the Company shall be at the disposal of the board; and

    (b)  the board may reclassify, allot (with or without conferring a right of renunciation), grant options over, or otherwise dispose of them to such persons on
such terms and conditions and at such times as it thinks fit.

Redeemable shares  7.  Subject to the provisions of the Companies Law, and without prejudice to any rights attached to any existing shares or class of shares, shares may be issued which are
to be redeemed or are to be liable to be redeemed at the option of the Company or the holder on such terms and in such manner as may be provided by these Articles.

Commissions  8.  The Company may exercise all powers of paying commissions or brokerage conferred or permitted by the Companies Law. Subject to the provisions of the Companies
Law, any such commission or brokerage may be satisfied by the payment of cash or by the allotment of fully or partly paid shares or partly in one way and partly in
the other.

Trusts not recognised  9.     

  (A)  Except as required by law, or as otherwise provided by these Articles, the Company shall recognise no person as holding any share on any trust and (except as
otherwise provided by these Articles or by law) the Company shall not be bound by or recognise any interest in any share (or in any fractional part of a share) except
the holder's absolute right to the entirety of the share (or fractional part of the share).

  (B)  The board may at any time after the allotment of a share but before a person has been entered into the register as the holder of such share, recognise a renunciation of
the share by the allottee in favour of another person and may grant to another allottee a right to effect renunciation on such terms and conditions as the board thinks fit.

VARIATION OF RIGHTS

Method of varying rights  10.  Subject to the provisions of the Companies Law and to any rights attached to existing shares (and except in the case where there is only one holder of the issued
shares of a class of shares, in which case any and all rights attached to any existing class of shares may be varied only with the consent in writing of that holder) the
rights attached to any existing class of shares may (unless otherwise provided by the terms of allotment of the shares of that class) be varied or abrogated, whether or
not the Company is being wound up, either:

    (a)  with the written consent of the holders of three-quarters in nominal value of the issued shares of the class, (excluding any shares of that class held as
treasury shares), which consent shall be in hard copy form or in electronic form sent to such address (if any) for the time being specified by or on behalf
of the Company for that purpose, or in default of such specification to the office, and may consist of several documents, each executed or authenticated
in such manner as the board may approve by or on behalf of one or more holders, or a combination of both; or

    (b)  with the sanction of a resolution passed by a majority of three-quarters of the holders of the shares of the class who (being entitled to do so) vote in
person or by proxy at a separate general meeting of such holders,

    but not otherwise.

When rights deemed to be
varied

 11.  For the purposes of Article 10, if at any time the capital of the Company is divided into different classes of shares, unless otherwise expressly provided by the rights
attached to any share or class of shares, those rights shall be deemed to be varied by:

    (a)  the reduction of the capital paid up on that share or class of shares otherwise than by a purchase or redemption by the Company of its own shares; and

    (b)  the allotment of another share ranking in priority for payment of a dividend or in respect of capital or which confers on its holder voting rights more
favourable than those conferred by that share or class of shares,

    but shall not be deemed to be varied by:

    (c)  the creation or issue of another share ranking equally with, or subsequent to, that share or class of shares or by the purchase or redemption by the
Company of its own shares; or

    (d)  the Company permitting, in accordance with the Order, the holding of and transfer of title to shares of that or any other class in uncertificated form by
means of a relevant system.

SHARE CERTIFICATES

Members' rights to
certificates

 12.  Subject to Article 216(b), every member, on becoming the holder of any certificated share (except a recognised person in respect of whom the Company is not required
by law to complete and have ready for delivery a certificate) shall be entitled, without payment, to one certificate for all the certificated shares of each class held by him
(and, on transferring a part of his holding of certificated shares of any class, to a certificate for the balance of his holding of certificated shares). He may elect to receive
one or more additional certificates for any of his certificated shares if he pays for every certificate after the first a reasonable sum determined from time to time by the
board. Every certificate shall:

    (a)  be executed under the seal or otherwise in accordance with Article 172 or in such other manner as the board may approve; and

    (b)  specify the number, class and distinguishing numbers (if any) of the shares to which it relates and the amount or respective amounts paid up on the
shares.

    The Company shall not be bound to issue more than one certificate for certificated shares held jointly by more than one person and delivery of a certificate to one joint
holder shall be a sufficient delivery to all of them. Shares of different classes may not be included in the same certificate.

Replacement certificates  13.  If a share certificate is defaced, worn out, lost or destroyed, it may be renewed on such terms (if any) as to evidence and indemnity and payment of any exceptional out-
of-pocket expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in investigating evidence and preparing the requisite form of indemnity as the board may determine but
otherwise free of charge, and (in the case of defacement or wearing out) on delivery up of the old certificate.

LIEN

Company to have lien on
shares

 14.  The Company shall have a first and paramount lien on every share (not being a fully paid share) for all moneys payable to the Company (whether presently or not) in
respect of that share. The board may at any time (generally or in a particular case) waive any lien or declare any share to be wholly or in part exempt from the provisions
of this Article. The Company's lien on a share shall extend to any amount (including without limitation dividends) payable in respect of it.

Enforcement of lien by sale  15.  The Company may sell, in such manner as the board determines, any share on which the Company has a lien if a sum in respect of which the lien exists is presently
payable and is not paid within 14 clear days after notice has been sent to the holder of the share, or to the person entitled to it by transmission, demanding payment and
stating that if the notice is not complied with the share may be sold.

Table of Contents

B-11

Giving effect to sale  16.  To give effect to that sale the board may, if the share is a certificated share, authorise any person to execute an instrument of transfer, or a director may do so under an
irrevocable power of attorney in favour of a director deemed to be granted by the relevant member under the Powers of Attorney (Jersey) Law 1995, such power of
attorney to come into effect on the date of the notice under Article 15, in respect of the share sold to, or in accordance with the directions of, the buyer. If the share is an
uncertificated share, the board may exercise any of the Company's powers under Article 5 to effect the sale of the share to, or in accordance with the directions of, the
buyer. The buyer shall not be bound to see to the application of the purchase money and his title to the share shall not be affected by any irregularity in or invalidity of the
proceedings in relation to the sale.

Application of proceeds  17.  The net proceeds of the sale, after payment of the costs, shall be applied in or towards payment or satisfaction of so much of the sum in respect of which the lien exists as
is presently payable. Any residue shall (if the share sold is a certificated share, on surrender to the Company for cancellation of the certificate in respect of the share sold
and, whether the share sold is a certificated or uncertificated share, subject to a like lien for any moneys not presently payable as existed on the share before the sale) be
paid to the person entitled to the share at the date of the sale.

CALLS ON SHARES

Power to make calls  18.  Subject to the terms of allotment, the board may from time to time make calls on the members in respect of any moneys unpaid on their shares (whether in respect of
nominal value or premium). Each member shall (subject to receiving at least 14 clear days' notice specifying when and where payment is to be made) pay to the Company
the amount called on his shares as required by the notice. A call may be required to be paid by instalments. A call may be revoked in whole or part and the time fixed for
payment of a call may be postponed in whole or part as the board may determine. A person on whom a call is made shall remain liable for calls made on him even if the
shares in respect of which the call was made are subsequently transferred.

Time when call made  19.  A call shall be deemed to have been made at the time when the resolution of the board authorising the call was passed.

Liability of joint holders  20.  The joint holders of a share shall be jointly and severally liable to pay all calls in respect of it.

Interest payable  21.  If a call or any instalment of a call remains unpaid in whole or in part after it has become due and payable the person from whom it is due and payable shall pay interest on
the amount unpaid from the day it became due and payable until it is paid. Interest shall be paid at the rate fixed by the terms of allotment of the share or in the notice of
the call or, if no rate is fixed, the rate determined by the board, not exceeding 15 per cent. per annum, but the board may in respect of any individual member waive
payment of such interest wholly or in part.

B-12

Deemed calls  22.  An amount payable in respect of a share on allotment or at any fixed date, whether in respect of nominal value or premium or as an instalment of a call, shall be deemed to
be a call duly made and notified and payable on the date so fixed or in accordance with the terms of the allotment. If it is not paid the provisions of these Articles shall
apply as if that amount had become due and payable by virtue of a call duly made and notified.

Differentiation on calls  23.  Subject to the terms of allotment, the board may make arrangements on the issue of shares for a difference between the allottees or holders in the amounts and times of
payment of calls on their shares.

Payment of calls in
advance

 24.  The board may, if it thinks fit, receive from any member all or any part of the moneys uncalled and unpaid on any share held by him. Such payment in advance of calls
shall extinguish the liability on the share in respect of which it is made to the extent of the payment. The Company may pay on all or any of the moneys so advanced (until
they would but for such advance become presently payable) interest at such rate agreed between the board and the member not exceeding (unless the Company by
ordinary resolution otherwise directs) 15 per cent. per annum.

FORFEITURE AND SURRENDER

Notice requiring payment
of call

 25.  If a call or any instalment of a call remains unpaid in whole or in part after it has become due and payable, the board may give the person from whom it is due not less than
14 clear days' notice requiring payment of the amount unpaid together with any interest which may have accrued and any costs, charges and expenses incurred by the
Company by reason of such non-payment. The notice shall name the place where payment is to be made and shall state that if the notice is not complied with the shares in
respect of which the call was made will be liable to be forfeited.

Forfeiture for non-
compliance

 26.  If that notice is not complied with, any share in respect of which it was sent may, at any time before the payment required by the notice has been made, be forfeited by a
resolution of the board. The forfeiture shall include all dividends or other moneys payable in respect of the forfeited share which have not been paid before the forfeiture.
When a share has been forfeited, notice of the forfeiture shall be sent to the person who was the holder of the share before the forfeiture. Where the forfeited share is held
in certificated form, an entry shall be made promptly in the register opposite the entry of the share showing that notice has been sent, that the share has been forfeited and
the date of forfeiture. No forfeiture shall be invalidated by the omission or neglect to send that notice or to make those entries.

B-13

Sale of forfeited shares  27.  Subject to the provisions of the Companies Law, a forfeited share shall be deemed to belong to the Company and may be sold, re-allotted or otherwise disposed of on such
terms and in such manner as the board determines, either to the person who was the holder before the forfeiture or to any other person. At any time before sale, re-
allotment or other disposal, the forfeiture may be cancelled on such terms as the board thinks fit. Where for the purposes of its disposal a forfeited share held in certificated
form is to be transferred to any person, the board may authorise any person to execute an instrument of transfer of the share to that person. Where for the purposes of its
disposal a forfeited share held in uncertificated form is to be transferred to any person, the board may exercise any of the Company's powers or their powers (whether as a
board or as individual directors) under Article 5. The Company may receive the consideration given for the share on its disposal and may register the transferee as holder
of the share.

Liability following
forfeiture

 28.  A person shall cease to be a member in respect of any share which has been forfeited and shall, if the share is a certificated share, surrender the certificate for any forfeited
share to the Company for cancellation. The person shall remain liable to the Company for all moneys which at the date of forfeiture were presently payable by him to the
Company in respect of that share with interest on that amount at the rate at which interest was payable on those moneys before the forfeiture or, if no interest was so
payable, at the rate determined by the board, not exceeding 15 per cent. per annum from the date of forfeiture until payment. The board may enforce payment without any
allowance for the value of the share at the time of forfeiture or for any consideration received on its disposal.

Surrender  29.  The board may accept the surrender of any share which it is in a position to forfeit on such terms and conditions as may be agreed. Subject to those terms and conditions, a
surrendered share shall be treated as if it had been forfeited.

Extinction of rights  30.  The forfeiture of a share shall involve the extinction at the time of forfeiture of all interest in and all claims and demands against the Company in respect of the share and
all other rights and liabilities incidental to the share as between the person whose share is forfeited and the Company, except only those rights and liabilities expressly
saved by these Articles, or as are given or imposed in the case of past members by the Companies Law.

Evidence of forfeiture or
surrender

 31.  A declaration by a director or the secretary that a share has been duly forfeited or surrendered on a specified date shall be conclusive evidence of the facts stated in it as
against all persons claiming to be entitled to the share. The declaration shall (subject if necessary to the execution of an instrument of transfer or transfer by means of the
relevant system, as the case may be and in connection with which a director may exercise an irrevocable power of attorney deemed to be given by the relevant member
under the Powers of Attorney (Jersey) Law 1995 such power to come into effect on the date of the relevant declaration) constitute a good title to the share. The person to
whom the share is disposed of shall not be bound to see to the application of the purchase money, if any, and his title to the share shall not be affected by any irregularity
in, or invalidity of, the proceedings in reference to the forfeiture, surrender, sale, re-allotment or disposal of the share.

TRANSFER OF SHARES

Form and execution of
transfer of certificated
share

 32.  Without prejudice to any power of the Company to register as shareholder a person to whom the right to any share has been transmitted by operation of law, the
instrument of transfer of a certificated share may be in any usual form or in any other form which the board may approve. An instrument of transfer shall be signed by
or on behalf of the transferor and, unless the share is fully paid, by or on behalf of the transferee. An instrument of transfer need not be under seal.

Invalid transfers of
certificated shares

 33.  The board may refuse to register the transfer of a certificated share unless the instrument of transfer:

    (a)  is lodged, duly stamped (if stampable), at the office or at another place appointed by the board accompanied by the certificate for the share to which it
relates and such other evidence as the board may reasonably require to show the right of the transferor to make the transfer;

    (b)  is in respect of only one class of shares; and

    (c)  is in favour of not more than four transferees.

Transfers by recognised
persons

 34.  In the case of a transfer of a certificated share by a recognised person, the lodging of a share certificate will only be necessary if and to the extent that a certificate has
been issued in respect of the share in question.

Notice of refusal to register  35.  If the board refuses to register a transfer of a share in certificated form, it shall send the transferee notice of its refusal within two months after the date on which the
instrument of transfer was lodged with the Company.

Suspension of registration  36.  The registration of transfers of shares or of transfers of any class of shares may be suspended at such times and for such periods (not exceeding 30 days in any year) as
the board may determine, except that the board may not suspend the registration of transfers of any participating class other than in accordance with the relevant laws,
rules and regulations.

No fee payable on
registration

 37.  No fee shall be charged for the registration of any instrument of transfer or other document relating to or affecting the title to a share.

Retention of transfers  38.  The Company shall be entitled to retain an instrument of transfer which is registered, but an instrument of transfer which the board refuses to register shall be returned
to the person lodging it when notice of the refusal is sent.

Transfer of uncertificated
share

 39.  Subject to such restrictions of these Articles as may be applicable any member may transfer all or any of his uncertificated shares by means of a relevant system in such
manner provided for and subject as provided in the Order and the relevant laws, rules and regulations provided that legal title to such shares shall not pass until such
transfer is entered into the register and accordingly no provision of these Articles shall apply in respect of an uncertificated share to the extent that it requires or
contemplates the effecting of a transfer by an instrument in writing or the production of a certificate for the share to be transferred.

TRANSMISSION OF SHARES

Transmission  40.  If a member dies, the survivor or survivors where he was a joint holder, and his personal representatives where he was a sole holder or the only survivor of joint holders,
shall be the only persons recognised by the Company as having any title to his interest. Nothing in these Articles shall release the estate of a deceased member (whether a
sole or joint holder) from any liability in respect of any share held by him.

Elections permitted  41.  A person becoming entitled by transmission to a share may, on production of any evidence as to his entitlement properly required by the board, elect either to become the
holder of the share or to have another person nominated by him registered as the transferee. If he elects to become the holder he shall send notice to the Company to that
effect. If he elects to have another person registered and the share is a certificated share, he shall execute an instrument of transfer of the share to that person. If he elects
to have himself or another person registered and the share is an uncertificated share, he shall take any action the board may require (including without limitation the
execution of any document and the giving of any instruction by means of a relevant system) to enable himself or that person to be registered as the holder of the share. All
the provisions of these Articles relating to the transfer of shares apply to that notice or instrument of transfer as if it were an instrument of transfer executed by the
member and the death or bankruptcy of the member or other event giving rise to the transmission had not occurred.

Elections required  42.  The board may at any time send a notice requiring any such person to elect either to be registered himself or to transfer the share. If the notice is not complied with within
60 days, the board may after the expiry of that period withhold payment of all dividends or other moneys payable in respect of the share until the requirements of the
notice have been complied with.

Rights of persons entitled
by transmission

 43.  A person becoming entitled by transmission to a share shall, on production of any evidence as to his entitlement properly required by the board and subject to the
requirements of Article 41, have the same rights in relation to the share as he would have had if he were the holder of the share, subject to Article 185. That person may
give a discharge for all dividends and other moneys payable in respect of the share, but he shall not, before being registered as the holder of the share, be entitled in
respect of it to receive notice of, or to attend or vote at, any meeting of the Company or to receive notice of, or to attend or vote at, any separate meeting of the holders of
any class of shares in the capital of the Company.

    (d)  subject to the provisions of the Companies Law, sub-divide its shares, or any of them, into shares of smaller amount than is fixed by the Memorandum
and the resolution may determine that, as between the shares resulting from the sub-division, any of them may have any preference or advantage as
compared with the others;

    (e)  subject to the provisions of the Companies Law convert or denominate any of its shares the nominal value of which is expressed in one currency into
shares of a nominal value of another currency; and

    (f)  cancel shares which, at the date of the passing of the resolution, have not been taken or agreed to be taken by any person and diminish the amount of its
share capital by the amount of the shares so cancelled.

New shares subject to these
Articles

 45.  All shares created by special resolution pursuant to Article 44 shall be:

    (a)  subject to all the provisions of these Articles, including without limitation provisions relating to payment of calls, lien, forfeiture, transfer and
transmission; and

    (b)  unclassified, unless otherwise provided by these Articles, by the resolution creating the shares or by the terms of allotment of the shares.

Fractions arising  46.  Whenever any fractions arise as a result of a consolidation or sub-division of shares, the board may on behalf of the members deal with the fractions as it thinks fit. In
particular, without limitation, the board may sell shares representing fractions to which any members would otherwise become entitled to any person (including, subject
to the provisions of the Companies Law, the Company) and distribute the net proceeds of sale in due proportion among those members. Where the shares to be sold are
held in certificated form the board may authorise some person to execute an instrument of transfer of the shares or a director may do so by virtue of an irrevocable power
of attorney deemed to be granted by the relevant member under the Powers of Attorney (Jersey) Law 1995 such power of attorney to come into effect on the date of the
creation of the fractions of shares to, or in accordance with the directions of, the buyer. Where the shares to be sold are held in uncertificated form, the board may do all
acts and things it considers necessary or expedient to effect the transfer of the shares to, or in accordance with the directions of, the buyer and in addition a director may
exercise an irrevocable power of attorney deemed to be granted by the relevant member under the Powers of Attorney (Jersey) Law 1995 in respect of the same such
power of attorney to come into effect on the date of the creation of the fractions of shares. The buyer shall not be bound to see to the application of the purchase moneys
and his title to the shares shall not be affected by any irregularity in, or invalidity of, the proceedings in relation to the sale.

Power to reduce capital  47.  In accordance with (and subject to) the provisions of Article 61 of the Companies Law, the Company may by special resolution reduce its share capital, capital
redemption reserve and share premium account in any way.

relevant period, with any disclosure notice issued pursuant to Article 50 in respect of those shares or, in purported compliance with such a notice, has made a statement
which is false or inadequate in a material particular as the board may determine at its sole discretion, the Company may give the holder of those shares:

    (i)  a further notice (a direction notice) to the relevant holder of shares directing that:

      i.  in respect of the shares in relation to which the default occurred (the default shares, which expression includes any shares issued after the date

personally or by proxy at a general meeting or at a separate meeting of the holders of that class of shares or on a poll or to exercise any other
right conferred by membership in relation to any such meeting or poll;

      ii.  in respect of the default shares where the default shares represent at least 0.25% in nominal value of the issued shares of their class (calculated
exclusive of any shares held as treasury shares): (a) no payment shall be made by way of dividend or distribution (or any other amount payable
in respect of the default shares) and the Company shall not be required to pay interest in respect of any such amounts not paid; (b) no transfer of
any default share shall be registered unless: (1) the member is not himself in default as regards supplying the information requested and the
transfer when presented for registration is accompanied by a certificate by the member in such form as the board may in its absolute discretion
require to the effect that after due and careful enquiry the member is satisfied that no person in default as regards supplying such information is

directions in accordance with the Order and relevant laws, rules and regulations applicable to those shares to effect that conversion immediately)
and that member shall not after that be entitled to convert all or any shares held by him into uncertificated form (except with the authority of the
board),

relevant laws, rules and regulations issue a written notification requiring the conversion into certificated form of any shares held by the holder in
uncertificated form), provided that any direction notice shall cease to have effect not more than seven days after the earlier of receipt by the
Company of (1) a notice of an approved transfer, but only in relation to the shares transferred; or (2) all the information required by the relevant
disclosure notice issued pursuant to Article 50, in a form satisfactory to the board and with the board being reasonably satisfied that such
information is complete and accurate; or

any other appropriate court, for an order compelling the relevant holder of shares (whether such application notice has been issued in respect of the actions or
omissions of such holder or in respect of another person to whom Articles 49 and 50 refer) to comply with the provisions in this Article 49 and Article 50.
Notwithstanding the outcome of any such application to court, the Company shall be fully indemnified on demand by the relevant holder of shares in respect
of which an application notice has been served in respect of all costs, liabilities and expenses (including, but not limited to, all legal fees and other associated
costs) in respect of such application. The board may, at its discretion, waive in whole or in part the Company's right to be indemnified in respect of any
application referred to above.

  (C)  The board may compel the relevant holder of shares to sell its shares in the Relevant Share Capital to a third party where:

    (i)  the board is satisfied that the relevant holder of shares is in default in supplying to the Company the information thereby required by any disclosure notice
issued pursuant to Article 50, or, in purported compliance with such a notice, has made a statement or given information which is false or inadequate in a

in person or by proxy at such a venue to view or hear all or any of the proceedings of the meeting or to speak at the meeting shall not in any way affect the validity of the
proceedings of the meeting.

 65.  If, after the sending of notice of a general meeting but before the meeting is held, or after the adjournment of a general meeting but before the adjourned meeting is held
(whether or not notice of the adjourned meeting is required), the board decides that it is impracticable or unreasonable, for a reason beyond its control, to hold the meeting
at the declared place (or any of the declared places, in the case of a meeting to which Article 61 applies) and/or time, it may change the place (or any of the places, in the
case of a meeting to which Article 61 applies) and/or postpone the time at which the meeting is to be held. If such a decision is made, the board may then change the place
(or any of the places, in the case of a meeting to which Article 61 applies) and/or postpone the time again if it decides that it is reasonable to do so. In either case, a proxy
appointment in relation to the meeting may, if by means of a document in hard copy form, be delivered to the office or to such other place as may be specified by or on
behalf of the Company in accordance with Article 103(a) or, if in electronic form, be received at the address (if any) specified by or on behalf of the Company in
accordance with Article 103(b), at any time not less than 48 hours before the postponed time appointed for holding the meeting provided that the board may specify, in any
case, that in calculating the period of 48 hours, no account shall be taken of any part of a day that is not a working day.

Meaning of participate  66.  For the purposes of Articles 61, 62, 63, 64 and 65, the right of a member or proxy to participate in the business of any general meeting shall include without limitation the
right to speak, vote on a show of hands, vote on a poll and have access to all documents which are required by the Companies Law or these Articles to be made available
at the meeting.

Accidental omission to
send notice etc.

 67.  The accidental omission to send a notice of a meeting or resolution, or to send any notification where required by the Companies Law or these Articles in relation to the
publication of a notice of meeting on a website, or to send a form of proxy where required by the Companies Law or these Articles, or to send a CDI Voting Notice, to any
person entitled to receive it, or the non-receipt for any reason of any such notice, resolution or notification, or form of proxy, or CDI Voting Notice, or the non-receipt by
the Company of a completed form of proxy, or of completed CDI Voting Instructions, in each case whether or not the Company is aware of such omission or non-receipt,
shall not invalidate the proceedings at that meeting.

writing to the secretary at the office not earlier than the close of business on the one hundred and twentieth (120th) calendar day nor later than the close of business on the
ninetieth (90th) calendar day prior to the date of the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual general meeting, provided, however, that if the date of an annual
meeting is more than thirty (30) calendar days before or more than sixty (60) calendar days after the date of the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual general
meeting, notice by the member must be so delivered in writing not earlier than the close of business on the one hundred and twentieth (120th) calendar day prior to such
annual general meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of (i) the ninetieth (90th) calendar day prior to such annual general meeting, and (ii) the
10th calendar day after the day on which public announcement of the date of such annual general meeting is first made by the Company. In no event shall any adjournment
or postponement of an annual general meeting or the public announcement thereof commence a new time period for the giving of a member's notice as described in this
Article 70.

  71.  For purposes of this Article, public announcement means disclosure in a press release reported by Reuters, the Dow Jones News Service, Associated Press or a
comparable news service or in a document publicly filed by the Company with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Section 13, 14 or 15(d) of the
Exchange Act.

Quorum  72.  No business shall be dealt with at any general meeting unless a quorum is present, but the absence of a quorum shall not preclude the choice or appointment of a chairman,
which shall not be treated as part of the business of the meeting. Save as otherwise provided by these Articles, the holders of at least one-third in nominal value of the
issued shares (excluding any shares held in treasury) which are entitled to vote on the business to be dealt with at the relevant meeting attending in person or by proxy
shall constitute a quorum.

If quorum not present  73.  If such a quorum is not present within five minutes (or such longer time not exceeding 30 minutes as the chairman of the meeting may decide to wait) from the time
appointed for the meeting, or if during a meeting such a quorum ceases to be present, the meeting, if convened on the requisition of members, shall be dissolved, and in
any other case shall stand adjourned to such time and place as the chairman of the meeting may determine. The adjourned meeting shall be dissolved if a quorum is not
present within 15 minutes after the time appointed for holding the meeting.

Chairman  74.  The chairman, if any, of the board or, in his absence, any deputy chairman of the Company or, in his absence, some other director nominated by the board, shall preside as
chairman of the meeting. If neither the chairman, deputy chairman nor such other director (if any) is present within five minutes after the time appointed for holding the
meeting or is not willing to act as chairman, the directors present shall elect one of their number to be chairman. If there is only one director present and willing to act, he
shall be chairman. If no director is willing to act as chairman, or if no director is present within five minutes after the time appointed for holding the meeting, the
members present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote shall choose a member or a proxy of a member or a person authorised to act as a representative of a
corporation in relation to the meeting to be chairman.

Directors entitled to speak  75.  A director shall, notwithstanding that he is not a member, be entitled to attend and speak at any general meeting and at any separate meeting of the holders of any class of
shares in the capital of the Company.

Adjournment: chairman's
powers

 76.  The chairman may, with the consent of a meeting at which a quorum is present (and shall if so directed by the meeting), adjourn the meeting from time to time and from
place to place. No business shall be dealt with at an adjourned meeting other than business which might properly have been dealt with at the meeting had the adjournment
not taken place. In addition (and without prejudice to the chairman's power to adjourn a meeting conferred by Article 62), the chairman may adjourn the meeting to
another time and place without such consent if it appears to him that:

    (a)  it is likely to be impracticable to hold or continue that meeting because of the number of members wishing to attend who are not present; or

    (b)  the unruly conduct of persons attending the meeting prevents or is likely to prevent the orderly continuation of the business of the meeting; or

    (c)  an adjournment is otherwise necessary so that the business of the meeting may be properly conducted.

Adjournment: procedures  77.  Any such adjournment may be for such time and to such other place (or, in the case of a meeting held at a principal meeting place and a satellite meeting place, such other
places) as the chairman may, in his absolute discretion determine, notwithstanding that by reason of such adjournment some members or proxies may be unable to be
present at the adjourned meeting. Any such member or proxy may nevertheless appoint a proxy for the adjourned meeting in accordance with Article 103 or by means of
a document in hard copy form which, if delivered at the meeting which is adjourned to the chairman or the secretary or any director, shall be valid even though it is given
at less notice than would otherwise be required by Article 103(a). When a meeting is adjourned for 30 days or more or for an indefinite period, notice shall be sent at least
seven clear days before the date of the adjourned meeting specifying the time and place (or places, in the case of a meeting to which Article 61 applies) of the adjourned
meeting and the general nature of the business to be transacted. Otherwise it shall not be necessary to send any notice of an adjournment or of the business to be dealt
with at an adjourned meeting.

B-29

Amendments to resolutions  78.  If an amendment is proposed to any resolution under consideration but is in good faith ruled out of order by the chairman, the proceedings on the substantive
resolution shall not be invalidated by any error in such ruling. With the consent of the chairman, an amendment may be withdrawn by its proposer before it is voted
on. No amendment to a resolution duly proposed as a special resolution may be considered or voted on (other than a mere clerical amendment to correct a patent
error). No amendment to a resolution duly proposed as an ordinary resolution may be considered or voted on (other than a mere clerical amendment to correct a
patent error) unless either:

    (a)  at least 48 hours before the time appointed for holding the meeting or adjourned meeting at which the ordinary resolution is to be considered (which if
the board so specifies, shall be calculated taking no account of any part of a day that is not a working day), notice of the terms of the amendment and the
intention to move it has been delivered in hard copy form to the office or to such other place as may be specified by or on behalf of the Company for that
purpose, or received in electronic form at such address (if any) for the time being specified by or on behalf of the Company for that purpose, or

    (b)  the chairman in his absolute discretion decides that the amendment may be considered and voted on.

Methods of voting  79.  All special resolutions put to the vote of a general meeting shall be decided by way of poll. All other resolutions put to the vote of a general meeting shall be decided
on a show of hands unless, before or on the declaration of the result of, a vote on the show of hands, or on the withdrawal of any other demand for a poll, a poll is
duly demanded. Subject to the provisions of the Companies Law, a poll may be demanded by:

    (a)  the chairman of the meeting; or

    (b)  (except on the election of the chairman of the meeting or on a question of adjournment) at least five persons present at the meeting being members or a
proxy or proxies for members in each case having the right to vote on the resolution; or

    (c)  any person or persons present at the meeting being a member or members or a proxy or proxies representing not less than 10% of the total voting rights
of all the members having the right to vote on the resolution (excluding any voting rights attached to any shares held as treasury shares); or

    (d)  any person or persons present at the meeting being a member or members or a proxy or proxies holding shares conferring a right to vote on the
resolution being shares on which an aggregate sum has been paid up equal to not less than 10% of the total sum paid up on all the shares conferring that
right (excluding any shares conferring a right to vote on the resolution which are held as treasury shares).

    A demand by a person as proxy for a member shall be the same as a demand by the member.

B-30

    The appointment of a proxy to vote on a matter at a meeting authorises the proxy to demand, or join in demanding, a poll on that matter. In applying the provisions of this
Article, a demand by a proxy counts (i) for the purposes of paragraph (b) of this Article, as a demand by the member, (ii) for the purposes of paragraph (c) of this Article,
as a demand by a member representing the voting rights that the proxy is authorised to exercise, and (iii) for the purposes of paragraph (d) of this Article, as a demand by a
member holding the shares to which those rights are attached.

Declaration of result  80.  Unless a poll is duly demanded (and the demand is not withdrawn before the poll is taken) a declaration by the chairman that a resolution has been carried or carried
unanimously, or by a particular majority, or lost, or not carried by a particular majority shall be conclusive evidence of the fact without proof of the number or proportion
of the votes recorded in favour of or against the resolution.

Chairman's casting vote  81.  In the case of an equality of votes, whether on a show of hands or on a poll, the chairman shall be entitled to a casting vote in addition to any other vote he may have.

Withdrawal of demand for
poll

 82.  The demand for a poll may be withdrawn before the poll is taken, but only with the consent of the chairman. A demand so withdrawn shall not be taken to have
invalidated the result of a show of hands declared before the demand was made. If the demand for a poll is withdrawn, the chairman or any other member entitled may
demand a poll.

Conduct of poll  83.  Subject to Article 84, a poll shall be taken as the chairman directs and he may, and shall if required by the meeting, appoint scrutineers (who need not be members) and fix
a time and place for declaring the result of the poll. The result of the poll shall be deemed to be the resolution of the meeting at which the poll was demanded.

When poll to be taken  84.  A poll demanded on the election of a chairman or on a question of adjournment shall be taken immediately. A poll demanded on any other question shall be taken either at
the meeting or at such time and place as the chairman directs not being more than 30 days after the poll is demanded. The demand for a poll shall not prevent the
continuance of a meeting for the transaction of any business other than the question on which the poll was demanded. If a poll is demanded before the declaration of the
result of a show of hands and the demand is duly withdrawn, the meeting shall continue as if the demand had not been made.

Notice of poll  85.  No notice need be sent of a poll not taken at the meeting at which it is demanded if the time and place at which it is to be taken are announced at the meeting. In any other
case notice shall be sent at least seven clear days before the taking of the poll specifying the time and place at which the poll is to be taken.

Effectiveness of special
resolutions

 86.  Where for any purpose an ordinary resolution of the Company is required, a special resolution shall also be effective.

Right to vote  87.  Subject to any rights or restrictions attached to any shares:

    (a)  on a show of hands every member who is present in person shall have one vote and every proxy present who has been duly appointed by a member
entitled to vote on the resolution has one vote; and

    (b)  on a poll every member present in person or (except in the case of a proxy appointed by or on behalf of the Depositary Nominee) by proxy shall have
one vote for every share of which he is the holder.

Votes of joint holders  88.  In the case of joint holders of a share, the vote of the senior who tenders a vote, whether in person or by proxy, shall be accepted to the exclusion of the votes of the other
joint holders. For this purpose seniority shall be determined by the order in which the names of the holders stand in the register.

Member under incapacity  89.  A member in respect of whom an order has been made by a court or official having jurisdiction (whether in Jersey or elsewhere) in matters concerning mental disorder
may vote, whether on a show of hands or on a poll, by his receiver, curator bonis or other person authorised for that purpose appointed by that court or official. That
receiver, curator bonis or other person may vote, on a show of hands or on a poll, by proxy. The right to vote shall be exercisable only if evidence satisfactory to the board
of the authority of the person claiming to exercise the right to vote has been delivered to the office, or another place specified in accordance with these Articles for the
delivery of proxy appointments, not less than 48 hours before the time appointed for holding the meeting or adjourned meeting at which the right to vote is to be exercised
provided that the board may specify, in any case, that in calculating the period of 48 hours, no account shall be taken of any part of a day that is not a working day.

Calls in arrears  90.  No member shall be entitled to vote at a general meeting or at a separate meeting of the holders of any class of shares in the capital of the Company, either in person or by
proxy, in respect of any share held by him unless all moneys presently payable by him in respect of that share have been paid.

Errors in voting  91.  If any votes are counted which ought not to have been counted, or might have been rejected, the error shall not vitiate the result of the voting unless it is pointed out at the
same meeting, or at any adjournment of the meeting, and, in the opinion of the chairman, it is of sufficient magnitude to vitiate the result of the voting.

Objection to voting  92.  No objection shall be raised to the qualification of any voter except at the meeting or adjourned meeting or poll at which the vote objected to is tendered. Every vote not
disallowed at such meeting shall be valid and every vote not counted which ought to have been counted shall be disregarded. Any objection made in due time shall be
referred to the chairman whose decision shall be final and conclusive.

Voting: additional
provisions

 93.  On a poll, a member or proxy entitled to more than one vote need not, if he votes, use all his votes or cast all the votes he uses in the same way.

issue invitations in electronic form to appoint a proxy in relation to the meeting in such form as may be approved by the board. The appointment of a proxy shall not
preclude a member from attending and voting in person at the meeting or poll concerned. A member may appoint more than one proxy to attend on the same occasion,
provided that each such proxy is appointed to exercise the rights attached to a different share or shares held by that member.

CDI voting and proxy
arrangements

 97.  Subject to Article 98, at every general meeting of the Company each person who is a CDI Holder at the relevant CDI Record Date shall have the right, in respect of the

Effect of voting
instructions

 100.  Where CDI Voting Instructions are received by the CDI Voting Instruction Receipt Time, then:

    (a)  in the case where a CDI Holder has given directions pursuant to Article 97(a), the number of votes that shall be cast by or on behalf of the Depositary
Nominee on a poll on their behalf shall be equal to the number of CDIs in respect of which that direction has been given or, if less, the number of CDIs
standing to the name of that CDI Holder in the CDI Register at the relevant CDI Record Date; and

    (b)  in the case where a CDI Holder has given a direction in accordance with Articles 97(b) or (c) to the effect that he or (as the case may be) some other
person should be appointed as a proxy of the Depositary Nominee, the Depositary Nominee shall appoint the person so nominated as its proxy and the
number of votes that may be cast by that proxy on a poll shall be equal to the number of CDIs in respect of which the direction has been given or, if less,
the number of CDIs standing to the name of that CDI Holder in the CDI Register at the relevant CDI Record Date.

Adjustment to votes  101.  If it appears in relation to a particular resolution at a particular meeting that the aggregate number of votes cast by or on behalf of the Depositary Nominee would
without an adjustment exceed the Depositary Nominee's Overall Holding at the relevant Member Voting Record Time then such adjustments shall be made to the
aggregate number of votes cast for or against the resolution so that the total number of votes cast by or on behalf of the Depositary Nominee does not exceed that
Depositary Nominee's Overall Holding at the Member Voting Record Time. The chairman of the meeting has discretion to make such adjustments as are fair and
equitable and any such adjustments made in good faith shall be conclusive and binding on all persons interested.

    For the avoidance of doubt votes cast by or on behalf of the Depositary Nominee shall include votes cast by any proxy appointed by it.

Determination of questions
relating to CDIs

 102.  Subject and without prejudice to the requirements of the ASX Settlement Operating Rules and the provisions of Articles 58 and 97, if in any circumstances other than
those provided for in those Articles any question shall arise as to whether any person has been validly appointed to vote (or exercise any other right) in respect of a
holding of CDIs or as to the number of CDIs in respect of which he is entitled to do so, then:

    (a)  if such question arises at or in relation to a general meeting it shall be determined by the chairman of the meeting or in such other manner as may have
been prescribed by regulations or procedures made or established by the board under Article 109; and

demanded to the chairman or to the secretary or to any director.

appointment not made by
holder

 104.  Where the appointment of a proxy is expressed to have been or purports to have been made, sent or supplied by a person on behalf of the holder of a share:

    (a)  the Company may treat the appointment as sufficient evidence of the authority of that person to make, send or supply the appointment on behalf of that
holder;

appointment has been made, sent or supplied, or a copy of such authority certified notarially or in some other way approved by the board, to such

Validity of proxy
appointment

 105.  A proxy appointment which is not delivered or received in accordance with Article 103 shall be invalid. When two or more valid proxy appointments are delivered or
received in respect of the same share for use at the same meeting, the one which was last delivered or received shall be treated as replacing or revoking the others as
regards that share, provided that if the Company determines that it has insufficient evidence to decide whether or not a proxy appointment is in respect of the same share
or which was last delivered or received, it shall be entitled to determine which proxy appointment (if any) is to be treated as valid. Subject to the Companies Law, the
board may determine at its discretion when a proxy appointment shall be treated as delivered or received for the purposes of these Articles.

Rights of proxy  106.  A proxy appointment shall be deemed to entitle the proxy to exercise all or any of the appointing member's rights to attend and to speak and vote at a meeting of the
Company. The proxy appointment shall, unless it provides to the contrary, be valid for any adjournment of the meeting as well as for the meeting to which it relates.

Corporate representatives  107.  Any corporation which is a member of the Company (in this Article the grantor) may, by resolution of its directors or other governing body, authorise such person or
persons as it thinks fit to act as its representative or representatives at any meeting of the Company or at any separate meeting of the holders of any class of shares.

    A director, the secretary or other person authorised for the purpose by the secretary may require all or any of such persons to produce a copy of the resolution of
authorisation certified by an officer of the corporation before permitting him to exercise his powers.

Revocation of authority  108.  The termination of the authority of a person to act as a proxy or duly authorised representative of a corporation does not affect:

    (a)  whether he counts in deciding whether there is a quorum at a meeting;

    (b)  the validity of anything he does as chairman of a meeting;

    (c)  the validity of a poll demanded by him at a meeting; or

    (d)  the validity of a vote given by that person,

    unless notice of the termination was either delivered or received as mentioned in the following sentence at least three hours before the start of the relevant meeting or
adjourned meeting or (in the case of a poll taken otherwise than on the same day as the meeting or adjourned meeting) the time appointed for taking the poll. Such notice
of termination shall be either by means of a document in hard copy form delivered to the office or to such other place as may be specified by or on behalf of the Company
in accordance with Article 103(a) or in electronic form received at the address (if any) specified by or on behalf of the Company in accordance with Article 103(b),
regardless of whether any relevant proxy appointment was effected in hard copy form or in electronic form.

Verification procedures of
proxies

 109.  From time to time the directors may (consistently with the Companies Law and the Articles) make such regulations and establish such procedures as they consider
appropriate to receive and verify the appointment or revocation of a proxy. Any such regulations may be general, or specific to a particular meeting. Without limitation,
any such regulations may include provisions that the directors (or some person or persons appointed by them) may conclusively determine any matter or dispute relating
to:

    (a)  the appointment or revocation, or purported appointment or revocation, of a proxy; and/or

    (b)  any instruction contained or allegedly contained in any such appointment,

    and any such regulations may also include rebuttable or conclusive presumptions of any fact concerning those matters. The directors may from time to time modify or
revoke any such regulations as they think fit, provided that no subsisting valid appointment or revocation of a proxy or any vote instruction shall thereby be rendered
invalid.

Limitation of liabilities in
connection with proxies

 110.  To the extent permitted by law, each of the directors, the secretary and each person employed or, directly or indirectly, retained or used by the Company in the processes
of receiving and validating the appointment and revocation of proxies or otherwise dealing with CDI Voting Instructions shall not be liable to any persons other than the
Company in respect of any acts or omission (including negligence) occurring in the execution or purported execution of his tasks relating to such processes, provided
that he shall have no such immunity in respect of any act done or omitted to be done in bad faith.

ESTABLISHMENT OF CDI REGISTER; TREATMENT OF CDI HOLDERS

Establishment of CDI
Register

 111.  If the Company is admitted to listing on ASX the board shall, in accordance with the ASX Settlement Operating Rules, establish and (for so long as the Company
remains so listed) maintain the CDI Register.

Legal framework
governing CDIs

 112.  For so long as the Company remains listed on ASX, the provisions of the ASX Settlement Operating Rules and of these Articles shall govern the relationship between
CDI Holders and the Company. Notwithstanding any provisions of these Articles, the board shall be authorised to vary or depart from any provision of these Articles
concerning the holding of CDIs if and to the extent necessary to comply with the ASX Settlement Operating Rules.

No recognition of trusts
etc.

 113.  Except as required by law, no CDI Holder shall be recognised by the Company as holding any interest in CDIs upon any trust and the Company shall be entitled to treat
any person entered in the CDI Register as the only person (other than the Depositary Nominee) who has any interest in the CDIs standing to the name of that CDI
Holder.

Limits on number of
directors

 114.  Unless otherwise determined by ordinary resolution, the number of directors (other than alternate directors) shall be not less than 3 nor more than 12 in number.

APPOINTMENT AND RETIREMENT OF DIRECTORS

Eligibility for election  115.  At each annual general meeting of shareholders, each director shall be elected for a one-year term. A director shall hold office until the subsequent annual general meeting
and until his successor shall be elected and shall qualify, subject, however, to prior death, resignation or removal from office.

  116.  If the Company does not fill the vacancy at the meeting at which a director retires, the retiring director shall, if willing to act, be deemed to have been re-appointed unless
at the meeting it is resolved not to fill the vacancy or unless a resolution for the re-appointment of the director is put to the meeting and lost.

  117.  No person shall be appointed a director at any general meeting unless he is recommended by the board.

Separate resolutions on
appointment

 118.  Except as otherwise authorised by the Companies Law, a motion for the appointment of two or more persons as directors by a single resolution shall not be made unless a
resolution that it should be so made has first been agreed to by the meeting without any vote being given against it.

Additional powers of the
Company

 119.  Subject as aforesaid, the Company may by ordinary resolution appoint a person who is willing to act to be a director either to fill a vacancy or as an additional director.
The appointment of a person to fill a vacancy or as an additional director shall take effect from the end of the meeting.

Appointment by board  120.  The board may appoint a person who is willing to act to be a director, either to fill a vacancy or as an additional director and in either case whether or not for a fixed term,
provided that the appointment does not cause the number of directors to exceed the number, if any, fixed by or in accordance with these Articles as the maximum number
of directors. Irrespective of the terms of his appointment, a director so appointed shall hold office only until the next following annual general meeting and shall not be
taken into account in determining the directors who are to retire at the meeting. If not re-appointed at such annual general meeting, he shall vacate office at its conclusion.

Position of retiring
directors

 121.  Subject to this Article 121, a director who retires at an annual general meeting may, if willing to act, be re-appointed. If he is not re-appointed, he shall retain office until
the meeting appoints someone in his place, or if it does not do so, until the end of the meeting. A director who is considered by the Company to be independent and has
held office for 10 years or more since his appointment shall retire and shall vacate office at the conclusion of such annual general meeting, provided that any independent
director who, prior to completion of the Merger, held office as a director of the Company or Janus, may serve for 15 years from the date of such director's original
appointment to the board of the Company or Janus (as applicable).

No share qualification  122.  A director shall not be required to hold any shares in the capital of the Company by way of qualification.

Power to appoint
alternates

 123.  Any director (other than an alternate director) may appoint any other director, or any other person approved by resolution of the board and willing to act, to be an alternate
director and may remove from office an alternate director so appointed by him.

Alternates entitled to
receive notice

 124.  An alternate director shall be entitled to receive notice of all meetings of the board and of all meetings of committees of the board of which his appointor is a member,
to attend and vote at any such meeting at which his appointor is not personally present, and generally to perform all the functions of his appointor (except as regards
power to appoint an alternate) as a director in his absence.

Alternates representing
more than one director

 125.  A director or any other person may act as alternate director to represent more than one director, and an alternate director shall be entitled at meetings of the board or
any committee of the board to one vote for every director whom he represents (and who is not present) in addition to his own vote (if any) as a director, but he shall
count as only one for the purpose of determining whether a quorum is present.

Expenses and
remuneration of alternates

 126.  An alternate director may be repaid by the Company such expenses as might properly have been repaid to him if he had been a director but shall not be entitled to
receive any remuneration from the Company in respect of his services as an alternate director. An alternate director shall be entitled to be indemnified by the Company
to the same extent as if he were a director.

Termination of
appointment

 127.  An alternate director shall cease to be an alternate director:

    (a)  if his appointor ceases to be a director; but, if a director retires but is re-appointed or deemed to have been re-appointed at the meeting at which he
retires, any appointment of an alternate director made by him which was in force immediately prior to his retirement shall continue after his re-
appointment; or

    (b)  on the happening of any event which, if he were a director, would cause him to vacate his office as director; or

    (c)  if he resigns his office by notice to the Company.

Method of appointment
and revocation

 128.  Any appointment or removal of an alternate director shall be by notice to the Company by the director making or revoking the appointment and shall take effect in
accordance with the terms of the notice (subject to any approval required by Article 123) on receipt of such notice by the Company which shall, be in hard copy form
or in electronic form sent to such address (if any) for the time being specified by or on behalf of the Company for that purpose.

Alternate not an agent of
appointor

 129.  Except as otherwise expressly provided in these Articles, an alternate director shall be deemed for all purposes to be a director. Accordingly, except where the context
otherwise requires, a reference to a director shall be deemed to include a reference to an alternate director. An alternate director shall alone be responsible for his own
acts and defaults and he shall not be deemed to be the agent of the director appointing him.

Business to be managed by
board

 130.  Subject to the provisions of the Companies Law, the Memorandum and these Articles and to any directions given by special resolution, the business of the Company shall
be managed by the board which may exercise all the powers of the Company. No alteration of the Memorandum or Articles and no such direction shall invalidate any prior
act of the board which would have been valid if that alteration had not been made or that direction had not been given. The powers given by this Article shall not be
limited by any special power given to the board by these Articles. A meeting of the board at which a quorum is present may exercise all powers exercisable by the board.

providing for the payment of remuneration to the directors of such body corporate).

DELEGATION OF POWERS OF THE BOARD

Committees of the board  132.  The board may delegate any of its powers to any committee consisting of one or more directors. The board may also delegate to any director holding any executive office
such of its powers as the board considers desirable to be exercised by him. Any such delegation shall, in the absence of express provision to the contrary in the terms of
delegation, be deemed to include authority to sub-delegate to one or more directors (whether or not acting as a committee) or to any employee or agent of the Company all
or any of the powers delegated and may be made subject to such conditions as the board may specify, and may be revoked or altered. The board may co-opt on to any such
committee persons other than directors, who may enjoy voting rights in the committee. The co-opted members shall be less than one-half of the total membership of the
committee and a resolution of any committee shall be effective only if a majority of the members present are directors. Subject to any conditions imposed by the board, the
proceedings of a committee with two or more members shall be governed by these Articles regulating the proceedings of directors so far as they are capable of applying.

Local boards etc.  133.  The board may establish local or divisional boards or agencies for managing any of the affairs of the Company and may appoint any persons to be members of the local or
divisional boards, or any managers or agents, and may fix their remuneration. The board may delegate to any local or divisional board, manager or agent any of the
powers, authorities and discretions vested in or exercisable by the board, with power to sub-delegate, and may authorise the members of any local or divisional board, or
any of them, to fill any vacancies and to act notwithstanding vacancies. Any appointment or delegation made pursuant to this Article may be made on such terms and
subject to such conditions as the board may decide. The board may remove any person so appointed and may revoke or vary the delegation but no person dealing in good
faith and without notice of the revocation or variation shall be affected by it.

all or any of his powers, authorities and discretions, and may revoke or vary such delegation.

Offices including title
"director"

 135.  The board may appoint any person to any office or employment having a designation or title including the word "director" or attach to any existing office or
employment with the Company such a designation or title and may terminate any such appointment or the use of any such designation or title. The inclusion of the
word "director" in the designation or title of any such office or employment shall not imply that the holder is a director of the Company, and the holder shall not
thereby be empowered in any respect to act as, or be deemed to be, a director of the Company for any of the purposes of these Articles.

DISQUALIFICATION AND REMOVAL OF DIRECTORS

Disqualification as a
director

 136.  A person ceases to be a director as soon as:

rules of the relevant stock exchange;

    (b)  a bankruptcy order is made against that person;

    (c)  a composition is made with that person's creditors generally in satisfaction of that person's debts;

mentally incapable of acting as a director and may remain so for more than three months;

    (e)  by reason of that person's mental health, a court makes an order which wholly or partly prevents that person from personally exercising any powers or
rights which that person would otherwise have;

taken effect in accordance with its terms, or his office as a director is vacated pursuant to Article 137; or

    (g)  that person receives notice signed by not less than three quarters of the other directors stating that that person should cease to be a director. In calculating
the number of directors who are required to give such notice to the director, (i) an alternate director appointed by him acting in his capacity as such shall
be excluded; and (ii) a director and any alternate director appointed by him and acting in his capacity as such shall constitute a single director for this
purpose, so that notice by either shall be sufficient.

Board

 148.  A director who, to his knowledge, is in any way (directly or indirectly) interested in any contract, arrangement, transaction or proposal to be entered into or proposed
to be entered into by the Company and such interest conflicts or may conflict to a material extent with the interests of the Company shall declare the nature of his

    (a)  a general notice given to the board by a director that he is to be regarded as having an interest (of the nature and extent specified in the notice) in any
contract, transaction, arrangement or proposal in which a specified person or class of persons is interested shall be deemed to be a sufficient disclosure
under this Article in relation to such contract, transaction, arrangement or proposal; and

    (b)  an interest of which a director has no knowledge and of which it is unreasonable to expect him to have knowledge shall not be treated as an interest of
his.

 151.  A director shall not vote (but shall be counted in the quorum) on any resolution of the board or committee of the board concerning his own appointment (including
fixing or varying the terms of his appointment or its termination) as the holder of any office or place of profit with the Company or any body corporate in which the
Company is interested. Where proposals are under consideration concerning the appointment (including fixing or varying the terms of appointment or its termination) of
two or more directors to offices or places of profit with the Company or any body corporate in which the Company is interested, such proposals may be divided and a
separate resolution considered in relation to each director. In such case each of the directors concerned (if not otherwise debarred from voting under these Articles) shall
be entitled to vote in respect of each resolution except that concerning his own appointment and for the avoidance of doubt shall be still be counted in the quorum for
any resolution concerning his own appointment.

Chairman's Ruling
conclusive on director's
interests

 152.  If any question arises at any meeting as to the materiality of a director's interest (other than the Chairman's interest) or as to the entitlement of any director (other than
the Chairman) to vote, and such question is not resolved by his voluntarily agreeing to abstain from voting, such question shall be referred to the Chairman of the
meeting. The Chairman's ruling in relation to the director concerned shall be final and conclusive.

Directors' resolution
conclusive on chairman's
interest

 153.  If any question arises at any meeting as the materiality of the Chairman's interests or as to the entitlement of the Chairman to vote, and such question is not resolved by
his voluntarily agreeing to abstain from voting, such question shall be decided by resolution of the directors or committee members present at the meeting (excluding
the Chairman), whose majority vote shall be final and conclusive.

Connected Persons and
notification

 154.   

  (A)  For the purpose of Articles 147 to 153 (inclusive) (which shall apply equally to alternate directors) an interest of a person who is for the purposes of the Companies Law
connected with a director within the meaning of Article 74ZA of the Companies Law shall be treated as an interest of the director, provided that the director is aware of
such interest.

  (B)  Subject to the Companies Law, a director shall be under no duty to the Company with respect to any information which he obtains or has obtained otherwise than as a
director of the Company and in respect of which he owes a duty of confidentiality to another person. However, to the extent that his relationship with that other person
gives rise to a conflict of interest or may give rise to a conflict of interest, this Article applies only if the existence of that relationship and the fact that it gives rise to a
conflict of interest or may give rise to a conflict of interest has been approved by the board. In particular, the director shall not be in breach of the general duties he owes
to the Company by virtue of Article 74 of the Companies Law or any other applicable law because he fails:

    (i)  to disclose any such information to the board or to any director or other officer or employee of the Company; and/or

    (ii)  to use or apply any such information in performing his duties as a director of the Company.

  (C)  Subject to the Companies Law, where the existence of a director's relationship with another person has been approved by the board pursuant to Article 154 (B) above
and his relationship with that person gives rise to a conflict of interest or may give rise to a conflict of interest, the director shall not be in breach of the general duties he
owes to the Company by virtue of Article 74 of the Companies Law or any other applicable law because he:

    (i)  absents himself from meetings of the board at which any matter relating to the conflict of interest or possible conflict of interest will or may be discussed
or from the discussion of any such matter at a meeting or otherwise; and/or

    (ii)  makes arrangements not to receive documents and information relating to any matter which gives rise to the conflict of interest or possible conflict of
interest sent or supplied by the Company and/or for such documents and information to be received and read by a professional adviser,

    for so long as he reasonably believes such conflict of interest (or possible conflict of interest) subsists.

  (D)  The provisions of Articles 154 (B) and (C) above are without prejudice to any equitable principle or rule of law which may excuse the director from:

    (i)  disclosing information, in circumstances where disclosure would otherwise be required under these Articles; or

    (ii)  attending meetings or discussions or receiving documents and information as referred to in Article 154 (C), in circumstances where such attendance or
receiving such documents and information would otherwise be required under these Articles.

GRATUITIES, PENSIONS AND INSURANCE

Gratuities and pensions  155.  The board may (by establishment of, or maintenance of, schemes or otherwise) provide benefits, whether by the payment of gratuities or pensions or by insurance or
otherwise, for any past or present director or employee of the Company or any of its subsidiary undertakings or any body corporate associated with, or any business
acquired by, any of them, and for any member of his family (including a spouse, a civil partner, a former spouse and a former civil partner) or any person who is or
was dependent on him, and may (as well before as after he ceases to hold such office or employment) contribute to any fund and pay premiums for the purchase or
provision of any such benefit.

Insurance  156.  Without prejudice to the provisions of Article 210, the board may exercise all the powers of the Company to purchase and maintain insurance for or for the benefit of
any person who is or was:

    (a)  a director, officer or employee of the Company, or any body which is or was the holding company or subsidiary undertaking of the Company, or in which
the Company or such holding company or subsidiary undertaking has or had any interest (whether direct or indirect) or with which the Company or such
holding company or subsidiary undertaking is or was in any way allied or associated; or

    (b)  a trustee of any pension fund in which employees of the Company or any other body referred to in paragraph (a) of this Article is or has been interested,

    including without limitation insurance against any liability incurred by such person in respect of any act or omission in the actual or purported execution or discharge
of his duties or in the exercise or purported exercise of his powers or otherwise in relation to his duties, powers or offices in relation to the relevant body or fund.

Directors not liable to
account

 157.  No director or former director shall be accountable to the Company or the members for any benefit provided pursuant to these Articles. The receipt of any such benefit
shall not disqualify any person from being or becoming a director of the Company.

Power to provide for
employees

 158.  The board is hereby authorised to make such provision as may seem appropriate for the benefit of any persons employed or formerly employed by the Company or any
of its subsidiary undertakings in connection with the cessation or the transfer of the whole or part of the undertaking of the Company or any subsidiary undertaking.
Any such provision shall be made by a resolution of the board.

PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD

Convening meetings  159.  Subject to the provisions of these Articles, the board may regulate its proceedings as it thinks fit. A director may, and the secretary at the request of a director shall, call a
meeting of the board by giving notice of the meeting to each director. Notice of a board meeting shall be deemed to be given to a director if it is given to him personally or
by word of mouth or sent in hard copy form to him, at his last known address or such other address (if any) as may for the time being be specified by him or on his behalf
to the Company for that purpose, or sent in electronic form to such address (if any) for the time being specified by him or on his behalf to the Company for that purpose. A
director absent or intending to be absent from his normal address may request the board that notices of board meetings shall during his absence be sent in hard copy form
or in electronic form to him at such address (if any) for the time being specified by him or on his behalf to the Company for that purpose, or sent using electronic
communications to such address (if any) for the time being notified by him or on his behalf to the Company for that purpose, but such notices need not be sent any earlier
than notices sent to directors not so absent and, if no such request is made to the board, it shall not be necessary to send notice of a board meeting to any director who is
for the time being absent from his normal address. No account is to be taken of directors absent from their normal address when considering the adequacy of the period of
notice of the meeting. Questions arising at a meeting shall be decided by a majority of votes. Any director may waive notice of a meeting and any such waiver may be
retrospective. Any notice pursuant to this Article need not be in writing if the board so determines and any such determination may be retrospective.

Quorum  160.  The quorum for the transaction of the business of the board may be fixed by the board and unless so fixed at any other number shall be two. A person who holds office
only as an alternate director may, if his appointor is not present, be counted in the quorum. Any director who ceases to be a director at a board meeting may continue to be
present and to act as a director and be counted in the quorum until the termination of the board meeting if no director objects.

Powers of directors if
number falls below
minimum

 161.  The continuing directors or a sole continuing director may act notwithstanding any vacancies in their number, but, if the number of directors is less than the number fixed
as the quorum, the continuing directors or director may act only for the purpose of filling vacancies or of calling a general meeting.

Chairman and deputy
chairman

 162.  The board may appoint one of their number to be the chairman, and one of their number to be the deputy chairman, of the board and may at any time remove either of
them from such office. Unless he is unwilling to do so, the director appointed as chairman, or in his stead the director appointed as deputy chairman, shall preside at every
meeting of the board at which he is present. If there is no director holding either of those offices, or if neither the chairman nor the deputy chairman is willing to preside or
neither of them is present within five minutes after the time appointed for the meeting, the directors present may appoint one of their number to be chairman of the
meeting.

Validity of acts of the
board

 163.  All acts done by a meeting of the board, or of a committee of the board, or by a person acting as a director or alternate director, shall, notwithstanding that it be
afterwards discovered that there was a defect in the appointment of any director or any member of the committee or alternate director or that any of them were
disqualified from holding office, or had vacated office, or were not entitled to vote, be as valid as if every such person had been duly appointed and was qualified and
had continued to be a director or, as the case may be, an alternate director and had been entitled to vote.

Resolutions in writing  164.  A resolution in writing agreed by all the directors entitled to receive notice of and vote at a meeting of the board or of a committee of the board (not being less than the
number of directors required to form a quorum of the board) shall be as valid and effectual as if it had been passed at a meeting of the board or (as the case may be) a
committee of the board duly convened and held. For this purpose:

    (a)  a director signifies his agreement to a proposed written resolution when the Company receives from him a document indicating his agreement to the
resolution authenticated in the manner permitted by the Companies Law for a document in the relevant form;

    (b)  the director may send the document in hard copy form in electronic form to such address (if any) for the time being specified by the Company for that
purpose;

    (c)  if an alternate director signifies his agreement to the proposed written resolution, his appointor need not also signify his agreement; and

    (d)  if a director signifies his agreement to the proposed written resolution, an alternate director appointed by him need not also signify his agreement in that
capacity.

Meetings by telephone etc.  165.  Without prejudice to the first sentence of Article 159, a person entitled to be present at a meeting of the board or of a committee of the board shall be deemed to be
present for all purposes if he is able (directly or by electronic communication) to speak to and be heard by all those present or deemed to be present simultaneously. A
director so deemed to be present shall be entitled to vote and be counted in a quorum accordingly. Such a meeting shall be deemed to take place where it is convened to
be held or (if no director is present in that place) where the largest group of those participating is assembled, or, if there is no such group, where the chairman of the
meeting is. The word meeting in these Articles shall be construed accordingly.

Interests of connected
person and alternate
director

 166.  For the purpose of these Articles in relation to an alternate director, an interest of his appointor shall be treated as an interest of the alternate director without prejudice
to any interest which the alternate director has otherwise.

Relaxation of provisions
regarding directors'
interests

 167.  Subject to the Companies Law, the Company may by ordinary resolution suspend or relax the provisions of Articles 147 to 153 to any extent or ratify any transaction or
arrangement not duly authorised by reason of a contravention of this Article.

Decision of chairman final
and conclusive

 168.  If a question arises at a meeting of a committee of the board as to the entitlement of a director to vote, the question may, before the conclusion of the meeting, be
referred to the chairman of the meeting and his ruling in relation to any director other than himself shall be final and conclusive except in a case where the nature or
extent of the interests of the director concerned have not been fairly disclosed. If any such question arises in respect of the chairman of the meeting, it shall be decided
by resolution of the committee of the board (on which the chairman shall not vote) and such resolution will be final and conclusive except in a case where the nature and
extent of the interests of the chairman have not been fairly disclosed.

SECRETARY

Appointment and removal
of secretary

 169.  Subject to the provisions of the Companies Law, the secretary shall be appointed by the board for such term, at such remuneration and on such conditions as it may think
fit. Any secretary so appointed may be removed by the board, but without prejudice to any claim for damages for breach of any contract of service between him and the
Company.

MINUTES

Minutes required to be
kept

 170.  The board shall cause minutes to be recorded for the purpose of:

    (a)  all appointments of officers made by the board; and

    (b)  all proceedings at meetings of the Company, the holders of any class of shares in the capital of the Company, the board and committees of the board,
including the names of the directors present at each such meeting.

Conclusiveness of minutes  171.  Any such minutes, if purporting to be authenticated by the chairman of the meeting to which they relate or of the next meeting, shall be sufficient evidence of the
proceedings at the meeting without any further proof of the facts stated in them.

THE SEAL

Authority required for
execution of deed

 172.  The seal shall only be used by the authority of a resolution of the board. The board may determine who shall sign any document executed under the seal. If they do not,
it shall be signed by at least one director and the secretary or by at least two directors. Any document may be executed under the seal by impressing the seal by
mechanical means or by printing the seal or a facsimile of it on the document or by applying the seal or a facsimile of it by any other means to the document. A
document executed, with the authority of a resolution of the board, by a director and the secretary or by two directors or by a director in the presence of a witness who
attests the signature and expressed (in whatever form of words) to be executed by the Company has the same effect as if executed under the seal.

Certificates for shares and
debentures

 173.  The board may by resolution determine either generally or in any particular case that any certificate for shares or debentures or representing any other form of security
may have any signature affixed to it by some mechanical or electronic means, or printed on it or, in the case of a certificate executed under the seal, need not bear any
signature.

Authentication and
certification of copies and
extracts

 176.  Any director or the secretary or any other person appointed by the board for the purpose shall have power to authenticate and certify as true copies of and extracts
from:

    (a)  any document comprising or affecting the constitution of the Company, whether in hard copy form or electronic form;

    If certified in this way, a document purporting to be a copy of a resolution, or the minutes or an extract from the minutes of a meeting of the Company, the holders of
any class of shares in the capital of the Company, the board or a committee of the board, whether in hard copy form or electronic form, shall be conclusive evidence in
favour of all persons dealing with the Company in reliance on it or them that the resolution was duly passed or that the minutes are, or the extract from the minutes is,
a true and accurate record of proceedings at a duly constituted meeting.

Declaration of dividends  177.  Subject to the provisions of the Companies Law, the Company may by ordinary resolution declare dividends in accordance with the respective rights of the members,
but no dividend shall exceed the amount recommended by the board.

Interim dividends  178.  Subject to the provisions of the Companies Law, the board may pay interim dividends if it appears to the board that they are justified by the profits or the cash flow
position of the Company. If the share capital is divided into different classes, the board may:

    (a)  pay interim dividends on shares which confer deferred or non-preferred rights with regard to dividends as well as on shares which confer preferential
rights with regard to dividends, but no interim dividend shall be paid on shares carrying deferred or non-preferred rights if, at the time of payment, any
preferential dividend is in arrear; and

    (b)  pay at intervals settled by it any dividend payable at a fixed rate if it appears to the board that the profits available for distribution justify the payment.

interim dividend on any shares having deferred or non-preferred rights.

 179.  The board may determine:

    (a)  the currency in which dividends shall be declared;

 180.  Except as otherwise provided by the rights attached to shares, all dividends shall be declared and paid according to the amounts paid up on the shares on which the
dividend is paid; but no amount paid on a share in advance of the date on which a call is payable shall be treated for the purpose of this Article as paid on the share. All
dividends shall be apportioned and paid proportionately to the amounts paid up on the shares during any portion or portions of the period in respect of which the
dividend is paid; but, if any share is allotted or issued on terms providing that it shall rank for dividend as from a particular date, that share shall rank for dividend
accordingly.

Dividends in specie  181.  A general meeting declaring a dividend may, on the recommendation of the board, by ordinary resolution direct that it shall be satisfied wholly or partly by the
distribution of assets, including without limitation paid up shares or debentures of another body corporate. The board may make any arrangements it thinks fit to settle
any difficulty arising in connection with the distribution, including without limitation (a) the fixing of the value for distribution of any assets, (b) the payment of cash to
any member on the basis of that value in order to adjust the rights of members, and (c) the vesting of any asset in a trustee.

Scrip dividends:
authorising resolution

 182.  The board may, if authorised by an ordinary resolution of the Company (the Resolution), offer any holder of shares the right to elect to receive shares, credited as fully
paid, instead of cash in respect of the whole (or some part, to be determined by the board) of all or any dividend specified by the Resolution. The offer shall be on the
terms and conditions and be made in the manner specified in Article 183 or, subject to those provisions, specified in the Resolution.

    (b)  Each holder of shares shall be entitled to that number of new shares as are together as nearly as possible equal in value to (but not greater than) the cash
amount (disregarding any tax credit) of the dividend that such holder elects to forgo (each a new share). For this purpose, the value of each new share
shall be:

      (i)  equal to the average quotation for the Company's ordinary shares, that is, the average of the middle market quotations for those shares on the
New York Stock Exchange, on the day on which such shares are first quoted ex the relevant dividend and the four subsequent dealing days; or

      (ii)  calculated in any other manner specified by the Resolution,
    but shall never be less than the par value of the new share.

    A certificate or report by the auditors as to the value of a new share in respect of any dividend shall be conclusive evidence of that value.

    (c)  On or as soon as practicable after announcing that any dividend is to be declared or recommended, the board, if it intends to offer an election in respect
of that dividend, shall also announce that intention. If, after determining the basis of allotment, the board decides to proceed with the offer, it shall notify
the holders of shares of the terms and conditions of the right of election offered to them, specifying the procedure to be followed and place at which, and
the latest time by which, elections or notices amending or terminating existing elections must be delivered in order to be effective.

    (d)  The board shall not proceed with any election unless the Company has sufficient unissued shares authorised for issue and sufficient reserves or funds that
may be appropriated to give effect to it after the basis of allotment is determined.

    (e)  The board may exclude from any offer any holders of shares where the board believes the making of the offer to them would or might involve the
contravention of the laws of any territory or that for any other reason the offer should not be made to them.

    (f)  The dividend (or that part of the dividend in respect of which a right of election has been offered) shall not be payable in cash on shares in respect of
which an election has been made (the elected shares) and instead such number of new shares shall be allotted to each holder of elected shares as is
arrived at on the basis stated in paragraph (b) of this Article. For that purpose the board shall, subject to the Companies Law, appropriate out of any
amount for the time being standing to the credit of any capital account, reserve or fund (including without limitation the profit and loss account), whether
or not it is available for distribution, a sum equal to the aggregate nominal amount of the new shares to be allotted and apply it in paying up in full the
appropriate number of new shares for allotment and distribution to each holder of elected shares as is arrived at on the basis stated in paragraph (b) of
this Article.

    (g)  The new shares when allotted shall rank equally in all respects with the fully paid shares of the same class then in issue except that they shall not be
entitled to participate in the relevant dividend.

    (h)  No fraction of a share shall be allotted. The board may make such provision as it thinks fit for any fractional entitlements including without limitation
payment in cash to holders in respect of their fractional entitlements, provision for the accrual, retention or accumulation of all or part of the benefit of
fractional entitlements to or by the Company or to or by or on behalf of any holder or the application of any accrual, retention or accumulation to the
allotment of fully paid shares to any holder.

    (i)  The board may do all acts and things it considers necessary or expedient to give effect to the allotment and issue of any share pursuant to this Article or
otherwise in connection with any offer made pursuant to this Article and may authorise any person, acting on behalf of the holders concerned, to enter
into an agreement with the Company providing for such allotment or issue and incidental matters. Any agreement made under such authority shall be
effective and binding on all concerned.

    (j)  The board may, at its discretion, amend, suspend or terminate any offer pursuant to this Article.

Income Access
Arrangements

 184.   

  (A)  Where any amount paid by way of dividend by a subsidiary of the Company is paid to the Income Access Trustee on behalf of Elected Shareholders, the entitlement
of such Elected Shareholders in respect of any dividend announced or declared pursuant to these Articles will be reduced by the corresponding amount that has been
paid to the Income Access Trustee in respect of such Elected Shareholder.

  (B)  If a dividend is announced or declared pursuant to these Articles and the entitlement of any Elected Shareholder to be paid its pro rata share of such dividend is not
fully extinguished on the relevant payment date by virtue of such a payment made to the Income Access Trustee, the Company has a full and unconditional obligation
to make payment in respect of the outstanding part of such dividend entitlement.

  (C)  For the purposes of this Article, the amount that is paid to the Income Access Trustee in respect of any Elected Shareholder in respect of any particular dividend paid
by a subsidiary of the Company (a specified dividend) will be deemed to include:

    (a)  any amount that the Income Access Trustee may be compelled by law to withhold or to deduct from, or in respect of, the specified dividend;

    (b)  a pro rata share of any tax that such subsidiary is obliged to withhold or to deduct from, or in respect of, the specified dividend; and

    (c)  a pro rata share of any tax that is payable by the Income Access Trustee in respect of the specified dividend.

  (D)  For the purposes of this Article, the Income Access Trustee is to be treated as having been paid an amount in respect of an Elected Shareholder if a cheque, warrant or
similar financial instrument in respect of that amount is properly despatched to the Income Access Trustee (or to such persons as the Income Access Trustee
nominates), in respect of that Elected Shareholder or if a payment is made through any direct debit, bank or other funds transfer system or any other method approved
by the board and agreed by the holder or person entitled to payment.

including without limitation in respect of an uncertificated share by means of the relevant system (subject to the facilities and requirements of the
relevant system).

Joint entitlement  187.  If two or more persons are registered as joint holders of any share, or are entitled by transmission jointly to a share, the Company may:

    (a)  pay any dividend or other moneys payable in respect of the share to any one of them and any one of them may give effectual receipt for that payment;

respect of a share may (but need not) be paid by the Company into an account separate from the Company's own account. Such payment shall not constitute the
Company a trustee in respect of it. The Company shall be entitled to cease making dividend payments to a member if the warrants and cheques previously used to make
dividend payments by post have been returned undelivered to, or left uncashed by, that member or the other method for making payment has failed on at least two
consecutive occasions, or, following one such occasion, reasonable enquiries have failed to establish the member's new address or payment details. The entitlement
conferred on the Company by this Article in respect of any member shall cease if the member claims a dividend or cashes a dividend warrant or cheque.

[Letterhead of Loeb Partners Corporation] 

October 1, 2016

Board of Directors
Janus Capital Group Inc.
151 Detroit Street
Denver, Colorado 80206

Dear Members of the Board of Directors:

        We understand that Janus Capital Group Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Janus"), Henderson Group plc, a company incorporated in Jersey ("Henderson"), and Horizon Orbit Corp., a Delaware corporation
and direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Henderson ("Merger Sub"), propose to enter into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Agreement"), pursuant to which Merger Sub will be merged with and into Janus
(the "Merger") with Janus surviving the Merger as a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Henderson. Pursuant to the Agreement, each outstanding share of the common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Janus
("Janus Common Stock"), other than shares of Janus Common Stock held by Janus or any wholly-owned subsidiary of Janus (or held in the treasury of Janus) immediately prior to the effective time of the
Merger (holders of such shares, collectively, "Excluded Holders"), will be converted into the right to receive 4.719 ordinary shares, par value £0.125 per share, of Henderson ("Henderson Ordinary Shares" and
such number of Henderson Ordinary Shares, the "Exchange Ratio"). The terms and conditions of the Merger are more fully set forth in the Agreement.

        The Board of Directors of Janus (the "Board") has requested our opinion as of the date hereof as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to holders of Janus Common Stock (other than the Excluded
Holders and Henderson and its affiliates) of the Exchange Ratio.

        In connection with this opinion, we have:

i. Reviewed the financial terms and conditions of a draft, dated September 30, 2016, of the Agreement; 

ii. Reviewed certain publicly available historical business and financial information relating to Janus and Henderson; 

iii. Reviewed various financial forecasts, synergy analyses and other data provided to us by the management of Janus relating to the business of Janus; 

iv. Reviewed various financial forecasts and other data provided to us by the management of Henderson relating to the business of Henderson; 

v. Reviewed publicly available research reports regarding the business and prospects of Janus and Henderson; 

vi. Held discussions with members of the senior management of Janus and Henderson with respect to the businesses and prospects of Janus and Henderson, respectively; 

vii. Reviewed public information with respect to certain other companies in lines of business we believe to be generally relevant in evaluating the business of Janus and Henderson;

viii. Reviewed historical stock prices and trading volumes of Janus Common Stock and Henderson Ordinary Shares; and 

ix. Conducted such other financial studies, analyses and investigations as we deemed appropriate.

        For purposes of our opinion, we have assumed and relied upon the accuracy and completeness of information that was publicly available or supplied or otherwise made available to us by Janus or
Henderson, without independent verification of such information, and we assume no liability therefor. We have not conducted any independent valuation or appraisal of any of the assets or liabilities (contingent
or otherwise) of Janus or Henderson or concerning the solvency of Janus or Henderson under any applicable laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters, and we have not been furnished with any
such valuation or appraisal, nor have we made any physical inspection of the properties or assets of Janus or Henderson. With respect to the projected financial and operating data and synergy analyses relating
to Janus and Henderson, we have assumed that such data and analyses have been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and good faith judgments of the respective
managements of Janus and Henderson as to the future financial performance of Janus and Henderson, as applicable, under the assumptions stated therein. We express no view as to any projected financial and
operating data or synergies or any judgments, estimates or assumptions on which they are based. We have relied at the Board's direction, without independent verification, upon the assessments of the
management of Janus and Henderson as to the future financial and operating performance of Janus and Henderson, and we have assumed that Janus and Henderson will realize the benefits that each expects to
realize from the Merger.

        Further, our opinion is necessarily based on economic, legal, monetary, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to us as of, the date hereof. Circumstances or events
occurring after the date hereof may affect this opinion, and we assume no responsibility for updating or revising our opinion based on circumstances or events occurring after the date hereof. We do not express
any opinion as to what the price of the Henderson Ordinary Shares actually will be when issued or as to the prices at which shares of Janus Common Stock or Henderson Ordinary Shares may trade at any time
subsequent to the announcement of the Merger. In addition, our opinion does not address the relative merits of the Merger compared to any other transaction or business strategy in which Janus might engage or
the merits of the underlying decision by Janus to pursue the Merger. We have not been authorized by the Board to solicit, and have not solicited, indications of interest in a possible transaction with Janus from
any third party.

        In rendering our opinion, we have assumed, with the consent of the Board, that the Merger will be consummated on the terms described in the Agreement, without any waiver or modification of any
material terms or conditions. Representatives of Janus have advised us, and we have assumed, that the Agreement, when executed, will conform to the draft reviewed by us in all material respects. We have
assumed that the representations and warranties made by Janus, Henderson and Merger Sub in the Agreement are and will be true and correct in all respects material to our opinion. We also have assumed, with
the consent of the Board, that obtaining the necessary governmental, regulatory or third party approvals and consents for the Merger will not result in any delay, limitation, restriction or condition, including any
divestiture requirements or amendments or modifications, that would have an adverse effect on Janus, Henderson, the Merger or the benefits of the Merger to Janus, the holders of the Janus Common Stock and
Henderson. We are not legal, tax or regulatory advisors. We are financial advisors only and have relied upon, without independent verification, the assessment of Janus and its legal, tax and regulatory advisors
with respect to legal, tax and regulatory matters. We express no opinion as to any terms or other aspects (other than the Exchange Ratio to the extent expressly specified herein) of the Merger, including, without
limitation, the form or structure of the Merger or any agreements or arrangements entered into in connection with, or contemplated by, the Merger. We express no opinion as to the fairness of any consideration
paid in connection with the Merger to the holders of any other class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of Janus. In addition, we

express no view or opinion as to the fairness of the amount or nature of, or any other aspects relating to, the compensation to any officers, directors or employees of any parties to the Agreement, or class of such
persons, relative to the Exchange Ratio or otherwise.

        We are acting as financial advisor to the Board in connection with the Merger and will receive a fee for such services, a portion of which was payable upon our rendering this opinion and a substantial
portion of which is contingent upon the closing of the Merger. In addition, Janus has agreed to reimburse our expenses and indemnify us against certain liabilities arising out of our engagement. During the two
year period prior to the date hereof, we have not provided financial advisory services to Janus or Henderson. We may provide financial or other services to Janus or Henderson in the future and in connection
with any such services we may receive compensation. In the ordinary course, we and our affiliates and employees may trade equity or debt securities, for our or their own accounts or for the accounts of
customers, of Janus, Henderson and certain of their respective affiliates and, accordingly, may at any time hold a long or short position in such securities.

        Our engagement and the opinion expressed herein are for the benefit of the Board (in its capacity as such) and our opinion is rendered to the Board in connection with its evaluation of the Merger. Our
opinion may not be used for any other purpose without our prior written consent, except that a copy of this opinion may be included in its entirety in any filing Janus is required to make with the Securities and
Exchange Commission in connection with the Merger if such inclusion is required by applicable law. Our opinion is not intended to and does not constitute a recommendation to any stockholder as to how such
stockholder should vote or act with respect to the Merger or any matter relating thereto. The issuance of this opinion was approved by our Opinion Committee.

        Based upon and subject to the foregoing, we are of the opinion that, as of the date hereof, the Exchange Ratio is fair, from a financial point of view, to holders of Janus Common Stock (other than the
Excluded Holders and Henderson and its affiliates).
