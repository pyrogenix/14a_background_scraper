Dear Stockholder:

You are cordially invited to attend a special meeting of the stockholders of Albany Molecular Research, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (“AMRI”), which we will hold at the offices of Goodwin Procter LLP, 100 Northern Avenue, Boston, MA, 02210 on
August 18, 2017, at 9:00AM, local time.

At the special meeting, holders of our common stock will be asked to consider and vote on a proposal to adopt an Agreement and
Plan of Merger (as it may be amended from time to time, the “Merger Agreement”), dated as of June 5, 2017, by and among AMRI,
UIC Parent Corporation, a Delaware corporation (“Parent”), and UIC Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-
owned subsidiary of Parent (“Merger Sub”). Parent and Merger Sub were formed by affiliates of The Carlyle Group (“Carlyle”)
and affiliates of GTCR LLC (“GTCR”) to facilitate the participation of investment funds advised by Carlyle and GTCR in the
transaction. As a result of the merger, AMRI will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent, and each share of AMRI common
stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger (other than shares owned by Parent, Merger Sub
or AMRI, and shares held by stockholders who have perfected their statutory rights of appraisal under the Delaware General
Corporation Law), will be converted into the right to receive $21.75 in cash, without interest and less applicable withholding taxes.

Our board of directors has unanimously approved the merger agreement and determined that the merger and the other
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement are advisable and in the best interests of AMRI and its stockholders.
The board unanimously recommends that stockholders vote “FOR” the proposal to adopt the merger agreement and
approve the transactions contemplated thereby and the related proposals described in the enclosed proxy statement.

The proxy statement describes the merger agreement, the merger, and related agreements and provides specific information
concerning the special meeting. In addition, you may obtain information about AMRI from documents filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission. We urge you to read the entire proxy statement carefully, including the annexes, as it sets forth the details
of the merger agreement and other important information related to the merger.

Your vote is very important.  The merger cannot be completed unless holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of our
common stock vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement. Whether or not you plan to attend the special meeting, we ask
you to submit a proxy to have your shares voted in advance of the special meeting by using one of the methods described in the
proxy statement. If you hold your shares in “street name,” you should instruct your broker, bank, trust or other nominee how to vote
your shares in accordance with the voting instruction form that you will receive from your broker, bank, trust or other nominee.

proxy card in the accompanying prepaid reply envelope or submit your proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone. If

TABLE OF CONTENTS

The Special Meeting (Page 17)

The special meeting of stockholders will be held at the offices of Goodwin Procter LLP, 100 Northern Avenue, Boston, MA, 02210
on August 18, 2017 at 9:00AM, local time. At the special meeting, you will be asked to consider and vote upon:

• a proposal to adopt the merger agreement and approve the transactions contemplated thereby;

• a proposal to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, specified compensation that may become payable to our named
executive officers in connection with the merger;

• a proposal to approve one or more adjournments of the special meeting, if necessary, to solicit additional proxies if there are
insufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the proposal to adopt the merger agreement and approve the
transactions contemplated thereby; and

• such other business as may properly come before the special meeting or any adjournment or postponement of the special
meeting by or at the direction of our board of directors.

We are not currently aware of any other business to come before the special meeting.

Record Date and Quorum (Page 18)

The holders of record of our common stock as of the close of business on July 10, 2017 (the record date for determination of
stockholders entitled to notice of and to vote at the special meeting), are entitled to receive notice of and to vote at the special
meeting or at any adjournment or postponement of the special meeting. All holders of our common stock shall vote together as a
single class, and each stockholder is entitled to one vote for each share of common stock held on the record date. As of the record
date, there were 43,012,240 shares of common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the special meeting. The presence at the
special meeting, in person or by proxy, of the holders of at least a majority of all outstanding shares of common stock on the record
date will constitute a quorum, permitting AMRI to conduct its business at the special meeting.

Voting and Proxies (Page 18)

Any stockholder of record entitled to vote at the special meeting may submit a proxy by telephone, via the Internet, by returning the
enclosed proxy card by mail, or by voting in person at the special meeting. If you intend to submit your proxy by telephone or via
the Internet, you must do so no later than the date and time indicated on the applicable proxy card. Even if you plan to attend the
special meeting, if you hold shares of common stock in your own name as the stockholder of record, please vote your shares by
completing, signing, dating, and returning the enclosed proxy card or by using the telephone number printed on your proxy card or
by using the Internet voting instructions printed on your proxy card.

If you give your proxy, but do not indicate how you wish to vote, your shares will be voted “FOR” the proposal to adopt the
merger agreement and approve the transactions contemplated thereby, “FOR” the proposal to approve, on an advisory (non-
binding) basis, specified compensation that may become payable to our named executive officers in connection with the merger,
and “FOR” the adjournment proposal.

If your shares of common stock are held in “street name,” you should instruct your broker, bank, trust or other nominee on how to
vote such shares of common stock using the instructions provided by your broker, bank, trust or other nominee. If you fail to
provide your nominee with instructions on how to vote your shares of common stock, your nominee will not be able to vote such
shares at the special meeting. If your shares of common stock are held in “street name,” you must obtain a legal proxy from such
nominee in order to vote in person at the special meeting.

Required Vote (Page 18)

For AMRI to complete the merger, stockholders holding at least a majority of the shares of common stock outstanding at the close
of business on the record date must vote “FOR” the proposal to adopt the merger agreement and approve the transactions
contemplated thereby. A failure to vote your shares of common stock, an abstention or broker non-vote will have the same effect as
a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the merger agreement and approve the transactions contemplated thereby.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Approval of each of the advisory (non-binding) proposal on specified compensation which may become payable to AMRI’s named
executive officers in connection with the merger and the adjournment proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the
shares present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on such proposal at the special meeting. Under our bylaws,
abstentions will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the advisory (non-binding) proposal on specified compensation and
the adjournment proposal. Broker non-votes will have no effect on the voting results for these proposals.

Revocation of Proxies (Page 20)

A stockholder of record may revoke his or her proxy at any time before the vote is taken at the special meeting by:

• submitting a new proxy with a later date, by using the telephone or Internet proxy submission procedures described above,
or by completing, signing, dating, and returning a new proxy card by mail to AMRI;

• attending the special meeting and voting in person; or

• delivering to the Secretary of AMRI a written notice of revocation c/o Albany Molecular Research, Inc., 26 Corporate
Circle, Albany, New York 12203, Attn: Secretary.

Attending the special meeting without taking one of the actions described above will not in itself revoke your proxy.

If you hold your shares in “street name” through a broker, bank, trust or other nominee, you will need to follow the instructions
provided to you by your broker, bank, trust or other nominee in order to revoke your voting instructions or submit new voting
instructions.

The Merger (Page 22)

The merger agreement provides that, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions in the merger agreement, Merger Sub
will merge with and into AMRI. AMRI will be the surviving corporation (which we refer to as the “surviving corporation”) in the
merger and will continue as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent.

If the merger is completed, at the effective time of the merger (which we refer to as the “effective time”), each outstanding share of
common stock (other than shares owned by Parent, Merger Sub or AMRI, and shares held by stockholders who have perfected their
statutory rights of appraisal under the Delaware General Corporation Law (which we refer to as the “DGCL”)) will be
automatically converted into the right to receive $21.75 in cash, without interest and less applicable withholding taxes. We refer to
this amount as the “merger consideration.”

Upon completion of the merger, shares of AMRI common stock will no longer be listed on any stock exchange or quotation system.
You will not own any shares of the surviving corporation. The merger agreement is attached as Annex A to this proxy statement.
Please read it carefully.

Recommendation of the Board and Reasons for the Merger (Page 43)

Our board of directors has unanimously approved the merger agreement and determined that the merger and the other transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement are advisable and in the best interests of AMRI and its stockholders. The board
unanimously recommends that stockholders vote “FOR” the proposal to adopt the merger agreement and approve the
transactions contemplated thereby. The board further unanimously recommends that stockholders vote “FOR” the
advisory (non-binding) proposal to approve specified compensation that may become payable to our named executive
officers in connection with the merger, and “FOR” the adjournment proposal.

For the factors considered by our board in reaching its decision to approve the merger agreement, see “The Merger (Proposal
1) — Reasons for the Merger” beginning on page 43 of this proxy statement.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Opinion of the Special Committee’s Financial Advisor (Page 47 and Annex B)

On June 5, 2017, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (which is referred to as Credit Suisse) rendered its oral opinion to a special
committee of the board (which we refer to as the “Special Committee”) (which was subsequently confirmed in writing by delivery
of Credit Suisse’s written opinion dated the same date) as of June 5, 2017, as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the
holders of AMRI common stock of the per share merger consideration to be received by such holders in the merger pursuant to the
merger agreement.

Credit Suisse’s opinion was directed to the Special Committee, and only addressed the fairness, from a financial point of
view, to the holders of AMRI common stock of the per share merger consideration to be received by such holders in the
merger and did not address any other aspect or implication of the merger. The summary of Credit Suisse’s opinion in this
proxy statement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of its written opinion, which is included as Annex B to
this proxy statement and sets forth the procedures followed, assumptions made, qualifications, and limitations on the review
undertaken and other matters considered by Credit Suisse in connection with the preparation of its opinion. However,
neither Credit Suisse’s written opinion nor the summary of its opinion and the related analyses set forth in this proxy
statement is intended to be, and they do not constitute, advice or a recommendation to any stockholder as to how such
stockholder should vote or act with respect to any matter relating to the merger.

Conditions to the Merger (Page 80)

Each party’s obligation to complete the merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the following conditions:

• the adoption of the merger agreement by the required vote of AMRI stockholders;

• the absence of any order, injunction or other judgment, decree, ruling or settlement agreement issued by any governmental
authority, or law, that prohibits or makes illegal the consummation of the merger; and

• the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period (and any extension thereof) under the Hart-Scott-Rodino
Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (which we refer to as the “HSR Act”) and receipt of all approvals or the
expiration of all applicable waiting periods required under other applicable antitrust laws.

The respective obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to complete the merger are subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the
following additional conditions:

• the representations and warranties of AMRI made in the merger agreement will be true and correct as of the closing date
(other than those representations and warranties that were made only as of a specified date, which need only be accurate as
of such specified date), except that, subject to certain exceptions for representations and warranties regarding corporate
existence and power, corporate authorization and brokers’ fees (which will be true and correct in all material respects),
capitalization (which will be true and correct in all respects except for de minimis inaccuracies) and absence of certain
changes (which will be true and correct), any inaccuracies in AMRI’s representations and warranties will be disregarded if
such inaccuracies (disregarding materiality and material adverse effect qualifiers in the related representations and
warranties) have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on AMRI;

• AMRI’s performance in all material respects of all obligations required to be performed by it under the merger agreement at
or prior to the effective time; and

• since the date of the merger agreement, there will not have occurred any change, event, circumstance, occurrence,
condition, state of facts or effect that, individually or in the aggregate, (1) has had or would reasonably be expected to have
a material adverse effect on AMRI and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (2) would reasonably be expected to prevent,
materially delay, interfere with or impair AMRI from consummating the merger.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

The obligation of AMRI to complete the merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the following additional conditions:

• the representations and warranties of Parent and Merger Sub made in the merger agreement will be true and correct in all
material respects as of the closing date (other than those representations and warranties that were made only as of a
specified date, which need only be true and correct as of such specified date), except where any failure to be so true and
correct would not prevent the merger or prevent or materially delay the consummation of the merger or the ability of Parent
and Merger Sub to fully perform their respective covenants and obligations under the merger agreement; and

• the performance in all material respects by Parent and Merger Sub of all obligations required to be performed by them
under the merger agreement at or prior to the effective time.

Treatment of Company Equity Awards (Page 66)

AMRI Stock Options.  Except as otherwise agreed upon with AMRI and Parent, as of the effective time, each AMRI stock option,
whether or not vested and exercisable, that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the effective time will be
automatically converted into the right to receive an amount in cash (less any applicable tax withholdings) equal to the product of
(1) the excess, if any, of $21.75 over the per share exercise price of such AMRI stock option and (2) the aggregate number of shares
of AMRI common stock that were issuable upon exercise or settlement of such AMRI stock option immediately prior to the
effective time. However, if the exercise price of an AMRI stock option is equal to or greater than $21.75, then such AMRI stock
option will be cancelled and terminated at the effective time without any cash payment being made in respect of such AMRI stock
option. The cancellation of an AMRI stock option shall be deemed a release of any and all rights the holder thereof had or may
have had in respect of such AMRI stock option.

Restricted Stock.  Except as otherwise agreed upon with AMRI and Parent, as of the effective time, each outstanding share of
AMRI restricted stock will become fully vested and the restrictions with respect thereto shall lapse and each such share shall be
converted into the right to receive an amount in cash (less any applicable tax withholdings) equal to $21.75 and shall be treated in
the same manner as the other shares of AMRI common stock.

Restricted Stock Unit Awards.  Except as otherwise agreed upon with AMRI and Parent, as of the effective time, each outstanding
AMRI restricted stock unit that is not subject to performance-based vesting, or RSU, whether or not fully vested, will be
automatically cancelled in exchange for the right to receive an amount in cash (less any applicable tax withholdings) equal to the
product of (1) $21.75 and (2) the number of shares of AMRI common stock subject to such RSU.

Performance-Based Restricted Stock Unit Awards.  Except as otherwise agreed upon with AMRI and Parent, as of the effective
time, the performance-based conditions to which each outstanding AMRI performance-based restricted stock unit, or PSU, is
subject will be deemed fully earned at the greater of (i) 100% of target performance or (ii) actual performance measured as of the
effective time, and to the extent earned, each PSU will be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash (less any applicable
tax withholdings) equal to the product of (1) $21.75 and (2) the resulting number of shares of AMRI common stock deemed earned
pursuant to such PSU.

Phantom Stock Awards.  Except as otherwise agreed upon with AMRI and Parent, as of the effective time, each outstanding AMRI
phantom stock award will be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash (less any applicable tax withholdings) equal to
the product of (1) $21.75 and (2) the number of shares of AMRI common stock subject to such AMRI phantom stock award.

Treatment of AMRI’s ESPP (Page 67)

The current offering period under AMRI’s 1998 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “ESPP”) ended on June 30, 2017, and
pursuant to the merger agreement, such offering period was the last permissible offering period under the ESPP. Following the date
of the merger agreement, no new participants may join the ESPP nor may any existing participants increase their rates of
contribution or purchase elections from those in effect on the date of the merger agreement. Following the offering period which
ended on June 30, 2017, there will be no subsequent offering periods under the ESPP, and the ESPP will be terminated on the date
immediately prior to the date on which the effective time occurs, subject to completion of the merger.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Interests of AMRI’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger (Page 57)

In considering the recommendation of our board with respect to the merger agreement, you should be aware that some of AMRI’s
directors and executive officers have interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of AMRI
stockholders generally. Interests of our directors and executive officers that may be different from or in addition to the interests of
AMRI stockholders include:

• The merger agreement provides for the accelerated vesting and cash-out of all AMRI equity awards.

• In connection with the merger, all PSUs will be deemed earned at the greater of 100% of target performance or actual
performance measured as of the effective time.

• AMRI’s executive officers are parties to employment agreements and other arrangements with AMRI that provide for pro-
rated bonus payments in connection with the merger, as well as severance benefits in the event of certain qualifying
terminations of employment in connection with or following the merger.

• Following the merger, AMRI’s executive officers are expected to retain their positions with the surviving corporation.

• AMRI will provide each member of the Special Committee with a special bonus payment for his additional time
commitment and service on the Special Committee. Such one-time special bonus payments will be paid upon
consummation of the merger.

• AMRI’s directors and executive officers are entitled to continued indemnification and insurance coverage under
indemnification agreements and the merger agreement.

These interests are discussed in more detail in the section entitled “The Merger (Proposal 1) — Interests of AMRI’s Directors and
Executive Officers in the Merger” beginning on page 57. The board was aware of the different or additional interests set forth in
this proxy statement and considered such interests along with other matters in approving the merger agreement and the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement, including the merger.

Financing (Page 54)

AMRI and Parent estimate that the total amount of funds required to complete the merger and related transactions and pay related
fees and expenses will be approximately $1.955 billion. Parent expects this amount to be funded through a combination of the
following:

• Barclays Bank PLC, Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc., Royal Bank of Canada, Goldman Sachs Bank USA, Jefferies
Finance LLC and Mizuho Bank Ltd. have committed to provide debt financing for the merger consisting of $720 million in
senior secured first-lien credit facilities (consisting of a $100 million multi-currency revolving credit facility and a $620
million term loan facility) and a $240 million senior secured second-lien credit facility, on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in an amended and restated debt commitment letter, dated as of June 27, 2017.

• Each of GTCR and Carlyle (which we refer to collectively as “Investors/Guarantors”) have committed, pursuant to equity
commitment letters dated as of June 5, 2017, to capitalize Parent, at or prior to the effective time, with an aggregate equity
contribution in an amount of $995 million, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the equity commitment
letters.

The completion of the merger is not subject to any financing condition, although funding of the debt and equity financing is subject
to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in the commitment letters under which the financing will be provided.

Limited Guarantees (Page 56)

The Investors/Guarantors have executed limited guarantees in favor of AMRI to guarantee, on a several basis, Parent’s obligations
to pay any termination fee to AMRI under the merger agreement and certain other expense and indemnification obligations under
the merger agreement.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Acquisition Proposal; Unsolicited Proposals (Page 73)

From the date of the merger agreement until the effective time or the termination of the merger agreement, AMRI and its
subsidiaries are not permitted to:

• solicit, initiate, knowingly facilitate, or knowingly encourage any inquiries, proposals or offers that constitute or could
reasonably be expected to lead to an acquisition proposal;

• engage in, continue, or participate in any discussions or negotiations with a third party regarding an acquisition proposal or
furnish any information to a third party or provide a third party access to the business, properties, assets or personnel of
AMRI or its subsidiaries in any way that could encourage or facilitate or could reasonably be expected to lead to an
acquisition proposal;

• enter into any letter of intent, agreement, contract, commitment, or agreement in principle requiring AMRI to terminate,
abandon or fail to consummate the merger; or

• resolve, propose, or agree to do any of the foregoing.

Following the date of the merger agreement until the date the stockholders approve the merger, (i) if AMRI receives a bona fide
written acquisition proposal from a third party, (ii) such acquisition proposal did not result from a material breach of the merger
agreement, and (iii) the board or the Special Committee determines in good faith (after consultation with the Special Committee’s
financial advisor or another independent financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation and outside legal counsel) that such
acquisition proposal constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to result in, a “superior proposal” to the merger, then, if, but only
if, the board or Special Committee determines in good faith (after consultation with the Special Committee’s financial advisor or
another independent financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation and outside legal counsel) that the failure to take such
actions would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with fiduciary duties under applicable laws, AMRI, after entering into a
confidentiality agreement with the third party, may (a) furnish information and data with respect to AMRI and its subsidiaries and
provide the third party access to the business, properties, assets, and personnel of AMRI and its subsidiaries and (b) enter into,
maintain, and participate in negotiations or discussions with the third party regarding the acquisition proposal or otherwise
cooperate with or assist or participate in, or facilitate any discussions or negotiations with the third party. AMRI may not provide
any non-public information other than pursuant to a confidentiality agreement and will provide written notice to Parent promptly
(and at least within 24 hours) including written notice of the determination by the board or the Special Committee, a copy of the
confidentiality agreement entered into between AMRI and the third party, and any material non-public information concerning
AMRI or its subsidiaries provided to the third party which was not previously provided to Parent. Additionally AMRI will not, and
will not permit its subsidiaries, to enter into any confidentiality or other agreements with a person that could limit or delay the
ability of AMRI or its subsidiaries to provide any information to Parent pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement. After the
receipt of an acquisition proposal, AMRI may contact the third party to clarify or understand the terms of the acquisition proposal
in order to determine if the acquisition proposal constitutes a superior proposal and may direct a person to the merger agreement.
AMRI shall not, and shall cause its subsidiaries and their representatives to not, provide any commercially sensitive non-public
information to a competitor unless consistent with past practice regarding dealing with disclosures for acquisition proposals
previously and with limitations no less restrictive than those placed on Parent or Merger Sub in connection with the merger.

Following the date of the merger agreement, AMRI shall notify Parent promptly (and at least within 24 hours) of AMRI’s receipt of
any acquisition proposal or inquiries with respect to, or that would reasonably be expected to lead to, an acquisition proposal, any
request for non-public information that would reasonably be expected to lead to an acquisition proposal or any request for
discussions or negotiations with AMRI, its subsidiaries or representatives that would reasonably be expected to lead to an
acquisition proposal from a bona fide potential purchaser of AMRI or any of its subsidiaries, which notification shall include a
copy of the applicable written acquisition proposal or other such proposal or offer (or, if oral, the material terms and conditions of
such acquisition proposal or proposal or offer) and the identity of the third party making such acquisition proposal or inquiry.
AMRI shall thereafter keep Parent reasonably informed on a reasonably current basis of the status of any material developments,
discussions or negotiations regarding any such acquisition proposal or inquiry, and the material terms and conditions thereof in the
case of any acquisition

proposal or other such proposal or offer (including any change in price or form of consideration or other material amendment
thereto), including by providing a copy of material documentation relating thereto that is exchanged between the third party (or its
representatives) making such acquisition proposal or other such proposal or offer and AMRI (or its representatives) within 24 hours
after receipt thereof.

Intervening Event (Page 73)

Following the date of the merger agreement until the date the stockholders approve the merger, our board may make a change in its
recommendation to AMRI stockholders with respect to the adoption of the merger agreement due to any fact, event, change,
development or circumstance not known or reasonably foreseeable to our board that is not related to an acquisition proposal (such
fact, event, change, development or circumstance we refer to as an “intervening event”). In the case of an intervening event, no
recommendation change may be made (i) until after the fourth business day following written notice from AMRI advising Parent
that our board or any committee of our board intends to take such an action and specifying the material facts underlying such
determination that an intervening event has occurred and the reason for the adverse recommendation change, (ii) unless during such
four business day period, AMRI shall negotiate with Parent to amend the merger agreement, limited guarantee, equity commitment
letter, and debt commitment letter in such a manner that permits AMRI to maintain the AMRI recommendation and not make an
adverse recommendation change, and (iii) unless, by the expiration of such four business day period, our board or any committee of
our board determines that the failure to effect an adverse recommendation change would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent
with fiduciary duties under applicable law.

Termination (Page 81)

AMRI and Parent may terminate the merger agreement by mutual written consent at any time before the effective time. In addition,
either AMRI or Parent may terminate the merger agreement if:

• the merger has not been consummated on or before December 5, 2017;

• any governmental authority of competent jurisdiction has issued a final and non-appealable injunction or similar order or
enacted any law permanently enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the completion of the merger; or

• if AMRI stockholders fail to adopt the merger agreement and approve the transactions contemplated thereby at the special
meeting or any adjournments or postponements thereof.

AMRI may also terminate the merger agreement:

• if Parent or Merger Sub has breached or failed to perform any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other
agreements contained in the merger agreement which would result in the failure to satisfy a closing condition and such
breach has not been timely cured;

• at any time prior to the adoption of the merger agreement by AMRI stockholders, if (1) our board has authorized AMRI to
enter into an alternative acquisition agreement with respect to a superior proposal, (2) concurrently with such termination,
AMRI enters into an alternative acquisition agreement with respect to such superior proposal, and (3) AMRI has paid the
related termination fee to Parent; or

• if (1) all conditions to Parent’s obligation to complete the closing (other than those conditions that are to be satisfied by
action taken at the closing) have been satisfied, (2) AMRI has irrevocably notified Parent that all conditions to AMRI’s
obligation to complete the closing have been satisfied or waived and AMRI is willing and able to consummate the merger,
and (3) the closing has not occurred within three business days of the later of the date upon which closing should have
occurred pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement and delivery by AMRI to Parent of the previously described notice.

Parent may also terminate the merger agreement:

• if AMRI has breached or failed to perform any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements contained
in the merger agreement which would result in the failure to satisfy a closing condition and such breach has not been timely
cured;

TABLE OF CONTENTS

• in the event of (1) an adverse recommendation change by the AMRI board prior the approval of the merger agreement by
AMRI stockholders (as described in the section entitled “The Merger Agreement — Other Covenants and
Agreements — Alternative Proposals; No Solicitation; Intervening Event”), (2) the failure of the AMRI board to include a
recommendation for approval of the merger agreement in its proxy statement for the special meeting of AMRI stockholders
or (3) AMRI’s entry into an alternative acquisition agreement prior to the effective time;

• in the event that, following a publicly announced acquisition proposal by a third party, AMRI’s board fails to publicly
reaffirm its recommendation prior to the earlier of (x) seven business days following AMRI’s receipt of Parent’s written
request or (y) two business days prior to the stockholder meeting;

• if AMRI has materially breached or failed to perform in any material respect any of its obligations with respect to the no-
shop/no solicitation provisions under the merger agreement (other than any materially cured breaches).

Termination Fees (Page 82)

AMRI will be required to pay a termination fee of $35 million in cash to Parent upon the termination of the merger agreement
pursuant to (1) AMRI’s entry into an alternative acquisition agreement (including with respect to a superior proposal); (2) AMRI’s
willful and material breach or failure to perform any of its representations, warranties, covenants, or other agreements contained in
the merger agreement which would result in the failure to satisfy a closing condition and such breach has not been timely cured
upon reaching December 5, 2017 (the “end date”); (3) AMRI’s board making an “adverse recommendation change”; (4) the failure
of the board of AMRI to include a recommendation for approval of the merger agreement in its proxy statement for the special
meeting of AMRI stockholders; (5) if following a publicly announced acquisition proposal by a third party, AMRI’s board fails to
publicy reaffirm its recommendation; (6) material breach by AMRI of its obligations under the no-shop/no-solicitation provision of
the merger agreement (other than any materially cured breaches); or (7) failure to receive AMRI stockholder approval, or a breach
by AMRI of any of its representations, warranties, covenants, or other agreements contained in the merger agreement which would
result in the failure to satisfy a closing condition and such breach has not been timely cured upon reaching the end date, and (in the
case of (7)), (i) an acquisition proposal is made to the AMRI stockholders generally or is publicly disclosed, in each case before
receipt of the AMRI stockholder approval and not withdrawn and (ii) within 12 months after the date of termination, AMRI enters
into a definitive acquisition agreement with respect to such acquisition proposal that is subsequently consummated (as further
described in the section entitled “The Merger Agreement — Termination Fees”).

Parent will be required to pay to AMRI a reverse termination fee of $70 million in cash in the event that AMRI has terminated the
merger agreement due to (1) the willful and material breach or failure by Parent or Merger Sub to perform any of its
representations, warranties, covenants, or other agreements contained in the merger agreement which would result in the failure to
satisfy a closing condition and such breach has not been timely cured; or (2) the merger not being completed within three business
days following the date the closing should have occurred pursuant to the merger agreement, and at the time of such termination, all
conditions to Parent’s obligation to consummate the closing (other than those conditions that are to be satisfied by action taken at
the closing) have been satisfied and AMRI is ready, willing, and able to complete the merger on such date.

Reimbursement of Expenses (Page 83)

In the event that AMRI fails to pay its termination fee as required under the merger agreement, and Parent or Merger Sub
commences a suit which results in a final, non-appealable judgment against AMRI for its termination fee, AMRI will be required to
reimburse Parent and Merger Sub for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Parent and Merger Sub in connection with
the suit.

In the event that the Parent fails to pay its termination fee as required under the merger agreement, and AMRI commences a suit
which results in a final, non-appealable judgment against Parent for its termination fee, Parent will be required to reimburse AMRI
for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by AMRI in connection with the suit.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Parent is required to reimburse AMRI for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by AMRI, or any of its subsidiaries or
representatives in connection with their (1) cooperation in providing certain information at the request of Parent in connection with
the debt financing, and (2) actions taken upon the written request of Parent with respect to AMRI’s note hedge instruments and
warrants.

Regulatory Approvals (Page 65)

Under the HSR Act and related rules, certain transactions, including the merger, may not be completed until notifications have been
given and information furnished to the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice (which we refer to as the
“Antitrust Division”) and the Federal Trade Commission (which we refer to as the “FTC”) and all statutory waiting period
requirements have been satisfied. On June 26, 2017, the FTC granted early termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act
applicable to the merger. The merger is also conditioned on the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period (and any
extension thereof) or receipt of any necessary approval or clearance required by the European Commission of the European Union
and the Israeli Antitrust Authority.

Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger (Page 62)

If you are a U.S. holder (as defined below), the receipt of cash in exchange for shares of common stock pursuant to the merger will
be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. You should consult your own tax advisors regarding the particular tax
consequences to you of the exchange of shares of common stock for cash pursuant to the merger in light of your particular
circumstances (including the application and effect of any state, local, or foreign income and other tax laws).

Appraisal Rights (Page 89 and Annex C)

Under Delaware law, holders of our common stock who do not vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement, who properly
demand appraisal of their shares of common stock and who otherwise comply with the requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL
will be entitled to seek appraisal for, and obtain payment in cash for the judicially determined fair value of, their shares of common
stock in lieu of receiving the merger consideration if the merger is completed, but only if they comply with all applicable
requirements of the DGCL. This value could be more than, the same as, or less than the merger consideration. Any holder of
common stock intending to exercise appraisal rights must deliver a written demand for appraisal to us prior to the vote on the
proposal to adopt the merger agreement and approve the transactions contemplated thereby, not vote in favor of the proposal to
adopt the merger agreement and approve the transactions contemplated thereby, and otherwise strictly comply with all of the
procedures required by Delaware law. The relevant provisions of the DGCL are included as Annex C to this proxy statement.
Please read these provisions carefully. Failure to strictly comply with these provisions will result in loss of the right of appraisal.

Completion of the Merger (Page 66)

We anticipate completing the merger no later than the end of the third calendar quarter of 2017. We cannot predict the exact timing
of the completion of the merger or whether the merger will be completed. In order to complete the merger, AMRI stockholders
must adopt the merger agreement and approve the transactions contemplated thereby at the special meeting and the other closing
conditions under the merger agreement, including receipt of required regulatory approvals, must be satisfied or, to the extent legally
permitted, waived.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE SPECIAL MEETING AND THE MERGER

The following questions and answers address briefly some questions you may have regarding the special meeting, the merger
agreement and the merger. These questions and answers may not address all questions that may be important to you as an AMRI
stockholder. Please refer to the more detailed information contained elsewhere in this proxy statement, the annexes to this proxy
statement, and the documents referred to in this proxy statement.

Q: Why am I receiving this proxy statement?

A: On June 5, 2017, AMRI entered into the merger agreement providing for the merger of Merger Sub, a wholly-owned subsidiary
of Parent, with and into AMRI, with AMRI surviving the merger as a subsidiary of Parent. You are receiving this proxy
statement in connection with the solicitation of proxies by our board in favor of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement and
approve the transactions contemplated thereby and the other matters to be voted on at the special meeting.

Q: What is the proposed transaction?

A: The proposed transaction is the merger of Merger Sub with and into AMRI pursuant to the merger agreement. Following the
effective time, AMRI would be privately held as a subsidiary of Parent.

Q: What will I receive in the merger?

A: If the merger is completed, you will be entitled to receive $21.75 in cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding
taxes, for each share of our common stock that you own. For example, if you own 100 shares of common stock, you will be
entitled to receive $2,175 in cash in exchange for your shares of common stock, less any applicable withholding taxes. You will
not be entitled to receive shares in the surviving corporation or any equity interests in Parent.

Q: Where and when is the special meeting?

A: The special meeting will take place at the offices of Goodwin Procter LLP, 100 Northern Avenue, Boston, MA 02210 on August
18, 2017, starting at 9:00AM, local time.

Q: What matters will be voted on at the special meeting?

A: You will be asked to consider and vote on the following proposals:

• a proposal to adopt the merger agreement and approve the transactions contemplated thereby;

• a proposal to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, specified compensation that may become payable to our named
executive officers in connection with the merger;

• a proposal to approve one or more adjournments of the special meeting, if necessary, to solicit additional proxies if there are
insufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the proposal to adopt the merger agreement and approve the
transactions contemplated thereby; and

• such other business as may properly come before the special meeting or any adjournment or postponement of the special
meeting by or at the direction of our board of directors.

We are not currently aware of any other business to come before the special meeting.

Q: What vote of our stockholders is required to adopt the merger agreement and approve the transactions contemplated
thereby?

A: Under Delaware law, stockholders holding at least a majority of the shares of common stock outstanding at the close of business
on the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to vote at the special meeting must vote “FOR” the proposal to
adopt the merger agreement and approve the transactions contemplated thereby. In addition, under the merger agreement, the
receipt of such required vote is a condition to the completion of the merger. A failure to vote your shares of common stock, an
abstention or broker non-vote will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the merger agreement and
approve the transactions contemplated thereby.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

As of July 10, 2017, the record date for the special meeting, there were 43,012,240 shares of our common stock outstanding and
entitled to vote at the special meeting.

Q: What is a quorum?

A: A quorum will be present if holders of a majority of the shares of our common stock outstanding on the record date are present
in person or represented by proxy at the special meeting. If a quorum is not present at the special meeting, the special meeting
may be adjourned or postponed from time to time until a quorum is obtained.

If you submit a proxy but abstain or fail to provide voting instructions on any of the proposals listed on the proxy card, your
shares will be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present at the special meeting.

If your shares are held in “street name” by your broker, bank, trust or other nominee and you do not tell the nominee how to
vote your shares, these shares will not be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present for the transaction
of business at the special meeting.

Q: What vote of our stockholders is required to approve other matters to be considered at the special meeting?

A: Approval of each of the advisory (non-binding) proposal on specified compensation that may become payable to AMRI’s named
executive officers in connection with the merger and the adjournment proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the
shares present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on such proposal at the special meeting. Under our bylaws,
abstentions will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” these proposals. Broker non-votes will have no effect on the voting
results for these proposals. Because all proposals for the special meeting are non-routine and non-discretionary, AMRI
anticipates that there will not be any broker non-votes.

Q: What happens if I do not vote?

A: The vote to adopt the merger agreement and approve the transactions contemplated thereby is based on the total number of
shares of our common stock outstanding on the record date, not just the shares that are voted. If you do not vote, it will have the
same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the merger agreement and approve the transactions contemplated
thereby.

Q: How does the board recommend that I vote?

A: Our board unanimously recommends that AMRI stockholders vote “FOR” the proposal to adopt the merger agreement and
approve the transactions contemplated thereby. The board further unanimously recommends that stockholders vote “FOR” the
advisory (non-binding) proposal to approve specified compensation that may become payable to the named executive officers of
AMRI in connection with the merger, and “FOR” the adjournment proposal.

Q: What effects will the merger have on AMRI?

A: Our common stock is currently registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (which we refer to as the
“Exchange Act”), and is quoted on the Nasdaq Global Market (which we refer to as the “Nasdaq”) under the symbol “AMRI.”
As a result of the merger, AMRI will cease to be a publicly-traded company and will become a subsidiary of Parent. Following
the merger, the registration of our common stock and our reporting obligations under the Exchange Act will be terminated. In
addition, upon completion of the merger, our common stock will no longer be listed on any stock exchange or quotation system,
including the Nasdaq.

Q: What happens if the merger is not completed?

A: If the merger agreement is not adopted by AMRI stockholders, or if the merger is not completed for any other reason, AMRI
stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of common stock in connection with the merger. Instead, we will
remain a public company and shares of our common stock will continue to be listed and traded on the Nasdaq. In addition,
under specified circumstances, AMRI may be required to pay Parent a termination fee.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Q: What will happen if stockholders do not approve the advisory proposal on specified compensation payable to AMRI’s
named executive officers in connection with the merger?

A: The approval of this proposal is not a condition to the completion of the merger. The vote on this proposal is an advisory vote
and will not be binding on AMRI or Parent. Further, the underlying plans and arrangements are contractual in nature and not, by
their terms, subject to stockholder approval. Therefore, regardless of whether AMRI stockholders approve this proposal, if the
merger is completed, the specified compensation will still be paid to AMRI’s named executive officers to the extent payable in
accordance with the terms of the merger agreement and pre-existing compensation and severance arrangements.

Q: What do I need to do now? How do I vote my shares of common stock?

A: We urge you to read this proxy statement carefully, including its annexes and the documents referred to in this proxy statement.
Your vote is important. If you are a stockholder of record, you can ensure that your shares are voted at the special meeting by
submitting your proxy by:

• mail, using the enclosed postage-paid envelope;

• telephone, using the toll-free number listed on each proxy card; or

• the Internet, at the address provided on each proxy card.

If you hold your shares in “street name” through a broker, bank, trust or other nominee, you should follow the directions
provided by your broker, bank, trust or other nominee regarding how to instruct your nominee to vote your shares. Without
those instructions, your shares will not be voted, which will have the same effect as voting “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt
the merger agreement and approve the transactions contemplated thereby.

Q: Can I revoke my proxy?

A: Yes. You can revoke your proxy at any time before the vote is taken at the special meeting. If you are a stockholder of record,
you may revoke your proxy by notifying AMRI’s Secretary in writing at Albany Molecular Research, Inc., 26 Corporate Circle,
Albany, NY 12203, Attn: Secretary, or by submitting a new proxy by telephone, the Internet or mail, in each case, dated after the
date of the proxy being revoked. In addition, you may revoke your proxy by attending the special meeting and voting in person
(simply attending the special meeting will not cause your proxy to be revoked). Please note that if you hold your shares in
“street name” and you have instructed a broker, bank, trust or other nominee to vote your shares, the above-described options for
revoking your voting instructions do not apply, and instead you must follow the instructions received from your broker, bank,
trust or other nominee to revoke your voting instructions or submit new voting instructions.

Q: Will my shares held in “street name” or another form of record ownership be combined for voting purposes with shares
I hold of record?

A: No. Because any shares you may hold in “street name” will be deemed to be held by a different stockholder than any shares you
hold of record, any shares so held will not be combined for voting purposes with shares you hold of record. Similarly, if you
own shares in various registered forms, such as jointly with your spouse, as trustee of a trust or as custodian for a minor, you
will receive, and will need to separately submit a proxy card for those shares because they are held in a different form of record
ownership. Shares held by a corporation or business entity must be voted by an authorized officer of the entity. Shares held in an
individual retirement account must be voted under the rules governing the account.

Q: What happens if I sell my shares of common stock before completion of the merger?

A: If you transfer your shares of common stock, you will have transferred your right to receive the merger consideration in the
merger. In order to receive the merger consideration, you must hold your shares of common stock through completion of the
merger.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

The record date for stockholders entitled to vote at the special meeting is earlier than the special meeting date and the closing of
the merger. So, if you transfer your shares of common stock after the record date but before the closing of the merger, you will
have transferred your right to receive the merger consideration in the merger, but retained the right to vote at the special
meeting. Additionally, if you transfer your shares of common stock after the record date but before the special meeting, you will
have transferred your right to receive the merger consideration in the merger but, unless special arrangements are made,
retained the right to vote at the special meeting.

Q: Should I send in my stock certificates or other evidence of ownership now?

A: No. After the merger is completed, you will receive a letter of transmittal from the exchange agent for the merger with detailed
written instructions for exchanging your shares of common stock for the merger consideration. If your shares of common stock
are held in “street name” by your broker, bank, trust or other nominee, you may receive instructions from your broker, bank,
trust or other nominee as to what action, if any, you need to take to effect the surrender of your “street name” shares in exchange
for the merger consideration. Please do not send in your certificates now.

Q: I do not know where my stock certificate is — how will I get the merger consideration for my shares?

A: If the merger is completed, the transmittal materials you will receive after the completion of the merger will include the
procedures that you must follow if you cannot locate your stock certificate. These procedures will include an affidavit that you
will need to sign attesting to the loss of your stock certificate. Parent may also require that you provide indemnity to the
surviving corporation in order to cover any potential loss.

Q: Am I entitled to exercise appraisal rights instead of receiving the merger consideration for my shares of common stock?

A: Stockholders who do not vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement and approve the transactions contemplated
thereby and otherwise comply with the requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL are entitled to statutory appraisal rights under
Delaware law if the merger is completed. This means that if you comply with the requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL, you
are entitled to have the “fair value” (as defined pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL) of your shares of common stock
determined by the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and to receive payment based on that valuation instead of
receiving the merger consideration. The ultimate amount you would receive in an appraisal proceeding may be more than, the
same as or less than the amount you would have received under the merger agreement. To exercise your appraisal rights, you
must strictly comply with the requirements of the DGCL. See “Appraisal Rights” and the text of the Delaware appraisal rights
statute, Section 262 of the DGCL, which is reproduced in its entirety as Annex C to this proxy statement. Please read it
carefully.

Q: Will I have to pay taxes on the merger consideration I receive?

A: If you are a U.S. holder, the receipt of cash in exchange for shares of common stock pursuant to the merger will be a taxable
transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. You should consult your own tax advisors regarding the particular tax
consequences to you of the exchange of shares of common stock for cash pursuant to the merger in light of your particular
circumstances (including the application and effect of any state, local, or foreign income and other tax laws).

Q: What does it mean if I get more than one proxy card or voting instruction card?

A: If your shares are registered differently or are held in more than one account, you will receive more than one proxy card or
voting instruction card. Please complete and return all of the proxy cards or voting instruction cards you receive (or submit each
of your proxies by telephone or the Internet, if available to you) to ensure that all of your shares are voted.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Q: Who is paying for this proxy solicitation?

A: Our directors, officers and employees may solicit proxies on our behalf in person, by telephone, email or facsimile. These
persons will not be paid additional remuneration for their efforts. AMRI has also engaged The Proxy Advisory Group, LLC to
assist in the solicitation of proxies and provide related advice and informational support, for a services fee, plus customary
disbursements, which are not expected to exceed $15,000 in total. AMRI will pay all expenses of filing, printing and mailing
this proxy statement, including solicitation expenses.

Q: What is householding and how does it affect me?

A: The Securities and Exchange Commission (which we refer to as the “SEC”) permits companies to send a single set of proxy
materials to any household at which two or more stockholders reside, unless contrary instructions have been received, but only
if the applicable company provides advance notice and follows certain procedures. In cases where contrary instructions have
been received, each stockholder continues to receive a separate notice of the meeting and proxy card. Certain brokerage firms
may have instituted householding for beneficial owners of common stock held through brokerage firms. If your family has
multiple accounts holding our common stock, you may have already received a householding notification from your broker.
Please contact your broker directly if you have any questions or require additional copies of this proxy statement. The broker
will arrange for delivery of a separate copy of this proxy statement promptly upon your written or oral request. You may decide
at any time to revoke your decision to household, and thereby receive multiple copies.

Q: Who can help answer my other questions?

A: If you have additional questions about the merger, or require assistance in submitting your proxy or voting your shares or need
additional copies of the proxy statement or the enclosed proxy card, please contact our proxy solicitor, The Proxy Advisory
Group, LLC, at:

The Proxy Advisory Group, LLC

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING
FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

This proxy statement, and the documents to which we refer you in this proxy statement, include “forward looking statements”
within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including, but not limited to, statements about the
expected timetable for completing the transaction; beliefs and expectations of AMRI, GTCR, and Carlyle about the proposed
acquisition of AMRI and their respective long-term vision for AMRI; expectations regarding the management, corporate structure,
projected results, and strategy of AMRI following the closing of the transaction; the expected impact of this transaction on AMRI’s
employees, customers, financial and operating results, and business; the anticipated funding for the transaction; and the timing of
the closing of the acquisition. The words “anticipates”, “believes”, “expects”, “may”, “plans”, “predicts”, “will”, “potential”,
“goal” and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements
contain these identifying words. Readers should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. AMRI’s actual
results may differ materially from such forward-looking statements as a result of numerous factors, some of which AMRI may not
be able to predict and may not be within AMRI’s control. Factors that could cause such differences include, but are not limited to,
(i) the risk that the proposed merger may not be completed in a timely manner, or at all, which may result in the payment of a
termination fee by AMRI and may adversely affect AMRI’s business and the price of its common stock, (ii) the failure to satisfy all
of the closing conditions of the proposed merger, including the adoption of the merger agreement by AMRI’s stockholders and the
receipt of certain governmental and regulatory approvals in foreign jurisdictions, (iii) the occurrence of any event, change, or other
circumstance that could give rise to the termination of the merger agreement, (iv) the effect of the announcement or pendency of
the proposed merger on AMRI’s business, operating results, and relationships with customers, suppliers, competitors, and others,
(v) risks that the proposed merger may disrupt AMRI’s current plans and business operations, (vi) potential difficulties retaining
employees as a result of the proposed merger, (vii) risks related to the diverting of management’s attention from AMRI’s ongoing
business operations, and (viii) the outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted against AMRI related to the merger
agreement or the proposed merger. In addition, AMRI’s actual performance and results may differ materially from those currently
anticipated due to a number of risks including, without limitation: changes in customers’ spending and demand and the trends in
pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies’ outsourcing of manufacturing services and research and development; AMRI’s
ability to provide quality and timely services and to compete with other companies providing similar services; AMRI’s ability to
comply with strict regulatory requirements; AMRI’s ability to successfully integrate past and future acquisitions and to realize the
expected benefits of each; disruptions in AMRI’s ability to source raw materials; a change in the AMRI’s relationships with its
largest customers; AMRI’s ability to service its indebtedness; AMRI’s ability to protect its technology and proprietary information
and the confidential information of its customers; AMRI’s ability to develop products of commercial value under its collaboration
arrangements; the risk of patent infringement and other litigation; as well as those risks discussed in AMRI’s Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on March 16,
2017, subsequent Quarterly Reports filed with the SEC and AMRI’s other SEC filings. Numerous factors, including those noted
above, may cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations. AMRI expressly disclaims any current intention or
obligation to update any forward-looking statement in this proxy statement to reflect future events or changes in facts affecting the
forward-looking statements contained in this proxy statement.

THE SPECIAL MEETING

Date, Time, and Place of the Special Meeting

This proxy statement is being furnished to our stockholders as part of the solicitation of proxies by our board of directors for use at
the special meeting to be held at the offices of Goodwin Procter LLP, 100 Northern Avenue, Boston, MA, 02210 on August 18,
2017 at 9:00AM, local time, or at any adjournment or postponement of such meeting. This proxy statement is first being mailed to
our stockholders on or about July 18, 2017.

Purpose of the Special Meeting

The purpose of the special meeting is for our stockholders to consider and vote upon the proposal to adopt the merger agreement
and approve the transactions contemplated thereby. AMRI stockholders must adopt the merger agreement and approve the
transactions contemplated thereby for the merger to be completed. A copy of the merger agreement is attached to this proxy
statement as Annex A and the material provisions of the merger agreement are described under “The Merger Agreement.” AMRI
stockholders are also being asked to approve one or more adjournments of the special meeting, if necessary, to solicit additional
proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to adopt the merger agreement and approve the transactions
contemplated thereby.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

In addition, in accordance with Section 14A of the Exchange Act, we are providing stockholders with the opportunity to cast an
advisory (non-binding) vote on specified compensation that may be payable to AMRI’s named executive officers in connection
with the merger, the value of which is disclosed in the table in the section of the proxy statement entitled “The Merger (Proposal
1) — Interests of AMRI’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger — “Golden Parachute” Compensation for AMRI’s Named
Executive Officers.” The vote on specified compensation that may become payable in connection with the merger is a vote separate
and apart from the vote to adopt the merger agreement and approve the transactions contemplated thereby. Accordingly, a
stockholder may vote to approve the adoption of the merger agreement and vote not to approve the specified compensation and vice
versa. Because the compensation vote is advisory in nature only, it will not be binding on either AMRI or Parent. Accordingly,
because AMRI is contractually obligated to pay the specified compensation, such compensation will be payable, subject only to the
conditions applicable to such payment, if the merger is completed and regardless of the outcome of the advisory vote.

Record Date and Quorum

The holders of record of our common stock as of the close of business on July 10, 2017, the record date for the special meeting, are
entitled to receive notice of and to vote at the special meeting. All holders of our common stock will vote together as a single class,
and each stockholder is entitled to one vote for each share of common stock held on the record date. On the record date, 43,012,240
shares of common stock were outstanding and entitled to vote at the special meeting.

The presence at the special meeting, in person or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of shares of common stock outstanding on
the record date will constitute a quorum, permitting AMRI to conduct its business at the special meeting. Treasury shares, which
are shares owned by AMRI itself, are not voted and do not count for this purpose. Proxies received but not marked or marked as
abstentions will be included in the calculation of the number of shares considered to be present at the special meeting. Because all
proposals for the special meeting are non-routine and non-discretionary, AMRI does not anticipate any broker non-votes in
connection with the special meeting. See “— Voting; Proxies; Revocation — Submitting a Proxy or Providing Voting
Instructions — Shares Held in “Street Name”” below.

Required Vote

For AMRI to complete the merger, under Delaware law, stockholders holding at least a majority of the shares of common stock
outstanding at the close of business on the record date must vote “FOR” the proposal to adopt the merger agreement and approve
the transactions contemplated thereby. A failure to vote your shares of common stock, an abstention or broker non-vote will have
the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the merger agreement and approve the transactions contemplated
thereby.

Approval of each of the advisory (non-binding) proposal on specified compensation which may become payable to AMRI’s named
executive officers in connection with the merger and the adjournment proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the
shares present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on such proposal at the special meeting. Under our bylaws,
abstentions will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the advisory (non-binding) proposal on specified compensation and
the adjournment proposal. Broker non-votes will have no effect on the voting results for these proposals.

Voting by AMRI’s Directors and Executive Officers

The directors and executive officers of AMRI have informed AMRI that, as of the date of this proxy statement, they intend to vote
in favor of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, although none of them has an obligation to do so. At the close of business
on the record date, our directors and executive officers owned, in the aggregate, approximately 13.9% of the outstanding common
stock of AMRI entitled to vote at the special meeting.

Voting; Proxies; Revocation

Attendance.  All holders of shares of common stock as of the close of business on July 10, 2017, the record date for voting at the
special meeting, including stockholders of record and beneficial owners of common stock registered in the “street name” of a
broker, bank, trust or other nominee, are invited to attend the special meeting. If you are a stockholder of record, please be prepared
to provide proper identification, such

TABLE OF CONTENTS

as a driver’s license. If you hold your shares in “street name,” you will need to provide proof of ownership, such as a recent account
statement or voting instruction form provided by your broker, bank, trust, or other nominee or other similar evidence of ownership,
along with proper identification.

Voting in Person.  Stockholders of record will be able to vote in person at the special meeting. If you are not a stockholder of
record, but instead hold your shares in “street name” through a broker, bank, trust or other nominee, you must provide a proxy
executed in your favor from your broker, bank, trust or other nominee in order to be able to vote in person at the special meeting.

Submitting a Proxy or Providing Voting Instructions.  To ensure that your shares are voted at the special meeting, we recommend
that you provide voting instructions promptly by proxy, even if you plan to attend the special meeting in person.

• Shares Held by Record Holder.  If you are a stockholder of record, you may submit a proxy using one of the methods
described below.

• Submit a Proxy by Telephone or via the Internet.  This proxy statement is accompanied by a proxy card with instructions for
submitting voting instructions. You may vote by telephone by calling the toll-free number or via the Internet by accessing
the Internet address as specified on the enclosed proxy card. Your shares will be voted as you direct in the same manner as
if you had completed, signed, dated, and returned your proxy card, as described below.

• Submit a Proxy Card.  If you complete, sign, date, and return the enclosed proxy card by mail so that it is received in time
for the special meeting, your shares will be voted in the manner directed by you on your proxy card.

If you sign, date, and return your proxy card without indicating how you wish to vote on a proposal, your proxy will be
voted in accordance with our board’s recommendation — i.e., in favor of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement and
approve the transactions contemplated thereby, the advisory (non-binding) proposal to approve specified compensation that
may become payable to the named executive officers of AMRI in connection with the merger, and the adjournment
proposal. If you are a stockholder of record and fail to return your proxy card, unless you attend the special meeting and vote in
person, the effect will be that your shares will not be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present at the
special meeting and will have the same effect as a vote against the proposal to adopt the merger agreement and approve the
transactions contemplated thereby, but will not affect the other proposals.

• Shares Held in “Street Name”.  If your shares of common stock are held in “street name,” you will receive instructions
from your broker, bank, trust or other nominee that you must follow in order to have your shares voted. Your broker, bank,
trust or other nominee will vote your shares only if you provide instructions on how to vote. Please follow the directions on
the voting instruction form sent to you by your broker, bank, trust or other nominee with this proxy statement. If you have
not received such voting instructions or require further information regarding such voting instructions, contact your broker,
bank, trust or other nominee, as the case may be. Brokers who hold shares of common stock in “street name” for a
beneficial owner of those shares typically have the authority to vote in their discretion on “routine” proposals when they
have not received instructions from the beneficial owner. However, brokers are not allowed to exercise their voting
discretion with respect to the approval of matters that are “non-routine,” such as adoption of the merger agreement, without
specific instructions from the beneficial owner. Broker non-votes are shares held by a broker or other nominee that are
present in person or represented at the meeting, but with respect to which the broker or other nominee is not instructed by
the beneficial owner of such shares to vote on the particular proposal and the broker does not have discretionary voting
power on such proposal. Because all proposals for the special meeting are non-routine and non-discretionary, AMRI
anticipates that there will not be any broker non-votes.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Revocation of Proxies.  Any person giving a proxy pursuant to this solicitation has the power to revoke and change it any time
before it is voted. If you are a stockholder of record, you may revoke your proxy at any time before the vote is taken at the special
meeting by:

• submitting a new proxy with a later date, by using the telephone or Internet proxy submission procedures described above,
or by completing, signing, dating, and returning a new proxy card by mail to AMRI;

• attending the special meeting and voting in person; or

• delivering to the Secretary of AMRI a written notice of revocation c/o Albany Molecular Research, Inc., 26 Corporate
Circle, Albany, New York 12203, Attn: Secretary.

Attending the special meeting without taking one of the actions described above will not in itself revoke your proxy. Please note
that if you want to revoke your proxy by mailing a new proxy card to AMRI or by sending a written notice of revocation to AMRI,
you should ensure that you send your new proxy card or written notice of revocation in sufficient time for it to be received by
AMRI before the special meeting.

If you hold your shares in “street name” through a bank, broker, trust or other nominee, you will need to follow the instructions
provided to you by your bank, broker, trust or other nominee in order to revoke your voting instructions or submit new voting
instructions.

Adjournments and Postponements

Although it is not currently expected, the special meeting may be adjourned or postponed for the purpose of soliciting additional
proxies. We are submitting a proposal for consideration at the special meeting to authorize the named proxies to approve one or
more adjournments of the special meeting if there are not sufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement and approve the
transactions contemplated thereby at the time of the special meeting. The adjournment proposal relates only to an adjournment of
the special meeting for purposes of soliciting additional proxies to obtain the requisite stockholder approval to adopt the merger
agreement and approve the transactions contemplated thereby. AMRI retains full authority to the extent set forth in its bylaws and
Delaware law to adjourn the special meeting for any other purpose, or to postpone the special meeting before it is convened,
without the consent of any AMRI stockholder.

If the special meeting is adjourned, we are not required to give notice of the time and place of the adjourned meeting if announced
at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken, unless the adjournment is for more than 30 days or our board fixes a new record
date for the special meeting. At any adjourned meeting, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the
original meeting. All proxies will be voted in the same manner as they would have been voted at the original convening of the
special meeting, except for any proxies that have been effectively revoked or withdrawn prior to the time the proxy is voted at the
reconvened meeting.

Solicitation of Proxies

Our directors, officers, and employees may solicit proxies on our behalf in person, by telephone, email or facsimile. These persons
will not be paid additional remuneration for their efforts. AMRI has also engaged The Proxy Advisory Group, LLC to assist in the
solicitation of proxies and provide related advice and informational support, for a services fee, plus customary disbursements,
which are not expected to exceed $15,000 in total. We also will request brokers and other fiduciaries to forward proxy solicitation
material to the beneficial owners of shares of common stock that the brokers and fiduciaries hold of record. Upon request, we will
reimburse them for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses. AMRI will pay all expenses of filing, printing, and mailing this proxy
statement, including solicitation expenses.

Stockholder List

A list of AMRI stockholders entitled to vote at the special meeting will be available for inspection at the special meeting and for ten
days prior to the special meeting for any purpose germane to the special meeting, between the hours of 8:45 a.m. and 4:30 p.m.,

THE MERGER (PROPOSAL 1)

General

If the merger agreement is adopted by AMRI stockholders and all other conditions to the closing of the merger are either satisfied
or waived, Merger Sub will be merged with and into AMRI with AMRI being the surviving corporation in the merger. Upon the
completion of the merger, each share of common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time (other than
shares owned by Parent, Merger Sub, or AMRI and certain of their affiliates, and shares held by stockholders who have perfected
their statutory rights of appraisal under the DGCL) will be converted into the right to receive $21.75 in cash, without interest and
less any applicable withholding taxes.

Our common stock is currently registered under the Exchange Act and is quoted on the Nasdaq under the symbol “AMRI.” As a
result of the merger, AMRI will cease to be a publicly-traded company and will become a subsidiary of Parent. Following the
completion of the merger, the registration of our common stock and our reporting obligations under the Exchange Act will be
terminated. In addition, upon the completion of the merger, our common stock will no longer be listed on any stock exchange or
quotation system, including the Nasdaq.

Background of the Merger

The following chronology summarizes the key meetings and events that led to the signing of the merger agreement. The following
chronology does not purport to catalogue every conversation among our board, the Special Committee, members of our
management or our representatives and other parties.

Our board of directors and senior management periodically review our long-term strategy and objectives in light of developments
in the markets and industries in which we operate. This process has included evaluating prospects and options pertaining to our
business, such as organic growth initiatives, possible acquisitions, investments in our company, and potential business combination
transactions, in each case with a view towards enhancing stockholder value. In addition, from time to time, we have received
unsolicited inquiries from various parties who have expressed a desire to discuss whether there would be mutual interest in a
potential strategic transaction with our company.

In early 2016, representatives of each of GTCR and Party A, another private equity firm, separately and on an unsolicited basis
informally approached and had brief meetings with representatives of AMRI and expressed their respective potential interest in
exploring a possible business transaction, including a potential financing transaction, with AMRI. After the meetings with GTCR
and Party A, no further discussions took place with respect to a potential financing transaction of us, and furthermore, we indicated
that we were not interested in exploring a possible sale of AMRI but rather were focused on taking steps to enhance stockholder
value by executing on our business plan although we would consider all proposals made to us. Although a confidentiality
agreement, including customary non-disclosure and standstill provisions that allowed each of GTCR and Party A to make
confidential proposals to us at any time after the public announcement by AMRI of a transaction, was executed with GTCR on
March 16, 2016 and was executed with Party A on March 23, 2016, no specific proposals were made by either GTCR or Party A
during these meetings. In addition, in January 2017, representatives of Party D, another private equity firm, had brief meetings with
representatives of AMRI and expressed their respective potential interest in exploring a potential financing transaction with AMRI.
A confidentiality agreement, including a customary non-disclosure and standstill provisions, was executed with Party D on January
24, 2017, however, no specific proposals by Party D were made during these meetings and we did not pursue a financing
transaction with Party D or any other potential investor.

Throughout 2016 and early 2017, our management and our board of directors from time to time discussed various alternatives in
which to finance our strategic plans, including funding future acquisitions that we believed would lead to desired levels of growth
for our business and increase value for stockholders, the fact that our outstanding convertible notes would mature in 2018 and a
restructuring of our outstanding indebtedness would be required in order to meet our obligations under our contractual
arrangements, and our ability to compete with other participants in the industry on a standalone basis.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

During a regularly scheduled meeting of the board of directors held on February 8, 2017, our board of directors discussed recent
merger and acquisition activity in the industry, as well as the challenges facing AMRI, including our ability to access capital to
fund acquisitions, the pending maturity of our outstanding notes and related indebtedness obligations, and efforts to diversify our
suite of service offerings and customer base and our capacity to compete with evolving technologies in the industry. In light of the
considerations and risks confronting us, our board of directors discussed the advisability of retaining a financial advisor to assist the
board in exploring whether interest existed among potential buyers for a transaction involving the sale of AMRI. Our board of
directors discussed reasons for exploring a sale of AMRI at this time, which included the potential ability to provide greater value
to our stockholders than the potential value to be achieved by continuing to pursue our business plan. The board also discussed the
risks involved in exploring a potential sale, including the risk that potential buyers who were also competitors or potential
competitors in our industry might use information obtained from us to solicit our employees and customers, the risk that a leak
regarding a possible transaction could disrupt our relationships with our customers, partners and employees, and the potential need
to disclose sensitive, proprietary and confidential information to these competitors and potential competitors. Representatives of
Goodwin Procter LLP (“Goodwin”), our external corporate counsel, led a discussion regarding the fiduciary duties of the directors
in the context of their consideration of strategic alternatives, including a stand-alone strategy, a potential significant investment in
AMRI by one or more financial sponsors, and the potential sale of AMRI to a third party. In executive session, our board of
directors discussed forming a special committee of independent and disinterested directors (the “Special Committee”) to review
any strategic alternatives, and to make a recommendation to the full board of directors as to the advisability of pursuing any such
strategic alternatives. Our board of directors noted that, although there were no known actual conflicts at the time, because of the
potential for conflicts of interest with our management as well as with our significant stockholders who have board representation
to arise in the context of a potential sale to a financial sponsor, it would be prudent to form a Special Committee of independent and
disinterested directors to direct the strategic process on behalf of our board of directors. Our board approved the formation of the
Special Committee consisting of David Deming (Chairman), Kevin O’Connor, Kenneth P. Hagen, and Anthony J. Maddaluna. Our
board authorized the Special Committee to consider and evaluate any proposals that might be received by us regarding a potential
sale transaction, participate in and direct the negotiation of the material terms and conditions of any such transaction, and
recommend to our board of directors the advisability of entering into any such transaction or pursuing another strategic alternative
should any be presented to AMRI. Throughout the Special Committee’s evaluation of a potential sale of AMRI, the Special
Committee conducted formal meetings, but its members were also in regular informal communication with AMRI’s legal and
financial advisors and with each other. In addition, the Special Committee, as well as the board, frequently met in executive session
with only the independent directors and outside counsel present.

Following the conclusion of the February 8, 2017 board of directors meeting, the Special Committee met to discuss the advisability
of engaging a financial advisor to assist the Special Committee in its evaluation of a potential sale transaction, and decided that,
based on the investment banking firms’ familiarity with AMRI and the industry in which it operates, Mr. Deming should contact
Credit Suisse and another investment bank about a possible engagement as the Special Committee’s financial advisor in connection
with a potential sale.

On February 21, 2017, the Company announced its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2016 and its financial
outlook for fiscal year 2017. The results for the full year 2016 were below the previous guidance provided by the Company on
November 8, 2016. On February 21, 2017, AMRI’s common stock price closed at $16.39, down from $18.61 or approximately
12% from the previous day’s close.

On February 21, 2017, the Special Committee met with representatives of Credit Suisse and another investment banking firm in
New York, New York. On February 24, 2017, the Special Committee again met telephonically with Credit Suisse. During these
meetings Credit Suisse described its qualifications and provided preliminary perspectives regarding AMRI and potential
considerations in the event AMRI wanted to pursue a sale, including a preliminary list of potential acquirers of AMRI based on,
among other things, such parties’ industry focus, acquisition experience and perceived ability to finance a potential acquisition of
AMRI. The preliminary list of potential acquirers prepared by Credit Suisse included strategic parties and financial sponsors,
including GTCR, Party A, and Party D as well as others that had previously engaged in preliminary, high-level conversations with
us without proceeding to any discussions under, or entering into, a

confidentiality agreement. Credit Suisse also discussed with the Special Committee various sale process alternatives, including a
pre-signing market-check and the possible use of a “go shop” (i.e., the right to actively solicit alternative acquisition proposals for a
specified period following execution of a definitive agreement). Credit Suisse was then excused from the meeting and
representatives of Goodwin reviewed with the Special Committee the fiduciary duties of the directors in the context of considering
a potential sale of AMRI. Following that discussion, the Special Committee considered the experience and qualifications of Credit
Suisse and discussed information provided by Credit Suisse at the request of the Special Committee regarding Credit Suisse’s
material investment banking relationships with certain potential acquirers of AMRI. Following further discussion with the
assistance of Goodwin, the Special Committee then determined to engage Credit Suisse to assist the Special Committee in its
review of strategic alternatives. The Special Committee based its decision on Credit Suisse’s familiarity with AMRI and the
industry in which it operates, and its qualifications, reputation and experience in the valuation of businesses and securities in
connection with mergers and acquisitions generally and its experience advising boards of directors and special committees in
connection with the sales of public companies, as well as the Special Committee’s belief that, notwithstanding its disclosed
relationships with potential acquirors, Credit Suisse would be able to provide the Special Committee with objective advice. The
Special Committee instructed management, with the assistance of Goodwin, to negotiate an engagement letter with Credit Suisse.

Between February 25, 2017 and March 3, 2017, AMRI and Credit Suisse negotiated the terms of an engagement letter to be entered
into with Credit Suisse, and on March 3, 2017, we retained Credit Suisse effective as of February 26, 2017, at the direction of the
Special Committee, pursuant to a formal engagement letter to act as the Special Committee’s financial advisor in connection with
its evaluation of strategic alternatives, including a potential sale of AMRI.

On February 25, 2017, Credit Suisse was authorized by the Special Committee to contact five financial sponsors, including GTCR,
Party A, Party B, Party C, and Party D, and on or about February 27, 2017, representatives of Credit Suisse contacted each of
GTCR, Party, A, Party B, Party C and Party D to solicit their potential interest in an acquisition of AMRI. The Special Committee,
after consulting with Credit Suisse, believed that these five parties were the most likely to be interested in acquiring us at a price
the Special Committee would deem attractive based on their perceived potential interest in us as a result of prior discussions held
with or unsolicited inquiries that we had received from such parties with respect to a potential strategic transaction. While reserving
the ability to expand the process to include other potential bidders as the Special Committee deemed necessary and appropriate, the
Special Committee believed that approaching these five parties was reasonably likely to result in a robust sale process. At the
direction of the Special Committee, Credit Suisse provided these parties with our form of confidentiality agreement. On February
25, 2017, we executed an amendment to the confidentiality agreement with GTCR, and on February 25, 2017, we executed an
amendment to the confidentiality agreement with Party A, in each case to extend the length of the standstill provision but all other
terms, including the non-disclosure provisions, remained unchanged. On March 2, 2017, we entered into a confidentiality
agreement with Party B. On March 13, 2017, we entered into a confidentiality agreement with Party C. Each agreement included
customary non-disclosure and standstill provisions that allowed each of Party B and Party C to make confidential proposals to us at
any time after the public announcement by AMRI of a transaction.

On March 3, 2017, the Special Committee met telephonically with members of management and representatives of Credit Suisse
and Goodwin present for a portion of the meeting by invitation of the Special Committee. The Special Committee, with the
assistance of Credit Suisse and input from management, discussed whether to expand the universe of parties to be contacted beyond
GTCR, Party A, Party B, Party C and Party D to include additional parties with relevant acquisition experience or that had
expressed an interest in acquiring businesses similar to AMRI. In that regard, the Special Committee discussed approaching
additional parties based upon those parties the Special Committee believed had the strongest potential to have an interest in
engaging in a strategic transaction with AMRI. In determining potential likely acquirors, the Special Committee considered such
parties’ financial strength, their experience in acquiring companies of the size and complexity of AMRI (including by virtue of
AMRI’s international footprint), such parties’ perceived potential interest in AMRI, the parties’ access to cash or debt and equity
financing, industry focus and the parties’ ability to move quickly in light of the Special Committee’s concern over the potential
adverse effect

on AMRI’s business that could result from a protracted process. Guided by the foregoing principles, the Special Committee
discussed which potential acquirors would most likely be able to make proposals to acquire AMRI at an attractive price. The
Special Committee again noted that any potential buyer must demonstrate financial capacity to complete an acquisition of a
company of AMRI’s size and the ability to proceed expeditiously in order to mitigate the risks associated with a protracted
evaluation process. The Special Committee also again discussed reasons for exploring a sale of AMRI at this time, and the risks
inherent in so doing, particularly the risk that potential buyers who were also competitors or potential competitors in our industry
might use information obtained from us to solicit our employees and customers, the risk that a leak regarding a possible transaction
could disrupt our relationships with customers, partners and employees, and the potential need to disclose sensitive, proprietary and
confidential information to these competitors and potential competitors. The Special Committee also considered the industry
participants that, in its judgment, would likely be uninterested or lack the capacity to acquire AMRI. In light of the concerns
discussed, and the Special Committee’s belief that a post-signing go-shop process may also be available if in fact other industry
participants were interested, the Special Committee concluded that exploratory discussions should not include other companies in
our industry at this time in the process, and that contacts should be made only with a limited number of financial sponsors. At the
conclusion of this discussion, the Special Committee determined to approach a total of nine parties, inclusive of GTCR, Carlyle,
Party A, Party B, Party C, Party D, Party F, and two other private equity firms, all of whom were financial sponsors who had
previously acquired companies in the global pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical industries and, as a result, the Special
Committee believed were most likely qualified buyers. The Special Committee also discussed with Credit Suisse and Goodwin a
potential timeline for a sale process. Additionally, the Special Committee authorized the management team and representatives of
Credit Suisse to provide each financial sponsor with limited access to AMRI confidential information via a virtual data room once a
confidentiality agreement had been executed with AMRI. At this meeting, Mr. Marth provided an update to the Special Committee
with respect to the financial condition of the business and general operations, including a discussion regarding the impact of the
matters discussed on the investor conference call regarding AMRI’s 2016 fourth quarter results and 2017 guidance. Following Mr.
Marth’s departure from the meeting, the Special Committee discussed further AMRI’s operations, financial position, maturity of its
outstanding convertible notes and risks to AMRI’s standalone business plan.

Following the March 3, 2017 Special Committee meeting, Credit Suisse continued to solicit interest from GTCR, Party A, Party B,
Party C and Party D regarding a potential strategic transaction with AMRI. Credit Suisse also sought to contact each of the four
additional financial sponsors identified by the Special Committee, one of which was Carlyle. Of these four additional parties, two
indicated that they did not wish to participate in the process because they did not believe that they could ultimately offer a proposal
that would be acceptable to the Special Committee. Carlyle and Party F indicated that they were considering the opportunity and
would contact Credit Suisse with a more definitive response as to their level of interest. Each of GTCR, Party A, Party B, Party C
and Party D continued to express an interest in exploring a potential strategic transaction with us and were granted limited due
diligence access.

Between March 3, 2017 and April 4, 2017, at the direction of the Special Committee, Credit Suisse coordinated meetings and
telephone calls between our management and eight financial sponsors. Although the Special Committee instructed management,
with the assistance of Credit Suisse, to provide information that was requested by the parties in conducting their business diligence
and to prepare a virtual data room containing materials that would enable a potential buyer to undertake comprehensive due
diligence, the Special Committee decided that until initial indications of interest were received containing terms that the Special
Committee believed could lead to a proposal in the best interests of AMRI stockholders, the Special Committee was not prepared to
provide more complete access to our competitively sensitive information.

Between March 4, 2017 and April 4, 2017, following speculation in the industry and financial sponsor community regarding a
potential sale of AMRI, 12 additional financial sponsors, including Party G, contacted Credit Suisse to inquire about AMRI and a
potential sale process. After discussions with these parties, some of them indicated that they were not interested in engaging in
additional discussions with AMRI or

representatives of Credit Suisse pursuant to a confidentiality agreement, and ultimately, the Special Committee authorized Party E,
a financial sponsor, to be granted access to confidential information and management meetings.

On March 8, 2017, the Special Committee met to review and discuss the proposed management presentation to be provided to
participating financial sponsors who would be scheduled to meet with the AMRI management team as part of their due diligence
investigation. Members of management and representatives of Credit Suisse and Goodwin were present for a portion of the meeting
at the invitation of the Special Committee. The Special Committee discussed with management and endorsed the long-term
financial forecast outlined in the management presentation (see “— Projected Financial Information”). Representatives of Credit
Suisse provided an update to the Special Committee regarding the status of discussions with the parties that had expressed an
interest in acquiring AMRI and outreach efforts by Credit Suisse to the other financial sponsors at the direction of the Special
Committee as potential acquirers. The Special Committee also discussed the proposed timing for the committee’s evaluation of any
proposals that might be received from the potentially interested parties.

In the morning on March 10, 2017, members of management of GTCR and AMRI met in Waltham, MA, and in the afternoon on
March 10, 2017, members of management of Party B and AMRI met in Waltham, MA, in each case to conduct business,
operational, financial, regulatory and legal diligence meetings. At these meetings, our management, with representatives of Credit
Suisse present, also provided an overview of AMRI’s business and operations. No party made any proposals during these meetings
or otherwise discussed the specific terms of a potential sale transaction.

On March 10, 2017, we executed a confidentiality agreement with Party F, which agreement included customary non-disclosure
and standstill provisions that allow Party F to make confidential proposals to us at any time after the public announcement by
AMRI of a transaction.

On March 13, 2017, members of management of Party C and AMRI met in Waltham, MA, to conduct business, operational,
financial, regulatory and legal diligence meetings. At this meeting, our management, with representatives of Credit Suisse present,
also provided an overview of AMRI’s business and operations. Party C did not make any proposals during this meeting or
otherwise discuss the specific terms of a potential sale transaction.

On March 15, 2017, Credit Suisse provided Goodwin for purposes of sharing with our Special Committee information regarding
Credit Suisse’s material investment banking relationships with certain parties, including GTCR, that had expressed an interest in
pursuing an acquisition of AMRI.

In the morning on March 16, 2017, members of management of Party F and AMRI met in Waltham, MA, and in the afternoon on
March 16, 2017, members of management of Party D and AMRI met in Waltham, MA, in each case to conduct business,
operational, financial, regulatory and legal diligence meetings. At these meetings, our management, with representatives of Credit
Suisse present, also provided an overview of AMRI’s business and operations. No party made any proposals during these meetings
or otherwise discussed the specific terms of a potential sale transaction.

On March 17, 2017, members of management of Party A and AMRI met in Waltham, MA, to conduct business, operational,
financial, regulatory and legal diligence meetings. At this meeting, our management, with representatives of Credit Suisse present,
also provided an overview of AMRI’s business and operations. Party A did not make any proposals during this meeting or
otherwise discuss the specific terms of a potential sale transaction.

On March 19, 2017, representatives of Party E contacted Credit Suisse regarding its potential interest in participating in a
management presentation with the management of AMRI. Following this discussion, on March 22, 2017, we entered into a
confidentiality agreement with Party E. The agreement included customary non-disclosure and standstill provisions that allowed
Party E to make confidential proposals to us at any time after the public announcement by AMRI of a transaction.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

On March 20, 2017, the Special Committee held a telephonic meeting with members of management and representatives of Credit
Suisse and Goodwin present for a portion of the meeting by the invitation of the Special Committee. The Special Committee
discussed the preliminary and introductory discussions that management had undertaken with each of the six parties who had
entered into confidentiality agreements with AMRI and participated in management presentations to date. The Special Committee,
with the assistance of Credit Suisse, discussed the proposed timeline for the sale process and the desire of the Special Committee to
not have a protracted process that would risk harm to the business and customer relationships. The Special Committee also
discussed whether to allow the interested parties to engage with their potential sources of equity and debt financing and concluded
that such discussions should not be permitted at this stage of the process because, in the judgment of the Special Committee,
expanding the scope of industry participants who are informed about our consideration of a potential strategic transaction increased
the likelihood of a leak. The Special Committee instructed Credit Suisse to send a bid instruction letter to each of the six interested
parties that had executed a confidentiality agreement with AMRI and participated in a management presentation. The Special
Committee discussed setting a firm deadline of April 4, 2017 for such parties to submit initial indications of interest and to
distribute a formal process letter to such parties with instructions for such submissions. The Special Committee planned to evaluate
the initial indications of interest and then determine whether to proceed further with the proposed transaction.

On March 21, 2017, as instructed by the Special Committee, Credit Suisse distributed a bid instruction letter to each of GTCR,
Party A, Party B, Party C, Party D and Party F requesting that each party submit a detailed proposal for an acquisition of AMRI by
April 4, 2017, addressing, among other things, price and form of consideration, valuation, sources and structures of financing,
material conditions, including required approvals, and focus areas for due diligence.

On March 22, 2017, representatives of Carlyle contacted Credit Suisse to communicate its interest in meeting with the management
team of AMRI and participating in our sale process. We entered into a confidentiality agreement with Carlyle on March 26, 2017.
The agreement included customary non-disclosure and standstill provisions that allowed Carlyle to make confidential proposals to
us at any time.

In the morning on March 27, 2017, members of management of Party E and AMRI met in Waltham, MA, and in the afternoon on
March 27, members of management of Carlyle and AMRI met in Waltham, MA, in each case to conduct business, operational,
financial, regulatory and legal diligence meetings. At these meetings, our management, with representatives of Credit Suisse
present, also provided an overview of AMRI’s business and operations. No party made any proposals during this meeting or
otherwise discussed the specific terms of a potential sale transaction. As instructed by the Special Committee, Credit Suisse
subsequently provided each of Party E and Carlyle with the same bid instruction letter.

On April 3, 2017, prior to the initial indication of interest deadline, representatives of each of Party A and Party C called Credit
Suisse to indicate that they would not be submitting an indication of interest. Party A indicated it had a general reluctance to
expend resources to participate in a competitive process where it did not believe it would be able to differentiate itself with respect
to price. Party C declined to submit an indication of interest because it did not believe it would be able to differentiate itself with
respect to price.

On April 4, 2017, Credit Suisse provided Goodwin for purposes of sharing with our Special Committee information regarding
Credit Suisse’s material investment banking relationships with certain additional parties, including Carlyle, that had expressed an
interest in pursuing an acquisition of AMRI.

Later on April 4, 2017, five parties submitted indications of interest. Party B submitted a written indication of interest with an all-
cash purchase price in the range of $17.00 to $18.00 per share. Party D submitted a written indication of interest with an all-cash
purchase price in the range of $17.00 to $19.00 per share. Carlyle submitted a written indication of interest with an all-cash
purchase price in the range of $19.00 to $21.00 per share. Party E submitted a written indication of interest with an all-cash
purchase price in the range of $21.00 to $23.00 per share. GTCR submitted a written indication of interest with an all-cash
purchase price in the range of $21.00 to $23.00 per share. None of the written indication of interests requested exclusivity, but each
had conditions that must be satisfied prior to entering into a potential transaction. In addition, all of the indications of interest
indicated that each party intended to finance the merger consideration with a combination of third-party debt and equity capital
from its own managed funds and

affiliates. After receipt of the written indication of interests, on April 4, 2017, as requested by the Special Committee,
representatives of Credit Suisse separately informed each of Carlyle, Party B and Party D by telephone that it had not submitted the
highest all-cash purchase price per share and that the Special Committee would be holding a meeting on April 6, 2017 to assess the
indications of interest that had been received from various parties. During the telephone call between Credit Suisse and Carlyle on
April 4, 2017, Carlyle orally indicated it was willing to increase its proposed price to $20.00 to $22.00 per share, and the remainder
of its indication of interest remained the same. Following the telephone call between Credit Suisse and Party D, on April 5, 2017,
Party D resubmitted a written indication of interest with an increased all-cash purchase price of $18.00 to $20.00 per share. Other
than to increase its proposed price to $18.00 to $20.00 per share, Party D’s proposal was the same as its initial indication of interest.

In addition, on April 4, 2017, Party G reached out to Credit Suisse to inquire about industry and media speculation regarding a
potential sale of AMRI. On April 5, 2017, there was a follow-up discussion between representatives of Credit Suisse and Party G
during which Credit Suisse confirmed that the Special Committee was in advanced discussions with several parties, which was a
similar message given to other financial sponsors who had contacted representatives of Credit Suisse as a result of industry and
media speculation. On April 6, 2017, Party G sent an email to Credit Suisse requesting contact with the members of the Credit
Suisse team who were assisting us with a potential sale transaction and ultimately a call was scheduled for April 9, 2017.

On April 5, 2017, representatives of Party F called Credit Suisse to indicate that it would not be submitting an indication of interest
because of a general reluctance to expend resources to participate in a competitive process where they did not believe they could
prevail on value.

In the early evening of April 5, 2017, Debtwire published an article (the “Debtwire Article”) disclosing that AMRI had hired Credit
Suisse to assist AMRI in exploring a possible sale transaction and that the process was in its early stages with valuation and
leverage views still in flux. Neither Credit Suisse nor AMRI responded to inquiries by Debtwire, either before or after the release of
the Debtwire Article.

Following the publication of the Debtwire Article, we were contacted, either directly or through Credit Suisse, by five strategic
industry participants. After follow-up communications by representatives of Credit Suisse as requested by the Special Committee,
two of these strategic industry participants indicated that they were not interested in participating in a competitive process because,
based on their assumptions regarding the anticipated price ranges, they did not have the available resources to offer a competitive
price; another two of these strategic industry participants indicated that they were not interested in participating in a process after
they learned of the competitive nature of the process with multiple parties conducting diligence; and the remaining one of these
strategic industry participants did not follow up with Credit Suisse with respect to its interest in participating in the process.

On April 6, 2017, the Special Committee held a meeting in New York City. By invitation of the Special Committee, members of
AMRI management and representatives of Credit Suisse and Goodwin participated for a portion of the meeting. At this meeting,
Credit Suisse provided an update on the recent interactions with the interested parties, including the fact that Party A, Party C and
Party F had chosen not to submit a proposal. The Special Committee, with the assistance of Credit Suisse also reviewed and
discussed the competing preliminary, non-binding proposals received from each of Carlyle, GTCR, Party B, Party D and Party E
and reviewed certain preliminary financial analyses. The Special Committee discussed each bidder’s initial proposed price,
proposed transaction and financing structure, and proposed timeline. Goodwin led a discussion concerning the fiduciary duties of
the directors in the context of their consideration of a potential sale of AMRI. In addition, the Special Committee engaged in a
general discussion concerning whether it might be advisable to approach and explore a potential strategic transaction with third
parties in addition to the parties who had been given confidential information and conducted diligence to date. In particular, the
Special Committee expressed its desire to avoid a protracted process given the potential disruptions to our business, and to focus on
potential buyers who could make the financial commitment necessary to acquire a company of our size and consummate a
transaction expeditiously. The Special Committee also discussed the continued risk of leaks that might arise from making contact
with other parties, the potential impact on our business of such leaks, including the loss of customers, partners and employees as a
result of the uncertainty over AMRI’s

future, and the potential need to disclose sensitive, proprietary and confidential information to competitors and potential
competitors if additional parties were to be contacted. As part of this discussion, the management team updated the Special
Committee regarding the impact of the Debtwire Article on AMRI’s employees. The Special Committee also considered our ability
to potentially solicit interest of additional third parties through a “go-shop” provision in the event that the board decided to pursue a
sale transaction with one of the current interested parties. The Special Committee also noted that the parties involved in the process
to date included those parties whom the Special Committee, after consulting with Credit Suisse and management, believed were the
most logical and viable acquirors given their access to debt and equity financing, industry focus, potential synergies, investment
philosophies and experience in acquiring publicly traded companies of the size and nature of AMRI. As part of this meeting, the
Special Committee also discussed management’s current forecasts and our long-range plan and prospects, as well as a number of
risks and factors affecting our business, including organic growth and business development opportunities, customer concentration,
revenue predictability and the volatility of revenue from quarter to quarter from our largest customers, and competitive pressure.
The Special Committee noted the execution risks, including our access to capital to fund acquisitions, efforts to diversify our suite
of service offerings and customer base, and our capacity to compete with evolving technologies in the industry. In light of the
concerns discussed, the Special Committee concluded that there were not likely to be any other logical financial sponsors with the
financial capacity to complete a transaction of the type that was being evaluated and who could differentiate themselves from the
parties with whom we were or had previously been engaged. Additionally, based on the risks discussed by the Special Committee,
including those associated with providing access to AMRI personnel and confidential information to competitors and potential
competitors, the Special Committee determined that the process should continue with only financial sponsors at this time. The
Special Committee also discussed the complexity of our business and operations and the amount of time required for each potential
financial sponsor to conduct and complete its due diligence requirements in connection with a potential acquisition of us, and the
demands such review and discussions required of our management. Based on these considerations, the Special Committee
determined not to invite Party D and Party B into the second round of the process based on their respective $17.00 to $19.00 and
$17.00 to $18.00 price ranges. Furthermore, based on the benefits and risks discussed, the Special Committee concluded that
approaching additional parties at such time would not be prudent because the contact and potential inclusion of additional parties in
our process would require AMRI to disclose sensitive, proprietary and confidential information to competitors and potential
competitors, but that we should continue discussions with Carlyle, GTCR and Party E. The Special Committee determined that it
was in the best interests of AMRI stockholders to invite Carlyle, GTCR and Party E to participate in a second round of the process
consisting of, among other things, continued due diligence by the parties and the drafting and negotiation of legal documentation.

Following the meeting of the Special Committee, on April 6, 2017, as requested by the Special Committee, Credit Suisse contacted
each of the parties who had submitted a written indication of interest to notify them with respect to the next steps of the process, if
any. As requested by the Special Committee, a representative of Credit Suisse contacted Party E to inquire about its financial
resources and the investment activities of its investment funds and, based on the price per share range proposed by Party E and the
availability of funds from its funding sources, invited Party E to continue to pursue an acquisition of AMRI. As requested by the
Special Committee, a representative of Credit Suisse also reached out to Carlyle to indicate that Carlyle would be invited to
participate in the next stage of the process and emphasized that multiple parties had submitted written indications of interest with
price ranges that were higher than the price range proposed by Carlyle and to be competitive, Carlyle would need to increase its
proposed per share purchase price in connection with any subsequent proposal presented to us, and Carlyle acknowledged that it
would need to increase its value in order to be competitive in the potential sale of AMRI. At the request of the Special Committee,
a representative of Credit Suisse contacted GTCR to indicate that it was invited to proceed to the next step of the process, and
confirmed with GTCR that GTCR had access to adequate funding sources to be able to consummate a transaction with AMRI.
Representatives of Credit Suisse informed each of Carlyle, GTCR and Party E that each party needed to fully engage their
respective legal, financial and accounting advisors in connection with the evaluation of a proposed transaction with us and related
due diligence efforts and ensure that any final proposal presented to us would include fully committed sources of equity and debt
financing. In addition, as requested by the Special Committee, representatives of Credit Suisse separately contacted each of

Party B and Party D and indicated that the per share price ranges set forth in their respective written indications of interest were
insufficient to allow such party to progress to the next stage of the process, and that unless they were willing and able to increase
their proposed valuation ranges, they would not be permitted to progress to the next stage of the process and have continued access
to management and diligence materials. Each of Party B and Party D acknowledged that they would not be continuing in the
process because they could not increase their respective price because neither would be able to achieve its required return above its
respective price range.

On April 7, 2017, our board of directors held a telephonic meeting at which members of management and, at the request of the
Special Committee, representatives of Credit Suisse and Goodwin were present. At this meeting, the Special Committee and at the
request of the Special Committee, Credit Suisse, summarized the written indications of interest that were received on April 4, 2017,
and provided an update on recent interactions with the interested parties, including the fact that Party A, Party C and Party F had
chosen not to submit an initial indication of interest. Our board of directors discussed the proposals by Party D and Party B in
comparison to the other preliminary written indications of interest submitted, and Party D’s and Party B’s acknowledgement that
they were unable to increase their per share price ranges. Representatives of Goodwin led a discussion concerning the fiduciary
duties of the directors in the context of their consideration of a potential sale of AMRI, and the next steps with respect to a potential
sale. Our board of directors discussed the process for continuing to explore a possible sale transaction.

By April 14, 2017, we had provided Carlyle, GTCR, and Party E and their respective advisors with access to a comprehensive
virtual data room containing our business and legal due diligence materials. Thereafter, the parties and their advisors had
discussions, and we provided answers to questions posed by such parties and their respective advisors, regarding the due diligence
materials, and each of the parties and their advisors continued their due diligence review, including through meetings with
management, visits to certain of our U.S. and non-U.S. facilities and teleconferences.

On April 9, 2017, Party G and representatives of Credit Suisse had their previously scheduled call to discuss Party G’s interest in
participating in our sale process. Party G was informed that the Special Committee was in advanced discussions with several
parties and that Party G would be contacted if things changed. On April 18, 2017, Party G called Credit Suisse to inquire whether
anything had changed and was told that the sale process was continuing to progress as previously discussed.

On April 25, 2017, Bloomberg published an article (the “Bloomberg Article”) disclosing that AMRI was working with Credit
Suisse in connection with the exploration of a possible sale, and that AMRI had received indications of interest from two financial
sponsors with valuations at approximately $1.0 billion in the aggregate. Neither Credit Suisse nor AMRI responded to inquiries by
Bloomberg before or after the release of the article. The article caused a considerable number of employees to express concern
about the impact of the reported process on the Company and the future direction of the Company. Following the publication of the
Bloomberg Article, we were contacted, either directly or through Credit Suisse, by two additional private equity firms.

On April 27, 2017, in preparation for the meeting of the Special Committee to be held on May 2, 2017, members of our
management and representatives of Credit Suisse and Goodwin had a telephonic meeting during which Credit Suisse provided an
update regarding the due diligence efforts of Carlyle, GTCR and Party E, the three parties with whom the Special Committee was
in advanced discussions. Credit Suisse also provided an update on the inbound communications received by Credit Suisse from the
five companies within our industry and two other financial sponsors who inquired about the status of our sale process in light of the
Debtwire Article and/or Bloomberg Article. Credit Suisse informed management and Goodwin that none of the strategic parties
were interested in executing a confidentiality agreement with us to further discuss our sale process or a proposed transaction with
us and that the two additional private equity firms did not meet the criteria for participation in the sale process previously
established by the Special Committee at the beginning of our sale process.

On May 1, 2017, Goodwin provided to our Special Committee a summary of the material terms and conditions of the draft “bid”
merger agreement to be provided to each of Carlyle, GTCR and Party E.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

On May 2, 2017, the Special Committee had a meeting in Valladolid, Spain with the other members of our board of directors,
members of the management team, and representatives of Credit Suisse and Goodwin present by telephone for portions of the
meeting at the invitation of the Special Committee. At this meeting, Credit Suisse provided an update on the recent interactions
with Carlyle, GTCR and Party E, the status of the bidders’ due diligence efforts and level of engagement with management and
Credit Suisse with respect to due diligence. The Special Committee also discussed the timeline for a potential sale, including dates
for the submission of final proposals and progressing to the execution of a definitive agreement. Representatives of Credit Suisse
also provided an update regarding certain inbound communications that they had received from strategic companies in the industry
and other financial sponsors, including that none of the strategic parties were interested in executing a confidentiality agreement
with us to further discuss our sale process or a proposed transaction with us and that the two additional private equity firms did not
meet the criteria previously established by the Special Committee at the beginning of our sale process, as had been discussed during
the meeting of the Special Committee on March 3, 2017. The Special Committee again engaged in a discussion concerning whether
it might be advisable to approach and explore a potential strategic transaction with third parties other than those parties who were
currently evaluating an acquisition of AMRI (GTCR, Carlyle and Party E). The Special Committee discussed the risk that including
additional parties may increase the potential for leaks, the potential impact on our business of such leaks, including the loss of
customers, partners and employees, and the potential need to disclose sensitive, proprietary and confidential information to
competitors and potential competitors if additional parties were to participate in the sale process. The Special Committee also
discussed the complexity of our business and operations and the amount of time required for each potential buyer to conduct and
complete its due diligence in connection with a potential acquisition of us, and the demands such review and discussions required
of our management and the potential to extend the process. The Special Committee also considered our ability to solicit interest of
additional third parties through a go-shop provision in the event that the board decided to pursue a sale transaction with one of the
interested parties and the additional delay in consummating a transaction that would result with a “go-shop” provision.

Based on the benefits and risks discussed, the Special Committee determined not to expand the sale process to include additional
financial sponsors, given the significant number of financial sponsors that already had been invited to participate in the sale
process, the advanced nature of discussions with Carlyle, GTCR and Party E, and the fact that there were not likely to be other
financial sponsors with the financial capacity to complete a transaction and who could differentiate themselves from the financial
sponsors in the sale process.

With regard to additional strategic parties who had not been previously contacted by or on behalf of us as part of our sale process,
the Special Committee instructed Credit Suisse to contact three additional strategic acquirers in the industry who the Special
Committee believed might have the resources to consummate a significant acquisition, both from a financial and operational
perspective, and who might have the capability to complete a transaction on a reasonable timeline in order to avoid a protracted
process that could be detrimental to our business, including the relationships with our customers, partners and employees.

Following the meeting of the Special Committee, representatives of Credit Suisse contacted the three additional strategic
companies who had been identified by the Special Committee. Two of the strategic companies indicated that they were not
interested in discussing a proposed transaction with us and the remaining strategic company did not return Credit Suisse’s
telephone call.

Also on May 2, 2017, Credit Suisse, at the direction of the Special Committee, distributed an instruction letter to each of Carlyle,
GTCR and Party E setting forth the timing and procedures for submitting a final proposal to acquire all of our outstanding equity.
The letter requested that proposals be submitted by May 24, 2017, with initial comments to the draft merger agreement,
accompanying disclosure schedules, form of equity commitment letter and limited guarantee to be provided by May 19, 2017. The
letter requested that each bidder address in its proposal, among other things, price and form of consideration, sources and structure
of financing, and required approvals, and include a final mark-up of the merger agreement and commitment letters securing the
necessary funding.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Between May 3, 2017 and May 4, 2017, representatives of Credit Suisse and Party E had several telephone conversations.
Ultimately Party E notified Credit Suisse of their intention to discontinue their efforts as part of the AMRI process, citing a lack of
sufficient resources due to the complexity of the potential transaction, competing demands and concern about additional capital
requirements for our operations on a post-closing basis.

On or about May 5, 2017, representatives of Credit Suisse separately had conversations with each of Carlyle and GTCR to discuss
the proposed timing of a potential acquisition of AMRI, status of each of the parties’ due diligence review and additional diligence
requirements.

In the course of its discussions with Credit Suisse, Carlyle discussed the anticipated capital requirements needed to implement
AMRI’s strategic plan with Credit Suisse and Carlyle’s view that future acquisitions would be necessary to achieve desired levels
of growth for AMRI’s business and Carlyle indicated that, in light of these anticipated capital requirements and other characteristics
of a potential investment in the Company and Carlyle’s intention to maintain a reserve of equity capital related to the investment to
fund potential future acquisitions, Carlyle would likely not be willing to commit all the equity capital required to complete a
transaction. After discussion with Mr. Marth, Mr. Deming and representatives of Goodwin later that day, at the request of the
Special Committee Credit Suisse contacted Carlyle and encouraged Carlyle to continue working and deliver a final proposal.

In the course of its discussions with Credit Suisse, GTCR mentioned that more equity capital than previously anticipated by GTCR
would be needed to complete an acquisition of AMRI given the near-term capital expenditures and other capital requirements
required to implement AMRI’s strategic plan and the meaningful follow-on acquisitions that underpin GTCR’s post-acquisition
strategy. As a result, GTCR indicated that it may need to consider third party capital as part of its final proposal, such as equity
capital from GTCR’s limited partners. Credit Suisse encouraged GTCR to continue working and deliver a final proposal that did
not rely on third party capital.

Later in the afternoon on May 5, 2017, Mr. Marth, Mr. Deming and representatives of Credit Suisse and Goodwin discussed the
status of the sale process, including Carlyle’s and GTCR’s due diligence review efforts and Party E’s decision to not pursue an
acquisition of AMRI. Representatives of Credit Suisse also contacted members of the Special Committee to inform them as to
Party E’s decision to not pursue an acquisition of AMRI.

On May 6, 2017, each of Carlyle and GTCR were provided with a form of merger agreement, equity commitment letter and limited
guarantee.

On May 8, 2017, representatives of Credit Suisse separately contacted each of Carlyle and GTCR to discuss the status of each of
the parties’ due diligence review and additional diligence requirements.

On May 11, 2017, members of our management team met with representatives of Carlyle and Credit Suisse in Waltham, MA, to
further discuss our operations and strategic focus and review our key financial highlights.

In addition, on May 11, 2017, another financial sponsor contacted Credit Suisse to inquire as to the status of our sale process,
however, there was nothing communicated as part of this discussion that provided a reasonable basis to suggest that such financial
sponsor met the criteria for participation in our sale process as established by the Special Committee, including the financial
strength, experience in acquiring companies of the size and complexity of AMRI (including AMRI’s international footprint),
industry focus and potential synergies with AMRI.

On May 12, 2017, each of Carlyle and GTCR were provided with AMRI’s disclosure schedules to the form of merger agreement.

On May 17, 2017, GTCR and Credit Suisse had a conversation regarding GTCR’s financing capabilities. GTCR mentioned that, as
a result of the capital requirements needed to implement AMRI’s strategic plan, GTCR may need to consider third party capital as
part of their final proposal and that GTCR would be open to that capital coming from another party that is pursuing a potential
acquisition of AMRI if partnering with such a party would allow the parties to collectively consummate a proposed transaction on
an expedited timeline. As requested by the Special Committee, Credit Suisse informed GTCR that partnering with respect

to a proposed acquisition of all of AMRI’s outstanding equity would not be permitted without the consent of the Special Committee
and that, as of the final bid due date, GTCR would be required to have sufficient sources of capital in order to fund the entire
proposed purchase price. GTCR also inquired about sharing their internal diligence reports and related work product that included
AMRI’s diligence materials to certain of its limited partners who could potentially provide equity commitments for a portion of the
proposed purchase price. As discussed with the Special Committee, Credit Suisse informed GTCR that a co-investment by certain
of GTCR’s limited partners might be permitted by the Special Committee provided that such limited partners executed a separate
confidentiality agreement with AMRI prior to receiving confidential information concerning AMRI. In addition, as instructed by
the Special Committee, Credit Suisse informed GTCR that the final bid due date would not be extended for GTCR despite the
inclusion of certain of GTCR’s limited partners as part of equity financing for a potential acquisition transaction.

On May 18, 2017, the members of our management team met with representatives of GTCR and Credit Suisse in Waltham, MA, to
further discuss our operations and strategic focus and review our key financial highlights.

In the morning of May 19, 2017, the Special Committee met telephonically with members of management and representatives of
Credit Suisse and Goodwin participating for a portion of the meeting by the invitation of the Special Committee. Representatives of
Credit Suisse reviewed with the Special Committee the outcome of their outreach to the three strategic companies and the fact that
none of those parties expressed an interest in engaging in a discussion with us regarding a potential strategic transaction involving
AMRI. Credit Suisse also updated the Special Committee regarding Carlyle’s and GTCR’s due diligence review, site visits to
certain of our U.S. and non-U.S. manufacturing facilities and their ongoing communications with the management team and Credit
Suisse with respect to the anticipated capital requirements to implement our strategic plan as presented to them throughout our sale
process. The Special Committee was informed that, in light of these anticipated capital requirements, both Carlyle and GTCR had
inquired of Credit Suisse whether there were partnering opportunities with other financial sponsors in connection with the equity
financing for the transaction, and both had been informed by Credit Suisse that no such partnering would be permitted unless and
until the Special Committee determined that such partnering would be in the best interest of our stockholders. Credit Suisse further
updated the Special Committee that GTCR had requested that two of its limited partners be allowed access to GTCR’s due
diligence reports and work product in connection with a possible co-investment with GTCR, and that GTCR had been informed
that such access would be conditioned upon such parties’ execution of confidentiality agreement with us. The Special Committee
also discussed timing with respect to the submission of final proposals and execution of a definitive agreement.

On May 19, 2017, we received initial comments to the merger agreement from GTCR and initial comments to the merger
agreement, disclosure schedules, equity commitment letter and limited guarantee from Carlyle.

On May 22, 2017, telephonic meetings were held throughout the day with Mr. Deming, members of management and
representatives of Credit Suisse and Goodwin to receive updates from Credit Suisse regarding ongoing interactions with the
interested parties and for Goodwin to review the comments to the merger agreement submitted by each of Carlyle and GTCR. As a
result of these discussions, Goodwin obtained feedback regarding the proposed terms to be communicated to each of Carlyle and
GTCR.

On the evening of May 22, 2017, Goodwin had conference calls with each of Latham & Watkins LLP (“Latham”), counsel to
Carlyle, and Kirkland & Ellis LLP (“Kirkland”), counsel to GTCR, to provide high-level feedback on the issues presented by their
respective comments to the merger agreement. With respect to Carlyle, these items included: (1) the specifics of the marketing
period for Carlyle to obtain the requisite debt financing needed for the proposed transaction; (2) the conditions to closing; (3) the
size of the termination fees payable by Parent and us; (4) our obligation to reimburse the expenses of Parent under certain
circumstances; (5) the obligation of Parent to reimburse our expenses in connection with the payoff of our convertible notes and
unwinding of our hedge and warrant transactions; and (6) the obligations of Parent to our employees with respect to employee
related benefits and compensation matters. With respect to GTCR, these items included: (1) the specifics of the marketing period
for GTCR to obtain the requisite debt financing needed for the proposed transaction; (2) the proposed requirement for us to make
available to Parent use of our unrestricted cash in order to fund a portion of the purchase price at closing; (3) the size of the
termination fees payable by Parent and us; (4) our obligation to reimburse the expenses of Parent under certain

circumstances; (5) the obligation of Parent to reimburse our expenses in connection with the payoff of our convertible notes and
unwinding of our hedge and warrant transactions; and (6) the obligations of Parent to our employees with respect to employee
related benefits and compensation matters. Goodwin communicated to each of Latham and Kirkland that it intended to send revised
drafts of the merger agreement back to them on the afternoon of May 24, 2017 for their respective clients to review in advance of
submitting their respective final proposals.

On May 23, 2017, representatives of Goodwin and Mr. Deming discussed the high-level feedback on the issues presented by each
of Carlyle and GTCR as presented in their respective merger agreements and Goodwin’s discussions with each of Latham and
Kirkland and the status of discussions between us and each of Carlyle and GTCR in advance of the final bid due date, including
discussions related to capital expenditure requirements for the ongoing business operations if a proposed transaction were to be
consummated.

On the morning of May 24, 2017, Kirkland contacted Goodwin to provide feedback from GTCR with respect to the high-level
issues previously communicated by Goodwin to Kirkland. In the afternoon of May 24, 2017, Goodwin provided revised drafts of
the merger agreement to each of Latham and Kirkland. In the evening of May 24, 2017, GTCR submitted a non-binding proposal to
acquire all of our outstanding equity at a purchase price of $21.25 per share payable in cash upon the closing of the transaction. The
proposal provided for the merger consideration to be funded through a combination of debt financing and equity financing from
GTCR and certain of its limited partners but did not specify the limited partners or provide the amount of their proposed equity
commitments. The proposal also noted that GTCR’s due diligence was complete, and included a mark-up of the form of equity
commitment letter, limited guarantee and accompanying disclosure schedules to the merger agreement. Following receipt of
GTCR’s non-binding proposal, representatives of Credit Suisse contacted GTCR to seek additional information regarding GTCR’s
equity commitment for the transaction, the proposed split among GTCR and its co-investors, the sources of cash and anticipated
timing to get to execution of a definitive merger agreement. GTCR indicated that it was prepared to negotiate the merger agreement
on the terms outlined in its non-binding proposal and the feedback to the issues as was provided orally by Kirkland to Goodwin,
and it expected to have certain of its limited partners participate as co-investors for the equity commitment but that it would require
at least 10 days for such limited partners to complete their diligence review and financial analyses.

In addition, on May 24, 2017, Party G submitted to Thomas E. D’Ambra, the chairman of our board of directors, a non-binding,
preliminary indication of interest to acquire all of our outstanding equity for consideration consisting of $20.00 per share in cash
payable at the closing. The proposal also indicated that Party G intended to finance the merger consideration with a combination of
debt and equity capital from Party G, provided a list of diligence requirements that Party G would need to complete, and noted that
Party G expected to be in a position to sign and announce a transaction within four weeks from receiving an indication from our
board of directors regarding a desire to proceed with Party G.

On May 25, 2017, Carlyle submitted a non-binding proposal to acquire all of our outstanding equity at a purchase price of $18.50
per share payable in cash upon the closing of the transaction. The proposal provided for the merger consideration to be funded
through a combination of debt financing and equity financing from Carlyle, and expressly stated that Carlyle would contribute fifty
percent (50%) of the equity investment and that Carlyle would seek the participation of another equity partner to fund the
additional fifty percent (50%) of the equity investment. The proposal generally noted the opportunities for management to
participate with Carlyle in the growth and success of our company. The proposal also noted that Carlyle’s due diligence was
substantially complete, with the exception of certain confirmatory diligence items listed in its proposal. In addition, the proposal
noted that Carlyle believed a definitive merger agreement and related documents could be executed within five days.

Later in the day on May 25, 2017, the Special Committee met telephonically with members of management and representatives of
Credit Suisse and Goodwin participating for a portion of the meeting at the invitation of the Special Committee. At this meeting,
Credit Suisse provided an update on recent interactions with the interested parties, including a review of the revised non-binding
proposals received from Carlyle and GTCR and the status of their respective financing commitments, including the fact that Carlyle
expressly stated that it would contribute fifty percent (50%) of the equity investment and that Carlyle would seek the participation
of

another equity partner to fund the additional fifty percent (50%) of the equity investment, and the fact that GTCR did not specify
the amount or the identity of the sources of its equity commitment to fund a portion of the proposed purchase price (but that it
would require at least 10 days for such sources to complete their diligence review and financial analyses). Credit Suisse also
provided a summary of the non-binding, preliminary indication of interest submitted by Party G. Credit Suisse also reviewed with
the Special Committee its preliminary financial analyses of the Company and each bidder’s proposal. Goodwin again led a
discussion concerning the fiduciary duties of the directors in the context of their consideration of a potential sale of AMRI, and
reviewed the material terms of the revised merger agreement mark-up received from each of Carlyle and GTCR. The Special
Committee also discussed (1) that the proposal of $18.50 per share proposed by Carlyle was lower than the per share price range
that Carlyle had included in its April 4th indication of interest, (2) that GTCR did not have committed sources for a portion of the
equity financing and would require additional time to organize and finalize such sources of equity financing, (3) that partnering at
this point in the process as requested by Carlyle, before the Special Committee was satisfied that it had progressed as far as possible
with each of GTCR and Carlyle in terms of valuation, could result in loss of the competitive dynamic between the two bidders and
make it more difficult to extract increased value for our stockholders, and (4) that Party G was at the very early stages of exploring
a possible transaction with us, had not conducted a thorough diligence review and would require at least several weeks to complete
its due diligence review and understand our business to the same degree as Carlyle and GTCR. After consideration of these issues,
the Special Committee instructed Credit Suisse to continue discussions with GTCR regarding its proposal on a non-exclusive basis,
including seeking a higher price from GTCR, and to inform Carlyle that the Special Committee was not willing to engage in further
discussions for a potential transaction with Carlyle on the terms included in its final proposal.

Following the meeting of the Special Committee, at the request of the Special Committee, representatives of Credit Suisse
contacted Party G’s financial advisor to discuss Party G’s non-binding, preliminary indication of interest submitted on May 24,
2017. During that conversation, as authorized by the Special Committee, Credit Suisse noted that other participants in our sale
process had worked expeditiously over the course of six weeks to conduct and complete their respective due diligence review of
our company as well as to review and respond to drafts of transaction documents, including a merger agreement, equity
commitment letter and limited guarantee, and were close to being able to finalize definitive documentation. Credit Suisse also
sought information regarding Party G’s level of interest in a potential transaction with us and its ability to undertake and
consummate such a transaction. Party G did not provide specifics as to the timing required to conduct its diligence review of AMRI
but reiterated its interest in a potential transaction with us.

In addition, as requested by the Special Committee, representatives of Credit Suisse contacted Carlyle to request an explanation
with respect to the decrease in the proposed purchase price from its April 4th non-binding proposal, and, as requested by the Special
Committee, informed Carlyle that their proposal did not provide a basis for continuing in our sale process and that other parties had
submitted proposals that represented significantly higher values for the acquisition of the outstanding equity of AMRI.

In addition, as requested by the Special Committee, representatives of Credit Suisse contacted GTCR to inform them that their
price was unsatisfactory to the Special Committee and they would need to improve their value and firm up their sources of equity
financing in order to continue in our sale process. GTCR reiterated their interest in a potential transaction with us and indicated that
they would require approximately two weeks for certain of their limited partners to complete their diligence review and finalize
their analyses. GTCR also indicated that if it were allowed to partner with another financial sponsor who was participating in our
sale process, it believed that it could negotiate and execute a definitive merger agreement within five days. As requested by the
Special Committee, representatives of Credit Suisse reiterated that the Special Committee was not prepared to permit partnering
between the participants in our sale process. Credit Suisse informed GTCR that it needed to increase its proposed per share price
and propose a specific path to having a definitive merger agreement negotiated and executed.

On May 26, 2017, our board of directors met telephonically with members of management and representatives of Credit Suisse and
Goodwin participating for a portion of the meeting at the request of the Special Committee. At the request of the Special
Committee, representatives of Goodwin led a discussion concerning the fiduciary duties of the directors in the context of their
consideration of a potential sale of AMRI and

TABLE OF CONTENTS

representatives of Credit Suisse provided a summary of the status of the interactions with each of Carlyle, GTCR and Party G and
reviewed the revised non-binding proposals received from Carlyle and GTCR and the initial non-binding indication of interest
submitted by Party G. Credit Suisse also provided an update regarding recent interactions with each of Carlyle and GTCR
regarding their revised non-binding proposals and the messages the Special Committee had authorized to be conveyed to each
regarding value and sources of equity financing.

Following the meeting of our board of directors, representatives of Credit Suisse and GTCR had additional teleconferences
regarding GTCR’s proposal, timing for negotiating and finalizing a definitive merger agreement and the steps that GTCR might
take in order to remain competitive in the process. GTCR indicated that it remained interested in pursuing a transaction but that it
had not yet determined what increased price it would be willing to pay to purchase AMRI’s outstanding equity and would follow up
with Credit Suisse in a few days if it was able to propose any increase in its proposed price. GTCR also indicated that it required at
least 10 – 14 additional days to allow certain of its limited partners to complete their due diligence review of AMRI and finalize
their analyses, but that it could potentially move quicker if allowed to partner with another party that is pursuing an acquisition of
AMRI. As requested by the Special Committee, representatives of Credit Suisse informed GTCR that they needed to provide Credit
Suisse with a response as to their increased price by May 31, 2017.

Later that evening, GTCR sent a mark-up of a confidentiality agreement to be executed with one of its limited partners who was
contemplating a co-investment with GTCR.

On May 27, 2017, the financial advisor to Party G sent an email to Credit Suisse indicating that Party G was increasing its proposed
price to acquire all of our outstanding equity for consideration consisting of $22.00 per share in cash payable at the closing, with no
other changes to the terms of their May 24th proposal. Party G’s financial advisor also indicated that Party G wanted to have a
meeting with our management team during the week of May 29th to initiate its diligence review process and representatives of
Credit Suisse and Party G’s financial advisor arranged the meeting for June 2, 2017.

In addition, Kirkland sent a further revised draft of the merger agreement to Goodwin, which reflected proposed changes in size of
the termination fees to be paid by Parent and us.

Also on May 27, 2017, GTCR contacted representatives of Credit Suisse to provide an update as to its discussion with certain of its
limited partners for a potential co-investment for the equity financing of the purchase price. As a part of this discussion, GTCR
inquired about the status of our discussions with other participants in our sale process and requested an exclusive negotiating period
with us for a period of five to ten days while GTCR finalized its equity financing sources. As requested by the Special Committee,
Credit Suisse informed GTCR that the Special Committee was not prepared to enter into exclusive discussions with a participant at
this point in the process. GTCR asked AMRI to consider its request for an exclusive negotiating period when and if the parties
reached agreement on the proposed price per share.

Later on May 27, 2017, Carlyle contacted representatives of Credit Suisse to inquire as to the meetings of the Special Committee
and our board of directors following the submission of the revised non-binding proposals to acquire all of our outstanding equity.
As instructed by the Special Committee, Credit Suisse informed Carlyle that it needed to significantly increase its proposed value
in order for the Special Committee to authorize further discussions. Carlyle informed Credit Suisse that they would reconsider their
proposed price per share but that they would not be in a position to do so until the following week.

On May 28, 2017, members of management and representatives of Credit Suisse and Goodwin met telephonically for an update
regarding the recent interactions with each of Carlyle, GTCR and Party G. The parties discussed the proposed timing
considerations, the request for exclusivity from GTCR and the concerns regarding the funding capabilities of each of the interested
parties. Following this discussion, Mr. Deming was provided with a summary of the interactions and discussions with each of
Carlyle, GTCR and Party G.

On May 29, 2017, Carlyle contacted representatives of Credit Suisse to indicate that it was increasing its proposal to $21.00 per
share. Carlyle informed Credit Suisse that it was prepared to provide fifty percent (50%) of the equity financing required to
complete a transaction on those terms and indicated that it was prepared to work expeditiously to complete its remaining
confirmatory due diligence and negotiate and

execute a definitive merger agreement and related documents on those terms. Representatives of Credit Suisse informed Carlyle
that the proposed increase in price was a constructive step forward and would be communicated to the Special Committee but that
the revised proposed price was still below the price proposed by others.

Also on May 29, 2017, representatives of Credit Suisse contacted Party G to inquire as to Party G’s proposed timeline to advance
discussions with us with respect to a transaction and to confirm their meeting with our management team on June 2, 2017. Party G
indicated that it would require two weeks to conduct its due diligence review of AMRI and four weeks to negotiate and execute a
definitive merger agreement with us, but did not offer additional specifics at this time as to how it would accomplish these steps
within their stated time periods. Party G acknowledged that AMRI was in a sale process, with other participants further advanced
with respect to their diligence review of AMRI and discussions with us, but confirmed its interest in its scheduled meeting with our
management team on June 2, 2017.

In the evening of May 29, 2017, Mr. Deming and representatives of Credit Suisse and Goodwin participated on a teleconference in
which Credit Suisse provided an update as to its recent interactions with each of Carlyle, GTCR and Party G and a summary of the
current status of discussions. The parties discussed (1) Carlyle’s recent revised oral proposal of $21.00 and the fact that Carlyle was
unlikely to proceed with a transaction at that valuation without the participation of another significant equity partner, (2) that the
potential increase in GTCR’s value remained unknown and that the timing for and its ability to secure co-investors remained
uncertain, and (3) the fact that Party G did not clarify its specific timeline to conduct and complete its due diligence review of
AMRI, that it did not offer any special or unique perspective on consummating a transaction with us, and that it had not previously
completed an acquisition of our size or complexity in our industry. Credit Suisse, Goodwin and Mr. Deming discussed the potential
consequences of permitting Carlyle and GTCR to partner (including reducing the number of bidders but potentially making for a
stronger and more likely bid) and discussed a proposed strategy to advance the discussions with each of Carlyle, GTCR and Party
G in an effort to obtain increased value from each of them, which included having Carlyle complete its remaining confirmatory due
diligence items specified in its prior, non-binding proposal, pushing both of Carlyle and GTCR to separately increase their
proposed prices and potentially permitting Carlyle and GTCR to partner in exchange for an increase in the proposed price to obtain
more value for AMRI’s stockholders.

On May 30, 2017, as requested by the Special Committee, representatives of Credit Suisse contacted Carlyle to indicate that our
management team would be providing the additional diligence information to Carlyle that it had requested in its last non-binding
proposal and that Carlyle’s due diligence review would need to be completed within the next two days so as to convey to Carlyle
that they needed to complete their work to remain competitive in our process. In addition, Credit Suisse requested that Carlyle
provide its comments in response to the May 24th draft merger agreement that Goodwin had sent to Latham.

Also on May 30, 2017, representatives of Goodwin and Kirkland engaged in negotiations regarding the merger agreement. In
addition, Party G executed a confidentiality agreement with AMRI that included customary non-disclosure and standstill provisions
that allowed Party G to make confidential proposals to us at any time.

Later on May 30, 2017, the Special Committee met telephonically and members of management and representatives of Credit
Suisse and Goodwin participated for a portion of the meeting by invitation of the Special Committee. Representatives of Credit
Suisse provided an update on recent developments in the interactions with each of Carlyle, GTCR and Party G. The Special
Committee, with the assistance of Credit Suisse, reviewed Carlyle’s latest proposal of $21.00 per share and considered the fact that
Carlyle’s proposal was conditioned upon Carlyle providing only fifty percent (50%) of the equity capital necessary to complete the
transaction. The Special Committee discussed GTCR’s ability to arrange the equity financing with certain of its limited partners
and the ability of Party G to arrange its equity and debt financing for a transaction of this size within a reasonable timeframe. The
Special Committee discussed the fact that none of the potential financial sponsors were willing to independently commit 100% of
the equity financing necessary to complete the proposed transaction with AMRI at the valuations being discussed. The Special
Committee also considered the fact that GTCR continued to express interest in a transaction with AMRI, but like Carlyle, was
unlikely to proceed with a transaction without the participation of another significant equity partner. The Special

Committee also noted that notwithstanding GTCR’s sources of equity financing, GTCR needed to respond to Credit Suisse with a
revised price. Following discussions, the Special Committee instructed Credit Suisse to contact Party G to confirm its interest in a
transaction and its ability to complete its diligence review on an expedited timeframe. The Special Committee also instructed Credit
Suisse to push Carlyle to complete its remaining due diligence review and provide a further revised draft of the merger agreement.

In the evening of May 30, 2017, GTCR contacted representatives of Credit Suisse and informed them that GTCR was unlikely to
improve upon its proposal and again inquired about obtaining exclusivity of negotiations while it secured its financing sources for a
proposed transaction with us. Representatives of Credit Suisse informed GTCR that the Special Committee would be disappointed
with its unwillingness to increase its proposed purchase price, and, as authorized by the Special Committee, indicated that it could
jeopardize GTCR’s participation in our sale process.

On May 31, 2017, we held our annual meeting of stockholders at our headquarters in Albany, New York. Following the stockholder
meeting, in Albany, New York on May 31, 2017, our board of directors held a regularly scheduled meeting at which representatives
of Credit Suisse were present at the request of the Special Committee. At the request of the Special Committee, representatives of
Credit Suisse described GTCR’s request for additional time for certain of its limited partners to complete their respective due
diligence in connection with a co-investment with GTCR as well as GTCR’s unwillingness to improve its proposal, Carlyle’s
increased proposal price and its stated position that it would not proceed with a transaction with us at that price unless permitted to
reach an arrangement with another equity partner to provide fifty percent (50%) of the required equity capitalization, and the
challenges faced by Party G in order for it to be competitive in our process given the current status of its due diligence review, its
lack of prior acquisitions of companies of our size and complexity or in our industry and its access to equity and debt financing
sources.

On May 31, 2017, GTCR informed representatives of Credit Suisse that GTCR was increasing its proposed price to $21.50 per
share. GTCR notified Credit Suisse that on its own it would not be able to improve its value beyond $21.50. However, when asked
by Credit Suisse, GTCR indicated that it may be able to find additional value if partnered with another equity partner to pursue an
acquisition of AMRI. Following this discussion, representatives of Goodwin sent to Kirkland a revised draft of the merger
agreement.

On May 31, 2017, Carlyle provided a revised draft of the merger agreement, including its position with respect to the high level
issues previously communicated to Latham by Goodwin on May 22, 2017.

On June 1, 2017, each of Carlyle and GTCR separately had a call with members of management with respect to our financial
performance as of April 30, 2017.

On June 1, 2017, we provided Party G with access to a virtual data room containing our business and legal due diligence materials.

Also on June 1, 2017, representatives of Kirkland and Goodwin participated in a teleconference to review and negotiate the terms
of the proposed merger agreement. Later on June 1, 2017, representatives of Goodwin contacted Latham to provide high-level
feedback on the issues presented by May 31st draft of Carlyle’s merger agreement.

In addition, throughout the day on June 1, 2017, representatives of Credit Suisse participated in telephone discussions with each of
Carlyle and GTCR regarding diligence matters and other transaction issues.

On the evening of June 1, 2017, the Special Committee met telephonically with members of management and representatives of
Credit Suisse and Goodwin present for a portion of the meeting by invitation of the Special Committee. The Credit Suisse
representatives updated the Special Committee on recent developments in the negotiations with each of Carlyle and GTCR,
including the completion of Carlyle’s confirmatory diligence review, each of Carlyle’s and GTCR’s respective positions and issues
regarding certain financial terms in the draft merger agreement, Carlyle’s increase in value to $21.00 and GTCR’s increase in value
to $21.50 per share (including its inability to improve its value beyond $21.50 per share on its own but potential ability to improve
its value beyond $21.50 per share if partnered with an equity partner). The Special Committee, with the assistance of Credit Suisse,
reviewed and discussed potential equity partners that might be able to team

with Carlyle as well as GTCR’s ability to consummate a transaction without an equity partner. The Special Committee also noted
that GTCR continued to express interest in engaging in a transaction with AMRI, but like Carlyle, was unlikely to proceed with a
transaction without the participation of another significant equity financing partner. Credit Suisse also updated the Special
Committee with respect to the discussions with Party G and the fact that Party G was meeting with the management team on June
2, 2017 to conduct business, operational, clinical, regulatory and legal diligence meetings and for AMRI to provide an overview of
AMRI’s business and operations. The Special Committee discussed the potential partnering of parties that wanted to pursue an
acquisition of AMRI in order to maximize the value for the stockholders. The Special Committee discussed the potential
willingness of each of Carlyle and GTCR to improve their proposals above their respective current proposal prices, the likelihood
of negotiating and executing a definitive merger agreement with each of Carlyle, GTCR and Party G and the remaining obstacles to
executing such an agreement. Following this discussion, the Special Committee directed Credit Suisse to contact Carlyle to confirm
its interest in a transaction, its willingness to partner with another participant in our process, if permitted, and the completion its
confirmatory diligence review, and to communicate that AMRI would consider permitting Carlyle to partner with another party that
wanted to pursue an acquisition of AMRI if the price were not less than $22.00 per share and the transaction could be signed and
announced by June 5, 2017. Following the meeting of the Special Committee, representatives of Credit Suisse contacted
representatives of Carlyle and communicated the Special Committee’s directives.

On June 2, 2017, members of management of Party G and AMRI met in Waltham, MA to provide Party G with an overview of
AMRI’s business and operations and to permit Party G to participate in business, operational, financial, regulatory and legal
diligence meetings.

On June 2, 2017, representatives of Goodwin participated in discussions with Kirkland during which Kirkland confirmed that an
equity rollover by our management team or other AMRI stockholders was not a condition to the proposal submitted by GTCR, and
that there was no intention to engage in discussions regarding management’s future compensation or participation in the transaction
at that time. Following this discussion, Kirkland sent to Goodwin a further revised draft of the merger agreement.

Also on June 2, 2017, we entered into a confidentiality agreement with another limited partner of GTCR, which agreement
included customary non-disclosure and standstill provisions that allow such party to make confidential proposals to us at any time.

On June 2, 2017, Carlyle informed representatives of Credit Suisse that Carlyle was increasing its proposal to $21.50 per share, but
that it would not be able to increase its proposal beyond $21.50 per share.

On June 3, 2017, representatives of Credit Suisse and Mr. Deming discussed Carlyle’s latest proposal of $21.50 per share, the fact
that Carlyle indicated that it was not in a position to further increase its proposal, and the advisability of permitting Carlyle to
partner with another financial sponsor in our sale process in order to encourage Carlyle to increase its offer. Mr. Deming
communicated with each of the other members of the Special Committee, and after discussion, the members of the Special
Committee agreed that if each of GTCR and Carlyle could increase its proposal to $21.75 per share, the Special Committee would
permit them to discuss partnering with each other in order to consummate a proposed transaction with us.

Representatives of Credit Suisse then contacted Carlyle and informed them that the Special Committee had determined that Carlyle
would be permitted to discuss partnering with GTCR on the proposed transaction provided that their joint offer price was at least
$21.75 per share and that both Carlyle and GTCR agreed to work expeditiously to finalize the definitive documentation for the
transaction.

Following discussions with Carlyle, representatives of Credit Suisse then contacted GTCR and informed them that the Special
Committee had determined that Carlyle and GTCR would be permitted to discuss partnering on the proposed transaction provided
that their joint offer price was at least $21.75 per share, that both Carlyle and GTCR agreed to work expeditiously to finalize the
definitive documentation for the transaction and that Carlyle had indicated that it was interested in pursuing such a joint proposal
for an acquisition of AMRI.

Following these discussions, GTCR and Carlyle met telephonically to discuss the terms and conditions on which they would be
willing to pursue a joint acquisition of AMRI and subsequently informed Credit Suisse that they were willing to jointly proceed
with the transaction at a price of $21.75 per share and expressed

their desire to negotiate and execute a definitive merger agreement and related transaction documents within the next two days.
Representatives of Goodwin sent a revised draft of the merger agreement and accompanying disclosure schedules of the Company
to Latham.

Also on June 3, 2017, representatives of Credit Suisse contacted Party G to seek feedback from the prior day’s meetings with the
AMRI management and the status of Party G’s consideration of a proposed transaction. Credit Suisse also indicated that the other
participants in our sale process were significantly advanced in discussions with us with respect to a proposed transaction. Party G
did not make a specific proposal on the call, and Credit Suisse and Party G agreed to continue discussions regarding Party G’s
contemplated due diligence review of AMRI on June 5, 2017.

Later on June 3, 2017, Party G submitted to Credit Suisse a revised, non-binding written indication of interest to acquire all of our
outstanding equity for consideration consisting of $22.50 per share in cash payable at the closing. The proposal also indicated that
Party G intended to finance the merger consideration with a combination of debt from third parties and equity capital from Party G,
indicated that Party G needed to complete its due diligence review and noted that Party G expected to be in a position to sign and
announce a transaction within two to three weeks from receiving full access to all of our confidential information.

In the evening of June 3, 2017, representatives of Goodwin and Mr. Deming discussed the revised, non-binding written indication
of interest received from Party G and agreed that Goodwin should contact Latham so that Carlyle and GTCR would be informed
that higher offer price had been received from a third party in an effort to push Carlyle and GTCR to increase their proposed price
above their current joint proposal of $21.75 per share.

In the morning of June 4, 2017, representatives of Goodwin and Latham held a teleconference to advise the Latham team that
AMRI had received a non-binding indication of interest from a third party, which was not identified to Latham by name, that set
forth a value in excess of the joint proposal price of Carlyle and GTCR. Goodwin and Latham discussed a number of matters in
connection with receipt of this non-binding indication of interest, including a request from AMRI for a reduced termination fee in
the event such party submitted a superior proposal for AMRI after the execution of a definitive merger agreement between Parent
and AMRI, a request from AMRI for an increased price from Carlyle and GTCR, and a request from AMRI for AMRI to allow the
third party to complete its due diligence review while simultaneously negotiating the terms of transaction with Carlyle and GTCR.
Latham indicated that Carlyle and GTCR would not delay their discussions with AMRI in order for AMRI to continue discussions
with the third party that had made the proposal, that Carlyle’s and GTCR’s joint proposal was conditioned upon finalizing
definitive agreements promptly, and that Latham would discuss this development with Carlyle, Kirkland and GTCR.

Also on June 4, 2017, the Special Committee met telephonically with members of management and representatives of Credit Suisse
and Goodwin present for a portion of the meeting by invitation of the Special Committee. Goodwin and Credit Suisse provided an
update regarding the recent interactions with Party G, including the submission by Party G of its revised non-binding indication of
interest to acquire all of our outstanding equity for consideration consisting of $22.50 per share in cash. Representatives of
Goodwin then updated the Special Committee regarding the discussion with Latham earlier that morning, including a request from
AMRI for a reduced termination fee in the event a party already engaged in the process submitted a superior proposal for AMRI
after execution of a definitive merger agreement between Parent and AMRI, a request from AMRI for an increased proposal price
from Carlyle and GTCR, and a request from AMRI for AMRI to allow Party G to complete its due diligence review while
simultaneously negotiating the terms of transaction with Carlyle and GTCR. The Special Committee also noted that Latham had
indicated that Carlyle and GTCR would not delay their discussions with AMRI in order for AMRI to continue discussions with
Party G. Representatives of Goodwin discussed with the Special Committee the fiduciary duties of the directors in the context of
their consideration of the current status of the joint Carlyle and GTCR proposal and the revised non-binding proposal received from
Party G. The Special Committee noted that any definitive merger agreement executed between AMRI and an acquirer would permit
our board of directors to consider and act upon a superior proposal for the acquisition of the company following the execution of
such definitive merger agreement pursuant to customary “deal protection” provisions for a transaction of this size and nature. The
Special Committee discussed whether Party G realistically had the ability to complete its diligence review

in the time period outlined in its non-binding indication of interest as compared to the period of time required for Carlyle and
GTCR to complete their confirmatory due diligence review of the Company and its facilities in the U.S. and internationally, Party
G’s ability to consummate a transaction of this size given its relative inexperience in evaluating, negotiating and consummating
transactions of this size and nature or within our industry, and Party G’s ability to secure equity and debt financing for such a
transaction. The Special Committee also discussed the proposed certainty of negotiating and executing a transaction with Carlyle
and GTCR within only a few days and the likelihood that Carlyle and GTCR would not be willing to delay their discussions with
AMRI in order for AMRI to continue discussions with Party G, and the proposed value that Carlyle and GTCR’s joint proposal of
$21.75 would provide to AMRI’s stockholders. The Special Committee concluded that it would reconvene after receiving a
response from Carlyle and GTCR.

During the day on June 4, 2017, representatives of Carlyle contacted Credit Suisse to indicate that Carlyle and GTCR were
prepared to negotiate and execute a definitive merger agreement with AMRI within the next two days. Carlyle requested a limited
period of time for exclusivity of negotiations. As directed by the Special Committee, Credit Suisse informed Carlyle that the
Special Committee was not prepared to grant exclusivity at this time.

Also on June 4, 2017, representatives of Goodwin, Kirkland and Latham held a teleconference to discuss AMRI’s receipt of Party
G’s non-binding indication of interest. On this teleconference, Kirkland and Latham informed Goodwin that: (1) neither Carlyle nor
GTCR were willing to postpone or delay further discussions with AMRI in order for Party G to advance its discussions with AMRI
and complete its diligence review of AMRI, and that Carlyle and GTCR would cease their efforts to pursue an acquisition of us if
we delayed our discussions with them in order for Party G to advance its diligence review and negotiations with us; (2) Carlyle and
GTCR did not have a specific proposal in response to AMRI’s termination fee request but that Carlyle and GTCR would consider
the current circumstances in negotiating the size of our termination fee; (3) neither Carlyle nor GTCR were willing to further
increase their proposed price; and (4) Carlyle and GTCR were requesting a period of exclusive negotiations for a limited number of
days but that they intended to negotiate and execute a definitive merger agreement by the end of the day on June 5th.

Later in the evening on June 4, 2017, the Special Committee met telephonically with members of management and representatives
of Credit Suisse and Goodwin present for a portion of the meeting by invitation of the Special Committee. Goodwin provided an
update regarding the discussions with Latham and Kirkland earlier in the day regarding Carlyle’s and GTCR’s response to Party
G’s non-binding indication of interest, including Carlyle’s and GTCR’s unwillingness to increase their joint proposal price and
Carlyle’s and GTCR’s joint position that they would cease their participation in our sale process if we delayed our discussions with
them in order for Party G to advance its diligence review and negotiations with us. The Special Committee also discussed Carlyle’s
and GTCR’s request for a period of exclusive negotiations and affirmed that no such exclusivity should be granted, particularly in
view of Carlyle’s and GTCR’s desire to negotiate and execute a definitive merger agreement within the next two days. The Special
Committee discussed, among other matters, the value offered to the AMRI stockholders by Carlyle’s and GTCR’s jointly proposed
price from a financial point of view, the certainty of engaging in final negotiations with Carlyle and GTCR with a view to executing
a definitive merger agreement with Carlyle and GTCR in the next two days, the certainty of value to the AMRI stockholders
associated with Carlyle’s and GTCR’s joint proposal in view of the fact that Carlyle and GTCR are highly experienced, serial
acquirors of public companies of similar size and complexity to AMRI, the fact that Party G did not have a similar profile and
experience, the additional, significant time that the Special Committee believed would be required in order for Party G to complete
its global due diligence review of AMRI based on discussions with Party G to date, the potential that Party G would reduce its
proposed price following such diligence review or otherwise require other material terms for a transaction inferior to those
proposed by Carlyle and GTCR, and the fact that Carlyle and GTCR expressed their unwillingness to continue participating in our
sale process if AMRI were to continue discussions with Party G. Following this discussion, the Special Committee concluded that
it was in the best interests of the AMRI stockholders to pursue final negotiations with Carlyle and GTCR with a view to
announcing a transaction imminently and to not jeopardize the value being provided by Carlyle and GTCR by seeking to delay the
final negotiation and execution of a definitive merger agreement with Carlyle and GTCR.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Throughout the remainder of June 4, 2017 and June 5, 2017, representatives of Goodwin, Latham and Kirkland exchanged drafts of
the merger agreement, the accompanying disclosure schedules, the equity commitment letters and the limited guarantees, and
representatives of Goodwin, Latham, Kirkland, Carlyle, GTCR, Credit Suisse and the AMRI management team held various
teleconferences to resolve outstanding issues regarding the merger agreement, the accompanying disclosure schedules, the equity
commitment letters and the limited guarantees. Also on June 5, 2017, Carlyle and GTCR provided us with their debt financing
commitment letter from Barclay’s and Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc.

During the day on June 5, 2017, representatives of Credit Suisse held a teleconference with Party G to seek clarification on certain
items included in Party G’s June 3rd non-binding indication of interest, including the intended scope and timing of Party G’s due
diligence review of AMRI and Party G’s ability and experience in acquiring companies of the size and complexity of AMRI
(including by virtue of AMRI’s international footprint). Party G indicated that it could provide the financing for a proposed
transaction with AMRI but did not specify any prior transactions that it had completed of the proposed size without a partner. In
addition, Party G provided examples of other transactions it had consummated in the healthcare industry, but the number and size
was significantly less than such transactions consummated by each of Carlyle, GTCR and other financial sponsors included earlier
in the sale process. Lastly, Party G did not provide any reasonable basis as to how it could complete a comprehensive due diligence
review of AMRI in a two to three week period when Carlyle and GTCR had required six weeks to complete the same.

On June 5, 2017, the Special Committee held a telephonic meeting at which members of management and representatives of Credit
Suisse and Goodwin were present. At this meeting, Credit Suisse reviewed and discussed its financial analyses with respect to our
Company and the proposed transaction and provided information regarding Credit Suisse’s material investment banking
relationships with Carlyle, GTCR and Party G. Thereafter, at the request of the Special Committee, Credit Suisse rendered its oral
opinion to the Special Committee (which was subsequently confirmed in writing by delivery of Credit Suisse’s written opinion
dated the same date) as to, as of June 5, 2017, the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of our common stock of the
per share merger consideration to be received by such holders in the merger pursuant to the merger agreement. Goodwin again
reviewed the fiduciary duties of the directors in connection with a potential sale of AMRI, and discussed in detail the material
terms of the proposed merger agreement. The Special Committee asked numerous questions of management, Credit Suisse and
Goodwin, and discussed the advantages and risks of the proposed transaction as described in the section entitled “— Reasons for
the Merger” as well as many of the considerations discussed at the prior day’s Special Committee meeting. After discussion, the
Special Committee unanimously recommended that the board of directors (1) determine that the merger and the other transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement are advisable and in the best interests of AMRI stockholders, (2) adopt the merger
agreement, and (3) recommend to AMRI stockholders that they adopt the merger agreement and approve the transactions
contemplated thereby at a special meeting.

Following the meeting of the Special Committee, on June 5, 2017 our board of directors held a telephonic meeting at which
members of management and representatives of Credit Suisse and Goodwin were present. At this meeting, at the request of the
Special Committee, Credit Suisse reviewed with our board of directors its financial analyses with respect to our company and the
proposed transaction and information regarding its material investment banking relationships with Carlyle, GTCR and Party G and
confirmed that it had rendered its oral opinion to the Special Committee as to, as of June 5, 2017, the fairness, from a financial
point of view, to the holders of our common stock of the per share merger consideration to be received by such holders in the
merger pursuant to the merger agreement. Goodwin again reviewed the fiduciary duties of the directors in connection with a
potential sale of AMRI, and discussed in detail the material terms of the proposed merger agreement. Our board of directors asked
numerous questions of management, Credit Suisse and Goodwin, and discussed the advantages and risks of the proposed
transaction as described in the section entitled “— Reasons for the Merger” as well as many of the considerations discussed at the
prior day’s Special Committee meeting. After discussion, and upon recommendation of the Special Committee, the board
unanimously adopted resolutions (1) determining that the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement
are advisable and in the best interests of AMRI stockholders, (2) adopting the merger agreement, and (3) recommending to AMRI
stockholders that they adopt the merger agreement and approve the transactions contemplated thereby at a special meeting.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

The parties executed the merger agreement on June 5, 2017. On the morning of Tuesday, June 6, 2017, prior to the opening of the
Nasdaq Stock Market, we issued a press release announcing that we had entered into the merger agreement.

Reasons for the Merger

During the course of its deliberations regarding the merger, our board of directors and the Special Committee held numerous
meetings and consulted with our senior management, financial advisor and outside legal counsel, and reviewed, evaluated and
considered numerous factors and a significant amount of information and data, including:

• information concerning our business, financial performance (both historical and projected) and our financial condition,
results of operations (both historical and projected), and business and strategic objectives, as well as the risks of
accomplishing those objectives;

• the possible alternatives to the merger (including a significant equity investment into our company and the option of
continuing to operate our company independently on a stand-alone basis), the timing and likelihood of accomplishing the
business plans and strategic objectives of those alternatives, and the potential benefits and risks of those alternatives;

• the results of our discussions with certain third parties who expressed interest in a potential strategic transaction with us,
and our ability under the terms of the merger agreement to negotiate with third parties concerning certain unsolicited
alternative acquisition proposals following the execution of the merger agreement; and

• the other terms of the merger agreement, including the parties’ representations, warranties and covenants, the conditions to
their respective obligations and the termination rights of the parties.

In reaching its decision to approve the merger agreement and the merger, and to recommend that AMRI stockholders adopt the
merger agreement, our board of directors and the Special Committee considered the following positive reasons to support the
merger agreement and the merger:

• the fact that the price of $21.75 per share in cash payable in the merger provides certainty, immediate value and liquidity to
AMRI stockholders;

• the fact that the $21.75 per share price to be paid in cash in respect of each share of AMRI common stock in the merger
represents:

º a 63% premium to the unaffected stock price of AMRI common stock of $13.37 as of April 5, 2017 (the last trading day
prior to public rumors in the press regarding a potential sale process),

º a 56% premium to the 30-day weighted average closing stock price leading up to April 5, 2017 (the last trading day prior
to public rumors in the press regarding a potential sale process), and

º a 42% premium to the 60-day weighted average closing stock price leading up to April 5, 2017 (the last trading day prior
to public rumors in the press regarding a potential sale process);

• the financial analyses reviewed and discussed with the Special Committee by representatives of Credit Suisse as well as the
oral opinion of Credit Suisse rendered to the Special Committee on June 5, 2017 (which was subsequently confirmed in
writing by delivery of Credit Suisse’s written opinion dated the same date) as to, as of June 5, 2017, the fairness, from a
financial point of view, to the holders of AMRI common stock of the per share merger consideration to be received by such
holders in the merger pursuant to the merger agreement;

• the directors’ knowledge of our business, financial condition, and results of operations, on both a historical and a
prospective basis;

• the process through which the Special Committee, with the assistance of Credit Suisse, engaged in or sought to engage in
discussions with other parties, including (i) the solicitation of both strategic acquirors and financial sponsors, believed to be
the most likely candidates to pursue a potential acquisition of us, (ii) various parties that contacted us on an unsolicited
basis as a result of media

speculation concerning a potential strategic transaction, (iii) the review of the proposals received by and level of interest of
the potential acquirors including Carlyle, GTCR, Party A, Party B, Party C, Party D, Party E, Party F and Party G, (iv)
management meetings with nine parties, and (v) the steps taken to foster competition;

• that discussions had been held with, and feedback received from, multiple interested or potentially interested parties as part
of the process of exploring the possibility of a transaction;

• the Special Committee’s and our board of director’s evaluation of the possible alternatives to a sale to Parent, including a
significant equity investment into our company and the option of continuing to operate our company independently on a
stand-alone basis, which alternatives the Special Committee evaluated with the assistance of its financial advisor, Credit
Suisse, and determined were likely to be less favorable to AMRI’s stockholders than the merger given the potential risks,
rewards and uncertainties associated with those alternatives;

• the likelihood that it could take a considerable period of time, if ever, before the trading price of AMRI common stock
would reach and sustain at least the per share merger consideration value of $21.75, as adjusted for present value;

• management’s forecasts provided to the board and our advisors and, in the case of the management presentation, to Carlyle
and GTCR and other potential buyers and, in each case, summarized below under “— Projected Financial Information”;

• the certainty of value to the AMRI stockholders associated with Carlyle’s and GTCR’s joint offer in view of the fact that
Carlyle and GTCR are highly experienced, serial acquirors of public companies of similar size, complexity and industry
focus to AMRI;

• the fact that the merger consideration is to be paid in all cash, which provides value certainty to AMRI’s stockholders and
allows them to monetize their investment in AMRI in the near future, while avoiding long-term business risk;

• the fact that Party G did not have a similar profile and experience to Carlyle and GTCR, that Party G’s expected timing of
completing its diligence review as compared with other parties did not appear realistic, and the additional, significant time
that the Special Committee believed would be required in order for Party G to complete its global due diligence review of
AMRI based on discussions with Party G to date;

• the potential that Party G would reduce its offer price following such diligence review or otherwise require other material
terms for a transaction inferior to those proposed by Carlyle and GTCR;

• the fact that Carlyle and GTCR expressed their unwillingness to continue participating in our sale process if AMRI were to
continue discussions with Party G;

• the likelihood that the merger would be completed, based on, among other things:

º the reputation and ability of Carlyle and GTCR to complete large acquisition transactions in our industry and their
familiarity with AMRI,

º the fact that Parent had obtained committed debt and equity financing for the transaction, the number and nature of the
conditions to the debt and equity financing, the reputation of the financing sources,

º the absence of a financing condition in the merger agreement,

º the likelihood and anticipated timing of completing the proposed merger in light of the scope of the conditions to
completion, including the fact that there were no anticipated substantive issues in connection with HSR and other
antitrust clearances and that there are no other regulatory approvals that are required to close the merger,

º the fact that the merger agreement provides that, in the event of a failure of the merger to be consummated under certain
circumstances, Parent will pay AMRI a $70.0 million reverse

termination fee, as described under “The Merger Agreement — Termination Fees”, without AMRI having to establish
any damages, the payment of which is guaranteed, severally but not jointly, by an affiliate of Carlyle and affiliates of
GTCR pursuant to their respective limited guarantees, and

º our ability, under certain circumstances pursuant to the merger agreement, to seek specific performance to prevent
breaches of the merger agreement and the equity commitment letters, as described under “The Merger
Agreement — Specific Performance” and to enforce specifically the terms of the merger agreement and the equity
commitment letters; and

• the procedural safeguards implemented by the board of directors to represent effectively the interests of AMRI’s
stockholders, including:

º the formation of the Special Committee to direct the strategic process on behalf of our board of directors, to consider and
evaluate any proposals that might be received by us regarding a potential sale transaction, participate in and direct the
negotiation of the material terms and conditions of any such transaction, and recommend to our board of directors the
advisability of entering into any such transaction or pursuing another strategic alternative should any be presented to
AMRI,

º the fact that the Special Committee and our board of directors met, along with Credit Suisse and Goodwin 19 times
between February 8, 2017 and June 5, 2017, the date the merger agreement was signed, and ultimately determined
unanimously (1) that the merger agreement is in the best interests of AMRI and its stockholders, (2) to approve the
merger agreement and the merger, (3) to recommend that the stockholders vote their shares of AMRI common stock in
favor of adoption of the merger agreement and (4) to direct that the merger agreement be submitted to the stockholders
for their adoption at a stockholders’ meeting in accordance with applicable law or regulation,

º the fact that, other than their receipt of board of directors’ fees and their interests described under “— Interests of AMRI’s
Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger”, members of the board of directors, including William Marth, Chief
Executive Officer, do not have interests in the merger different from, or in addition to, those of AMRI stockholders
generally,

º the fact that, as of the execution of the merger agreement, members of senior management had not had any material
discussions, and were not party to any binding agreements, with Parent regarding their post-closing employment with or
equity participation in the surviving entity, including with respect to any equity roll-over, and

º the other terms and conditions of the merger agreement and the course of negotiations of the merger agreement,
including the nature of the parties’ representations, warranties and covenants and provisions regarding deal certainty, and
the board of directors’ belief, after reviewing the merger agreement with its legal advisors, that the merger agreement
offered reasonable assurances as to the likelihood of consummation of the merger, did not impose unreasonable burdens
on us and would not preclude a superior proposal, noting in particular that:

▪ until the date the AMRI stockholders approve the merger, our board or any committee of our board may, if it
determines in good faith (after consultation with the Special Committee’s financial advisor or another independent
financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation and outside legal counsel) that the failure to do so would be
inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the board under applicable law, make an adverse recommendation change
due to a superior proposal or any other fact, event or development not known or reasonably foreseeable to our board
that is not related to an acquisition proposal or may cause AMRI to terminate the merger agreement and enter into a
superior proposal,

▪ the ability of the board of directors, under certain circumstances, to change, qualify, withhold, withdraw or modify its
recommendation that AMRI stockholders vote to approve the merger agreement,

▪ our ability, subject to certain conditions, to respond to, furnish information and data with respect to and participate in
discussions or negotiations with a third party if we receive a written bona fide acquisition proposal that constitutes or
could reasonably constitute a superior proposal,

▪ our ability to terminate the merger agreement to enter into a superior proposal, subject to certain conditions
(including certain rights of Parent to have an opportunity to match the superior proposal), provided that we
concurrently pay a $35.0 million termination fee in the event of a termination of the merger agreement to enter into a
superior transaction,

▪ that the reverse termination fee of $70.0 million and reimbursements payable by Parent would become payable by
Parent in certain circumstances, as described under “The Merger Agreement — Termination Fees” and “The Merger
Agreement — Reimbursement of Expenses”,

▪ the definition of “Company material adverse effect” and the exceptions for what constitutes a Company material
adverse effect for purposes of the merger agreement, and

▪ the closing conditions to the merger, including the fact that the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub under the
merger agreement are not subject to a financing condition.

In the course of its deliberations, our board of directors and the Special Committee also considered, among other things, the
following negative factors:

• the fact that AMRI stockholders will not participate in any future growth potential or benefit from any future increase in the
value of our company (whether through organic growth, extraordinary events, acquisitions or otherwise);

• the significant costs involved in connection with entering into and completing the merger and the substantial time and effort
of management required to complete the merger and related disruptions to the operation of our business;

• the risk that the proposed merger might not be completed in a timely manner or at all, including the risk that the proposed
merger will not occur if the financing contemplated by the acquisition financing commitments, described under “The
Merger — Financing”, is not obtained;

• the restrictions on the conduct of our business prior to the closing of the merger, which could delay or prevent us from
undertaking business opportunities or any other action we would otherwise take with respect to our operations pending
closing;

• the potential negative effect of the public announcement or pendency of the merger, or a failure to complete the merger,
could have on our business and particularly on relationships with our customers and employees;

• the risk of diverting management’s focus and resources from other strategic opportunities and from operational matters
while working to implement the merger;

• the risks and costs to us if the proposed merger does not close, including the diversion of management and employee
attention, potential employee attrition and the potential disruptive effect on business and customer relationships;

• the risk that certain key members of senior management might choose not to remain employed with us prior to the
completion of the merger;

• the possibility that the amounts that may be payable by us upon the termination of the merger agreement could discourage
other potential acquirors from making a competing bid to acquire us, including the possibility of the payment of a
termination fee of $35.0 million if we breach our obligations under the provisions of the merger agreement relating to the
solicitation of acquisition proposals;

• the risk that Parent’s matching rights under the merger agreement in connection with our right to terminate the agreement to
accept a superior competing acquisition proposal might discourage third parties from submitting a competing acquisition
proposal;

• the fact that Parent requires significant third party debt financing for the transaction and in the event that the lenders do not
provide the debt financing under the commitment letters, we will not be able to specifically enforce Parent’s obligations to
complete the merger and our remedy in the event of the termination of the merger agreement due to such failure to obtain
financing may be limited to receipt of the reverse termination fee and certain reimbursements as provided under the merger
agreement, and that under certain circumstances we may not be entitled to such termination fee or reimbursements;

• the fact that the merger will be taxable to many of our stockholders that are U.S. holders for U.S. federal income tax
purposes; and

• the other risks described under “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” beginning on page 16.

The preceding discussion of the information and factors considered by our board of directors and the Special Committee is not, and
is not intended to be, exhaustive. In light of the variety of factors considered in connection with its evaluation of the merger and the
complexity of these matters, our board of directors and the Special Committee did not find it practicable to, and did not, quantify or
otherwise attempt to rank or assign relative weights to the various factors considered in reaching its determination. In considering
the factors described above and any other factors, individual members of our board of directors and Special Committee may have
viewed factors differently or given different weight, merit or consideration to different factors. In addition, neither our board of
directors nor the Special Committee undertook to make any specific determination as to whether any particular factor, or any aspect
of any particular factor, was favorable or unfavorable to its ultimate determination, but rather our board of directors and the Special
Committee conducted an overall analysis of the factors described above, including discussions with and questioning of our senior
management, legal counsel and financial advisor.

Recommendation of AMRI’s Board of Directors

After careful consideration, our board of directors has unanimously approved the merger agreement and determined that the merger
and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement are advisable and in the best interests of AMRI and its
stockholders. The board unanimously recommends that stockholders vote “FOR” the proposal to adopt the merger
agreement and approve the transactions contemplated thereby.

Opinion of the Special Committee’s Financial Advisor

On June 5, 2017, Credit Suisse rendered its oral opinion to the special committee of the board (which we refer to as the “Special
Committee”) (which was subsequently confirmed in writing by delivery of Credit Suisse’s written opinion dated the same date) as
of June 5, 2017, as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of AMRI common stock of the per share merger
consideration to be received by such holders in the merger pursuant to the merger agreement.

Credit Suisse’s opinion was directed to the Special Committee, and only addressed the fairness, from a financial point of
view, to the holders of AMRI common stock of the per share merger consideration to be received by such holders in the
merger and did not address any other aspect or implication of the merger. The summary of Credit Suisse’s opinion in this
proxy statement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of its written opinion, which is included as Annex B to
this proxy statement and sets forth the procedures followed, assumptions made, qualifications, and limitations on the review

undertaken and other matters considered by Credit Suisse in connection with the preparation of its opinion. However,
neither Credit Suisse’s written opinion nor the summary of its opinion and the related analyses set forth in this proxy
statement is intended to be, and they do not constitute, advice or a recommendation to any stockholder as to how such
stockholder should vote or act with respect to any matter relating to the merger.

In arriving at its opinion, Credit Suisse:

• reviewed a draft dated June 5, 2017 of the merger agreement;

• reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information relating to AMRI;

• reviewed certain other information relating to AMRI, including financial forecasts relating to AMRI for the nine months
ended December 31, 2017 and the fiscal years ending December 31, 2018 through December 31, 2021 and certain
normalized terminal year projections and an estimate of AMRI’s perpetuity growth rate thereafter, each as prepared and
provided to Credit Suisse by the management of AMRI (see “— Projected Financial Information”), which we refer to
collectively as the “Company Projections”;

• spoke with the management of AMRI and certain of their representatives regarding the business and prospects of AMRI;

• considered certain financial and stock market data of AMRI, and compared that data with similar data for other companies
with publicly traded equity securities in businesses Credit Suisse deemed similar to those of AMRI;

• considered, to the extent publicly available, the financial terms of certain business combinations and other transactions
which have been effected or announced; and

• considered such other information, financial studies, analyses, and investigations and financial, economic, and market
criteria which Credit Suisse deemed relevant.

In connection with its review, Credit Suisse did not independently verify any of the foregoing information, and Credit Suisse
assumed and relied upon such information being complete and accurate in all respects material to its analyses and opinion. With
respect to Company Projections, management of AMRI advised Credit Suisse and Credit Suisse assumed that such financial
forecasts have been reasonably prepared in good faith on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of
the management of AMRI as to the future financial performance of AMRI. Credit Suisse expressed no view or opinion with respect
to Company Projections or the assumptions upon which they were based and, at the direction of management of AMRI, Credit
Suisse assumed that Company Projections were a reasonable basis on which to evaluate AMRI and the merger and relied upon such
information for purposes of its analyses and opinion.

For purposes of its analyses and opinion, at the Special Committee’s direction Credit Suisse assumed that, in the course of
obtaining any regulatory or third party consents, approvals or agreements in connection with the merger, no delay, limitation,
restriction or condition would be imposed that would have an adverse effect on AMRI or the contemplated benefits of the merger,
that the merger would be consummated in accordance with all applicable federal, state and local laws, and that the merger would be
consummated in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement, without waiver, modification or amendment of any term,
condition or agreement thereof that was material to Credit Suisse’s analyses or opinion. In addition, Credit Suisse was not requested
to make, and did not make, an independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of AMRI,
nor was Credit Suisse furnished with any such evaluations or appraisals. With AMRI’s consent, Credit Suisse also assumed that the
final form of the merger agreement, when executed by the parties thereto, would conform to the draft reviewed by Credit Suisse in
all respects material to Credit Suisse’s analyses and opinion.

Credit Suisse’s opinion addressed only the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of AMRI common stock of the per
share merger consideration to be received by such holders in the merger pursuant to the merger agreement and did not address any
other aspect or implication of the merger or any other agreement, arrangement or understanding entered into in connection
therewith or otherwise or the fairness of

the amount or nature of, or any other aspect relating to, any compensation or consideration to be received or otherwise payable to
any officers, directors, employees, security holders or affiliates of any party to the merger, or class of such persons, relative to the
per share merger consideration or otherwise. Furthermore, Credit Suisse did not express any advice or opinion regarding matters
that require legal, regulatory, accounting, insurance, tax, environmental, intellectual property, executive compensation or other
similar professional advice. Credit Suisse assumed that AMRI had or would obtain such advice or opinions from the appropriate
professional sources. The issuance of Credit Suisse’s opinion was approved by Credit Suisse’s authorized internal committee.

Credit Suisse’s opinion was necessarily based upon information made available to Credit Suisse as of the date of its opinion and
financial, economic, market and other conditions as they existed and could be evaluated on the date of its opinion. Credit Suisse did
not undertake, and is under no obligation, to update, revise, reaffirm or withdraw its opinion, or otherwise comment on or consider
events occurring or coming to Credit Suisse’s attention after the date of its opinion. Credit Suisse’s opinion did not address the
relative merits of the merger as compared to alternative transactions or strategies that might have been available to AMRI, nor did it
address the underlying business decision of the Special Committee, AMRI’s board of directors, or AMRI to proceed with or effect
the merger.

Credit Suisse’s opinion was for the information of the Special Committee in connection with its consideration of the merger. Credit
Suisse’s opinion did not constitute a recommendation to the Special Committee or the board of directors with respect to the
proposed merger or advice or a recommendation to any stockholder as to how such stockholder should vote or act on any matter
relating to the proposed merger.

In preparing its opinion to the Special Committee, Credit Suisse performed a variety of analyses, including those described below.
The summary of Credit Suisse’s financial analyses is not a complete description of the analyses underlying Credit Suisse’s opinion.
The preparation of such an opinion is a complex process involving various quantitative and qualitative judgments and
determinations with respect to the financial, comparative and other analytic methods employed and the adaptation and application
of those methods to the unique facts and circumstances presented. As a consequence, neither Credit Suisse’s opinion nor the
analyses underlying its opinion are readily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. Credit Suisse arrived at its
opinion based on the results of all analyses undertaken by it and assessed as a whole and did not draw, in isolation, conclusions
from or with regard to any individual analysis, analytic method or factor. Accordingly, Credit Suisse believes that its analyses must
be considered as a whole and that selecting portions of its analyses, analytic methods, and factors, without considering all analyses
and factors or the narrative description of the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the processes underlying its
analyses and opinion.

In performing its analyses, Credit Suisse considered business, economic, industry and market conditions, financial and otherwise,
and other matters as they existed on, and could be evaluated as of, the date of its opinion. No company, business or transaction used
in Credit Suisse’s analyses for comparative purposes is identical to AMRI or the proposed merger. While the results of each
analysis were taken into account in reaching its overall conclusion with respect to fairness, Credit Suisse did not make separate or
quantifiable judgments regarding individual analyses. The implied valuation reference ranges indicated by Credit Suisse’s analyses
are illustrative and not necessarily indicative of actual values nor predictive of future results or values, which may be significantly
more or less favorable than those suggested by the analyses. In addition, any analyses relating to the value of assets, businesses or
securities do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which businesses or securities actually may be sold, which may
depend on a variety of factors, many of which are beyond AMRI’s control and the control of Credit Suisse. Much of the
information used in, and accordingly the results of, Credit Suisse’s analyses are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty.

Credit Suisse’s opinion and analyses were provided to the Special Committee in connection with its consideration of the proposed
merger and were among many factors considered by the Special Committee in evaluating the proposed merger. Neither Credit
Suisse’s opinion nor its analyses were determinative of the per share merger consideration or of the views of the Special Committee
with respect to the proposed merger.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

The following is a summary of the material financial analyses performed in connection with the preparation of Credit Suisse’s
opinion rendered to the Special Committee on June 5, 2017. The analyses summarized below include information presented in
tabular format. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the analyses. Considering the data in the tables below
without considering the full narrative description of the analyses, as well as the methodologies underlying, and the assumptions,
qualifications, and limitations affecting, each analysis, could create a misleading or incomplete view of Credit Suisse’s analyses.

For purposes of its analyses, Credit Suisse reviewed a number of financial metrics including:

• Enterprise Value — generally the value as of a specified date of the relevant company’s outstanding equity securities
(taking into account its options and other outstanding convertible securities) plus the value as of such date of its net debt
(the value of its outstanding indebtedness, preferred stock, and capital lease obligations less the amount of cash on its
balance sheet).

• Adjusted EBITDA — generally the amount of the relevant company’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization for a specified time period, as adjusted for certain non-recurring items.

Selected Companies Analyses

Credit Suisse considered certain financial data for AMRI and selected companies with publicly traded equity securities Credit
Suisse deemed relevant. The selected companies are providers of active pharmaceutical ingredients or outsourced contract
development and manufacturing services worldwide to branded and generic pharmaceutical companies and were selected because
they were deemed to be similar to AMRI in one or more respects. Unless the context indicates otherwise, share prices for the
selected companies used in the selected companies analysis described below were as of June 2, 2017. The estimates of AMRI’s
future financial performance for the calendar years ending December 31, 2017 and 2018 used in the Selected Companies Analysis
described below were based on Company Projections. Estimates of the future financial performance of the selected companies
listed below for the calendar years ending December 31, 2017 and 2018 were based on publicly available research analyst estimates
for those companies.

The financial data reviewed included:

• Enterprise Value as a multiple of estimated Adjusted EBITDA for the calendar year ended December 31, 2017, or “CY
2017E Adj. EBITDA”; and

• Enterprise Value as a multiple of estimated Adjusted EBITDA for the calendar year ended December 31, 2018, or “CY
2018E Adj. EBITDA.”

The selected companies and corresponding multiples were:

(1) Shown as of 5/12/17, the last trading day prior to the public announcement of its proposed acquisition by Thermo Fisher.

Taking into account the results of the selected companies analysis, and its experience and professional judgment, Credit Suisse
applied multiple ranges of 10.0x to 12.5x AMRI’s CY 2017E Adj. EBITDA and 9.5x to 11.5x AMRI’s CY 2018E Adj. EBITDA.
The selected companies analysis indicated an implied valuation reference range of $17.00 to $27.50 per share of AMRI common
stock, as compared to the proposed per share merger consideration of $21.75 per share of AMRI common stock in the merger
pursuant to the merger agreement.

Selected Transactions Analysis

Credit Suisse also considered the financial terms of certain business combinations and other transactions Credit Suisse deemed
relevant. The selected transactions were selected because the target companies were providers of active pharmaceutical ingredients
or outsourced contract development and manufacturing services worldwide to branded and generic pharmaceutical companies and
were deemed to be similar to AMRI in one or more respects. The financial data reviewed included the implied Enterprise Value
(based on the consideration proposed to be paid in the selected transactions as of the date of announcement) as a multiple of
Adjusted EBITDA for the last twelve months, or “LTM Adj. EBITDA.” The selected transactions and corresponding multiples

Taking into account the results of the selected transactions analysis and its experience and professional judgment, Credit Suisse
applied a multiple range of 10.5x to 15.0x to AMRI’s LTM Adj. EBITDA as of March 31, 2017. The selected transactions analysis
indicated an implied valuation reference range of $15.75 to $27.00 per share of AMRI common stock as compared to the proposed
per share merger consideration of $21.75 per share of AMRI common stock in the merger pursuant to the merger agreement.

Discounted Cash Flow Analysis

Credit Suisse also performed a discounted cash flow analysis of AMRI. For purposes of its discounted cash flow analysis, Credit
Suisse calculated the net present value of the unlevered free cash flows that AMRI management projected that AMRI will generate
for the 9 months ending December 31, 2017 and the fiscal years ending December 31, 2018 through December 31, 2021 and an
illustrative terminal value based on the Company Projections. For purposes of the discounted cash flow analysis, share based
compensation was treated as a cash expense. For purposes of its discounted cash flow analysis, Credit Suisse used an estimate of
AMRI’s perpetuity growth rate ranging from 2.0% to 3.0% applied to a normalized terminal year projected 2021E adjusted
EBITDA, each as prepared and provided to Credit Suisse by the management of AMRI and discount rates ranging from 7.75% to
9.75% based on an estimate of AMRI’s weighted average cost of capital. The discounted cash flow analysis of AMRI indicated an
implied valuation reference range of $16.50 to $32.00 (rounded to the nearest $0.25) per share of AMRI common stock as
compared to the proposed per share merger consideration of $21.75 per share of AMRI common stock in the merger pursuant to the
merger agreement.

Other Information Reviewed

Historical Trading Range

Credit Suisse also noted for informational purposes the low and high intra-day trading prices of AMRI common stock for the 52-
week period ending June 2, 2017 of $12.50 and $20.50 (rounded to the nearest $0.25).

Premiums in Selected Leveraged Buyout Transactions

Credit Suisse also noted for informational purposes that applying the 25th percentile premium (15%) and 75th percentile premium
(63%) paid in selected leveraged buyout transactions with enterprise values greater than $500 million to the closing price of AMRI
common stock on April 5, 2017 (the date of the Debtwire article) resulted in implied values per share of AMRI common stock of
$15.25 and $21.75 (rounded to the nearest $0.25).

Premiums in Selected All-Cash Transactions

Credit Suisse also noted for informational purposes that applying the 25th percentile premium (17%) and 75th percentile premium
(64%) paid in selected all-cash transactions with enterprise values greater than $500 million to the closing price of AMRI common
stock on April 5, 2017 (the date of the Debtwire article) resulted in implied values per share of AMRI common stock of $15.75 and
$22.00 (rounded to the nearest $0.25).

Leveraged Buyout Analysis

Credit Suisse also noted for informational purposes that a leveraged buyout analysis assuming 6.5x maximum leverage, an internal
rate of return ranging from 17.5% to 22.5% and an exit multiple range from 9.5x to 12.5x normalized terminal year 2021E adjusted
EBITDA resulted in an implied value per share of AMRI common stock ranging from $16.00 to $26.25 (rounded to the nearest
$0.25).

Other Matters

The Special Committee retained Credit Suisse as its financial advisor in connection with a potential sale of AMRI or other similar
transaction based on Credit Suisse’s qualifications, experience and reputation as an internationally recognized investment banking
and financial advisory firm. Credit Suisse will receive a transaction fee currently estimated to be approximately $16 million
contingent upon the consummation of the merger. In addition, AMRI has agreed to reimburse Credit Suisse for certain of its
expenses and indemnify Credit Suisse and certain related parties for certain liabilities and other items arising out of or related to its
engagement.

Credit Suisse and its affiliates have in the past provided investment banking and financial services to Parent and/or certain of its
affiliates, including affiliates and portfolio companies of investment funds affiliated or associated with Carlyle Investment
Management L.L.C. and GTCR LLC (collectively, the “Sponsor Group”) for which Credit Suisse and its affiliates have received
and would expect to receive compensation including, among other things, during the past two years (i) with respect to Carlyle,
having provided or otherwise participated in the refinancing and recapitalization of Pharmaceutical Product Development, Inc. in
2015 and 2017, respectively, having provided or otherwise participated in the financing for the acquisition of Novolex Holdings,
Inc. by an affiliate of Carlyle in 2016, having provided or otherwise participated in the financing for the acquisition of Arctic
Glacier Inc. by an affiliate of Carlyle in 2017, having participated in the sale of a block of shares of Booz Allen Hamilton Inc. by an
affiliate of Carlyle in 2016, having provided or otherwise participated in the financing of the acquisition of Atotech Gmbh by an
affiliate of Carlyle in 2017 and having acted as joint arranger and joint bookrunner of an offering of debt securities by NBTY, Inc.
in 2016, for which services Credit Suisse and its affiliates received aggregate fees of approximately $55 million and (ii) with
respect to GTCR, having provided financial advisory services and having provided and/or otherwise participated in the financing
for the acquisition of Inteliquent, Inc. by Onvoy, LLC, in 2017, for which advice and services Credit Suisse and its affiliates
received aggregate fees of approximately $20 million. Credit Suisse and/or its affiliates are also lenders to members of Carlyle and
GTCR. Credit Suisse and its affiliates may have provided other investment banking and financial services, and may in the future
provide investment

our sales process. Credit Suisse is a full service securities firm engaged in securities trading and brokerage activities as well as
providing investment banking and other financial services. In the ordinary course of business, Credit Suisse and its affiliates may
acquire, hold or sell, for it and its affiliates’ own accounts and the accounts of customers, equity, debt, and other securities and

and their affiliates.

Projected Financial Information

AMRI does not, as a matter of course, make public projections as to future performance or earnings beyond the current fiscal year
and generally does not make public projections for extended periods due to, among other things, the inherent difficulty of
predicting financial performance for future periods and the likelihood that the underlying assumptions and estimates may not be
realized. In connection with the evaluation of potential strategic alternatives by our board of directors, however, our management
prepared certain unaudited prospective financial information for AMRI based on our long-range plan. The financial projections
were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure and, accordingly, do not necessarily comply with published guidelines of
the SEC or established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation and presentation of prospective
financial information or generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). Our independent registered public accounting firm
has not compiled, examined, audited or performed any procedures with respect to the financial projections, and has not expressed
any opinion or any other form of assurance regarding this information or its achievability.

The table below presents a summary of the financial projections for fiscal years 2017 through 2021 as prepared by our management
and provided to our board in their evaluation of the merger agreement and to Credit Suisse for its use and reliance in connection
with preparing its financial analyses and opinion to the board as described above under the heading “— Opinion of AMRI’s
Financial Advisor.” We also provided these management projections to GTCR and Carlyle.

The table below is included solely to provide AMRI stockholders access to certain financial projections that were made available to
our board, Credit Suisse, and GTCR and Carlyle in connection with the proposed merger, and is not included in this proxy
statement to influence an AMRI stockholder’s decision whether to vote for the merger agreement or for any other purpose.

The financial projections, while presented with numerical specificity, were based on numerous variables and assumptions that
necessarily involve judgments with respect to, among other things, future economic, competitive, regulatory, and financial market
conditions, all of which are difficult or impossible to predict and many of which are beyond our control. The financial projections
also reflect assumptions as to certain business decisions that are subject to change. Given that the financial projections cover
multiple years, by their nature, they become subject to greater uncertainty with each successive year. Important factors that may
affect actual results and the achievability of the financial projections include, but are not limited to, general economic conditions
and disruptions in the financial, debt, capital, credit, or securities markets, developing industry dynamics, acceptance of our
products and services, competition, our ability to obtain financing, and those risks and uncertainties described in our Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on
Form 8-K. See also the section entitled “Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements” in this proxy statement.

In addition, the financial projections reflect assumptions that are subject to change and are susceptible to multiple interpretations
and periodic revisions based on actual results, revised prospects for our business, changes in general business or economic
conditions, or any other transaction or event that has occurred or that may occur and that was not anticipated when the financial
projections were prepared. In addition, the financial projections may be affected by our ability to achieve strategic goals, objectives,
and targets over the applicable period. Accordingly, actual results will differ, and may differ materially, from those contained in the
financial projections. In addition, the financial projections do not take into account any circumstances, transactions or events
occurring after the date on which the financial projections were prepared and do not give effect to any

changes or expenses as a result of the merger or any effects of the merger. There can be no assurance that the financial results in the
financial projections will be realized, or that future actual financial results will not materially vary from those estimated in the
financial projections.

AMRI uses financial information that has not been prepared in accordance with GAAP, including adjusted EBITDA and adjusted
EBIT. We use these non-GAAP financial measures in analyzing our financial results and believe that they enhance investors’
understanding of our financial performance and the comparability of our results to prior periods, as well as against the performance
of other companies. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial
information prepared in accordance with GAAP. AMRI’s calculation of non-GAAP financial measures may differ from others in its
industry and adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBIT are not necessarily comparable with similar titles used by other companies.

The following is a summary of management’s financial projections for fiscal years 2017 through 2021 (dollars in millions):
      
 Management Projections(1)

 

Normalized

(1) The projected financial data provided in this table has not been updated to reflect AMRI’s current views of its future financial
performance, and should not be treated as guidance with respect to projected results for 2017 or any other period.

(2) Unlevered free cash flow is the Adjusted EBITDA less stock-based compensation, less taxes, plus/minus the change in net
working capital and less capital expenditures.

The inclusion of selected elements of the financial projections in the table and accompanying narrative above should not be
regarded as an indication that AMRI and/or any of our affiliates, officers, directors, advisors or other representatives consider the
financial projections to be predictive of actual future events, and this information should not be relied upon as such. None of AMRI
and/or our affiliates, officers, directors, advisors or other representatives gives any AMRI stockholder or any other person any
assurance that actual results will not differ materially from the financial projections and, except as otherwise required by law,
AMRI and/or our affiliates, officers, directors, advisors or other representatives undertake no obligation to update or otherwise
revise or reconcile the financial projections to reflect circumstances existing after the date on which the financial projections were
prepared or to reflect the occurrence of future events, even in the event that any or all of the assumptions and estimates underlying
the financial projections are shown to be in error. We have made no representation to Parent or Merger Sub concerning the financial
projections in the merger agreement or otherwise.

In light of the foregoing factors and the uncertainties inherent in the financial projections, AMRI stockholders are
cautioned not to place undue, if any, reliance on such financial projections.

Financing

General.  AMRI and Parent estimate that the total amount of funds required to complete the merger and related transactions and
pay related fees and expenses will be approximately $1.955 billion. Parent expects this amount to be funded through a combination
of the following:

• debt financing in an aggregate principal amount of $960 million, consisting of $720 million in senior secured first-lien
credit facilities (consisting of a $100 million multi-currency revolving credit facility and a $620 million term loan facility)
and a $240 million senior secured second-lien credit facility; and

TABLE OF CONTENTS

• equity financing of up to approximately $995 million in the aggregate to be provided by investment funds affiliated with
Carlyle and investment funds affiliated with GTCR or other parties to which they assign a portion of their commitments.

Equity Financing.  On June 5, 2017, each of the Investors/Guarantors entered into an equity commitment letter (the “Equity
Commitment Letters”) with Parent pursuant to which the Investors/Guarantors committed to contribute (or cause to be contributed)
to Parent up to $995 million in cash in the aggregate in exchange for equity and/or debt securities of Parent. The equity
commitment of the Investors/Guarantors is subject to the following conditions:

• satisfaction or waiver of the conditions precedent to Parent’s and Merger Sub’s obligations to complete the merger;

• the merger agreement not having been terminated at the time of the contribution;

• the prior or concurrent funding by all other Investors/Guarantors of their commitments under the Equity Commitment
Letters; and

• the concurrent funding of the debt financing.

The obligation of each Investor/Guarantor to fund the equity commitment will automatically and immediately terminate upon the
earliest to occur of: (1) the satisfaction in full of all obligations of Parent and/or Merger Sub in connection with the closing in
accordance with the merger agreement; (2) the valid termination of the merger agreement in accordance with its terms; (3) AMRI
or any of its affiliates asserting specified prohibited claims against the Investor/Guarantor, Parent, Merger Sub or certain of their
respective affiliates; or (4) the Investor/Guarantor’s payment in full of its obligations under the limited guarantee executed by the
Investor/Guarantor in favor of AMRI (as described in more detail under “Limited Guarantees”).

AMRI is an express third-party beneficiary of the Equity Commitment Letters and has the right to seek specific performance of the
obligations of the Investors/Guarantors under the Equity Commitment Letters under certain circumstances.

Debt Financing.  In connection with the entry into the merger agreement, Barclays Bank PLC, Morgan Stanley Senior Funding,
Inc., Royal Bank of Canada, Goldman Sachs Bank USA, Jefferies Finance LLC, and Mizuho Bank, Ltd. (together, the “Lenders”),
provided commitments to Merger Sub under an amended and restated commitment letter dated June 27, 2017 (the “Debt
Commitment Letter”), which provides for a commitment that adds up to the full amount of the debt financing subject to terms and
express conditions. Under the Debt Commitment Letter, the Lenders have committed to provide an aggregate principal amount of
$960 million in debt financing, consisting of $720 million in senior secured first-lien credit facilities (consisting of a $100 million
multi-currency revolving credit facility and a $620 million first-lien term loan facility) and a $240 million senior secured second-
lien credit facility.

The Lenders’ obligation to provide the debt financing under the Debt Commitment Letter is subject to customary conditions,
including the following (subject to certain exceptions and qualifications as set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter):

• the substantially simultaneous closing of the merger in accordance in all material respects with the merger agreement;

• the substantially simultaneous funding of the equity financing;

• the substantially simultaneous repayment, refinancing or other termination (or notice thereof) of certain third party
indebtedness of AMRI;

• the receipt of certain specified financial statements of AMRI and Merger Sub;

• the execution and delivery of definitive documentation with respect to the debt financing;

• the absence of a continuing material adverse effect (as defined in the merger agreement) on AMRI since June 5, 2017;

• the payment by Merger Sub of all fees and out-of-pocket expenses required pursuant to the Debt Commitment Letter and
invoiced at least three business days prior to the closing of the merger;

• the expiration of a fifteen day marketing period, subject to the terms of the Debt Commitment Letter; and

• the delivery by AMRI of documentation (including certain security documentation) and other information reasonably
requested by the Lenders.

The commitment of the Lenders under the Debt Commitment Letter expires upon the earliest of (1) five business days after the end
date under the merger agreement as in effect on June 5, 2017 (if the initial borrowing has not occurred prior to that date), (2) the
funding of the debt financing, (3) the valid termination of the merger agreement without the use of the debt financing, and (4) the
completion of the merger without the use of the debt financing. In addition, subject to certain surviving provisions and obligations,
Merger Sub may at any time terminate the commitments under the Debt Commitment Letter.

Limited Guarantees

Concurrently with the execution of the merger agreement, each of the Investors/Guarantors has executed and delivered a limited
guarantee in favor of AMRI (collectively, the “Limited Guarantees”), pursuant to which each Investor/Guarantor has agreed,
subject to the terms and conditions of the Limited Guarantee, to guarantee, on a several basis, the payment of its applicable
percentage of Parent’s obligations to pay the Parent termination fee (as described in more detail under “The Merger
Agreement — Termination Fees”), certain reimbursement and indemnification obligations in connection with the debt financing and
certain actions taken with respect to AMRI’s Note Hedge Instruments and Warrants, and certain collection and interest payment
obligations under the merger agreement, which are referred to as the “Guaranteed Obligations.” The Guaranteed Obligations of
GTCR are subject to a cap in an amount equal to GTCR’s applicable percentage of the Guaranteed Obligations, minus any portion
of the Guaranteed Obligations actually paid to AMRI by Parent or Merger Sub. The Guaranteed Obligations of Carlyle are subject
to a cap in an amount equal to Carlyle’s applicable percentage of the Guaranteed Obligations, minus any portion of the Guaranteed
Obligations actually paid to AMRI by Parent or Merger Sub.

Each of the Limited Guarantees will terminate upon the earliest to occur of:

• the closing of the merger;

• the payment, performance, and/or satisfaction in full, or the waiver by AMRI, of the Guaranteed Obligations; and

• the valid termination of the merger agreement (other than (i) termination by AMRI (A) as a result of an uncured breach by
Parent or Merger Sub of any representation, warrant or covenant under the merger agreement, or (B) if the merger has not
been consummated within a specified time following satisfaction or waiver of all closing conditions, or (ii) in a
circumstance in which AMRI may be entitled to payment of certain of the Guaranteed Obligations, in which case each
Limited Guarantee will terminate on the 180th day following termination of the merger agreement) unless AMRI shall have
asserted a claim or commenced an action alleging that any Guaranteed Obligations are due and owing to AMRI.

In the event that AMRI or any of its affiliates asserts in any litigation or other legal proceeding relating to a Limited Guarantee that
certain provisions of the Limited Guarantee are illegal, invalid, or unenforceable or that the Investor/Guarantor is liable in excess of
the cap or other specified permitted claims, then (1) the obligations of such Investor/Guarantor under such Limited Guarantee will
terminate, (2) if such Investor/Guarantor has previously made any payments under its Limited Guarantee, it will be entitled to
recover such payments from AMRI and (3) the Investor/Guarantor will not have any liability to AMRI with respect to the merger
agreement or such Limited Guarantee.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Interests of AMRI’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger

General.  In considering the recommendation of our board of directors that you vote to adopt the merger agreement and approve the
transactions contemplated thereby, you should be aware that, aside from their interests as stockholders of AMRI, AMRI’s directors
and executive officers have interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, those of other stockholders of AMRI
generally. Members of the board were aware of and considered these interests, among other matters, in evaluating and negotiating
the merger agreement and the merger, and in recommending to AMRI stockholders that the merger agreement be adopted. See the
section entitled “The Merger (Proposal 1) — Reasons for the Merger.” AMRI stockholders should take these interests into account
in deciding whether to vote “FOR” the proposal to adopt the merger agreement and to approve the transactions contemplated
thereby. These interests are described in more detail below, and certain of them are quantified in the narrative and the tables below.

AMRI’s directors and executive officers are as follows:
 

Name  Position
William S. Marth  President and Chief Executive Officer, Director
Milton Boyer  Senior Vice President, Drug Product
Christopher M. Conway  Senior Vice President, Discovery, Development & Analytical Services
Margalit Fine  Executive Vice President, API
Steven R. Hagen, Ph.D.  Senior Vice President, Quality and Compliance
Lori M. Henderson

 
Senior Vice President, Secretary, General Counsel, and Head of Business
Development

Felicia I. Ladin  Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Treasurer
George Svokos  Chief Operating Officer
Thomas E. D’Ambra, Ph.D.  Chairman of the Board of Directors
David H. Deming  Director
Gerardo Gutiérrez  Director
Kenneth P. Hagen  Director
Anthony J. Maddaluna  Director
Fernando Napolitano  Director
Kevin O’Connor  Director

Equity-Based Awards.  The following table identifies for each of our executive officers and directors: (i) the number of shares
subject to each type of outstanding equity award (AMRI stock options, RSUs, PSUs, and restricted stock awards), (ii) the weighted
average exercise price of his or her outstanding AMRI stock options, (iii) the aggregate value of each type of equity award payable
in the merger, and (iv) the total consideration payable in respect of his or her equity awards in the merger (not reflecting any
withholdings). All equity awards, including those held by our executive officers and directors, will be fully vested in accordance
with their terms and cashed out in connection with the merger, including PSUs. The following table assumes that (A) the closing of
the merger occurs on September 1, 2017, and (B) no AMRI stock options are exercised, no PSUs are deemed earned as described in
footnote 3 accompanying this table, no RSUs or shares of restricted stock are settled or forfeited, and no dividends are paid with
respect to AMRI common stock, in each case, between the date of this proxy statement and the closing of the merger. The
estimated aggregate amounts set forth below are based on the merger consideration of $21.75 payable in cash, without interest, for
each share of AMRI common stock, net of the applicable exercise price (for AMRI stock options only), multiplied by the total
number of shares of AMRI common stock subject to each applicable award.

(1) The amounts included in the column are equal to (a) the aggregate number of shares of AMRI common stock subject to AMRI
stock options multiplied by (b) the positive difference, if any, between the per share merger consideration of $21.75 per share
and the weighted average exercise price of such AMRI stock options.

(2) The amounts included in this column are equal to (a) the number of shares of AMRI common stock subject to the RSUs
multiplied by (b) the per share merger consideration of $21.75.

(3) The amounts included in this column are equal to (a) the number of shares of AMRI common stock subject to the PSUs
multiplied by (b) the per share merger consideration of $21.75. With respect to PSUs held by each executive officer, the number
of shares of AMRI common stock deemed earned is equal to the greater of the number of shares earned based on achievement of
(i) 100% of target performance or (ii) actual performance measured as of the effective time. For purposes of calculating the
value of outstanding PSUs, it has been assumed that all such awards have been deemed earned at maximum performance.

(4) The amounts included in this column are equal to (a) the number of shares of AMRI restricted stock multiplied by (b) the per
share merger consideration of $21.75.

Special Bonus Payments.  AMRI will provide each member of the Special Committee of our board of directors, which was
established to evaluate the merger, with a special bonus payment of $25,000 and $50,000 for the chairman, in each case for his
additional time commitment and service on the Special Committee. The special bonus payments to the members of the Special
Committee are not contingent upon consummation of the merger. The Special Committee members are David Deming (chairman),
Kenneth Hagen, Kevin O’Connor and Anthony Maddaluna. Such one-time payments will be paid upon consummation of the
merger.

Employment Agreements.  Select employees, including certain of AMRI’s executive officers, are party to employment agreements
that provide for (1) severance benefits in the event of an involuntary termination of employment by AMRI without Cause (as
defined in the respective employment agreement and not due to death or disability), or by the executive officer for Good Reason (as
defined in the respective employment agreement) (each, a “qualifying termination”), (2) certain enhanced severance benefits if such
qualifying termination occurs within two years following a Change of Control (as defined in the respective employment agreement)
and (3) certain Change of Control benefits that are provided regardless of whether a qualifying

TABLE OF CONTENTS

termination occurs. The contemplated merger would constitute a Change of Control under each of the employment agreements with
AMRI’s executive officers. The following description sets forth the material terms of the agreements with AMRI’s executive
officers.

Mr. Marth.  The employment agreement with Mr. Marth provides that in the event of a qualifying termination, subject to his timely
execution and non-revocation of an effective general release of claims in favor of AMRI, he would be entitled to the following:

• base salary continuation for two years following such termination, payable in monthly installments; provided that in
connection with a qualifying termination during the two-year period following a Change of Control, the cash severance
amount will equal 2.0 times the sum of Mr. Marth’s (i) annual base salary and (ii) target annual bonus for the year of
termination, payable in a lump sum;

• an amount equal to Mr. Marth’s annual bonus actually received for the year immediately preceding such termination,
payable in monthly installments over the two-year period following such termination; provided that no such amount would
be payable in the event of a qualifying termination during the two-year period following a Change of Control;

• a pro-rated annual bonus (pro-rated based on the number of days of Mr. Marth’s actual employment with AMRI during the
applicable calendar year, determined based on actual performance for the entire year of termination and payable in the
ordinary course); provided that in connection with a qualifying termination during the two-year period following a Change
of Control, the pro-rated annual bonus will be based on target performance and payable within 30 days following the date of
such termination;

• up to one year of outplacement support at AMRI’s expense;

• health and dental insurance benefits continuation for two years following such termination; and

• in the event of a qualifying termination during the two-year period following a Change of Control, full vesting of all AMRI
contributions made to AMRI’s 401(k) plan, profit sharing or other retirement accounts on his behalf.

The employment agreement with Mr. Marth provides that in the event of a termination of employment due to death or permanent
disability, he would be entitled to a pro-rated annual bonus (determined based on actual performance for the year of termination)
and, in the case of a permanent disability, health and dental insurance continuation for twelve months following termination.

Other Executive Officers.  The employment agreements with each of Ms. Henderson, Ms. Ladin, Dr. Hagen, Mr. Conway, Mr.
Boyer and Mr. Svokos provide for the following payments and benefits in the event of a qualifying termination, subject to the
applicable executive officer’s timely execution and non-revocation of an effective general release of claims in favor of AMRI:

• base salary continuation for one year following such termination, payable in monthly installments; provided that in
connection with a qualifying termination during the two-year period following a Change of Control, the cash severance
amount will equal 1.5 times the sum of such executive officer’s (i) annual base salary and (ii) target annual bonus for the
year of termination, payable in a lump sum;

• an amount equal to the executive officer’s annual bonus actually received for the year immediately preceding such
termination, payable in monthly installments over the one-year period following such termination; provided that no such
amount would be payable in the event of a qualifying termination during the two-year period following a Change of
Control;

• up to one year of outplacement support at AMRI’s expense; and

• health and dental insurance benefits continuation for 12 months following such termination; provided that in connection
with a qualifying termination during the two-year period following a Change of Control, the health and dental insurance
benefits continuation will be for 18 months.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

The employment agreements with each of Ms. Henderson, Ms. Ladin, Dr. Hagen, Mr. Conway, Mr. Boyer and Mr. Svokos provide
that in the event of a termination of employment due to death or permanent disability, he or she would be entitled to a pro-rated
annual bonus (determined based on actual performance for the year of termination) and, in the case of a permanent disability, health
and dental insurance continuation for twelve months following termination.

In addition, pursuant to the terms of his or her respective employment agreement, upon a Change of Control (regardless of whether
a qualifying termination has occurred), each of the executive officers (other than Mr. Marth and Ms. Fine) is entitled to (i) full
vesting of all AMRI contributions made to AMRI’s 401(k) plan, profit sharing or other retirement accounts made on such executive
officer’s behalf and (ii) a pro-rated annual bonus (determined based on target performance for the year in which the Change of
Control occurred), which will become payable within 30 days of a Change of Control. Pursuant to the terms of the merger
agreement, the parties agreed that Mr. Marth and Ms. Fine would be entitled to a similar arrangement with respect to the pro-rated
annual bonus and also would receive his or her pro-rated target bonus within 30 days of a Change of Control (which in the case of
Mr. Marth would accelerate, but not augment, the pro-rated bonus to which he is entitled to under his employment agreement in the
event of a qualifying termination). Each employment agreement with AMRI’s executive officers also provides for full vesting of all
equity awards upon a Change of Control.

In consideration of the payments and benefits under his or her employment agreement, each executive officer has also entered into
an Employee Non-Disclosure, Proprietary Information, Inventions, and Non-Solicitation Agreement, which outlines restrictions
relating to confidentiality and non-solicitation of AMRI’s employees for a certain period.

Each of the employment agreements (other than the directorship agreement with Ms. Fine discussed below) contains a “best after-
tax benefit” provision, which provides that, to the extent that the amount of any compensation, payment or distribution paid,
payable, distributed or distributable to an executive officer under such agreement or otherwise (the “Change in Control Payments”)
would be subject to the federal tax levied on certain “excess parachute payments” under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), AMRI will either (i) pay the executive officer the full amount of the Change in Control
Payments, or (ii) reduce his or her Change in Control Payments such that no Section 4999 excise tax would be due. AMRI will pay
the full amount of the Change in Control Payments if the Change in Control Payments reduced by the sum of (A) the Section 4999
excise tax and (B) the total of all federal, state, local and employment taxes payable by the executive on the amount of the Change
in Control Payments in excess of the executive’s Section 280G safe harbor amount are greater than or equal to the executive’s
Section 280G safe harbor amount.

Ms. Fine.  Pursuant to a directorship agreement with Ms. Fine, in the event Ms. Fine’s employment is terminated as a “Good
Leaver,” which includes Ms. Fine’s resignation upon request of AMRI for reasons other than “Just Cause” (as defined in such
directorship agreement) or due to any material breach by AMRI of its obligations under such directorship agreement, she would be
entitled to a “termination indemnity” (as defined in her directorship agreement) equal to her base salary payable over the remaining
term of the directorship agreement plus the pro rata bonus accrued up to the date of termination.

For an estimate of the value of the payments and benefits described above that would become payable to AMRI’s named executive
officers under the employment agreements in the event of a qualifying termination in connection with the merger, see “— “Golden
Parachute” Compensation for AMRI’s Named Executive Officers,” and the assumptions set forth under that subheading, below.

Indemnification and Insurance.  Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, AMRI’s directors and executive officers will be
entitled to certain ongoing indemnification and coverage under directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policies. See “The Merger
Agreement — Other Covenants and Agreements — Indemnification of Directors and Officers; Insurance” on page 78 below for a
description of such ongoing indemnification and insurance coverage obligations.

“Golden Parachute” Compensation for AMRI’s Named Executive Officers.  The information set forth below is intended to comply
with Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K regarding specified compensation that is based on or

otherwise relates to the merger that is payable or may become payable to each of AMRI’s named executive officers who were
named executive officers in AMRI’s most recent filing with the SEC under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Exchange Act (the
“named executive officers”). This compensation is referred to as “golden parachute” compensation by the applicable SEC
disclosure rules.

The table below sets forth an estimate of the approximate values of “golden parachute” compensation that may become payable to
our named executive officers in connection with the merger as described in this proxy statement. The table assumes that (i) the
closing of the merger will occur on September 1, 2017, (ii) a qualifying termination of employment occurs immediately following
the closing of the merger, (iii) no withholding tax amounts are deducted from any payments set forth in the table, (iv) no payments
are delayed for six months to the extent required under Section 409A of the Code and (v) no payments are subject to reduction to
the extent required by the terms of any applicable employment agreement to account for the application of Section 4999 of the
Code to such payments. The amounts set forth in the table are estimates based on the $21.75 per share merger consideration. As a
result of these assumptions and estimates, and the additional assumptions and estimates described in the footnotes accompanying
this table, the actual amounts, if any, that a named executive officer ultimately receives may materially differ from the amounts set
forth in the below table. For additional details regarding the terms of the payments described below, see the discussion above in this
section.

(1) The cash amounts payable to each of the named executive officers consist of: (a) a severance payment, payable in a lump sum,
in an amount equal to 1.5 times (or, with respect to Mr. Marth, 2.0 times) the sum of such named executive officer’s (x) annual
base salary and (y) target annual bonus for the year of termination; and (b) a pro rata portion of the named executive officer’s
target annual bonus for the year of the Change of Control. The cash severance payments are “double-trigger” and would be due
in the event of a qualifying termination of the named executive officer’s employment within two years after closing of the
merger; and the pro-rated annual bonus payments are “single-trigger” and payable upon the closing of the merger, even if no
qualifying termination occurs. The cash severance payments are subject to the executive’s timely execution and non-revocation
of a release of claims against AMRI. Set forth below are the aggregate values of the cash amounts that are attributable to the
cash severance and pro-rata target annual bonus, as reflected in the table above.

(2) All unvested equity awards held by the named executive officers will accelerate and be cashed out in connection with the
closing of the merger. For additional details regarding the treatment of these equity awards in the merger, see “The Merger
Agreement — Treatment of Company Equity Awards.” The values attributable to (a) AMRI stock options, (b) RSUs, (c) PSUs,

(3) These perquisites/benefits amounts include the following: (a) the estimated value of the premiums for health and dental
continuation coverage under AMRI’s benefit plans for 18 months (24 months for Mr. Marth); (b) the value attributable to full
vesting of all AMRI contributions on the named executive officer’s behalf to AMRI’s 401(k) plan, if any; and (c) the estimated
value of outplacement support services for 12 months for all named executive officers. In each case, pursuant to the terms of the
employment agreements, such amounts are “double-trigger” and would be due in the event of a qualifying termination of the
named executive officer’s employment within two years after completion of the merger, except that the full vesting of all AMRI
contributions made to AMRI’s 401(k) plan with respect to each named executive officer (except for Mr. Marth) is “single-
trigger” and occurs upon the closing of the merger. With respect to the benefits continuation payments, such amounts are based
on the applicable named executive officer’s elected level of coverage for plan year 2017 and the rate applicable to such coverage
effective for calendar year 2017.

Arrangements with Parent

As of the date of this proxy statement, none of our executive officers has entered into any agreement with Parent or any of its
affiliates regarding employment with, or the right to purchase or participate in the equity of, the surviving corporation or one or
more of its affiliates. Following the public announcement of the transaction, representatives of Carlyle and GTCR discussed
with our executive officers the general terms and structure of equity incentive compensation that may be offered to our
executive officers and other employees following the closing of merger, though no agreements were reached regarding such
structure or any grant of any equity incentive compensation. Prior to or following the closing of the merger, however, some or
all of our executive officers or other employees may further discuss or enter into agreements with Parent or any of its affiliates
regarding employment with, or the right to purchase or participate in the equity of, the surviving corporation or one or more of
its affiliates.

Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger

The following is a general discussion of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger to holders of common
stock whose shares are exchanged for cash pursuant to the merger. This discussion does not address U.S. federal income tax
consequences with respect to non-U.S. holders except to the extent specifically described below. This discussion is based on the
provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), applicable U.S. Treasury regulations, judicial opinions,
and administrative rulings and published positions of the Internal Revenue Service, each as in effect as of the date of this proxy
statement. These authorities are subject to change, possibly on a retroactive basis, and any such change could affect the accuracy of
the statements and conclusions set forth in this discussion. This discussion does not address any tax consequences arising under the
unearned income Medicare contribution tax pursuant to the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, nor does it
address the alternative minimum tax or any tax considerations under state, local, or foreign laws or U.S. federal laws other than
those pertaining to the U.S. federal income tax. This discussion is not binding on the Internal Revenue Service or the courts and,
therefore, the tax consequences of the merger described herein could be subject to challenge, which could be sustained. No ruling is
intended to be sought from the Internal Revenue Service with respect to the merger.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

For purposes of this discussion, the term “U.S. holder” means a beneficial owner of common stock that is for U.S. federal income
tax purposes:

• a citizen or individual resident of the United States;

• a corporation, or other entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, created or organized in or under
the laws of the United States, any state thereof, or the District of Columbia;

• a trust if (1) a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the trust’s administration and one
or more U.S. persons are authorized to control all substantial decisions of the trust, or (2) has a valid election in effect under
applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations to be treated as a U.S. person; or

• an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of its source.

For purposes of this discussion, a “non-U.S. holder” is a beneficial owner of common stock, other than a partnership or other entity
taxable as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, that is not a U.S. holder.

This discussion applies only to U.S. holders of shares of common stock who hold such shares as a capital asset within the meaning
of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment). Further, this discussion does not purport to consider all
aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to a U.S. holder in light of its particular circumstances, or that may
apply to a U.S. holder that is subject to special treatment under the U.S. federal income tax laws (including, for example, insurance
companies, controlled foreign corporations, passive foreign investment companies, dealers or brokers in securities or foreign
currencies, traders in securities who elect the mark-to-market method of accounting, holders subject to the alternative minimum tax,
U.S. holders that have a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar, tax-exempt organizations, banks and certain other financial
institutions, mutual funds, certain expatriates, partnerships, S corporations, or other pass-through entities or investors in
partnerships or such other entities, U.S. holders who hold shares of common stock as part of a hedge, straddle, constructive sale, or
conversion transaction, U.S. holders who will hold, directly or indirectly, an equity interest in the surviving corporation, and U.S.
holders who acquired their shares of common stock through the exercise of employee stock options or other compensation
arrangements).

If a partnership (including for this purpose any entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes)
holds shares of common stock, the tax treatment of a partner in such partnership will generally depend on the status of the partners
and the activities of the partnership. If you are a partner of a partnership holding shares of common stock, you should consult your
tax advisor.

Holders of common stock are urged to consult their own tax advisors to determine the particular tax consequences to them
of the merger, including the applicability and effect of the alternative minimum tax, and any state, local, foreign or other
tax laws.

Consequences to U.S. Holders.  The receipt of cash by U.S. holders in exchange for shares of common stock pursuant to the merger
will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes and may also be a taxable transaction under applicable state,
local, foreign, and other tax laws. In general, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, a U.S. holder who receives cash in exchange for
shares of common stock pursuant to the merger will recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between (1)
the amount of cash received and (2) the U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in such shares.

If a U.S. holder’s holding period in the shares of common stock surrendered in the merger is greater than one year as of the date of
the merger, the gain or loss will be long-term capital gain or loss. Long-term capital gains of certain non-corporate holders,
including individuals, are generally subject to U.S. federal income tax at preferential rates. If a U.S. holder’s holding period in the
shares of common stock surrendered in the merger is one year or less as of the date of the merger, the gain or loss will be short-term
capital gain or loss, with any short-term capital gain generally subject to tax at rates as high as the rates applicable to ordinary
income. The deductibility of a capital loss recognized on the exchange is subject to limitations. If a

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1065087/000114420417036873/v470292_defm14a.htm 71/192

 

TABLE OF CONTENTS

U.S. holder acquired different blocks of common stock at different times and different prices, such U.S. holder must determine its
adjusted tax basis and holding period separately with respect to each block of common stock.

Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders.  A non-U.S. holder whose shares of common stock are converted into the right to receive cash
in the merger generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income taxation unless:

• gain resulting from the merger is effectively connected with the non-U.S. holder’s conduct of a U.S. trade or business (and,
if required by any applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to a United States permanent establishment of the non-U.S.
holder);

• the non-U.S. holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the individual’s taxable year
in which the merger occurs and certain other conditions are satisfied; or

• AMRI is or has been a U.S. real property holding corporation (such corporation is referred to as a “USRPHC”) as defined in
Section 897 of the Code at any time within the five-year period preceding the merger, the non-U.S. holder owned (or is
treated as owning under applicable stock ownership attribution rules set forth in the Code) more than five percent of the
common stock at any time within that five-year period, and certain other conditions are satisfied. We believe that, as of the
effective date of the merger, we will not have been a USRPHC at any time within the five-year period ending on the date
thereof.

Any gain recognized by a non-U.S. holder described in the first bullet above generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on
a net income basis at regular graduated U.S. federal income tax rates in the same manner as if such holder were a “U.S. person” as
defined under the Code. A non-U.S. holder that is a corporation may also be subject to an additional “branch profits tax” at a rate of
30% (or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable income tax treaty) on after-tax profits effectively connected with a
U.S. trade or business to the extent that such after-tax profits are not reinvested and maintained in the U.S. business.

Gain described in the second bullet above generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a flat 30% rate, but may be offset
by certain U.S. source capital losses, if any, of the non-U.S. holder.

With respect to the third bullet above, in connection with the merger agreement, AMRI intends to provide Parent with a certificate
attesting to the fact that it will not have been a USRPHC at any time during the relevant period. However, if AMRI does not
provide such a certificate, Parent will withhold on the proceeds paid to a non-U.S. holder of the disposition of its common stock in
connection with the merger. Non-U.S. holders who are subject to withholding in excess of their actual tax liability may seek a
refund of such excess provided that such holder furnishes the required information to the Internal Revenue Service in a timely
manner.

Information Reporting and Backup Withholding.  Payments made in exchange for shares of common stock pursuant to the merger
may be subject, under certain circumstances, to information reporting and backup withholding (currently at a rate of 28%). To
avoid backup withholding, a U.S. holder that does not otherwise establish an exemption should complete and return Internal
Revenue Service Form W-9, certifying that such U.S. holder is a U.S. person, the taxpayer identification number provided is correct
and such U.S. holder is not subject to backup withholding. In general, a non-U.S. holder will not be subject to U.S. federal backup
withholding and information reporting with respect to cash payments to the non-U.S. holder pursuant to the merger if the non-U.S.
holder has provided an Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN-E, as applicable (or
an Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI if the non-U.S. holder’s gain is effectively connected with the conduct of a U.S. trade or
business).

Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be refunded or
credited against a holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, if any, provided that such holder furnishes the required information to
the Internal Revenue Service in a timely manner.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

This summary of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences is for general information purposes only and is not tax
advice. Holders of common stock should consult their tax advisors as to the specific tax consequences to them of the merger,
including the applicability and effect of the alternative minimum tax and the effect of any federal, state, local, foreign, and
other tax laws.

Regulatory Approvals

Antitrust Approval in the U.S.  Under the HSR Act and related rules, certain transactions, including the merger, may not be
completed until notifications have been given and information furnished to the Antitrust Division and the FTC and all statutory
waiting period requirements have been satisfied. On June 12, 2017, both AMRI and Parent filed their respective Notification and
Report Forms with the Antitrust Division and the FTC. On June 26, 2017, the FTC granted early termination of the waiting period
under the HSR Act applicable to the merger. With such early termination, the condition to the merger relating to the expiration or
termination of the HSR Act waiting period has been satisfied.

At any time before or after the effective time, the Antitrust Division or the FTC could take action under the antitrust laws, including
seeking to prevent the merger, to rescind the merger or to conditionally approve the merger upon the divestiture of assets of AMRI
or Parent or subject to regulatory conditions or other remedies. In addition, U.S. state attorneys general could take action under the
antitrust laws as they deem necessary or desirable in the public interest, including, without limitation, seeking to enjoin the
completion of the merger or permitting completion subject to regulatory conditions. Private parties may also seek to take legal
action under the antitrust laws under some circumstances. There can be no assurance that a challenge to the merger on antitrust
grounds will not be made or, if such a challenge is made, that it would not be successful.

Antitrust Approval in Non-U.S. Jurisdictions.  The merger is also conditioned on the expiration or termination of any applicable
waiting period (and any extension thereof) or receipt of any necessary approval or clearance required by the European Union and
the Israeli Antitrust Authority.

Foreign antitrust authorities in this or other jurisdictions may take action under the antitrust laws of their jurisdictions including,
without limitation, seeking to enjoin the completion of the merger or permitting completion of the merger subject to regulatory
conditions. There can be no assurance that a challenge to the merger under foreign antitrust laws will not be made or, if such a
challenge is made, that it would not be successful.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE MERGER AGREEMENT

The following is a summary of the material provisions of the merger agreement, a copy of which is attached to this proxy statement
as Annex A, and is incorporated by reference into this proxy statement. This summary may not contain all of the information about
the merger agreement that is important to you. We encourage you to read carefully the merger agreement in its entirety, as the
rights and obligations of the parties thereto are governed by the express terms of the merger agreement and not by this summary or
any other information contained in this proxy statement.

The Merger

The merger agreement provides that, subject to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement and in accordance with Delaware
law, at the effective time, Merger Sub will be merged with and into AMRI and, as a result of the merger, the separate corporate
existence of Merger Sub will cease and AMRI will continue as the surviving corporation and become a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Parent. As the surviving corporation, the separate corporate existence of AMRI, and all of its rights, privileges, immunities, powers,
and franchises, will continue unaffected by the merger.

The closing of the merger will occur as soon as practicable but in any event no later than two business days after all of the
conditions set forth in the merger agreement and described under “— Conditions to the Merger” are satisfied or waived, to the
extent permitted under the merger agreement, or at such other time as agreed to in writing by the parties unless the merger
agreement has been terminated pursuant to its terms. Subject to certain conditions pursuant to the merger agreement, the closing
shall not occur prior to the second business day following the termination of the marketing period in connection with the debt
financing (the “Marketing Period”), which Marketing Period shall terminate no earlier than July 23, 2017 unless the debt financing
is consummated prior to such date.

The merger will become effective when the certificate of merger has been duly filed with the Delaware Secretary of State or at a
later time as agreed to by the parties and specified in the certificate of merger. The merger is expected to be completed no later than
the third quarter of 2017. However, the parties cannot predict the exact timing of the completion of the merger or whether the
merger will be completed at an earlier or later time, as agreed by the parties, or at all.

Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock

Subject to the terms of the merger agreement, at the effective time, each share of our common stock outstanding immediately prior
to the effective time, other than shares owned by AMRI (or any direct or indirect subsidiary of AMRI), Parent, Merger Sub, and
holders who are entitled to and properly exercise appraisal rights under the DGCL, will be converted automatically into and will
represent the right to receive $21.75 in cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes.

At the effective time, each share that is owned directly by AMRI (or any direct or indirect subsidiary of AMRI), Parent or Merger
Sub immediately prior to the effective time will be cancelled and will cease to exist and no consideration will be delivered in
exchange for such cancellation.

At the effective time, each share of common stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time
will be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of the surviving corporation with the same rights, powers and privileges as the shares so converted and will constitute the
only outstanding shares of capital stock of the surviving corporation.

Treatment of Company Equity Awards

AMRI Stock Options.  Except as otherwise agreed upon with AMRI and Parent, as of the effective time, each AMRI stock option,
whether or not vested and exercisable, that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the effective time will be
automatically converted into the right to receive an amount in cash (less any applicable tax withholdings) equal to the product of
(1) the excess, if any, of $21.75 over the per share exercise price of such AMRI stock option and (2) the aggregate number of shares
of AMRI common stock that were issuable upon exercise or settlement of such AMRI stock option immediately prior to the
effective time. However, if the exercise price of an AMRI stock option is equal to or greater than $21.75, then such

TABLE OF CONTENTS

AMRI stock option will be cancelled and terminated at the effective time without any cash payment being made in respect of such
AMRI stock option. The cancellation of an AMRI stock option shall be deemed a release of any and all rights the holder thereof
had or may have had in respect of such AMRI stock option.

Restricted Stock.  Except as otherwise agreed upon with AMRI and Parent, as of the effective time, each outstanding share of
AMRI restricted stock will become fully vested and the restrictions with respect thereto shall lapse and each such share shall be
converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to $21.75 (less any applicable tax withholdings) and shall be treated in
the same manner as the other shares of AMRI common stock.

Restricted Stock Unit Awards.  Except as otherwise agreed upon with AMRI and Parent, as of the effective time, each outstanding
AMRI restricted stock unit that is not subject to performance based vesting, or RSU, whether or not fully vested, will be
automatically cancelled in exchange for the right to receive an amount in cash (less any applicable tax withholdings) equal to the
product of (1) $21.75 and (2) the number of shares of AMRI common stock subject to such RSU.

Performance-Based Restricted Stock Unit Awards.  Except as otherwise agreed upon with AMRI and Parent, as of the effective
time, the performance-based conditions to which each outstanding AMRI performance-based restricted stock unit, or PSU, is
subject will be deemed fully earned at the greater of (i) 100% of target performance or (ii) actual performance measured as of the
effective time, and to the extent earned, each PSU will be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash (less any applicable
tax withholdings) equal to the product of (1) $21.75 and (2) the resulting number of shares of AMRI common stock deemed earned
pursuant to such PSU.

Phantom Stock Awards.  Except as otherwise agreed upon with AMRI and Parent, as of the effective time, each outstanding AMRI
phantom stock award will be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash (less any applicable tax withholdings) equal to
the product of (1) $21.75 and (2) the number of shares of AMRI common stock subject to such AMRI phantom stock award.

Treatment of AMRI’s ESPP

The current offering period under AMRI’s 1998 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “ESPP”) ended on June 30, 2017, and
pursuant to the merger agreement, such offering period was the last permissible offering period under the ESPP. Following the date
of the merger agreement, no new participants may join the ESPP nor may any existing participants increase their rates of
contribution or purchase elections from those in effect on the date of the merger agreement. There will be no subsequent offering
periods under the ESPP, and the ESPP will be terminated on the date immediately prior to the date on which the effective time
occurs, subject to completion of the merger. Each ESPP participant’s accumulated contributions under the current offering period
shall be used to purchase shares of AMRI common stock in accordance with the terms of the ESPP. Shares of AMRI common stock
purchased pursuant to the ESPP shall be automatically converted into the right to receive $21.75 in cash, without interest and less
applicable withholding taxes.

Payment for the Common Stock and Equity Awards in the Merger

At or prior to the effective time, Parent will deposit or cause to be deposited with AMRI’s transfer agent, who shall act as exchange
agent in the merger for the purpose of exchanging the book entry units representing AMRI common stock for merger consideration,
sufficient cash to pay to the holders of the common stock the merger consideration of $21.75 per share. Promptly after the effective
time and in any event not later than the third business day following the effective time, the surviving corporation will send or will
cause the exchange agent to send to each record holder of shares of common stock that were converted into the merger
consideration (other than shares of AMRI common stock subject to restricted stock awards) a letter of transmittal and instructions
for use in effecting the surrender of book entry units that formerly represented shares of our common stock in exchange for the
merger consideration (less any applicable withholding taxes). Each holder of our common stock that has been converted into the
right to receive consideration in the merger shall be entitled to receive such consideration upon (i) surrender to the exchange agent
of a validly executed letter of transmittal, together with the certificate representing such shares of our common stock, or (ii) receipt
of an “agent’s message” by the exchange agent (or such other evidence, if any, that the exchange agent may reasonably request) in
the case of book-entry shares of our common stock, in each case along with delivery of

TABLE OF CONTENTS

such other documents as the exchange agent may reasonably request. Until cancelled, each book entry representing such shares of
AMRI common stock will represent after the effective time only the right to receive such merger consideration.

Unless otherwise agreed to in writing prior to the effective time by Parent and the holder thereof, the surviving corporation or one
of its subsidiaries will pay to each holder of Company equity awards, the cash amounts described above under “— Treatment of
Company Equity Awards” no later than the next regular payroll date occurring at least five business days after the effective time.

Representations and Warranties

The merger agreement contains representations and warranties that: (1) were made only for purposes of the merger agreement and
as of specific dates; (2) were solely for the benefit of the parties to the merger agreement; (3) may be subject to limitations agreed

material adverse effect” or a “Parent material adverse effect” standard (that is, they will not be deemed to be untrue or incorrect
unless their failure to be true or correct, individually or in the aggregate, would, as the case may be, be material or have a material
adverse effect on AMRI or Parent).

TABLE OF CONTENTS

For purposes of the merger agreement, a “material adverse effect” on AMRI means any event, change, circumstance, condition,
occurrence, effect or state of facts that, individually or in the aggregate with all other effects, (a) have had, or would be reasonably
expected to have, a material adverse effect on the business, assets, facilities, financial condition or results of operations of AMRI
and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (b) would reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay, interfere with or impair
AMRI from consummating the merger. However, the standard of “material adverse effect” on AMRI excludes, in the case of clause
(a) above, any such material adverse effect resulting from or arising out of:

• the announcement or pendency of the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including any adverse
impact on relationships with customers, suppliers, employees or other third parties (provided that this exception does not
apply to representations and warranties contained in the merger agreement to the extent such representation or warranty
expressly addresses the consequences resulting from announcement or pendency of the merger or the transactions
contemplated by thereby);

• the identity of Parent or its affiliates as the acquirer or any facts or circumstances concerning Parent or its affiliates;

• any change in general economic, business, or political conditions, or changes in the capital, banking, debt, financial, or
currency markets;

• any change generally affecting any of the industries in which AMRI or its subsidiaries operate or in any specific jurisdiction
or geographical area in the U.S. or elsewhere in the world;

• any change or proposed change in GAAP (or the enforcement or interpretation thereof);

• any change or proposed change in applicable laws (or the enforcement or interpretation thereof);

• any action taken (or omitted to be taken) by AMRI or any of its subsidiaries at the written direction of Parent or Merger Sub
or as required by the express terms of the merger agreement, the failure to take any action resulting from Parent’s failure to
grant any consent requested by AMRI following the date of the merger agreement, or the taking of action or failure to take
action by the Parent or Merger Sub following the date of the merger agreement;

• any stockholder litigation related to the merger or the merger agreement;

• any outbreak or escalation of hostilities or any acts of war, sabotage, or terrorism (regardless of where occurring), or any
natural disaster, calamity or other act of God;

• the availability or cost of equity, debt, or other financing to Parent, Merger Sub, or AMRI; or

• any change in or failure to meet, in and of itself, any projections, forecasts, budgets or other estimates of or relating to
operating statistics, revenue, earnings or any other financial or performance measures or any change in price or trading
volume of AMRI’s common stock.

provided that, with respect to the third, fourth, fifth, sixth, and ninth bullet, any such event, change, circumstance, condition,
occurrence, effect or state of facts may be considered in determining whether or not a material adverse effect has occurred to the
extent that it has had, or would reasonably be expected to have, a disproportionate impact on AMRI and its subsidiaries relative to
other businesses in the industries in which AMRI or its subsidiaries operate.

For the purpose of the merger agreement, a “Parent material adverse effect” means any event, change, circumstance, condition,
occurrence, effect or state of facts that, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to prevent or materially
delay, interfere with, or impair Parent from consummating the merger on a timely basis in accordance with the terms of the merger
agreement or materially impair or delay the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to perform their respective obligations under the merger
agreement.

contracts, and records of AMRI and its subsidiaries as Parent may reasonably request; provided, however, that any such access or
furnishing of information will be conducted during normal business hours. AMRI and its subsidiaries will not be required to

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Following the date of the merger agreement until the date the stockholders approve the merger, (i) if AMRI receives a bona fide
written acquisition proposal from a third party, (ii) such acquisition proposal did not result from a material breach of the merger
agreement, and (iii) the board or the Special Committee determines in good faith (after consultation with the Special Committee’s
financial advisor or another independent financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation and outside legal counsel) that such
acquisition proposal constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to result in, a “superior proposal” to the merger, then, if, but only
if, the board or Special Committee determines in good faith (after consultation with the Special Committee’s financial advisor or
another independent financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation and outside legal counsel) that the failure to take such
actions would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with fiduciary duties under applicable laws, AMRI, after entering into a
confidentiality agreement with the third party, may (a) furnish information and data with respect to AMRI and its subsidiaries and
provide the third party access to the business, properties, assets, and personnel of AMRI and its subsidiaries and (b) enter into,
maintain, and participate in negotiations or discussions with the third party regarding the acquisition proposal or otherwise
cooperate with or assist or participate in, or facilitate any discussions or negotiations with the third party. AMRI may not provide
any non-public information other than pursuant to a confidentiality agreement and will provide written notice to Parent promptly
(and at least within 24 hours) including written notice of the determination by the board or the Special Committee, a copy of the
confidentiality agreement entered into between AMRI and the third party, and any material non-public information concerning
AMRI or its subsidiaries provided to the third party which was not previously provided to Parent. Additionally AMRI will not, and
will not permit its subsidiaries, to enter into any confidentiality or other agreements with a person that could limit or delay the
ability of AMRI or its subsidiaries to provide any information to Parent pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement. After the
receipt of an acquisition proposal, AMRI may contact the third party to clarify or understand the terms of the acquisition proposal
in order to determine if the acquisition proposal constitutes a superior proposal and may direct a person to the merger agreement.
AMRI shall not, and shall cause its subsidiaries and their representatives to not, provide any commercially sensitive non-public
information to a competitor unless consistent with past practice regarding dealing with disclosures for acquisition proposals
previously and with limitations no less restrictive than those placed on Parent or Merger Sub in connection with the merger.

Following the date of the merger agreement, AMRI shall notify Parent promptly (and at least within 24 hours) of AMRI’s receipt of
any acquisition proposal or inquiries with respect to, or that would reasonably be expected to lead to, an acquisition proposal, any
request for non-public information that would reasonably be expected to lead to an acquisition proposal or any request for
discussions or negotiations with AMRI, its subsidiaries or representatives that would reasonably be expected to lead to an
acquisition proposal from a bona fide potential purchaser of AMRI or any of its subsidiaries, which notification shall include a
copy of the applicable written acquisition proposal or other such proposal or offer (or, if oral, the material terms and conditions of
such acquisition proposal or proposal or offer) and the identity of the third party making such acquisition proposal or inquiry.
AMRI shall thereafter keep Parent reasonably informed on a reasonably current basis of the status of any material developments,
discussions or negotiations regarding any such acquisition proposal or inquiry, and the material terms and conditions thereof in the
case of any acquisition proposal or other such proposal or offer (including any change in price or form of consideration or other
material amendment thereto), including by providing a copy of material documentation relating thereto that is exchanged between
the third party (or its representatives) making such acquisition proposal or other such proposal or offer and AMRI (or its
representatives) within 24 hours after receipt thereof.

“Superior proposal” means a bona fide written acquisition proposal (substituting “50%” for each reference to “20%” in the
definition of acquisition proposal) that our board or the Special Committee determines in good faith, after consultation with the
Special Committee’s financial advisor or another independent financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation and outside
legal counsel:

• is reasonably likely to be consummated in accordance with its terms, taking into account all legal, financial and regulatory
aspects of the proposal and the person making the proposal;

TABLE OF CONTENTS

• if consummated, would result in a transaction more favorable to AMRI stockholders from a financial point of view than the
merger (after taking into account any revisions to the merger agreement, limited guarantees, equity commitment letters, and
debt commitment letters made or proposed in writing by Parent prior to the time of such determination); and

• is not subject to any financing condition in respect of which it has been demonstrated to our board or the Special
Committee, after consultation with the Special Committee’s financial advisor or another independent financial advisor of
nationally recognized reputation and outside legal counsel, that any required financing to complete such acquisition
proposal will be reasonably likely to be obtained.

Neither our board nor any committee of our board may (i) withhold, withdraw, or fail to make, amend or modify, or publicly
propose to withhold, withdraw, amend or modify, in any manner adverse to the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement,
Parent or Merger Sub, or otherwise make any public statement or proposal inconsistent with, the board’s recommendation, (ii)
approve, adopt or recommend, or publicly propose to adopt or recommend, an acquisition proposal, (iii) fail to recommend against
acceptance of any third party tender offer or exchange offer for the shares of common stock of AMRI within ten business days after
commencement of such offer, (iv) approve or recommend, or publicly propose to approve or recommend, or cause or permit AMRI
or its subsidiary to execute or enter into any agreement, arrangement or understanding, including any letter of intent, memorandum
of understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement,
partnership agreement or other similar agreement with respect to an acquisition proposal (other than an acceptable confidentiality
agreement) or (v) resolve or publicly propose to take any of the foregoing actions (an “adverse recommendation change”).

Until the date the stockholders approve the merger, our board or any committee of our board may, if it determines in good faith
(after consultation with the Special Committee’s financial advisor or another independent financial advisor of nationally recognized
reputation and outside legal counsel) that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the board under
applicable law, make an adverse recommendation change due to a superior proposal or any other fact, event or development not
known or reasonably foreseeable to our board that is not related to an acquisition proposal (such fact, event or development, an
“intervening event”) or may cause AMRI to terminate the merger agreement and enter into a superior proposal. No adverse
recommendation change and no termination of the merger agreement is permitted:

• until the fourth business day following written notice from AMRI advising Parent that our board or the Special Committee
intends to make an adverse recommendation change or terminate the merger agreement which notice includes the material
terms and conditions of the superior proposal and the identity of the third party; it being understood and agreed that any
material amendment to the superior proposal will require a new two business day notice period;

• unless during such four business day period, or two business day period for amended proposals, AMRI negotiates with
Parent in good faith to make such adjustments to the merger agreement, limited guarantee, equity commitment letter, and
debt commitment letter as needed to maintain the board’s recommendation and not make an adverse recommendation
change or terminate the merger agreement; and

• unless after the expiration of the four business day period, or two business day period for amended proposals, our board or
the Special Committee reviews in good faith Parent’s proposal to adjust the terms and conditions of the existing agreements
and our board or the Special Committee determines in good faith (after consultation with the Special Committee’s financial
advisor or another independent financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation and outside legal counsel) that the
failure to make an adverse recommendation change or terminate the merger agreement would be inconsistent with their
fiduciary duties and the acquisition proposal continues to be the superior proposal.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

In the case of an intervening event (or any material change to the facts and circumstances relating to an intervening event, except
that any reference in this paragraph to four business days will instead be two business days), no adverse recommendation change
may be made (i) until after the fourth business day following written notice from AMRI advising Parent that our board or the
Special Committee intends to take such an action and specifying the material facts underlying such determination that an
intervening event has occurred and the reason for the adverse recommendation change, (ii) unless during such four business day
period, AMRI shall negotiate with Parent to amend the merger agreement, limited guarantee, equity commitment letter, and debt
commitment letter in such a manner that permits AMRI to maintain AMRI recommendation and not make an adverse
recommendation change, and (iii) unless, by the expiration of such four business day period, our board or the Special Committee
determines in good faith (after consultation with the Special Committee’s financial advisor or another independent financial advisor
of nationally recognized reputation and outside legal counsel) that the failure to effect an adverse recommendation change would be
reasonably likely to be inconsistent with fiduciary duties under applicable law.

The merger agreement provides that none of its terms will be deemed to prohibit AMRI from taking and disclosing a positon
contemplated by Rule 14d-9, Rule 14e-2(a) or Item 1012(a) of the Exchange Act, making any disclosure to AMRI stockholders if,
in the good faith judgment of the board or the Special Committee, after consultation with outside legal counsel, such disclosure is
required by applicable law, or making any disclosure that constitutes a stop, look, and listen communication as contemplated by
Section 14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act.

Filings and Other Actions.  Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement and in accordance with applicable law and AMRI’s
governing documents, AMRI agreed to duly set a record date for, call, give notice of, and hold a special meeting of its stockholders
for the purpose of considering and taking action upon the adoption of the merger agreement. Unless our board of directors will have
effected an adverse recommendation change, the board will make the recommendation that AMRI stockholders vote to adopt the
merger agreement and approve the transactions contemplated thereby.

Notice of Certain Events.  AMRI and Parent each will give prompt notice to the other (and will subsequently keep the other
informed on a reasonably current basis of any material developments related to such notice) upon its becoming aware of (i) the
occurrence or existence of any fact, event or circumstance that has or would reasonably be expected to have a Company material
adverse effect with respect to AMRI or a Parent material adverse effect with respect to Parent or Merger Sub, (ii) the occurrence or
existence of any fact, event or circumstance reasonably likely to result in any of the closing conditions of the merger agreement not
being satisfied prior to the end date or (iii) any notice or other communication received by AMRI from a person alleging the
consent of such person is or may be required in connection with the merger.

Employee Matters.  For a period of 12 months after the completion of the merger, Parent will cause AMRI, as the surviving
corporation in the merger, to provide continuing employees with (1) base salary or base hourly rate and certain cash incentive
compensation target opportunities (excluding specified performance goals for any cash incentive compensation in respect of any
calendar year after 2017) in an amount at least equal to the level that was provided to each such continuing employee immediately
prior to the closing date of the merger, and (2) employee benefits (other than equity awards) that are substantially comparable in the
aggregate to those provided to each such continuing employee immediately prior to the closing date of the merger. In addition,
Parent will honor AMRI’s annual cash incentive bonus for the 2017 calendar year which shall be paid consistent with AMRI’s prior
bonus payment timings and no later than March 15, 2018. Furthermore, Parent will assume and honor the terms of certain
severance agreements and provide the severance payments and benefits required thereunder to any employee in accordance with
the terms and conditions of such agreements, and for a period of 12 months after the completion of the merger, also honor the terms
of any severance policies generally applicable to employees. Until the closing date of the merger, AMRI may, subject to Parent’s
consent, and the Parent and AMRI will work in good faith to, implement changes to AMRI’s 2017 cash incentive bonus plan for
VP and director level employees to be effective as of the closing date of the merger, which changes will be designed to facilitate the
retention of such employees.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

After the completion of the merger, Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to cause all parent benefit plans to (i) waive limitations
related to pre-existing conditions, waiting periods, physical examinations, and exclusions with respect to participation and coverage
to the same extent that such limitations and exclusions would not have applied or would have been waived if the continuing
employee was a participant immediately prior to his participation in the Parent benefit plan, but, with respect to long-term disability
and life insurance, solely to the extent permitted under the terms of Parent’s applicable insurance contracts in effect as of the
closing date of the merger, and (ii) provide each continuing employee and eligible dependents with credit for co-payments and
deductibles paid in the calendar year that, and prior to the date that, such continuing employee commences participation in such
Parent benefit plan in satisfying any applicable co-payment or deductible requirements under such Parent benefit plan for the
applicable calendar year, to the extent such expenses were recognized under the comparable AMRI employee plan.

After the completion of the merger, Parent shall honor, and shall cause the surviving corporation and their respective subsidiaries to
honor, in accordance with its terms, (i) certain existing (as of immediately prior to the effective time) employment, change in
control, retention, severance, and termination protection plans, policies or agreements of or between AMRI or any of its
subsidiaries and certain current or former officers, directors or employees of that company, (ii) all obligations in effect as of the
effective time under certain transaction bonus agreements, (iii) all obligations in effect as of the effective time under any bonus or
bonus deferral plans, programs or agreements of AMRI or its subsidiaries, and (iv) all vested and accrued benefits under any AMRI
employee plan.

After the completion of the merger, Parent will cause AMRI, as the surviving corporation in the merger, to recognize (but not for

required to be filed by such party under the HSR Act with respect to the merger and the other transactions contemplated by
the merger agreement and use reasonable best efforts to promptly secure the expiration or termination of any applicable
waiting periods under the HSR Act;

• promptly make all filings, and use reasonable best efforts to timely obtain all consents, permits, authorizations, waivers,
clearances, and approvals, and to cause the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting periods, as may be required
under any other applicable antitrust laws;

other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement; and

• use reasonable best efforts to take any action to resolve any proceeding that may be commenced challenging the merger or

Parent also agrees to take promptly any and all steps necessary to avoid, eliminate, or resolve each and every impediment and
obtain all clearances, consents, approvals, and waivers under antitrust laws that may be required by any governmental authority, so
as to enable the consummation of the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement on a timely basis
(and in any event no later than three business days prior to the end date), including (i) committing to or effecting, by consent
decree, hold separate orders, trust, or otherwise, the sale, license, transfer, assignment or other disposition of assets or businesses of

authority in connection with any of the foregoing and in the case of actions by or with respect to AMRI or its subsidiaries or its or
their businesses or assets, by consenting to such action by AMRI; provided, however, that any such action may, at the discretion of
Parent or AMRI, be conditioned upon consummation of the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement) (each a “divestiture action”) as may be necessary or required, to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of or
vacate or lift, any order that would otherwise have the effect of preventing consummation of the merger and the other transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement, and to ensure that no governmental authority with the authority to clear, authorize or
otherwise approve consummation of the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, fails to do so on
a timely basis and in any event no later than three business days prior to the end date. Parent and AMRI shall cooperate in any
proposal, negotiation, or offer to commit and to effect, by consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, any and all divestiture

Parent and Merger Sub will not, and will cause their subsidiaries not to, acquire or agree to acquire any rights, assets, business,
person, or division thereof (through acquisition, license, joint venture, collaboration or otherwise) if such acquisition or agreement
would reasonably be expected to increase the risk of not obtaining any applicable clearance, consent, approval or waiver under
antitrust laws with respect to the merger or any other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

Indemnification of Directors and Officers; Insurance.  For a period of six years following the effective time, the surviving
corporation will maintain officers’ and directors’ liability insurance in respect of acts or omissions occurring prior to the effective

the date of the merger agreement. Neither Parent nor the surviving corporation will be required to pay annual premiums in excess
of 300% of the amount per annum AMRI paid in its last full fiscal year prior to the date of the merger agreement (the “current
premium”) and if such premium exceeds 300% of the current premium, the surviving corporation shall use good faith judgment to
provide maximum coverage available at an annual premium equal to 300% of the current premium. The preceding sentences will
be deemed to be satisfied if prepaid “tail” or “runoff” policies are obtained by AMRI prior to the effective time, which policies
cover such persons for an aggregate period of six years with respect to claims arising from facts or events occurring on or before
the effective date, provided such premium does not exceed 300% of the current premium. Further, each of Parent and the surviving
corporation will, (i) indemnify and hold harmless each present and former director and officer of AMRI or of a subsidiary and
additional individuals as set forth in the merger agreement against any costs or expenses (including attorneys’ fees), judgments,
fines, penalties, or liabilities in connection with any proceeding such indemnified party may be involved or threatened with by
reason of such indemnified party being or having been a director or officer or employee or agent of AMRI or subsidiary or arising
out of such indemnified party’s service in connection with any other corporation or organization where such party serves as a
director, officer, employee, agent, trustee or fiduciary at the request of AMRI to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, and
(ii) fulfill and honor all obligations of AMRI under indemnification agreements in effect as of the date of the merger agreement or
any indemnification provisions or exculpation provision in AMRI’s certificate of incorporation or bylaws in effect as of the date of
the merger agreement. If Parent fails to comply with these obligations and an indemnified party commences a suit which result in a
final, non-appealable determination, Parent shall pay indemnified party his or her costs and expenses (including reasonably
attorney’s fees and disbursements) in connection with such suit with interest thereon.

conditions described in the commitment letters, including:

and/or syndication activities contemplated by the commitment letter; and

agreements and complying in all material respects with its obligations under the commitment letters.

AMRI will use its reasonable best efforts to provide, and to cause each of its subsidiaries and their representatives to use their
reasonable best efforts to provide, to Parent and Merger Sub, at Parent’s sole expense, all cooperation reasonably requested by
Parent in connection with the arrangement of the financing subject to certain exceptions as detailed in the merger agreement.

Other Covenants.  The merger agreement contains additional agreements between AMRI, Parent, and Merger Sub relating to,

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ADVISORY VOTE ON NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICER SPECIFIED COMPENSATION (PROPOSAL 2)

As required by Section 14A of the Exchange Act and the related SEC rules, AMRI is required to submit a proposal to AMRI
stockholders for a non-binding, advisory vote to approve the potential payment by AMRI of specified compensation to the named
executive officers of AMRI that is based on or otherwise relates to the merger. This proposal, commonly known as “say-on-golden
parachute”, gives AMRI stockholders the opportunity to vote, on a non-binding, advisory basis, on the compensation that the
named executive officers may be entitled to receive from AMRI that is based on or otherwise relates to the merger. This specified
compensation is summarized in the table under “The Merger (Proposal 1) — Interests of AMRI’s Directors and Executive Officers
in the Merger — “Golden Parachute” Compensation for AMRI’s Named Executive Officers,” including the footnotes to the table.

Our board encourages you to review carefully the named executive officer specified compensation information disclosed in this
proxy statement.

Our board unanimously recommends that AMRI stockholders approve the following resolution:

“RESOLVED, that the stockholders of Albany Molecular Research, Inc. hereby approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis,
specified compensation to be paid or which may become payable by AMRI to its named executive officers that is based on or
otherwise relates to the merger as disclosed pursuant to Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K in the “golden parachute compensation”
table and the footnotes to that table.”

The vote on the named executive officer specified compensation proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote on the proposal
to adopt the merger agreement and approve the transactions contemplated thereby. Accordingly, you may vote to approve the
adoption of the merger agreement and vote not to approve the named executive officer specified compensation proposal and vice
versa. Because the vote on the named executive officer specified compensation proposal is advisory only, it will not be binding on
either AMRI or Parent. As a result, if the merger is completed, the specified compensation will be payable, subject only to the
conditions applicable to such payment, regardless of the outcome of the non-binding, advisory vote of AMRI stockholders.

The above resolution approving specified compensation of AMRI’s named executive officers on an advisory basis will require the
affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on such
proposal at the special meeting. Under our bylaws, abstentions will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” this proposal.
Broker non-votes will have no effect on the voting results for this proposal.

The board unanimously recommends a vote “FOR” the advisory (non-binding) proposal to approve specified compensation
that may become payable to our named executive officers in connection with the merger.

VOTE ON ADJOURNMENT (PROPOSAL 3)

AMRI is asking its stockholders to approve a proposal for one or more adjournments of the special meeting, if necessary, to solicit
additional proxies if we have not obtained sufficient affirmative stockholder votes to adopt the merger agreement and approve the
transactions contemplated thereby. If, at the special meeting, the number of shares of AMRI common stock present in person or by
proxy and voting in favor of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement and approve the transactions contemplated thereby is not
sufficient to approve that proposal, we may move to adjourn the special meeting in order to enable our directors, officers, and
employees to solicit additional proxies for the adoption of the merger agreement. In that event, we will ask AMRI stockholders to
vote only upon the adjournment proposal, and not the merger agreement proposal. If AMRI stockholders approve the adjournment
proposal, we could adjourn the special meeting, and any adjourned session of the special meeting, and use the additional time to
solicit additional proxies.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

The adjournment proposal relates only to an adjournment of the special meeting for purposes of soliciting additional proxies to
obtain the requisite stockholder approval to adopt the merger agreement and approve the transactions contemplated thereby. AMRI
retains full authority to the extent set forth in its bylaws and Delaware law to adjourn the special meeting for any other purpose, or
to postpone the special meeting before it is convened, without the consent of any AMRI stockholder.

Approval of the adjournment proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares present in person or
represented by proxy and entitled to vote on such proposal at the special meeting. Under our bylaws, abstentions will have the same
effect as a vote “AGAINST” this proposal. Broker non-votes will have no effect on the voting results for this proposal.

The board unanimously recommends a vote “FOR” the adjournment proposal.

APPRAISAL RIGHTS

The following discussion summarizes the material terms of the law pertaining to appraisal rights under the DGCL and is qualified
in its entirety by the full text of Section 262 of the DGCL, referred to as “Section 262,” which is attached to this proxy statement as
Annex C. The following summary does not constitute legal or other advice, nor does it constitute a recommendation that
stockholders exercise their appraisal rights under Section 262.

Under Section 262, record holders of shares of common stock who do not vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement
and who otherwise follow the procedures set forth in Section 262 will be entitled to have their shares appraised by the Delaware
Court of Chancery and to receive payment in cash of the “fair value” of the shares, exclusive of any element of value arising from
the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, as determined by the Court, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the
amount determined to be the fair value.

Under Section 262, where a merger agreement is submitted for adoption at a meeting of stockholders, the corporation, not less than
20 days prior to the meeting, must notify each of its stockholders who was a stockholder of record for notice of the meeting with
respect to shares for which appraisal rights are available and include in the notice a copy of Section 262. This proxy statement shall
constitute such notice, and the full text of Section 262 is attached to this proxy statement as Annex C.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ANY HOLDER OF COMMON STOCK WHO WISHES TO EXERCISE APPRAISAL RIGHTS, OR WHO WISHES TO
PRESERVE SUCH HOLDER’S RIGHT TO DO SO, SHOULD CAREFULLY REVIEW THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION AND
ANNEX C BECAUSE FAILURE TO TIMELY AND PROPERLY COMPLY WITH THE PROCEDURES SPECIFIED WILL
RESULT IN THE LOSS OF APPRAISAL RIGHTS. MOREOVER, BECAUSE OF THE COMPLEXITY OF THE
PROCEDURES FOR EXERCISING THE RIGHT TO SEEK APPRAISAL OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK, AMRI
BELIEVES THAT, IF A STOCKHOLDER CONSIDERS EXERCISING SUCH RIGHTS, SUCH STOCKHOLDER SHOULD
SEEK THE ADVICE OF LEGAL COUNSEL.

If a holder of common stock loses his, her or its appraisal rights by failing to timely comply with the procedures of Section 262 or
otherwise, such holder of common stock will be entitled to receive the merger consideration described in the merger agreement.

Filing Written Demand

Any holder of common stock wishing to exercise appraisal rights must, before the vote on the adoption of the merger agreement at
the special meeting, deliver to AMRI a written demand for the appraisal of the stockholder’s shares. A holder of common stock
wishing to exercise appraisal rights must hold of record the shares on the date the written demand for appraisal is made and must
continue to hold the shares of record through the effective date of the merger. The holder will lose appraisal rights if the holder
transfers the shares before the effective time. The holder must not vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement. A proxy
that is submitted and does not contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the adoption of the merger
agreement, and it will effectively constitute a waiver of the stockholder’s right of appraisal and will effectively nullify any
previously delivered written demand for appraisal. Therefore, a stockholder who submits a proxy and who wishes to exercise
appraisal rights must submit a proxy containing instructions to vote against the adoption of the merger agreement or abstain from
voting on the adoption of the merger agreement. Neither voting against the adoption of the merger agreement, nor abstaining from
voting or failing to vote on the proposal to adopt the merger agreement and approve the transactions contemplated thereby, will in
and of itself constitute a written demand for appraisal satisfying the requirements of Section 262. The written demand for appraisal
must be in addition to and separate from any proxy or vote on the adoption of the merger agreement; however, a holder of record of
the AMRI common stock need not vote against the merger agreement in order to exercise the right to seek an appraisal. The
demand must reasonably inform AMRI of the identity of the holder as well as the intention of the holder to demand an appraisal of
the “fair value” of the shares held by the holder. A stockholder’s failure to deliver the written demand to AMRI prior to the taking
of the vote on the adoption of the merger agreement at the special meeting will effectively constitute a waiver of appraisal rights.

Only a holder of record of shares of common stock is entitled to demand an appraisal of the shares registered in that holder’s name.
A demand for appraisal in respect of shares of common stock must be executed by or on behalf of the holder of record. The demand
must set forth, fully and correctly, the registered holder’s name as it appears on the holder’s stock certificates, and must specify the
holder’s mailing address and the number of shares registered in the holder’s name. The demand must state that the person intends
thereby to demand appraisal of the holder’s shares in connection with the merger. If the shares are owned of record in a fiduciary
capacity, such as by a trustee, guardian or custodian, execution of the demand must be made in that capacity, and if the shares are
owned of record by more than one person, as in a joint tenancy and tenancy-in-common, the demand must be executed by or on
behalf of all joint owners. An authorized agent, including an agent for two or more joint owners, may execute a demand for
appraisal on behalf of a holder of record; however, the agent must identify the record owner or owners and expressly disclose that,
in executing the demand, the agent is acting as agent for the record owner or owners. If the shares are held in “street name” by a
broker, bank, trust or nominee, the broker, bank, trust or nominee may exercise appraisal rights with respect to the shares held for
one or more beneficial owners while not exercising the rights with respect to the shares held for other beneficial owners; in such
case, however, the written demand should set forth the number of shares as to which appraisal is sought and where no number of
shares is expressly mentioned the demand will be presumed to cover all shares of common stock held in the name of the record
owner. If a stockholder holds shares of common stock through a broker who in turn holds the shares through a central securities
depository nominee, a demand for appraisal of such shares must be made by or on behalf of the depository nominee and

TABLE OF CONTENTS

must identify the depository nominee as record holder. Stockholders who hold their shares in brokerage accounts or other nominee
forms and who wish to exercise appraisal rights are urged to consult with their brokers to determine the appropriate procedures for
the making of a demand for appraisal by such a nominee. A person having a beneficial interest in shares held of record in the name
of another person, such as a broker or nominee, must act promptly to cause the record holder to follow properly in a timely manner
the steps necessary to perfect appraisal rights.

All written demands for appraisal pursuant to Section 262 should be sent or delivered to AMRI at:

Albany Molecular Research, Inc.
26 Corporate Circle

Albany, New York 12203
Attention: Secretary

At any time within 60 days after the effective date of the merger, any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding
or joined that proceeding as a named party may withdraw his, her or its demand for appraisal and accept the consideration offered
pursuant to the merger agreement by delivering to AMRI, as the surviving corporation, a written withdrawal of the demand for
appraisal. However, any such attempt to withdraw the demand made more than 60 days after the effective date of the merger will
require written approval of AMRI, as the surviving corporation. No appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery will
be dismissed as to any stockholder without the approval of the Delaware Court of Chancery, and such approval may be conditioned
upon such terms as the Court deems just; provided, however, that any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding
or joined that proceeding as a named party may withdraw his, her or its demand for appraisal and accept the merger consideration
offered pursuant to the merger agreement within 60 days after the effective date of the merger. If AMRI, as the surviving
corporation, does not approve a request to withdraw a demand for appraisal when that approval is required, or, except with respect
to any stockholder who withdraws such stockholder’s demand in accordance with the proviso in the immediately preceding
sentence, if the Delaware Court of Chancery does not approve the dismissal of an appraisal proceeding with respect to a
stockholder, the stockholder will be entitled to receive only the appraised value determined in any such appraisal proceeding, which
value could be less than, equal to or more than the consideration being offered pursuant to the merger agreement.

Notice by the Surviving Corporation

Within ten days after the effective date of the merger, AMRI, as the surviving corporation, must notify each holder of common
stock who has complied with Section 262, and who has not voted in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement, of the date on
which the merger became effective.

Filing a Petition for Appraisal

Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger, but not thereafter, AMRI, as the surviving corporation, or any holder of
common stock who has complied with Section 262 and is entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262 may commence an
appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery, with a copy served upon the surviving corporation in
the case of a petition filed by a stockholder, demanding a determination of the fair value of the shares held by all such dissenting
holders. AMRI, as the surviving corporation, is under no obligation to and has no present intention to file a petition and holders
should not assume that AMRI as the surviving corporation will file a petition. Accordingly, any holders of common stock who
desire to have their shares appraised should initiate all necessary action to perfect their appraisal rights in respect of shares of
common stock within the time prescribed in Section 262. Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger, any holder of
common stock who has complied with the requirements of Section 262 will be entitled, upon written request, to receive from
AMRI as the surviving corporation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the adoption of
the merger agreement and with respect to which demands for appraisal have been received and the aggregate number of holders of
such shares. The statement must be mailed within ten days after a written request therefor has been received by AMRI as the
surviving corporation or within ten days after the expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal, whichever is later.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a person who is the beneficial owner of shares of common stock held either in a voting trust or by a
nominee on behalf of such

If a petition for an appraisal is timely filed by a holder of shares of common stock and a copy thereof is served upon AMRI as the
surviving corporation, AMRI as the surviving corporation will then be obligated within 20 days to file with the Delaware Register
in Chancery a duly verified list containing the names and addresses of all stockholders who have demanded an appraisal of their
shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares have not been reached. After notice to the dissenting stockholders,
the Delaware Court of Chancery will conduct a hearing on the petition to determine those stockholders who have complied with
Section 262 and who have become entitled to appraisal rights thereunder. The Delaware Court of Chancery may require the
stockholders who demanded payment for their shares to submit their stock certificates to the Delaware Register in Chancery for
notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceeding; and if any stockholder fails to comply with the direction, the
Delaware Court of Chancery may dismiss the proceedings as to such stockholder.

Determination of Fair Value

After the Delaware Court of Chancery determines the holders of common stock entitled to appraisal, the appraisal proceeding shall
be conducted in accordance with the rules of the Delaware Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically governing appraisal
proceedings. If a holder fails to comply with the court’s direction, the court may dismiss the proceeds as to the holder. Through
such proceeding, the Court shall determine the “fair value” of the shares, exclusive of any element of value arising from the
accomplishment or expectation of the merger, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair
value. Unless the Court in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest from the effective date of the merger
through the date of payment of the judgment shall be compounded quarterly and shall accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve
discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the effective date of the merger
and the date of payment of the judgment.

In determining the fair value, the Delaware Court of Chancery will take into account all relevant factors. The Delaware Supreme
Court has stated that “proof of value by any techniques or methods that are generally considered acceptable in the financial
community and otherwise admissible in court” should be considered in the appraisal proceedings. In addition, Delaware courts
have decided that the statutory appraisal remedy, in cases of unfair dealing, may or may not be a dissenter’s exclusive remedy.
Stockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as so determined could be more than,
the same as or less than the consideration they would receive pursuant to the merger if they did not seek appraisal of their shares
and that an investment banking opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the consideration payable in a sale
transaction, such as the merger, is not an opinion as to, and does not otherwise address, fair value under Section 262. No
representation is made as to the outcome of the appraisal of fair value as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, and
stockholders should recognize that such an appraisal could result in a determination of a value higher or lower than, or the same as,
the merger consideration. Neither Parent, Merger Sub nor AMRI anticipate offering more than the applicable merger consideration
to any stockholder of AMRI exercising appraisal rights, and reserve the right to assert, in any appraisal proceeding, that for
purposes of Section 262, the “fair value” of a share of common stock is less than the applicable merger consideration.

The costs of the action (which do not include attorneys’ fees or the fees and expenses of experts) may be determined by the Court
and taxed upon the parties as the Court deems equitable under the circumstances. Upon application of a stockholder, the Court may
order all or a portion of the expenses incurred by a stockholder in connection with an appraisal proceeding, including, without
limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees and the fees and expenses of experts utilized in the appraisal proceeding, to be charged pro
rata against the value of all the shares entitled to be appraised.

If any stockholder who demands appraisal of shares of common stock under Section 262 fails to perfect, successfully withdraws or
loses such holder’s right to appraisal, the stockholder’s shares of common stock will be deemed to have been converted at the
effective date of the merger into the right to receive the merger consideration pursuant to the merger agreement. A stockholder will
fail to perfect, or effectively lose, the

holder’s right to appraisal if no petition for appraisal is filed within 120 days after the effective date of the merger. In addition, as
indicated above, a stockholder may withdraw his, her or its demand for appraisal in accordance with Section 262 and accept the
merger consideration offered pursuant to the merger agreement.

Any holder of shares of common stock who has duly demanded appraisal in compliance with Section 262 will not, after the
effective date of the merger, be entitled to vote for any purpose any shares subject to such demand or to receive payment of
dividends or other distributions on such shares, except for dividends or distributions payable to stockholders of record at a date
prior to the effective date of the merger.

FAILURE TO FOLLOW THE STEPS REQUIRED BY SECTION 262 OF THE DGCL FOR PERFECTING APPRAISAL
RIGHTS MAY RESULT IN THE LOSS OF APPRAISAL RIGHTS. IN THAT EVENT, YOU WILL BE ENTITLED TO
RECEIVE THE MERGER CONSIDERATION FOR YOUR DISSENTING SHARES IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE MERGER
AGREEMENT. IN VIEW OF THE COMPLEXITY OF THE PROVISIONS OF SECTION 262 OF THE DGCL, IF YOU ARE A
COMPANY STOCKHOLDER AND ARE CONSIDERING EXERCISING YOUR APPRAISAL RIGHTS UNDER THE DGCL,
YOU SHOULD CONSULT YOUR OWN LEGAL ADVISOR.

LITIGATION RELATED TO THE MERGER

On July 11, 2017, a purported stockholder of AMRI filed a class action complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of
Delaware against AMRI and our board of directors, Eyre v. Albany Molecular Research Inc., et al., No. 1:17-cv-00932. The
complaint alleges violations of Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act, in connection with the merger. The plaintiff alleges
that the preliminary proxy statement on Schedule 14A, filed by AMRI with the SEC with a filing date of July 3, 2017, omits
material information regarding the Company’s financial projections, and seeks, in addition to other relief, an injunction preventing
the stockholders’ vote on the merger and preventing the consummation of the merger until such information is disclosed.

On July 13, 2017, another purported stockholder of AMRI filed a separate class action complaint in the U.S. District Court for the
District of Delaware against AMRI, our board of directors, Carlyle, GTCR, Parent and Merger Sub, Witmer v. Albany Molecular
Research Inc., et. al., No. 1:17-cv-00942. This complaint also alleges the same claims and seeks similar relief, including that the
preliminary proxy statement omits material information regarding the Company’s financial projections, potential conflicts of
interest by AMRI officers, directors and Credit Suisse, and certain background of the proposed transaction.

The Company, and our board of directors, believes that the respective allegations asserted against them in the lawsuits are without
merit and intend to defend against the lawsuits vigorously. Similar cases may also be filed in connection with the merger.

MULTIPLE STOCKHOLDERS SHARING ONE ADDRESS

In accordance with Rule 14a-3(e)(1) under the Exchange Act, one proxy statement will be delivered to two or more stockholders
who share an address, unless AMRI has received contrary instructions from one or more of the stockholders. AMRI will deliver
promptly upon written or oral request a separate copy of the proxy statement to a stockholder at a shared address to which a single
copy of the proxy statement was delivered. Requests for additional copies of the proxy statement should be directed to Albany
Molecular Research, Inc., 26 Corporate Circle, Albany, New York 12203, Attn: Secretary, or by calling (518) 512-2000. In
addition, stockholders who share a single address, but receive multiple copies of the proxy statement, may request that in the future
they receive a single copy by contacting AMRI at the address and phone number set forth in the prior sentence.

FUTURE STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS

If the merger is completed, we will have no public stockholders and there will be no public participation in any future meetings of
stockholders of AMRI. However, if the merger is not completed, stockholders will continue to be entitled to attend and participate
in stockholder meetings.

AMRI will hold an annual meeting in 2018 only if the merger has not already been completed.

Stockholder proposals submitted pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 14a-8 for inclusion in AMRI’s proxy statement and form of proxy
for the 2018 annual meeting of stockholders must be received in writing by

Securities and Exchange Commission if such proposals are to be included in the proxy statement. Any such proposals should be
mailed to: Albany Molecular Research, Inc., 26 Corporate Circle, Albany, New York 12203, Attention: Secretary.

Stockholder proposals (including recommendations of nominees for election to our board) intended to be presented at the 2018
annual meeting of stockholders, other than stockholder proposals submitted pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 14a-8, must be
delivered to, or mailed and received at, Albany Molecular Research, Inc., 26 Corporate Circle, Albany, New York 12203, not
earlier than January 31, 2018 nor later than March 17, 2018; provided, however, that in the event that the annual meeting is
scheduled to be held before May 1, 2018 or after July 30, 2018, notice must be so delivered not later than the close of business on
the later of (i) the 75th day prior to the scheduled date of such annual meeting or (ii) the 15th day following the day on which public
announcement of the date of such meeting is first made by AMRI. The proposal must also comply with the other requirements
contained in AMRI’s Amended and Restated By-laws, including supporting documentation and other information. Proxies solicited
by the board of directors will confer discretionary voting authority with respect to these proposals, subject to the Securities and
Exchange Commission’s rules governing the exercise of this authority.

Section 2.01 The Closing.  Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, the closing of the Merger (the “Closing”)
shall take place at 10:00 a.m., Eastern time, as soon as practicable (and, in any event, within two Business Days) after satisfaction
or, to the extent permitted hereunder, waiver of all conditions to the Merger set forth in Article 7 (other than those conditions that
by their nature are to be satisfied by deliveries made at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted
hereunder) of such conditions), unless this Agreement has been terminated pursuant to its terms or unless another time or date is
agreed to in writing by the parties hereto; provided that, if the Marketing Period has not ended at the time of the satisfaction or
waiver of the conditions set forth in Article 7 (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied by deliveries made
at the Closing), the Closing shall occur on the earlier to occur of (i) a date during the Marketing Period specified by Parent on no
less than three (3) Business Days’ notice to the Company and (ii) the second Business Day after the end of the Marketing Period
(subject in each case to the satisfaction or waiver (by the party entitled to grant such waiver) of the conditions set forth in Article 7
as of the date determined pursuant to this proviso). The Closing shall be held at the offices of Goodwin Procter LLP, 100 Northern
Avenue, Boston, Massachusetts, 02210, unless another place is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto.

Section 2.02 The Merger.

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, as soon as practicable on the Closing Date, Parent
and the Company shall cause a certificate of merger (the “Certificate of Merger”) to be executed and delivered to the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware for filing as provided in the DGCL.

(b) The Merger shall become effective on such date and at such time when the Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or at such later time and date as may be agreed by the parties hereto in writing
and specified in the Certificate of Merger (the “Effective Time”).

(c) At the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company in accordance with the DGCL, whereupon
the separate existence of Merger Sub shall cease, and the Company shall be the surviving corporation in the Merger (the
“Surviving Corporation”), and the separate corporate existence of the Company, with all its rights, privileges, immunities,
powers and franchises, shall continue unaffected by the Merger. The Merger shall have the effects specified in the DGCL.

Section 2.03 Conversion of Shares.  At the Effective Time, as a result of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent,
Merger Sub, the Company or the holders of any capital stock of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company:

(a) except as otherwise provided in Section 2.03(b) or Section 2.05, each share of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be automatically canceled and converted into and shall thereafter
represent the right to receive $21.75 in cash without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes (the “Merger
Consideration”). As of the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be issued and
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of any such shares of Company
Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration in
accordance with this Agreement;

(b) each share of Company Common Stock owned by the Company and any shares of Company Common Stock owned by
Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist and

powers and privileges as the shares so converted and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the
Surviving Corporation.

Section 2.04 Surrender and Payment.

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint Computershare Trust Company, N.A. as the exchange agent (or such other
nationally recognized exchange agent agreed to between the parties hereto) (the “Exchange Agent”) for the purpose of
exchanging the Merger Consideration for certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock (the “Certificates”);
provided, however, that any references herein to “Certificates” are deemed to include references to book-entry account
statements relating to the ownership of shares of Company Common Stock. At or prior to the Effective Time and except
with respect to the Merger Consideration payable pursuant to Company Restricted Stock Awards (which are governed by
Section 2.06(b)), Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited with the Exchange Agent the Aggregate Merger
Consideration (the “Payment Fund”). To the extent such fund diminishes for any reason below the level required to make
prompt payment of the Merger Consideration, Parent shall promptly replace or restore, or cause to be replaced or restored,
the lost portion of such fund so as to ensure that it is, at all times, maintained at a level sufficient to make such payments.
The Payment Fund shall be invested by the Exchange Agent as directed by Parent; provided that (i) no such investment or
losses thereon shall relieve Parent from making the payments required by this Article 2 or affect the amount of Merger
Consideration payable hereunder, (ii) no such investment shall have maturities that could prevent or delay payments to be
made pursuant to this Agreement and (iii) such investments shall be in short-term obligations of the United States with
maturities of no more than 30 days, or guaranteed by, and backed by the full faith and credit of, the United States. Any and
all interest or other amounts earned with respect to such funds shall become part of the Payment Fund. The Payment Fund
shall not be used for any other purpose. The Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to) pay all charges and expenses, including those of the Exchange Agent, in connection with the exchange of shares of
Company Common Stock and the payment of the Merger Consideration in respect of such shares of Company Common
Stock.

(b) Promptly after the Effective Time, and in any event no later than three Business Days after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall send, or shall cause the Exchange Agent to send, to each record holder of shares of Company Common
Stock at the Effective Time whose shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to
Section 2.03(a) (other than shares of Company Common Stock subject to Company Restricted Stock Awards) a letter of
transmittal and instructions in customary forms reasonably satisfactory to the Company and Parent (which shall specify that
the delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery or transfer of the Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu of the Certificates pursuant to Section 2.09) to the Exchange Agent) for use in such exchange. Each
holder of shares of Company Common Stock that have been converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
(other than shares of Company Common Stock subject to Company Restricted Stock Awards) shall, subject to Section
2.04(e), be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by
a Certificate upon (i) surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with a duly completed and validly executed
letter of transmittal, or (ii) receipt of an “agent’s message” by the Exchange Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer
as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry transfer of shares of Company Common Stock,
and, in each case, delivery to the Exchange Agent of such other documents as may reasonably be requested by the Exchange
Agent. Until so surrendered or transferred, each such Certificate shall represent after the Effective Time for all purposes only
the right to receive such Merger Consideration. No interest shall be paid or accrued on the cash payable upon the surrender
or transfer of such Certificate.

(c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered
Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or
shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall pay to the Exchange Agent
any transfer or other Tax

required as a result of such payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the
satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

(d) All Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender of Certificates in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to
have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by
such Certificate and from and after the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of
Company Common Stock on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates
are presented to the Surviving Corporation, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration as provided
for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth, in this Article 2.

(e) Any portion of the Payment Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock 12 months
after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation, upon demand, and any such holder who has not
exchanged shares of Company Common Stock for the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Section 2.04 prior to
that time shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of the Merger Consideration, without any
interest thereon but subject to any applicable withholdings. None of Parent, the Company or the Surviving Corporation shall
be liable to any holder of Company Common Stock for any cash from the Payment Fund delivered to a public official
pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or similar Applicable Law.

Section 2.05 Dissenting Shares.  Notwithstanding Section 2.03, shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who has not voted in favor of adoption of this Agreement or
consented thereto in writing, who is entitled to appraisal and who has properly exercised appraisal rights for such shares in
accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL shall not be converted into a right to receive the Merger Consideration but instead shall
be entitled to payment of the appraised value of such shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL following which such
shares shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist; provided, however, that if, after the Effective Time, such holder fails
to perfect, withdraws or loses such holder’s right to appraisal, pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL or if a court of competent
jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not entitled to the relief provided by Section 262 of the DGCL, such shares of
Company Common Stock shall be treated as if they had been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration (less any amounts entitled to be deducted or withheld pursuant to Section 2.08) in accordance with Section 2.03(a),
without interest thereon, upon surrender of such Certificate formerly representing such share. The Company shall provide Parent
prompt written notice of any demands or threatened demands received by the Company for appraisal of shares of Company
Common Stock, any withdrawal of any such demand and any other demand, notice or instrument delivered to the Company prior to
the Effective Time pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL that relates to such demand, and Parent shall have the opportunity and
right to participate in all negotiations and Proceedings with respect to such demands. Except with the prior written consent of
Parent, the Company shall not make any payment with respect to, or offer to settle or settle, any such demands or agree to do any of
the foregoing.

Section 2.06 Company Equity Awards; ESPP.

(a) Except as otherwise agreed upon with the Company and Parent, as of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of the holders thereof, unless otherwise agreed by a holder thereof, each Company Stock
Option, whether or not vested and exercisable, that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time,
shall be automatically converted into the right to receive from the Surviving Corporation (and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to pay) an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the excess, if any, of the
Merger Consideration over the per share exercise price of such Company Stock Option, by (ii) the aggregate number of
shares of Company Common Stock that were issuable upon exercise or settlement of such Company Stock Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time (such product, the “Option Cash Amount”); provided, however, that if the exercise
price per share of a Company Stock Option is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration, such Company Stock
Option shall be cancelled and terminated effective upon the Effective Time without any cash payment being made in respect
thereof. The cancellation of a Company Stock

Option as provided in the immediately preceding sentence shall be deemed a release of any and all rights the holder thereof
had or may have had in respect of such Company Stock Option. From and after the Effective Time, the former holder of any
cancelled Company Stock Option shall only be entitled to receive the Option Cash Amount in respect of such cancelled
Company Stock Option. Payments of the Option Cash Amount shall be made by the Surviving Corporation no later than the
next regular payment date under the Company’s payroll system that is at least five Business Days after the Effective Time,
without interest. All payments provided pursuant to this Section 2.06(a) shall be made through the Surviving Corporation’s
or one of its Affiliate’s payroll and/or equity award maintenance systems, subject to withholding in accordance with the
provisions of Section 2.08.

(b) Except as otherwise agreed upon with the Company and Parent, as of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of the holders thereof, each outstanding Company Restricted Stock Award shall become fully
vested and the restrictions with respect thereto shall lapse. All Company Restricted Stock Awards, including shares that
become fully vested and with respect to which the restrictions shall lapse as of the Effective Time, shall not be assumed by
Parent or Merger Sub in the Merger and shall automatically be cancelled and converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration and be treated in the Merger in the same manner as the other shares of Company Common Stock in
accordance with Section 2.03(a). The Company Restricted Stock Award payments described in this Section 2.06(b) shall be
made by the Surviving Corporation no later than the next regular payment date under the Company’s payroll system that is
at least five (5) Business Days after the Effective Time, without interest. All payments provided pursuant to this Section 2.06
shall be made through the Surviving Corporation’s or one of its Affiliate’s payroll and/or equity award maintenance systems,
subject to withholding in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.08. In no event shall this Section 2.06 and Section 2.04
result in a duplication of benefits with respect to any Company Restricted Stock Awards.

(c) Except as otherwise agreed upon with the Company and Parent, as of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of the holders thereof, each outstanding Company RSU Award, whether or not vested, shall
not be assumed by Parent or Merger Sub in the Merger and shall be canceled and extinguished as of the Effective Time and,
in exchange therefor, each former holder of any such Company RSU Award shall have the right to receive from the
Surviving Corporation (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay) an amount in cash equal to the product
obtained by multiplying (i) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company RSU
Award by (ii) the Merger Consideration (such amounts payable hereunder, the “RSU Award Payments”). From and after
the Effective Time, the former holder of any canceled Company RSU Award shall only be entitled to receive the RSU Award
Payment in respect of such canceled Company RSU Award. The RSU Award Payments described in this Section 2.06(c)
shall be made by the Surviving Corporation no later than the next regular payment date under the Company’s payroll system
that is at least five Business Days after the Effective Time, without interest; provided that such payment shall be made at
such other time or times following the Effective Time consistent with the terms of the Company RSU Award to the extent
necessary to avoid the imposition of additional income tax under Section 409A of the Code. All payments provided pursuant
to this Section 2.06(c) shall be made through the Surviving Corporation’s or one of its Affiliate’s payroll and/or equity award
maintenance systems, subject to withholding in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.08.

(d) Except as otherwise agreed upon with the Company and Parent, as of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of the holders thereof, each Company PSU Award shall be deemed fully earned at the greater
of (i) 100% of the specified target award level, and (ii) the percentage of the target award level that would be earned based
on achievement of the applicable performance metric as of the Effective Time pursuant to the terms of the applicable
Performance Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement, any time-based restrictions thereon shall lapse, and such Company
PSU Awards shall not be assumed by Parent or Merger Sub in the Merger and shall be canceled and extinguished as of the

cause the Surviving Corporation to pay) an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the aggregate
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company PSU Award (taking into account the achievement
and acceleration contemplated by this Section 2.06(d)) by (ii) the Merger Consideration (such amounts payable hereunder,
the “PSU Award Payments”). From and after the Effective Time, the former holder of any canceled Company PSU Award
shall only be entitled to receive the PSU Award Payment in respect of such canceled Company PSU Award. The PSU Award
Payments described in this Section 2.06(d) shall be made by the Surviving Corporation no later than the next regular

Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay) an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the
aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Phantom Stock Award by (ii) the Merger
Consideration (such amounts payable hereunder, the “Phantom Stock Payments”). From and after the Effective Time, the
holder of any canceled Company Phantom Stock Award shall only be entitled to receive the Phantom Stock Payment in
respect of such canceled Company Phantom Stock Award. The Phantom Stock Payments described in this Section 2.06(e)

shares of capital stock of the Company shall occur by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including reverse
stock split) or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend, the Merger Consideration and any other

been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company and no other corporate proceedings on the
part of the Company pursuant to the DGCL or otherwise, are necessary to authorize the execution, delivery and performance
of this Agreement or to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The only vote
of holders of any class of capital stock of the Company necessary to adopt this Agreement, approve the Merger and
consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby is the affirmative vote (in person or by proxy) of
holders of a majority in voting power of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, voting together as a single
class (such vote, the “Stockholder Approval”). This Agreement constitutes a valid and binding agreement of the Company
enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, moratorium and other similar Applicable Law affecting creditors’ rights generally and by general principles of
equity.

(b) At a meeting duly called and held, prior to the execution of this Agreement, the Company Board unanimously (acting upon
the recommendation of the Special Committee) duly adopted resolutions (i) determining and declaring that this Agreement,
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement are advisable and in the best interests of the
Company’s stockholders, (ii) approving the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (iii) directing that the adoption of this Agreement be submitted to a vote
of the stockholders of the Company at the Stockholder Meeting and (iv) recommending adoption of this Agreement to the
stockholders of the Company (the “Company Recommendation”). The Company is not party to any stockholder rights
agreement or “poison pill” or similar anti-takeover agreement or plan. The Company Board has taken all necessary action so
that Section 203 of the DGCL or any similar anti-takeover, moratorium, or “control share” law applicable to the Company
does not, and will not, apply to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

(b) As of the date hereof, neither Parent nor Merger Sub is aware of any fact or circumstance relating to its or any of its
Affiliates’ (including any portfolio company Affiliate) respective businesses, assets, liabilities, operations or legal status that
would reasonably be expected to impair the ability of the parties to obtain, on a timely basis, any expiration of any waiting

the Financing Commitment Letters has been withdrawn, terminated, repudiated, rescinded, amended or modified, no terms
thereunder have been waived, and, to the knowledge of Parent, no such withdrawal, termination, repudiation, rescission,
amendment, modification or waiver is contemplated. Parent or Merger Sub has fully paid any and all commitment fees or other fees
payable on or prior to the date hereof in connection with the Financing Commitment Letters. Assuming (i) the Financing is funded
in accordance with the Equity Commitment Letters and the Debt Commitment Letter, as applicable, the net proceeds contemplated
by the Equity Commitment Letters and the Debt Commitment Letter (both before and after giving effect to any “flex” provisions
contained in the Debt Commitment Letter) will, in the aggregate be sufficient for Parent and Merger Sub and the Surviving
Corporation to pay all amounts required to be paid in connection with the Merger and the transactions contemplated in this
Agreement and Financing Commitment Letters, including, without limitation, payment of the Aggregate Merger Consideration,
repayment or refinancing of debt of the Company and its Subsidiaries contemplated by this Agreement or the Debt Commitment
Letter, and payment of any other fees and expenses and payment obligations required to be paid or satisfied by Parent or Merger
Sub on or prior to the Closing Date in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Financing (the
“Required Amount”), assuming the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 7.02(a) and Section 7.02(b) on the Closing
Date. The Financing Commitment Letters are, as to Parent, Merger Sub and the other parties thereto, enforceable against Parent and
Merger Sub and, to the knowledge of Parent, each of the other parties thereto, in accordance with their terms, in each case, as
enforcement may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or similar Applicable Laws affecting creditors’ rights
generally and by general principles of equity. As of the date hereof, the Financing Commitment Letters are in full force and effect
and no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would or would reasonably be expected to
constitute a default or breach on the part of Parent or Merger Sub or, to the knowledge of Parent, any other parties thereto, under
any of the Financing Commitment Letters. Assuming the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 7.01 and Section 7.02 on
the Closing Date, as of the date hereof, Parent does not have any reason to believe (both before and after giving effect to any “flex”
provisions contained in the Debt Commitment Letter) that any of the conditions to the funding of the full amount of the Financing
will not be satisfied on a timely basis or that the full amount of the Financing will not be available to Parent or Merger Sub on the
date of the Closing. As of the date hereof, the Financing Commitment Letters contain all of the conditions precedent and other
conditions to the obligations of the parties thereunder to make the full amount of the Financing available to Parent on the terms
therein. There are no side letters or other agreements, arrangements or understandings (other than with respect to an alternative
financing consistent with the provisions of Section 6.17(b)) that could affect the availability of the Financing on the Closing Date to
which Parent or any of its Affiliates is a party related to the funding or investing, as applicable, of the Required Amount other than
as expressly set forth in the Financing Commitment Letters. The Equity Commitment Letters provide, and will continue to provide,
that the Company is a third party beneficiary thereof as set forth therein. The obligations of Parent and Merger Sub under this
Agreement are not subject to any conditions regarding Parent’s, Merger Sub’s, their respective Affiliates’ or any other Person’s
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Company’s or any Subsidiary of the Company’s) ability to obtain the Financing.

Section 5.09 Solvency.  Assuming (a) satisfaction of the conditions to Parent’s obligation to consummate the Merger, and after
giving effect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Financing and the payment of the Aggregate
Merger Consideration, (b) any repayment or refinancing of debt contemplated in this Agreement or the Financing Commitment
Letters, (c) the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in Article 4 hereof, (d) payment of all
amounts required to be paid in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (e) payment
of all related fees and expenses, (f) compliance with the Company’s obligations in this Agreement and satisfaction of the conditions
set forth in Section 7.01 and Section 7.02 on the Closing Date and (g) any estimates, projections or forecasts of the Company and
its Subsidiaries furnished to Parent or its Affiliates or Representatives have been prepared by them in good faith based upon
assumptions that were and continue to be reasonable, each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation will be Solvent as of the
Effective Time and immediately after the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. For purposes of this
Agreement, the term “Solvent” when used with respect to any Person, means that, as of any date of determination (x) the amount of
the present “fair saleable value” of the assets of such Person will, as of such

date, exceed (i) the value of all “liabilities of such Person, including contingent and other liabilities,” as of such date, as such
quoted terms are generally determined in accordance with Applicable Laws governing determinations of the insolvency of debtors,
and (ii) the amount that will be required to pay the probable liabilities of such Person on its existing debts (including contingent and
other liabilities) as such debts become absolute and mature, (y) such Person will not have, as of such date, an unreasonably small
amount of capital for the operation of the businesses in which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged following such date, and (z)
such Person will be able to pay its liabilities, including contingent and other liabilities, as they mature. For purposes of this
definition, “not have an unreasonably small amount of capital for the operation of the businesses in which it is engaged or proposed
to be engaged” and “able to pay its liabilities, including contingent and other liabilities, as they mature” means that such Person
will be able to generate enough cash from operations, asset dispositions or refinancing, or a combination thereof, to meet its
obligations as they become due.

Section 5.10 Guarantee.  Parent has furnished the Company with a duly executed, true, complete and correct copy of the
Guarantees. Each Guarantee is in full force and effect. Each Guarantee is (i) a legal, valid and binding obligation of the applicable
Guarantor and (ii) enforceable in accordance with its respective terms against such Guarantor, except as such enforceability may be
limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium and other similar Applicable Law affecting creditors’ rights generally and by
general principles of equity. There is no breach or default under any Guarantee by the applicable Guarantor, and no event has
occurred that would constitute a breach or default (or with notice or lapse of time or both would constitute a breach or default)
thereunder by such Guarantor.

Section 5.11 Absence of Certain Agreements.  As of the date hereof, neither Parent, Merger Sub nor any of their respective
Affiliates has entered into any agreement, arrangement or understanding (in each case, whether oral or written), or authorized,
committed or agreed to enter into any agreement, arrangement or understanding (in each case, whether oral or written), (i) pursuant
to which any stockholder of the Company would be entitled to receive, in respect of any share of Company Common Stock,
consideration of a different amount or nature than the Merger Consideration or pursuant to which any stockholder of the Company
has agreed to vote to adopt this Agreement or has agreed to vote against any Superior Proposal or (ii) pursuant to which any
stockholder of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has agreed to make an investment in, or contribution to, Parent or Merger
Sub in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. As of the date hereof, there are no agreements,
arrangements or understandings (in each case, whether oral or written) between Parent, Merger Sub, the Guarantor or any of their
respective Affiliates, on the one hand, and any member of the Company’s management or directors, on the other hand, that relate in
any way to, or are in connection with, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. As of the date hereof, none of Parent,
Merger Sub, the Guarantor has entered into any Contract with any Person prohibiting such Person from providing or seeking to
provide debt financing to any Person in connection with a transaction involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in
connection with the Merger, other than Contracts with any Debt Financing Sources in effect on the date hereof, true, correct and
complete copies of which have been provided to Parent on the date hereof.

Section 5.12 Stock Ownership.  Neither Parent nor Merger Sub owns any shares of capital stock of the Company. None of Parent,
Merger Sub nor any of their respective Affiliates is an “interested stockholder” of the Company as defined in Section 203(c) of the
DGCL.

Section 5.13 Brokers’ Fees.  There is no investment banker, broker, finder or other agent or intermediary that has been retained by

Agreement, other than those that become payable by the Surviving Corporation following the consummation of the Merger.

respective Representatives to not, provide any commercially sensitive non-public information to any competitor in
connection with the actions permitted by this Section 6.02(b), except in a manner consistent with the Company’s past
practices in dealing with the disclosure of such information in the context of considering Acquisition Proposals prior to the

Parent, Merger Sub and/or their Representatives with respect to such information in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby.

(c) From and after the date hereof, the Company shall as promptly as practicable (and in any event within 24 hours) notify
Parent of the Company’s receipt of (i) any Acquisition Proposal or (ii) any inquiries, proposals or offers with respect to, or

of any provision of, any confidentiality, standstill or similar agreement (or any standstill or confidentiality provision of any
other contract or agreement) to which any of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company is a party (a “Standstill
Provision”) or any “moratorium,” “control share acquisition,” “fair price,” “interested stockholder,” “affiliate transaction,”
“business combination,” or other antitakeover Applicable Law (provided, however, that the Company Board or any
committee thereof may grant a waiver, release or termination of a Standstill Provision if, but only if, the Company Board or
any committee thereof determines in good faith, after consultation with the Company Financial Advisor and outside legal
counsel, that failure to provide such waiver, release or termination would reasonably be likely to be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under Applicable Law), and the Company will use its reasonable best efforts to enforce or cause to be
enforced to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law each such agreement.

(e) The Company agrees that in the event any of its Subsidiaries or its or their Representatives takes any action which, if taken

Stockholder Approval (and subject to the Company’s or the Company Board’s, as applicable, compliance with Section 6.02,
this Section 6.03 and Section 9.04), the Company Board or the Special Committee may, if it determines in good faith (after
consultation with the Company Financial Advisor and outside legal counsel), that the failure to do so would be reasonably
likely to be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Company Board under Applicable Law, (A) make an Adverse
Recommendation Change as a result of either (1) a Superior Proposal or (2) any fact, event, change, development or

pursuant to Section 8.01(h) (a “Notice of Superior Proposal”) and specifying the reasons therefor, including, the
material terms and conditions of, and the identity of the Third Party making, such Superior Proposal, and a copy of
any other relevant transaction documents (it being understood and agreed that any amendment to the financial terms

notice);

considered in good faith Parent’s proposal to adjust the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Guarantees, the
Financing Commitment Letters, and the Company Board or the Special Committee determines in good faith (after
consultation with the Company Financial Advisor and outside legal counsel) that (x) the failure to make an Adverse
Recommendation Change or authorize the termination of this Agreement would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under Applicable Law and (y) after taking into account any adjustment or modification to the terms of this
Agreement proposed by Parent, that the Acquisition Proposal continues to be a Superior Proposal. None of the
Company, the Company Board or any committee thereof shall enter into any agreement with any Third Party to limit
or not to give prior notice to Parent of its intention to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change or to terminate this
Agreement in light of a Superior Proposal.

(iii)In the case of an Intervening Event, no Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to this Section 6.03(b) may be made:

(A)until after the fourth Business Day following written notice from the Company advising Parent that the Company
Board or the Special Committee intends to take such action and specifying the material facts underlying the
determination by the Company Board or the Special Committee that an Intervening Event has occurred, and the
reason for the Adverse Recommendation Change, in reasonable detail (a “Notice of Intervening Event”);

(B) unless during such four Business Day period, the Company shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, to the extent
requested by Parent, negotiate with Parent in good faith to enable Parent to amend this Agreement, the Guarantees,
the Financing Commitment Letters in such a manner that permits the Company Board to maintain the Company
Recommendation and not make an Adverse Recommendation Change; and

(C) unless, by the expiration of such four Business Day period, the Company Board or the Special Committee has
considered in good faith any amendments to this Agreement, the Guarantees, the Financing Commitment Letters
proposed by Parent and has determined in good faith (after consultation with the Company Financial Advisor and
outside legal counsel), that the failure to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change would be reasonably likely to
be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law if such amendments were implemented.

The provisions of this Section 6.03(b)(iii) shall also apply to any material change to the facts and circumstances relating
to an Intervening Event, in which case such change shall require a new Notice of Intervening Event and the Company
shall be required to comply again with the provisions of this Section 6.03(b)(iii), except that any reference to four
Business Days shall instead be to two Business Days.

(c) Nothing contained in Section 6.03 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company from (i) taking and disclosing
a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9, Rule 14e-2(a) or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange
Act with regard to an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) making any disclosure to the Company’s stockholders if, in the good faith
judgment of the Company Board or the Special Committee, after consultation with outside legal counsel, such disclosure is
required by Applicable Law, or (iii) making any disclosure that constitutes a stop, look and listen communication or similar
communication of the type contemplated by Section 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act, provided that the
Company Board shall not recommend that the stockholders of the Company tender their shares in connection with any
tender or exchange offer (or otherwise approve or recommend any Acquisition Proposal) or effect an Adverse
Recommendation Change, unless, in each case, the applicable requirements of Section 6.03(b) shall have been and continue
at the time of such action to be satisfied as to an Adverse Recommendation Change.

Agreement, the Company shall prepare a proxy statement in preliminary form for a special meeting of the Company’s
stockholders (including any adjournments and postponements thereof, the “Stockholder Meeting”) (together with any

the SEC and the Company and Parent shall cooperate with each other in connection with the preparation of the foregoing,
including to cause their respective Affiliates, as applicable, to cooperate with the preparation of the foregoing. The Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts to have the Proxy Statement cleared by the SEC as promptly as practicable after the

hand, and the SEC, or its staff or any other government officials, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of Parent and Merger Sub shall cooperate, and shall cause their
respective Affiliates to cooperate, with the Company in connection with the preparation and filing of the Proxy Statement,
including promptly furnishing to the Company in writing upon request any and all information relating to Parent, Merger
Sub and their respective Affiliates as may be required to be set forth in the Proxy Statement under Applicable Law. Parent
shall ensure that such information supplied by it and its Affiliates in writing for inclusion in the Proxy Statement will not, on
the date it is first mailed to stockholders of the Company and at the time of the Stockholder Meeting or filed with the SEC
(as applicable), contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not
misleading. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary stated above, prior to filing or mailing the Proxy Statement (or any
amendment or supplement thereto), or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto, the Company shall
provide Parent with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such document or response and shall consider
Parent’s comments in good faith. The Company shall ensure that the Proxy Statement (i) will not on the date it is first mailed
to stockholders of the Company and at the time of the Stockholder Meeting contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading and (ii) will comply as to form in all material respects with the
applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations of the SEC and Nasdaq. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Company assumes no responsibility with respect to information supplied in writing by or on behalf of Parent
or Merger Sub or their Affiliates for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement. If, at any time prior to
the Stockholder Meeting, the Company, Parent or Merger Sub discovers information provided by it for inclusion in the
Proxy Statement has become false or misleading in any material respect, the party hereto which discovers such information
shall promptly notify the other parties hereto and the Company shall promptly prepare and file with the SEC an appropriate
amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement and, to the extent required by Applicable Law or the SEC or its staff,
disseminate such amendment or supplement to the Company’s stockholders.

event within five (5) Business Days after clearance by the SEC), the Company shall cause the Proxy Statement in definitive
form to be mailed to the Company’s stockholders. As promptly as reasonably practicable following the mailing of the Proxy
Statement to the Company’s stockholders, the Company shall, in accordance with Applicable Law and the Company’s
governing documents, convene and hold the Stockholder Meeting for the purpose of considering and taking action upon the
matters requiring Stockholder Approval (with the record date

Company Recommendation in compliance with Section 6.03, the Company shall (i) make the Company Recommendation to
the stockholders of the Company and include such recommendation in the Proxy Statement, (ii) use its reasonable best
efforts to solicit from stockholders of the Company proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and (iii) take all other
action necessary or advisable to secure the vote of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock required by Applicable
Law to effect the Merger. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the Company may adjourn,
recess or postpone the Stockholder Meeting solely (i) after consultation with Parent, to the extent necessary to ensure that
any required supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement is provided to the stockholders of the Company within a
reasonable amount of time in advance of the Stockholders Meeting or (ii) if as of the time for which the Stockholders
Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy Statement) there are insufficient shares of Company Common
Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the
Stockholders Meeting.

Section 6.05 Access to Information.  Subject to Applicable Law, upon reasonable notice, the Company shall (and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to) afford Parent, the Debt Financing Sources and its and their authorized Representatives reasonable access, during
normal business hours throughout the period prior to the Effective Time, to its properties, books, Tax Returns, Contracts and

Contracts or records if such access would violate a confidentiality, non-disclosure or other similar agreement in effect as of the date
hereof, (b) to provide access to or otherwise make available or furnish any information if and to the extent that the provision of
such information would in the good faith judgment of the Company based on advice of counsel jeopardize any attorney-client,
work product or other legal privilege or protection (it being agreed that, in the case of clauses (a) and (b), the Company shall give
notice to Parent of the fact that it is withholding such information or documents and thereafter the Company and Parent shall use
their respective commercially reasonable efforts to cause such information to be provided in a manner that would not reasonably be
expected to violate such restriction or waive the applicable privilege or protection), (c) to provide access to or otherwise make
available any information relating to the process conducted by the Company that led to the execution of this Agreement, or (d) to

the case of clause (d), that the Company shall give notice to Parent of the fact that it is withholding such information or documents
and thereafter the Company and Parent shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to cause such information to be provided in
a manner that would not reasonably be expected to violate such Applicable Law). Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
Parent and Merger Sub shall not, and shall cause their respective Representatives acting on their behalf not to, contact any
customer, partner, vendor or supplier of the Company in connection with the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement without the Company’s prior written consent, and Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that any such
contact shall be arranged and supervised by Representatives of the Company. All requests for information made pursuant to this
Section 6.05 shall be directed to the executive officer or other Person designated by the Company. All such information shall be
deemed Evaluation Material (as defined in the Confidentiality Agreements) under and be governed by the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreements.

Section 6.06 Notice of Certain Events.  Each of the Company and Parent will give prompt notice to the other (and will subsequently
keep the other informed on a reasonably current basis of any material developments related to such notice) upon its becoming

Section 6.06 shall limit or otherwise affect any of the representations, warranties, covenants, obligations or conditions contained in
this Agreement.

Section 6.07 Employee Benefit Plan Matters.

(a) From and after the Closing Date, with respect to employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries immediately before the
Effective Time who continue employment with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation following the Closing Date (“Continuing Employees”), Parent shall cause the service of each such
Continuing Employee to be recognized for purposes of eligibility to participate, levels of benefits (but not for benefit
accruals under any defined benefit pension plan) and vesting under each compensation, retirement, vacation, fringe or other
welfare benefit plan, program or arrangement of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries (collectively,
the “Parent Benefit Plans”) in which any Continuing Employee is or becomes eligible to participate, but solely to the extent
service was credited to such employee for such purposes under a comparable Company Employee Plan immediately prior to
the Closing Date and to the extent such credit would not result in a duplication of benefits. Parent shall assume any and all
vacation balances of Continuing Employees, and shall assume all costs and notice obligations incurred in connection with
terminations of non-Continuing Employees.

(b) For a period of not less than 12 months after the Closing Date, Parent shall provide each Continuing Employee with (i) (A)
base salary or base hourly rate and (B) cash incentive compensation target opportunity (including commissions but
excluding specified performance goals for any cash incentive compensation in respect of any calendar year after the 2017
calendar year), in each case in an amount at least equal to the level that was provided to each such Continuing Employee
prior to the Closing Date, and (ii) employee benefits (other than equity awards) that are substantially comparable in the
aggregate to those provided to each such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date. Parent shall also
honor the Company’s annual cash incentive bonus plans in effect for the 2017 calendar year, and shall provide each
Continuing Employee with a cash incentive bonus for 2017 which shall be paid consistent with the Company’s prior bonus
payment timing, but in no event later than March 15, 2018. Each Person listed on Schedule 6.07(b) shall receive his or her
pro-rated target cash bonus with respect to 2017 in connection with and at the Effective Time of the Merger, and the bonus
amount payable to such Person following the conclusion of the 2017 fiscal year shall be reduced by any pro-rated target cash
bonus paid with respect to 2017 at the Effective Time. In addition, Parent shall (i) assume and honor the terms of the
severance agreements listed on Schedule 6.07(b) and provide the severance payments and benefits required thereunder to be

and (ii) for a period of 12 months after the Closing Date, honor the terms of Company’s and its Subsidiaries’ severance
policies generally applicable to all employees as in effect as of the Closing Date. Between the date hereof and the Closing
Date, the Company may, subject to Parent’s consent, and the Parent and the Company will work in good faith to, implement
changes to the Company’s 2017 cash incentive bonus plan for VP and director level employees to be effective as of the
Closing Date, which changes will be designed to facilitate the retention of such employees.

(c) From and after the Closing Date, with respect to each Parent Benefit Plan that is an “employee welfare benefit plan” as
defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA in which any Continuing Employee is or becomes eligible to participate, Parent shall use
reasonable best efforts to cause each such Parent Benefit Plan to (i) waive all limitations as to pre-existing conditions,
waiting periods, required physical examinations and exclusions with respect to participation and coverage requirements
applicable under such Parent Benefit Plan for such Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents to the same extent
that such pre-existing conditions, waiting periods, required physical examinations and exclusions would not have applied or
would have been waived under the corresponding Company Employee Plan in which such Continuing Employee was a
participant immediately prior to his or her commencement of participation in such Parent Benefit Plan but, with respect to
long-term disability and life insurance benefits and coverage, solely to the extent permitted under the terms and conditions
of Parent’s applicable insurance contracts in effect as of

conditions based on periods of employment, Section 6.07(a) shall control; and (ii) provide each Continuing Employee and
their eligible dependents with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid in the calendar year that, and prior to the date
that, such Continuing Employee commences participation in such Parent Benefit Plan in satisfying any applicable co-
payment or deductible requirements under such Parent Benefit Plan for the applicable calendar year, to the extent that such
expenses were recognized for such purposes under the comparable Company Employee Plan.

(d) From and after the Closing Date, Parent shall honor, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and their respective
Subsidiaries to honor, in accordance with its terms, (i) each existing (as of immediately prior to the Effective Time)
employment, change in control, retention, severance and termination protection plan, policy or agreement of or between the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any current or former officer, director or employee of that company to the extent set
forth on Schedule 6.07(b), (ii) all obligations in effect as of the Effective Time under any “Merger Bonus Agreement” as

Time under any bonus or bonus deferral plans, programs or agreements of the Company or its Subsidiaries and (iv) all
vested and accrued benefits under any Company Employee Plan. Parent acknowledges that the transaction contemplated
hereby shall constitute a “change in control” for purposes of each Company Employee Plan set forth on Schedule 6.07(d)
that uses such term.

(e) Nothing in this Section 6.07 shall be deemed to amend any Parent Benefit Plan or to require Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their Affiliates to continue or amend any particular benefit plan before or after the consummation of
the transactions contemplated in this Agreement, and any such plan may be amended or terminated in accordance with its
terms and Applicable Law. The provisions of this Section 6.07 are for the sole benefit of the parties hereto and nothing
herein, express or implied, is intended or shall be construed to confer upon or give to any person (including any Continuing
Employee), other than the parties to this Agreement and their respective successors and permitted assigns, any legal or
equitable or other rights or remedies under or by reason of any provision of this Section 6.07. Nothing contained herein,
express or implied is intended to confer upon any Continuing Employee any right to employment or continued employment

Law becomes or is deemed to be applicable to the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, the Merger, or any other transaction contemplated
by this Agreement, then each of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, and their respective Board of Directors shall grant such
approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise act to render such anti-takeover Applicable
Law inapplicable to the foregoing.

perform its obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby on the
terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement.

Section 6.11 Director and Officer Liability.

(a) For six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain officers’ and directors’
liability insurance in respect of acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time covering each such person currently
covered by the Company’s officers’ and directors’ liability insurance policy on terms with respect to coverage and amount
no less favorable than those of such policy in effect on the date hereof; provided, however, that in satisfying its obligation
under this Section 6.11(a), neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to pay annual premiums in excess
of 300% of the amount per annum the Company paid in its last full fiscal year prior to the date hereof (the “Current
Premium”) and if such premiums for such insurance would at any time exceed 300% of the Current Premium, then the
Surviving Corporation shall cause to be maintained policies of insurance that, in the Surviving Corporation’s good faith
judgment, provide the maximum coverage available at an annual premium equal to 300% of the Current Premium. The
provisions of the immediately preceding sentence shall be deemed to have been satisfied if prepaid “tail” or “runoff” policies
have been obtained by the Company prior to the Effective Time, which policies provide such persons currently covered by
such policies with coverage for an aggregate period of six years with respect to claims arising from facts or events that
occurred on or before the Effective Time, including in respect of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided,
however, that the amount paid for such prepaid policies does not exceed 300% of the Current Premium. If any such prepaid
policies described in this Section 6.11(a) have been obtained by the Company prior to the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) maintain any and all such policies in full force and
effect for their full term, and continue to honor the obligations thereunder.

(b) From and after the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall: (i) indemnify and hold harmless each
individual who (x) at the Effective Time is, or at any time prior to the Effective Time was, a director or officer of the
Company or of a Subsidiary of the Company or (y) is listed on Part 6.11(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule (each such
individual in clause (x) or (y), an “Indemnified Party”) for any and all costs and expenses (including fees and expenses of
legal counsel, which shall be advanced as they are incurred; provided that the Indemnified Party shall have made an
undertaking to repay such expenses if it is ultimately determined that such Indemnified Party was not entitled to
indemnification under this Section 6.11(b)), judgments, fines, penalties or liabilities (including amounts paid in settlement or
compromise) imposed upon or reasonably incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with or arising out of any
action, suit or other Proceeding (whether civil or criminal) in which such Indemnified Party may be involved or with which
he or she may be threatened (regardless of whether as a named party or as a participant other than as a named party,
including as a witness) (an “Indemnified Party Proceeding”) (A) by reason of such Indemnified Party’s being or having
been such director or officer or an employee or agent of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company or otherwise in
connection with any action taken or not taken at the request of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company or (B)
arising out of such Indemnified Party’s service in connection with any other corporation or organization for which he or she
serves or has served as a director, officer, employee, agent, trustee or fiduciary at the request of the Company (including in
any capacity with respect to any employee benefit plan), in each of (A) or (B), whether or not the Indemnified Party
continues in such position at the time such Indemnified Party Proceeding is brought or threatened and at, or at any time prior
to, the Effective Time (including any Indemnified Party Proceeding relating in whole or in part to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or relating to the enforcement of this provision or any other indemnification or
advancement right of any Indemnified Party), to the fullest extent permitted under Applicable Law; and (ii) fulfill and honor
in all respects the obligations of the Company pursuant to: (x) each indemnification agreement in effect as of the date hereof
between the Company and any Indemnified Party, the form of which has been Made Available to Parent; and (y) any
indemnification provision (including advancement of expenses) and any exculpation provision set forth in the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws of the Company as in effect on the date hereof. Parent’s and the Surviving Corporation’s obligations
under the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) shall continue in full force and effect for a period of six years from the Effective

Time; provided, however, that all rights to indemnification, exculpation and advancement of expenses in respect of any
claim asserted or made within such period shall continue until the final disposition of such claim. If Parent or the Surviving
Corporation fails to comply with its obligations in this Section 6.11(b) and an Indemnified Party commences a suit which
results in a final, non-appealable determination by a court of competent jurisdiction that Parent or the Surviving Corporation
failed to comply with such obligation, Parent shall pay such Indemnified Party his or her costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorney’s fees and disbursements) in connection with such suit, together with interest thereon at the “prime rate”
as published in The Wall Street Journal, Eastern Edition, in effect on the date such payment was required to be made through
the date of payment (calculated daily on the basis of a year of 365 days and the actual number of days elapsed, without
compounding).

(c) If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys
all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case proper provision shall be made
so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations
set forth in this Section 6.11.

(d) The provisions of this Section 6.11 are (i) intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified
Party, his or her heirs and his or her Representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to
indemnification or contribution that any such individual may have under any certificate of incorporation or bylaws, by
contract or otherwise. The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this Section 6.11 shall not be
terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect the rights of any Indemnified Party unless (x) such
termination or modification is required by Applicable Law or (y) the affected Indemnified Party shall have consented in
writing to such termination or modification (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnified Parties shall be third party
beneficiaries of this Section 6.11); provided, however, that such rights of the Indemnified Parties as third party beneficiaries
under this Section 6.11 shall not arise until the Effective Time.

Section 6.12 Reasonable Best Efforts.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Company and Parent shall use their reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in
doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable under Applicable Law to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including (i) using reasonable best efforts to obtain all necessary actions or non-actions, waivers, consents and
approvals from Governmental Authorities and to make all necessary registrations and filings (including filings with
Governmental Authorities, if any) and to take such steps as may be necessary to obtain an approval or waiver from, or to
avoid a Proceeding by, any Governmental Authorities, (ii) using reasonable best efforts to deliver required notices to, and
obtain required consents or waivers from, Third Parties and (iii) the execution and delivery of any additional instruments
necessary to consummate the Merger and to fully carry out the purposes of this Agreement.

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of the Company and Parent (and their respective Affiliates, if
applicable) shall: (i) promptly, but in no event later than five Business Days after the date hereof, file any and all notices,
reports and other documents required to be filed by such party under the HSR Act with respect to the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and shall use reasonable best efforts to promptly secure the expiration or
termination of any applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act; (ii) promptly make all filings, and use reasonable best
efforts to timely obtain all consents, permits, authorizations, waivers, clearances and approvals, and to cause the expiration
or termination of any applicable waiting periods, as may be required under any other applicable Antitrust Laws (to the extent
required); (iii) as promptly as reasonably practicable provide such information as may reasonably be requested by the U.S.

order to commence or end a statutory waiting period; (iv) use reasonable best efforts to cause to be taken, on a timely basis,
all other actions necessary or appropriate for the purpose of consummating and effectuating the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and (v) promptly take, and cause its Subsidiaries to take, all reasonable
actions and steps requested or required by any Governmental Authority as a condition to granting any consent, permit,
authorization, waiver, clearance and approvals, and to cause the prompt expiration or termination of any applicable waiting
period and to resolve such objections, if any, as the FTC and the DOJ, or other Governmental Authorities of any other
jurisdiction for which consents, permits, authorizations, waivers, clearances, approvals and expirations or terminations of
waiting periods are required with respect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided
that (A) the Company and its Subsidiaries will only be required to take or commit to take any such action, or agree to any
such condition or restriction, of the type described in this clause (v) if such action, commitment, agreement, condition or
restriction is binding on the Company or its Subsidiaries, only in the event the Closing occurs and (B) neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries will take or commit to take any such action of the type described in this clause (v), or agree to any
such condition or restriction of the type described in this clause (v), without the prior written consent of Parent. Parent shall
pay all filing fees under the HSR Act and other applicable Antitrust Laws, and the Company shall not be required to pay any
fees or other payments to any Governmental Authority (or any other Person) in connection with any filings under the HSR
Act or such other filings as may be required under applicable Antitrust Laws in connection with the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(c) Without limiting the generality of anything contained in this Section 6.12, each party hereto shall: (i) give the other parties
prompt notice of the making or commencement of any request, inquiry or Proceeding by any Governmental Authority with
respect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) keep the other parties reasonably
informed as to the status of any such request, inquiry or Proceeding; (iii) promptly inform the other parties of any
communication to or from the FTC, DOJ or any other Governmental Authority to the extent regarding the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or regarding any such request, inquiry or Proceeding, and provide a
copy of all written communications; and (iv) pull and re-file any notice under the HSR Act only if the other parties hereto
agree. Subject to Applicable Law, in advance and to the extent practicable, each of Parent or the Company, as the case may
be, will consult the other on all the information relating to Parent or the Company, as the case may be, and any of their
respective Subsidiaries that appear in any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any third party and/or any
Governmental Authority in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and shall
incorporate all comments reasonably proposed by Parent or the Company, as the case may be; provided, however, that if
review of any information would be material in connection with any second request (or similar process) such information
shall be provided solely to those individuals acting as outside antitrust counsel for the other parties (provided that such
counsel shall not disclose such information to such other parties and shall enter into a joint defense agreement with the
providing party). In addition, except as may be prohibited by any Governmental Authority or by any Applicable Law, in
connection with any such request, inquiry or Proceeding in respect of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, each party hereto will permit authorized Representatives of the other party to be present at each meeting or
conference (including telephonic) relating to such request, inquiry or Proceeding and to have access to and be consulted in
connection with any document, opinion or proposal made or submitted to any Governmental Authority in connection with
such request, inquiry or Proceeding.

such action may, at the discretion of Parent or the Company, be conditioned upon consummation of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement) (each a “Divestiture Action”) as may be necessary or required, to avoid the
entry of, or to effect the dissolution of or vacate or lift, any Order that would otherwise have the effect of preventing
consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and to ensure that no
Governmental Authority with the authority to clear, authorize or otherwise approve consummation of the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, fails to do so on a timely basis and in any event no later than three
Business Days prior to the End Date. Parent and the Company shall cooperate in any proposal, negotiation, or offer to
commit and to effect, by consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, any and all Divestiture Actions or otherwise to
offer to take or offer to commit (and if such offer is accepted, commit to and effect) to take any Divestiture Action as may be
required to resolve any Governmental Authority’s objections to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

(e) In the event that any Proceeding is commenced challenging the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and such Proceeding seeks, or would reasonably be expected to seek, to prevent consummation of the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Parent and Merger Sub shall use their reasonable best efforts to
take any and all action to resolve any such Proceeding and each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall cooperate
with each other and use its respective reasonable best efforts to contest any such Proceeding and to have vacated, lifted,

permitted to settle (or engage in settlement negotiations concerning) any Stockholder Litigation without the prior written consent of
Parent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Without otherwise limiting the Indemnified
Parties’ rights with regard to the right to counsel, following the Effective Time, the Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to continue

Section 6.14 Public Announcements.  Parent and the Company shall consult with each other before issuing any press release or
making any other public announcements, or scheduling a press conference or conference call with investors or analysts, with
respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and shall not issue any such press release or make
any such other public announcement without the consent of the other party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed, except (i) as such release or announcement may be required by Applicable Law or any listing agreement with or rule of
any national securities exchange or association upon which the securities of the Company or Parent, as applicable, are listed, in
which case the party required to make the release or announcement shall use reasonable best efforts to consult with the other party
about, and allow the other party reasonable time (taking into account the circumstances) to comment on, such release or
announcement in advance of such issuance and (ii) for statements that (1) are consistent with previous releases, public disclosures
or public statements made jointly by the parties (or individually, if approved by the other party), or (2) relate to an Acquisition

officers and directors of the Company who are subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act in
connection with the Merger, both prior to and after the Effective Time, it is desirable that such Persons not be subject to a risk of
liability under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and, for that compensatory and retentive purpose, agree to the provisions of this
Section 6.16. Promptly after the date hereof and in any event prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all such steps as
may be required to cause any dispositions of shares of Company Common Stock resulting from the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement by each individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect
to the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law.

consummate the Financing on the terms and conditions (including, to the extent required, the full exercise of any “flex”
provisions) described in the Financing Commitment Letters and the fee letter pursuant to the terms thereof (or, with respect

not permit any amendment, supplement or modification to be made to, or any waiver of any provision under, the Financing
Commitment Letters if such amendment, supplement, modification, replacement or waiver (A) with respect to the Financing
Commitment Letters, reduces (or could have the effect of reducing) the aggregate amount of the Financing (including by
increasing the amount of fees to be paid or original issue discount unless (x) the Debt Financing or the Equity Financing is
increased by a corresponding amount or the Debt Financing is otherwise made available to fund such fees or original issue
discount and (y) after giving effect to any of the transactions referred to in clause (x) above, the representation and warranty

Merger Sub may amend the Debt Commitment Letter to (i) add additional lenders, arrangers, bookrunners, agents and other
similar entities or (ii) replace such Financing with alternative financing from alternative sources in an amount sufficient to
pay the Required Amount (after taking into account consideration cash on hand at the Parent and other available financing

commitment in respect of the Debt Financing without the prior written consent of the Company, and shall not release or
consent to the termination of the obligations of the financing sources under the Debt Commitment Letter other than to effect
the joinder or addition of financing sources to the Debt Commitment Letter providing replacement commitments in a
manner not prohibited by this Section 6.17. Parent shall promptly deliver to the Company copies of any such material

Parent or Merger Sub believes in good faith that it will not be able to obtain all or any portion of the Financing on the terms
and conditions, in the manner or from the sources contemplated by any of the Financing Commitment Letters or definitive
agreements related to the Financing; provided, that in no event will Parent or Merger Sub be under any obligation to disclose
any information that would result in the waiver of attorney-client or similar privilege if Parent and Merger Sub shall have
used their reasonable best efforts to disclose such information in a way that would not waive such privilege (it being agreed
that Parent or Merger Sub shall give notice to the Company of the fact that it is withholding such information). As soon as

otherwise becomes unavailable, and such portion is reasonably required to fund the Aggregate Merger Consideration and all
fees, expenses and other amounts contemplated to be paid by Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation pursuant to
this Agreement and the Financing, Parent and Merger Sub shall use their reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain in
replacement thereof alternative debt financing from alternative sources in an amount sufficient to consummate the Merger
and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement with terms and conditions not less favorable to Parent and Merger Sub
than the terms and conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter and with lenders reasonably satisfactory to Parent and
Merger Sub, as promptly as reasonably practicable following the occurrence of such event. Parent shall deliver to the
Company true and complete copies of all agreements, arrangements or understandings (including fee letters (subject to
redaction consistent with the requirements of Section 5.08)) related to any such alternative Debt Financing. Parent and
Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that the obtaining of the Financing, or any alternative financing, is not a condition to
Closing.

(c) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to provide, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to use their respective reasonable best efforts to provide, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its
Representatives to use their respective reasonable best efforts to provide, to Parent and Merger Sub, in each case at Parent’s
sole expense, all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing,
including (i) upon reasonable notice and at mutually convenient times, causing representatives of senior management of the
Company to participate in a reasonable number of meetings and presentations with prospective lenders (but not more than
two primary bank meetings), (ii) assistance with the preparation of customary materials for bank information memoranda
and similar documents reasonably necessary in connection with the Debt Financing, (iii) furnishing Parent reasonably
promptly with the historical and the pro forma financial statements identified in Section 4 and Section 5, respectively of
Exhibit D to the Debt Commitment Letter as in effect on the date hereof (subject to the immediately following proviso, the
“Required Financial Information”); provided, however, that with respect to the pro forma financial statements described
in clause (iii) above, Parent shall have furnished to the Company any and all information to be included in such pro forma
financial statements (other than the historical financial statements) as promptly as practicable and in no event later than June

with assumed interest rates, fees and expenses relating to the incurrence of such debt and equity financing, for the
transactions contemplated hereby, (y) the assumed pro forma capitalization of the Company after giving effect to the
Closing, the Financing and the refinancing or repayment of any Indebtedness of the Company and its Subsidiaries in
connection therewith and (z) the assumed cost savings, synergies and similar adjustments (if any) for the transactions
contemplated hereby, (iv) causing representatives of senior management of the Company to participate in, and assist with,

Section 6.23 Company Transaction Expenses.  The Company does not anticipate that the Company Transaction Expenses as of the

Corporation under Section 2.04 of this Agreement so long as such efforts do not result in the Company or its Subsidiaries incurring
a material tax or other material liability; provided that failure of the Company and Parent to mutually agree with respect to the use
of such excess available cash shall not be a condition to Parent’s and Merger Sub’s obligations to consummate the transactions

otherwise to be paid by Parent or the Surviving Corporation under Section 2.04 of the Agreement.

extent expressly permitted by Section 6.02 hereof), or (v) the Company shall have materially breached its obligations under
Section 6.02 (other than materially cured breaches);

(h) by the Company, upon written notice to Parent, if (i) prior to the Stockholder Approval and subject to complying with the
terms of this Agreement (including Section 6.02 and Section 6.03), the Company Board shall have effected an Adverse

prior to or substantially concurrently with the termination of this Agreement, the Company pays to Parent in immediately

(i) by the Company, upon written notice to Parent, if (A) the conditions set forth in Section 7.01 and Section 7.02 (other than
those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied by actions taken at the Closing; provided that each such condition is
then capable of being satisfied at a Closing on such date, assuming for purposes hereof that the date of termination is the
Closing Date) have been satisfied or waived, (B) the Company has irrevocably notified Parent in writing that all conditions
set forth in Section 7.03 have been satisfied or waived and the Company is ready, willing and able to consummate the
Merger, and (C) Parent and Merger Sub fail to consummate the Merger within three Business Days after the later of (1) the

6.17(e), (v) Section 6.18, (vi) Section 6.22(d) and (vii) Article 9 shall survive any termination hereof pursuant to Section 8.01;
provided, however, that, the Company shall not be relieved or released from any liabilities or damages (collectively, “Damages”)
arising out of its willful and material breach of any provision of this Agreement, subject only to Section 9.04(b) and Section
9.09(d). For the avoidance of doubt, (a) the failure of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the Merger on the date
required by Section 2.01 after the conditions set forth in Article 7 (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied
at the Closing and which are capable of being satisfied on the Closing Date, assuming for purposes hereof that the date of
termination is the Closing Date) have been satisfied or waived shall constitute a willful and material breach by such party, (b) the
Confidentiality Agreements shall survive the termination of this Agreement and shall remain in full force and effect in accordance
with its terms and (c) the Guarantees shall survive the termination of this Agreement and shall remain in full force and effect in

Section 9.03 Amendments and Waivers.

(a) Any provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived prior to the Effective Time if, but only if, such amendment or
waiver is in writing and is signed, in the case of an amendment, by each party to this Agreement or, in the case of a waiver,
by each party against whom the waiver is to be effective; provided, however, that without the further approval of the

Commitment Letter.

(b) No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor

(iv)this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.01(b) (if the Company shall have materially breached any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement), Section 8.01(d) or Section 8.01(e) (other
than a termination pursuant to Section 8.01(e) with respect to which the Company Termination Fee has already been
paid) and (A) an Acquisition Proposal is made, communicated or is otherwise publicly disclosed, (x) before such
termination, in the case of a termination pursuant to Section 8.01(b) or Section 8.01(e) or (y) before receipt of the
Stockholder Approval, in the case of a termination pursuant to Section 8.01(d), and (B) within twelve months after the
date of such termination, the Company consummates an Acquisition Proposal or enters into a definitive agreement in
respect of an Acquisition Proposal, which Acquisition Proposal is subsequently consummated (whether during such
twelve month period or thereafter) (provided that for purposes of this subsection (iv), each reference to “20%” in the
definition of Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be references to “50%”);

then the Company shall pay Parent (or its designee) the Company Termination Fee by wire transfer of same-day funds (x) in
the case of Section 9.04(b)(i) or Section 9.04(b)(iii), within three Business Days after such termination, (y) in the case of
Section 9.04(b)(ii), prior or substantially concurrently with the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(h)
and (z) in the case of Section 9.04(b)(iv), substantially concurrently with the consummation of the Acquisition Proposal.
For the avoidance of doubt, any payment made by the Company under this Section 9.04(b) shall be payable only once with
respect to Section 9.04(b) and not in duplication, even though such payment may be payable under one or both provisions
hereof. In the event that Parent is entitled to receive payment pursuant to this Section 9.04(b), the receipt of the Company
Termination Fee shall (other than in the case of willful and material breach by the Company) be deemed to be liquidated
damages for any and all losses or damages suffered or incurred by Parent, Merger Sub, any of their respective Affiliates or
any other Person in connection with this Agreement (and the termination hereof), the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (and the abandonment thereof) or any matter forming the basis for such termination, and, other than in the case
of willful or material breach on the part of the Company, except for payment of the Company Termination Fee and any
Parent Recovery Costs under this Section 9.04(b), the Company shall have no further liability, whether pursuant to a claim
at law or in equity, to Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates in connection with this Agreement (and the
termination hereof), the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (and the abandonment thereof) or any matter forming
the basis for such termination, and (other than in the case of willful and material breach by the Company) none of Parent,
Merger Sub, any of their respective Affiliates or any other Person shall be entitled to bring or maintain any Proceeding
against the Company or any of its Affiliates for damages or any equitable relief arising out of or in connection with this
Agreement (other than equitable relief to require payment of the Company Termination Fee), any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or any matters forming the basis for such termination; provided that if the Company fails
to pay the Company Termination Fee and Parent and/or Merger Sub commences a suit which results in a final, non-
appealable judgment against the Company for the Company Termination Fee, then the Company shall pay Parent and
Merger Sub their reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable attorney’s fees and disbursements) in
connection with such suit, together with interest on the Company Termination Fee at the “prime rate” as published in The
Wall Street Journal, Eastern Edition, in effect on the date such payment was required to be made through the date of
payment (calculated daily on the basis of a year of 365 days and the actual number of days elapsed, without compounding)
(the “Parent Recovery Costs”).

(c) In the event that this Agreement is terminated (i) pursuant to Section 8.01(i) or (ii) pursuant to Section 8.01(f) as a result of a
willful and material breach of this Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub, then Parent shall pay the Company the Parent
Termination Fee by wire transfer of same-day funds on the third Business Day following such termination (it being
understood that in no event shall Parent be required to pay the Parent Termination Fee on more than one occasion). In the
event that the Company is entitled to receive payment pursuant to this Section 9.04(c), the receipt of the Parent Termination
Fee shall be deemed to be liquidated damages for any and all losses or damages suffered or incurred by the Company in
connection with this Agreement (and the termination

such termination, and, except for payment of the Parent Termination Fee and the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub
pursuant to Section 6.17(e) and Section 6.22(d) (collectively, the “Parent Expenses”), and any Company Recovery Costs
under this Section 9.04(c), neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall have any further liability, whether pursuant to a claim at law
or in equity, to the Company or any of its Affiliates under this Agreement (and the termination hereof), the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (and the abandonment thereof) or any matter forming the basis for such termination, and
the Company shall not be entitled to bring or maintain any Proceeding against Parent or Merger Sub for damages or any
equitable relief arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or any matters forming the basis for such termination (other than equitable relief to require payment of the Parent
Termination Fee and/or any Parent Expenses); provided that if Parent fails to pay the Parent Termination Fee and/or any
Parent Expenses and the Company commences a suit which results in a final, non-appealable judgment against Parent for the
Parent Termination Fee and/or any Parent Expenses, then Parent shall pay the Company its reasonable out-of-pocket costs
and expenses (including reasonable attorney’s fees and disbursements) in connection with such suit, together with interest on
the Parent Termination Fee and/or Parent Expenses at the “prime rate” as published in The Wall Street Journal, Eastern
Edition, in effect on the date such payment was required to be made through the date of payment (calculated daily on the
basis of a year of 365 days and the actual number of days elapsed, without compounding) (the “Company Recovery
Costs”).

Section 9.05 Assignment; Benefit.  This Agreement shall not be assigned by any of the parties hereto (whether by operation of law
or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other parties; provided, however, that Parent and Merger Sub may without the
consent of the other party (a) assign their rights under this Agreement, in whole or in part, to an Affiliate or (b) collaterally assign
their rights under this Agreement to any of the Debt Financing Sources or any agent or collateral trustee for such Debt Financing
Sources, but in the case of clause (a) and (b) no such assignment will relieve Parent or Merger Sub of their obligations under this
Agreement. This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective successors and
permitted assigns, and any reference to a party shall also be a reference to the successors and permitted assigns thereof.
Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to
confer on any Person other than the parties hereto or their respective heirs, successors, executors, administrators and permitted
assigns any rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement, except (i) for the provisions of Article
2 concerning payment of the Aggregate Merger Consideration, Section 6.11, Section 6.17(e), Section 6.18, Section 6.22(d) and
Section 8.02, which provisions shall inure to the benefit of the Persons or entities benefiting therefrom who are expressly intended
to be third-party beneficiaries thereof and who may enforce the covenants contained therein and (ii) that the Debt Financing
Sources and Parent Related Parties are intended third party beneficiaries of and may enforce their respective rights under Section
8.02, Section 9.03(a), Section 9.04(c), this Section 9.05, Section 9.06, the last sentence of Section 9.07, Section 9.08, Section 9.09,
and Section 9.10; provided, however, that, prior to the Effective Time, the rights and remedies conferred on the Company’s
stockholders pursuant to Article 2 concerning payment of the Aggregate Merger Consideration may only be enforced by the
Company acting on the behalf of the Company’s stockholders and holders of Company Equity Awards.

Section 9.06 Governing Law.  This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of
Delaware, without regard to the conflicts of law rules of such State. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, each party
hereto acknowledges and irrevocably agrees that any Proceeding, whether in contract or tort, at law or in equity or otherwise,
involving any Debt Financing Source in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Debt Commitment Letter or the performance
thereunder, shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York.

Section 9.07 Jurisdiction.  The parties hereto agree that any Proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any matter
arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be brought in the

exclusive jurisdiction of such court in respect of any legal or equitable Proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or relating to enforcement of any of the terms of this Agreement, and hereby
waives, and agrees not to assert, as a defense in any such Proceeding, any claim that it is not subject personally to the jurisdiction of

Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may not be enforced in or by such courts. Each party hereto agrees
that notice or the service of process in any Proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement shall be properly served or delivered if delivered in the manner contemplated by Section 9.01 or in any other
manner permitted by law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each party hereto agrees that it will not bring or support any action, cause
of action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind or description, whether in law or equity, whether in contract or tort or

OBLIGATIONS TO PARENT OR MERGER SUB UNDER THE DEBT COMMITMENT LETTER OR IN CONNECTION

Section 9.09 Specific Performance; Parent Liability Cap; Company Liability Cap.

(a) The parties hereto agree that irreparable harm would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that money damages or other legal
remedies would not be an adequate remedy for any such harm. The parties hereto agree that unless and until this Agreement
is terminated in accordance with Section 8.01 and any dispute over the right to termination has been finally resolved, (i) the
parties hereto shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions from a court of competent jurisdiction as set forth in Section
9.07 to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement (other
than Parent’s and Merger Sub’s obligation to effect the Closing, which shall be governed by the next sentence), without bond
or other security being required, this being in addition to any remedy to which they are entitled pursuant to Section 8.02 or
Section 9.04, and (ii) the right of specific enforcement is an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the Merger, and without that right, none of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub would have entered
into this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the parties hereto agree that
unless and until this Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with Section 8.01, the Company shall be entitled to an
injunction, specific performance or other equitable remedy in connection with enforcing Parent’s obligation to cause the
Equity Financing to be funded and to specifically enforce

Parent’s and Merger Sub’s obligations to effect the Closing on the terms and conditions set forth herein if and only if (A) the
conditions set forth in Section 7.01 and Section 7.02 (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the
Closing; provided that each such condition is then capable of being satisfied at the Closing have been satisfied or waived
and such conditions would be so satisfied on such date if it were the Closing Date), (B) the Debt Financing is available to be
funded at the Closing and has been funded or will be simultaneously funded at the Closing if the Equity Financing is funded,
(C) the Company has irrevocably notified Parent in writing that all conditions set forth in Section 7.03 have been satisfied or
waived and the Company is ready, willing and able to consummate the Merger, and (D) Parent and Merger Sub fail to
complete the Closing on the date the Closing is required to have occurred pursuant to Section 2.01 (such clauses (A) through
(D), together, the “Specific Performance Conditions”). Each of the parties hereto agrees that it will not oppose the granting
of an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief on the basis that any other of such parties has an adequate
remedy at law or that any such injunction or award of specific performance or other equitable relief is not an appropriate
remedy for any reason; provided that solely with respect to the equitable remedy in connection with enforcing Parent’s
obligation to cause the Equity Financing to be funded and to specifically enforce Parent’s or Merger Sub’s obligation to
effect the Closing, Parent and Merger Sub may oppose the granting of specific performance only on the basis that one of the
Specific Performance Conditions has not been satisfied. The parties hereto further agree that (i) following the Company’s
termination of this Agreement in accordance with Section 8.01, the Company shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions
from a court of competent jurisdiction as set forth in Section 9.07 to enforce specifically Parent’s and Merger Sub’s
surviving payment obligations herein, and (ii) following Parent’s termination of this Agreement in accordance with Section
8.01, Parent shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions from a court of competent jurisdiction as set forth in Section

June 5, 2017

Albany Molecular Research, Inc.
26 Corporate Circle
Albany, New York 12203
Attention: Special Committee of the Board of Directors

Members of the Special Committee:

You have asked us to advise you in your capacity as members of the Special Committee (the “Special Committee”) of the Board of
Directors of Albany Molecular Research, Inc. (the “Company”) with respect to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the
holders of common stock, par value $0.01 per share (“Common Stock”), of the Company of the Consideration (as defined below)
to be received by such holders in the Merger (as defined below) pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger
Agreement”) to be entered into among the Company, UIC Parent Corporation (“Parent”) and UIC Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly
owned direct subsidiary of Parent (“Merger Sub”). We understand that, among other things, pursuant to the Merger Agreement,
Merger Sub will merge with the Company (the “Merger”), each outstanding share of Common Stock will be converted into the
right to receive $21.75 in cash (the “Consideration”) and the Company will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent.

In arriving at our opinion, we have reviewed a draft, dated June 5, 2017, of the Merger Agreement and certain publicly available
business and financial information relating to the Company. We have also reviewed certain other information relating to the
Company, including financial forecasts relating to the Company for the nine months ended December 31, 2017 and the fiscal years
ending December 31, 2018 through December 31, 2021 and certain normalized terminal year projections and an estimate of the
Company’s perpetuity growth rate thereafter, each as prepared and provided to us by the management of the Company (collectively,
the “Company Projections”). We have also spoken with the management of the Company and certain of their representatives
regarding the business and prospects of the Company. We have also considered certain financial and stock market data of the
Company, and we have compared that data with similar data for other companies with publicly traded equity securities in
businesses we deemed similar to those of the Company. We also considered such other information, financial studies, analyses and
investigations and financial, economic and market criteria which we deemed relevant.

In connection with our review, we have not independently verified any of the foregoing information, and we have assumed and
relied upon such information being complete and accurate in all respects material to our analyses and this opinion. With respect to
the Company Projections, management of the Company has advised us and we have assumed that such financial forecasts have
been reasonably prepared in good faith on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the management
of the Company as to the future financial performance of the Company. We express no view or opinion with respect to the
Company Projections or the assumptions upon which they are based and, at the direction of management of the Company, we have
assumed that the Company Projections are a reasonable basis on which to evaluate the Company and the Merger and have used and
relied upon such information for purposes of our analyses and this opinion.

For purposes of our analyses and this opinion we have at your direction assumed that, in the course of obtaining any regulatory or
third party consents, approvals or agreements in connection with the Merger, no delay, limitation, restriction or condition will be
imposed that would have an adverse effect on the Company or the contemplated benefits of the Merger, that the Merger will be
consummated in accordance with all applicable federal, state and local laws, and that the Merger will be consummated in
accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, without waiver, modification or amendment of any term, condition or
agreement thereof that is material to our analyses or this opinion. In addition, we have not been requested to make, and have not
made, an independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of the Company, nor have we been
furnished with any such evaluations or appraisals. With your consent we have also assumed that the final form of the Merger
Agreement, when executed by the parties thereto, will conform to the draft reviewed by us in all respects material to our analyses
and this opinion.

Our opinion addresses only the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Common Stock of the Consideration to be
received by such holders in the Merger pursuant to the Merger Agreement and does not address any other aspect or implication of
the Merger or any agreement, arrangement or understanding entered into in connection therewith or otherwise, or the fairness of the
amount or nature of, or any other aspect relating to, any compensation or consideration to be received or otherwise payable to any
officers, directors, employees, securityholders or affiliates of any party to the Merger, or class of such persons, relative to the
Consideration or otherwise. Furthermore, we are not expressing any advice or opinion regarding matters that require legal,
regulatory, accounting, insurance, tax, environmental, intellectual property, executive compensation or other similar professional
advice. We have assumed that the Company has or will obtain such advice or opinions from the appropriate professional sources.
The issuance of this opinion was approved by our authorized internal committee.

Our opinion is necessarily based upon information made available to us as of the date hereof and financial, economic, market and
other conditions as they exist and can be evaluated on the date hereof. We have not undertaken, and are under no obligation, to
update, revise, reaffirm or withdraw this opinion, or otherwise comment on or consider events occurring or coming to our attention
after the date hereof. Our opinion does not address the relative merits of the Merger as compared to alternative transactions or
strategies that might be available to the Company, nor does it address the underlying business decision of the Special Committee,
the Board of Directors of the Company (the “Board”) or the Company to proceed with or effect the Merger.

the surviving corporation as provided in §251(f) of this title.

(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1) of this section, appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the shares of
any class or series of stock of a constituent corporation if the holders thereof are required by the terms of an agreement

(c) Any corporation may provide in its certificate of incorporation that appraisal rights under this section shall be available for
the shares of any class or series of its stock as a result of an amendment to its certificate of incorporation, any merger or
consolidation in which the corporation is a constituent corporation or the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the
corporation. If the certificate of incorporation contains such a provision, the provisions of this section, including those set
forth in subsections (d), (e), and (g) of this section, shall apply as nearly as is practicable.

(d) Appraisal rights shall be perfected as follows:

(1) If a proposed merger or consolidation for which appraisal rights are provided under this section is to be submitted for
approval at a meeting of stockholders, the corporation, not less than 20 days prior to the meeting, shall notify each of its
stockholders who was such on the record date for notice of such meeting (or such members who received notice in
accordance with §255(c) of this title) with respect to shares for which appraisal rights are available pursuant to
subsection (b) or (c) of this section that appraisal rights are available for any or all of the shares of the constituent
corporations, and shall include in such notice a copy of this section and, if 1 of the constituent corporations is a nonstock
corporation, a copy of §114 of this title. Each stockholder electing to demand the appraisal of such stockholder’s shares
shall deliver to the corporation, before the taking of the vote on the merger or consolidation, a written demand for
appraisal of such stockholder’s shares. Such demand will be sufficient if it reasonably informs the corporation of the
identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to demand the appraisal of such stockholder’s shares.
A proxy or vote against the merger or consolidation shall not constitute such a demand. A stockholder electing to take
such action must do so by a separate written demand as herein provided. Within 10 days after the effective date of such
merger or consolidation, the surviving or resulting corporation shall notify each stockholder of each constituent
corporation who has complied with this subsection and has not voted in favor of or consented to the merger or
consolidation of the date that the merger or consolidation has become effective; or

(2) If the merger or consolidation was approved pursuant to §228, §251(h), §253, or §267 of this title, then either a
constituent corporation before the effective date of the merger or consolidation or the surviving or resulting corporation
within 10 days thereafter shall notify each of the holders of any class or series of stock of such constituent corporation
who are entitled to appraisal rights of the approval of the merger or consolidation and that appraisal rights are available
for any or all shares of such class or series of stock of such constituent corporation, and shall include in such notice a
copy of this section and, if 1 of the constituent corporations is a nonstock corporation, a copy of §114 of this title. Such
notice may, and, if given on or after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, shall, also notify such stockholders
of the effective date of the merger or consolidation. Any stockholder entitled to appraisal rights may, within 20 days after
the date of mailing of such notice or, in the case of a merger approved pursuant to §251(h) of this title, within the later of
the consummation of the offer contemplated by §251(h) of this title and 20 days after the date of mailing of such notice,
demand in writing from the surviving or resulting corporation the appraisal of such holder’s shares. Such demand will be
sufficient if it reasonably informs the corporation of the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends
thereby to demand the appraisal of such holder’s shares. If such notice did not notify stockholders of the effective date of
the merger or consolidation, either (i) each such constituent corporation shall send a second notice before the effective
date of the merger or consolidation notifying each of the holders of any class or series of stock of such constituent
corporation that are entitled to appraisal rights of the effective date

of the merger or consolidation or (ii) the surviving or resulting corporation shall send such a second notice to all such
holders on or within 10 days after such effective date; provided, however, that if such second notice is sent more than 20
days following the sending of the first notice or, in the case of a merger approved pursuant to §251(h) of this title, later
than the later of the consummation of the offer contemplated by §251(h) of this title and 20 days following the sending
of the first notice, such second notice need only be sent to each stockholder who is entitled to appraisal rights and who
has demanded appraisal of such holder’s shares in accordance with this subsection. An affidavit of the secretary or
assistant secretary or of the transfer agent of the corporation that is required to give either notice that such notice has
been given shall, in the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein. For purposes of determining
the stockholders entitled to receive either notice, each constituent corporation may fix, in advance, a record date that
shall be not more than 10 days prior to the date the notice is given, provided, that if the notice is given on or after the
effective date of the merger or consolidation, the record date shall be such effective date. If no record date is fixed and
the notice is given prior to the effective date, the record date shall be the close of business on the day next preceding the
day on which the notice is given.

(e) Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, the surviving or resulting corporation or any
stockholder who has complied with subsections (a) and (d) of this section hereof and who is otherwise entitled to appraisal
rights, may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Court of Chancery demanding a determination of
the value of the stock of all such stockholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time within 60 days after the effective
date of the merger or consolidation, any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that
proceeding as a named party shall have the right to withdraw such stockholder’s demand for appraisal and to accept the
terms offered upon the merger or consolidation. Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, any
stockholder who has complied with the requirements of subsections (a) and (d) of this section hereof, upon written request,
shall be entitled to receive from the corporation surviving the merger or resulting from the consolidation a statement setting
forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the merger or consolidation and with respect to which demands
for appraisal have been received and the aggregate number of holders of such shares. Such written statement shall be mailed
to the stockholder within 10 days after such stockholder’s written request for such a statement is received by the surviving or
resulting corporation or within 10 days after expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal under subsection
(d) of this section hereof, whichever is later. Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, a person who is the beneficial
owner of shares of such stock held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person may, in such person’s
own name, file a petition or request from the corporation the statement described in this subsection.

(f) Upon the filing of any such petition by a stockholder, service of a copy thereof shall be made upon the surviving or resulting
corporation, which shall within 20 days after such service file in the office of the Register in Chancery in which the petition
was filed a duly verified list containing the names and addresses of all stockholders who have demanded payment for their
shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares have not been reached by the surviving or resulting
corporation. If the petition shall be filed by the surviving or resulting corporation, the petition shall be accompanied by such
a duly verified list. The Register in Chancery, if so ordered by the Court, shall give notice of the time and place fixed for the
hearing of such petition by registered or certified mail to the surviving or resulting corporation and to the stockholders
shown on the list at the addresses therein stated. Such notice shall also be given by 1 or more publications at least 1 week
before the day of the hearing, in a newspaper of general circulation published in the City of Wilmington, Delaware or such
publication as the Court deems advisable. The forms of the notices by mail and by publication shall be approved by the
Court, and the costs thereof shall be borne by the surviving or resulting corporation.

(g) At the hearing on such petition, the Court shall determine the stockholders who have complied with this section and who
have become entitled to appraisal rights. The Court may require the

TABLE OF CONTENTS

stockholders who have demanded an appraisal for their shares and who hold stock represented by certificates to submit their
certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings; and if any
stockholder fails to comply with such direction, the Court may dismiss the proceedings as to such stockholder. If
immediately before the merger or consolidation the shares of the class or series of stock of the constituent corporation as to
which appraisal rights are available were listed on a national securities exchange, the Court shall dismiss the proceedings as
to all holders of such shares who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless (1) the total number of shares entitled to
appraisal exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of the class or series eligible for appraisal, (2) the value of the consideration
provided in the merger or consolidation for such total number of shares exceeds $1 million, or (3) the merger was approved
pursuant to §253 or §267 of this title.

(h) After the Court determines the stockholders entitled to an appraisal, the appraisal proceeding shall be conducted in
accordance with the rules of the Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings.
Through such proceeding the Court shall determine the fair value of the shares exclusive of any element of value arising
from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger or consolidation, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the
amount determined to be the fair value. In determining such fair value, the Court shall take into account all relevant factors.
Unless the Court in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, and except as provided in this subsection,
interest from the effective date of the merger through the date of payment of the judgment shall be compounded quarterly
and shall accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time
during the period between the effective date of the merger and the date of payment of the judgment. At any time before the
entry of judgment in the proceedings, the surviving corporation may pay to each stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount
in cash, in which case interest shall accrue thereafter as provided herein only upon the sum of (1) the difference, if any,
between the amount so paid and the fair value of the shares as determined by the Court, and (2) interest theretofore accrued,
unless paid at that time. Upon application by the surviving or resulting corporation or by any stockholder entitled to
participate in the appraisal proceeding, the Court may, in its discretion, proceed to trial upon the appraisal prior to the final
determination of the stockholders entitled to an appraisal. Any stockholder whose name appears on the list filed by the
surviving or resulting corporation pursuant to subsection (f) of this section and who has submitted such stockholder’s
certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery, if such is required, may participate fully in all proceedings until it is finally
determined that such stockholder is not entitled to appraisal rights under this section.

(i) The Court shall direct the payment of the fair value of the shares, together with interest, if any, by the surviving or resulting
corporation to the stockholders entitled thereto. Payment shall be so made to each such stockholder, in the case of holders of
uncertificated stock forthwith, and the case of holders of shares represented by certificates upon the surrender to the
corporation of the certificates representing such stock. The Court’s decree may be enforced as other decrees in the Court of
Chancery may be enforced, whether such surviving or resulting corporation be a corporation of this State or of any state.

(j) The costs of the proceeding may be determined by the Court and taxed upon the parties as the Court deems equitable in the
circumstances. Upon application of a stockholder, the Court may order all or a portion of the expenses incurred by any
stockholder in connection with the appraisal proceeding, including, without limitation, reasonable attorney’s fees and the
fees and expenses of experts, to be charged pro rata against the value of all the shares entitled to an appraisal.

(k) From and after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, no stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights as
provided in subsection (d) of this section shall be entitled to vote such stock for any purpose or to receive payment of
dividends or other distributions on the stock (except dividends or other distributions payable to stockholders of record at a
date which is prior to the effective date of the merger or consolidation); provided, however, that if no petition for an
appraisal shall be filed within the time provided in subsection (e) of this section, or if such stockholder shall deliver to the
surviving or resulting corporation a written withdrawal of such stockholder’s demand for an

appraisal and an acceptance of the merger or consolidation, either within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or
consolidation as provided in subsection (e) of this section or thereafter with the written approval of the corporation, then the
right of such stockholder to an appraisal shall cease. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no appraisal proceeding in the Court of
Chancery shall be dismissed as to any stockholder without the approval of the Court, and such approval may be conditioned
upon such terms as the Court deems just; provided, however that this provision shall not affect the right of any stockholder
who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such stockholder’s
demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the merger or consolidation within 60 days after the effective date
of the merger or consolidation, as set forth in subsection (e) of this section.

(l) The shares of the surviving or resulting corporation to which the shares of such objecting stockholders would have been
converted had they assented to the merger or consolidation shall have the status of authorized and unissued shares of the
surviving or resulting corporation.
