MERGER PROPOSED—YOUR VOTE IS VERY IMPORTANT

Dear Stockholder:

On November 1, 2017, Kearny Financial Corp. (which we refer to as “Kearny”) and Clifton Bancorp Inc. (which we refer to as “Clifton”) entered into an
Agreement and Plan of Merger (which we refer to as the “merger agreement”) under which Clifton will merge with and into Kearny, with Kearny remaining as
the surviving entity. This transaction is referred to in this document as the “merger.” Immediately following the merger, Clifton Savings Bank, the wholly-
owned subsidiary of Clifton, will merge with and into Kearny Bank, the wholly-owned subsidiary of Kearny, with Kearny Bank as the surviving entity. This
transaction is referred to in this document as the “bank merger.” Before we complete the merger, the stockholders of Kearny and Clifton must approve the
merger agreement and the merger.

If the merger is completed, Clifton stockholders will be entitled to receive, for each share of Clifton common stock they own, 1.191 shares of Kearny
common stock. The maximum number of shares of Kearny common stock estimated to be issuable upon completion of the merger is 26,320,879. Based on
Kearny’s closing price of $15.05 on November 1, 2017, which was the last trading date preceding the public announcement of the proposed merger, each share
of Clifton common stock exchanged for 1.191 shares of Kearny common stock would have a value of $17.92, or approximately $396.0 million in aggregate
merger consideration. Based on Kearny’s closing price of $14.10 on January 9, 2018, which is the most recent practicable trading day prior to the printing of
this document, each share of Clifton common stock exchanged for 1.191 shares of Kearny common stock would have a value of $16.79. The common stock of
Kearny trades on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “KRNY.” The common stock of Clifton trades on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under
the symbol “CSBK.” The market price of both Kearny common stock and Clifton common stock will fluctuate before the completion of the merger; therefore,
you are urged to obtain current market quotations for Kearny common stock and Clifton common stock.

Although the number of shares of Kearny common stock that holders of Clifton common stock will be entitled to receive is fixed, the market value of the
stock consideration will fluctuate with the market price of Kearny common stock and will not be known at the time Clifton stockholders vote on the merger.
However, Clifton has the right to terminate the merger agreement if, at any time during a five-day period commencing on the tenth day prior to closing, the
average closing price of Kearny common stock over the 20 consecutive trading days prior to the tenth day prior to closing (i) is less than $12.42 and (ii) fails to
meet certain comparison thresholds relative to the NASDAQ Bank Index. If Clifton elects to exercise this termination right, then Kearny has the option to
override the proposed termination by increasing the exchange ratio to a level that would eliminate the effects of either of the two requirements of this
termination right.

The affirmative vote of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of Kearny common stock is required to approve the merger agreement and the
merger. Kearny stockholders will vote to adopt the merger agreement and the merger and on the other matters described below at a special meeting of
stockholders to be held at 10:00 a.m., local time, on March 1, 2018 at the Crowne Plaza Hotel located at 690 Route 46 East, Fairfield, New Jersey 07004.

Kearny’s board of directors unanimously recommends that Kearny common stockholders vote “FOR” the adoption of the merger agreement and
the merger and “FOR” the other matters to be considered at the Kearny special meeting.

The affirmative vote of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of Clifton common stock is required to approve the merger agreement and the
merger. Clifton stockholders will vote to adopt the merger agreement and the merger and on the other matters described below at a special meeting of
stockholders to be held at 9:30 a.m., local time, on March 1, 2018 at the Saddle Brook Marriott located at 138 New Pehle Avenue, Saddle Brook, New Jersey
07663.

Clifton’s board of directors unanimously recommends that Clifton common stockholders vote “FOR” the adoption of the merger agreement and
the merger and “FOR” the other matters to be considered at the Clifton special meeting.

This document contains information that you should consider in evaluating the proposed merger. In particular, you
should carefully read the section captioned “Risk Factors” beginning on page 18 for a discussion of certain risk factors
relating to the merger. You can also obtain information about Kearny and Clifton from documents filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission.

We look forward to seeing you at the stockholders meetings and we appreciate your continued support.
 

Craig L. Montanaro   Paul M. Aguggia
President and Chief Executive Officer   President and Chief Executive Officer
Kearny Financial Corp.   Clifton Bancorp Inc.

The shares of Kearny common stock to be issued in the merger are not deposits or savings accounts or other obligations of any bank or savings
association subsidiary of Kearny or Clifton, and are not insured by the FDIC or any other governmental agency.

Neither the Securities and Exchange Commission nor any state securities commission has approved or disapproved the merger described in this
document or the Kearny common stock to be issued in the merger, or passed upon the adequacy or accuracy of this document. Any representation to
the contrary is a criminal offense.

The date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus is January 17, 2018, and it is first being mailed or otherwise delivered to stockholders of Kearny and
Clifton on or about January 23, 2018.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE MERGER AND THE SPECIAL MEETINGS

The following are answers to certain questions that you may have regarding the merger, the Kearny special meeting or the Clifton
special meeting. We urge you to read carefully the remainder of this document because the information in this section may not provide
all the information that might be important to you in determining how to vote. Additional important information is also contained in
the annexes to, and the documents incorporated by reference in this document.

 
Q: WHY AM I RECEIVING THIS DOCUMENT?
 

A. You are receiving this document because you are either a stockholder of Kearny as of January 9, 2018, the record date for the
Kearny special meeting, or a stockholder of Clifton as of January 9, 2018, the record date for the Clifton special meeting. This
document is being used by the boards of directors of Kearny and Clifton to solicit proxies of the stockholders of Kearny and
Clifton, as applicable, in connection with the approval of the merger agreement and the merger and related matters. This
document also serves as the prospectus for shares of Kearny common stock to be issued in exchange for shares of Clifton
common stock in the merger.

In order to approve the merger agreement and the merger, Kearny has called a special meeting of its stockholders (which we refer
to as the “Kearny special meeting”) and Clifton has called a special meeting of its stockholders (which we refer to as the “Clifton
special meeting”). This document also serves as a notice of the Kearny special meeting and the Clifton special meeting, and
describes the proposals to be presented at each special meeting.

You should read this document carefully and in its entirety. The enclosed materials allow you to have your shares voted by proxy
without attending your special meeting. Your vote is important. We encourage you to submit your proxy as soon as possible.

 
Q: WHAT AM I BEING ASKED TO VOTE ON?
 

A: For Kearny Stockholders: You are being asked to vote on the approval of a merger agreement that provides for the merger of
Clifton with and into Kearny. You are also being asked to vote on a proposal to adjourn the stockholder meeting to a later date or
dates, if necessary, to permit further solicitation of proxies if there are not sufficient votes at the meeting to approve the merger
agreement and the merger (which we refer to as the “Kearny adjournment proposal”). Completion of the merger is not
conditioned upon approval of the Kearny adjournment proposal.

For Clifton Stockholders: You are being asked to vote on the approval of a merger agreement that provides for the merger of
Clifton with and into Kearny. You are also being asked to vote on a non-binding advisory resolution approving the compensation
that may become payable to the named executive officers of Clifton in connection with the merger (“merger-related compensation
proposal”). You are also being asked to vote on a proposal to adjourn the stockholder meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary,
to permit further solicitation of proxies if there are not sufficient votes at the meeting to approve the merger agreement and the
merger (which we refer to as the “Clifton adjournment proposal”). Completion of the merger is not conditioned upon approval of
the merger-related compensation proposal or the Clifton adjournment proposal.

 
Q: WHAT VOTE DOES KEARNY’S BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMEND?
 

A: Kearny’s board of directors has determined that the proposed merger is in the best interests of Kearny stockholders, has
unanimously approved the merger agreement and the merger and unanimously recommends that Kearny stockholders vote “FOR”
the approval of the merger agreement and the merger and “FOR” the Kearny adjournment proposal.

Table of Contents

Q: WHAT VOTE DOES CLIFTON’S BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMEND?
 

A: Clifton’s board of directors has determined that the proposed merger is in the best interests of Clifton stockholders, has
unanimously approved the merger agreement and the merger and unanimously recommends that Clifton stockholders vote “FOR”
the approval of the merger agreement and the merger, “FOR” the merger-related compensation proposal, and “FOR” the Clifton
adjournment proposal.

 
Q: WHAT WILL CLIFTON STOCKHOLDERS RECEIVE IN THE MERGER?
 

A: If the merger is completed, Clifton stockholders will receive 1.191 shares of Kearny common stock (which we refer to as the
“merger consideration”) for each share of Clifton common stock held immediately prior to the merger. Kearny will not issue any
fractional shares of Kearny common stock in the merger. Kearny will pay to each former Clifton stockholder who holds fractional
shares an amount in cash determined by multiplying the average of the closing sale prices of Kearny common stock for the 10 full
trading days ending on the third business day preceding the closing date of the merger by the fraction of a share (rounded to the
nearest cent) of Kearny common stock that such stockholder would otherwise be entitled to receive.

 
Q: WHAT WILL KEARNY STOCKHOLDERS RECEIVE IN THE MERGER?
 

A: If the merger is completed, Kearny stockholders will not receive any merger consideration and will continue to hold the shares of
Kearny common stock that they currently hold. Following the merger, shares of Kearny common stock will continue to be traded
on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “KRNY.”

 
Q: HOW WILL THE MERGER AFFECT CLIFTON EQUITY AWARDS?
 

A: Clifton equity awards will be affected as follows:

Stock Options: At the effective time of the merger, each option to purchase shares of Clifton common stock outstanding
immediately before the effective time of the merger, whether or not vested, will be canceled and, upon Kearny’s receipt of an
option surrender agreement from the holder, exchanged for a cash payment equal to the product of (1) the number of shares of
Clifton common stock subject to the stock option multiplied by (2) the amount by which $18.25 exceeds the exercise price of
such option, less applicable withholding taxes.

Restricted Stock Awards: At the effective time of the merger, each outstanding share of restricted stock will vest and be converted
into the right to receive 1.191 shares of Kearny common stock.

 
Q: WHAT EQUITY STAKE WILL CLIFTON STOCKHOLDERS HOLD IN KEARNY IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING

THE MERGER?
 

A: Following completion of the merger, current Kearny stockholders will own in the aggregate approximately 76% of the
outstanding shares of Kearny common stock. Immediately following completion of the merger, Clifton stockholders will own
approximately 24% of the outstanding shares of Kearny common stock.

 
Q: WHAT HAPPENS IF I AM ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE A FRACTION OF A SHARE OF KEARNY COMMON STOCK

AS PART OF THE MERGER CONSIDERATION?
 

A: If the aggregate number of shares of Kearny common stock that you are entitled to receive as part of the merger consideration
includes a fraction of a share of Kearny common stock, you will receive cash instead of that fractional share. See the section
entitled “Description of the Merger—Consideration to be Received in the Merger” beginning on page 40 of this document.

Table of Contents

Q: HOW DO CLIFTON STOCKHOLDERS EXCHANGE THEIR STOCK CERTIFICATES?
 

A: Shortly after the merger, Kearny’s exchange agent will send instructions to Clifton’s stockholders on how and where to surrender
their Clifton stock certificates after the merger is completed. Please do not send your Clifton stock certificates with your proxy
card.

 
Q: ARE CLIFTON’S STOCKHOLDERS ENTITLED TO APPRAISAL RIGHTS?
 

A: No. Because Clifton common stock is traded on The Nasdaq Global Select Market, Maryland law does not provide for appraisal
rights in connection with the merger. Clifton is incorporated under Maryland law.

 
Q: IS COMPLETION OF THE MERGER SUBJECT TO ANY CONDITIONS BESIDES STOCKHOLDER APPROVAL?
 

A: Yes. The merger must receive the required regulatory approvals, and there are other customary closing conditions that must be
satisfied. For more information about the conditions to the completion of the merger, see “Description of the Merger—Conditions
to Completing the Merger” on page 81 of this document.

 
Q: WHEN IS THE MERGER EXPECTED TO BE COMPLETED?
 

A: We will complete the merger as soon as possible. Before that happens, the merger agreement and the merger must be approved by
Kearny’s stockholders and Clifton’s stockholders and we must obtain the necessary regulatory approvals, among other conditions.
Assuming timely receipt of regulatory and stockholder approvals, we expect to complete the merger late in the first quarter of
2018 or early in the second quarter of 2018.

 
Q: ARE THERE RISKS THAT I SHOULD CONSIDER IN DECIDING WHETHER TO VOTE TO APPROVE THE

MERGER AGREEMENT AND THE MERGER?
 

A: Yes. You should consider the risk factors set out in the section entitled “Risk Factors” beginning on page 18 of this document.

 
Q: WHAT VOTE IS REQUIRED TO APPROVE THE MATTERS TO BE CONSIDERED AT THE SPECIAL MEETINGS?
 

A: For Kearny Stockholders: The proposal to approve the merger agreement and the merger must be approved by the affirmative
vote of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of Kearny common stock. Consequently abstentions and broker non-votes
with respect to the merger agreement and the merger will effectively act as “against” votes on such proposal.

The affirmative vote of a majority of votes cast at the Kearny special meeting is required to approve the Kearny adjournment
proposal. Abstentions and broker non-votes will not affect the outcome of such proposal.

For Clifton Stockholders: The proposal to approve the merger agreement and the merger must be approved by the affirmative vote
of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of Clifton common stock. Consequently, abstentions and broker non-votes with
respect to the merger agreement and the merger will effectively act as “against” votes on such proposal.

Approval of the merger-related compensation proposal and the Clifton adjournment proposal require that the votes cast in favor of
each such proposal exceed the votes cast against such proposal. Abstentions and broker non-votes will not affect the outcome of
such proposals.

Table of Contents

Q: WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF CLIFTON STOCKHOLDERS DO NOT APPROVE THE COMPENSATION THAT MAY
BECOME PAYABLE TO CLIFTON’S NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS IN CONNECTION WITH THE MERGER?

 

A: The vote with respect to the “golden parachute” compensation is an advisory vote and will not be binding on Clifton or Kearny.
Approval of the compensation that may become payable to Clifton’s named executive officers is not a condition to completion of
the merger. Therefore, if the merger agreement and the merger are approved by Clifton’s stockholders and the merger is
subsequently completed, the compensation will still be paid to Clifton’s named executive officers, whether or not Clifton
stockholders approve the compensation at the Clifton special meeting.

 
Q: WHAT ARE THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER TO CLIFTON STOCKHOLDERS?
 

A: It is a condition to the completion of the merger that Kearny and Clifton receive written opinions from their respective counsel to
the effect that the merger will be treated as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986, as amended, which we refer to in this document as the “Internal Revenue Code.” Subject to the limitations and
qualifications described in the section entitled “Description of the Merger—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of
the Merger,” if you are a United States holder of Clifton common stock, generally you will not recognize any gain or loss with
respect to the exchange of shares of Clifton common stock for shares of Kearny common stock in the merger. However, Clifton
stockholders generally will recognize gain or loss with respect to cash received instead of fractional shares of Kearny common
stock that the Clifton stockholders would otherwise be entitled to receive.

You should read “Description of the Merger—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger” beginning on
page 72 of this document for more information about the United States federal income tax consequences of the merger. Tax
matters can be complicated and the tax consequences of the merger to you will depend on your particular tax situation. You
should consult your tax advisor to determine the tax consequences of the merger to you.

OWNERSHIP PLAN AND/OR THE CLIFTON SAVINGS BANK 401(K) SAVINGS PLAN?
 

A: Participants in the Clifton Savings Bank Employee Stock Ownership Plan (the “Clifton ESOP”) will each receive a Voting

Clifton ESOP. Under the terms of the Clifton ESOP, the Clifton ESOP trustee votes all shares held by the Clifton ESOP, but each
Clifton ESOP participant may direct the trustee how to vote the shares of Clifton common stock allocated to his or her account.

Clifton Bancorp Inc. Stock Fund (the “Clifton Stock Fund”) will receive a Voting Instruction Form that allows them to direct the

Q: WHAT SHOULD I DO IF I HOLD MY SHARES OF CLIFTON COMMON STOCK IN BOOK-ENTRY FORM?

merger. Kearny will pay to each former Clifton common stockholder who holds fractional shares an amount in cash determined by
multiplying the average of the closing sale prices of Kearny common stock for the 10 full trading days ending on the third business
day preceding the closing date of the merger by the fraction of a share (rounded to the nearest cent) of Kearny common stock that
such stockholder would otherwise be entitled to receive.

Based on Kearny’s closing price of $15.05 on November 1, 2017, which was the last trading date preceding the public
announcement of the proposed merger, each share of Clifton common stock exchanged for 1.191 shares of Kearny common stock
would have a value of $17.92, or approximately $396.0 million in aggregate merger consideration. Based on Kearny’s closing
price of $14.10 on January 9, 2018, which is the most recent practicable trading day prior to the printing of this document, each
share of Clifton common stock exchanged for 1.191 shares of Kearny common stock would have a value of $16.79. The common
stock of Kearny trades on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “KRNY.” The common stock of Clifton trades on
the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “CSBK.” The market price of both Kearny common stock and Clifton common
stock will fluctuate before the completion of the merger; therefore, you are urged to obtain current market quotations for Kearny
common stock and Clifton common stock.

Market Price and Share Information (page 115)

The following table shows the closing price per share of Kearny common stock, the closing price per share of Clifton
common stock and the equivalent price per share of Clifton common stock, giving effect to the merger, on November 1, 2017,
which is the last day on which shares of each of Kearny common stock and Clifton common stock traded preceding the public
announcement of the proposed merger, and on January 9, 2018, the most recent practicable date before the mailing of this
document. The implied value of one share of Clifton common stock is computed by multiplying the price of a share of Kearny
common stock by the 1.191 exchange ratio. See “Description of the Merger—Consideration to be Received in the Merger.”

Treatment of Clifton Equity Awards (page 71)

At the effective time of the merger, each option to purchase shares of Clifton common stock outstanding immediately before
the effective time of the merger, whether or not vested, will be canceled and, upon Kearny’s receipt of an option surrender
agreement from the holder, exchanged for a cash payment equal to the product of (1) the number of shares of Clifton common
stock subject to the stock option multiplied by (2) the amount by which $18.25 exceeds the exercise price of such option, less
applicable withholding taxes.

At the effective time of the merger, each outstanding share of restricted stock will vest and be converted into the right to
receive 1.191 shares of Kearny common stock.

Recommendation of Kearny’s Board of Directors (page 58)

The Kearny board of directors has unanimously approved the merger agreement and the proposed merger. The Kearny board
believes that the merger agreement, including the merger, is in the best interests of Kearny and its stockholders, and therefore
unanimously recommends that Kearny stockholders vote “FOR” the approval of the merger agreement and the merger. In

RP Financial’s Opinion to Clifton Bancorp Inc.’s Board of Directors (page 48)

On November 1, 2017, the Clifton board of directors received an opinion from RP Financial, LC. (which we refer to as “RP
Financial”) to the effect that, as of such date and subject to the procedures followed, assumptions made, matters considered, and
qualifications and limitations on the review undertaken by RP Financial as set forth in its opinion, the exchange ratio in the
proposed merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Clifton common stock. Subsequent changes in the
operations and prospects of Clifton or Kearny, general market and economic conditions and other factors that may be beyond the
control of Clifton or Kearny may significantly alter the value of Clifton or Kearny or the prices of Clifton common stock or
Kearny common stock by the time the merger is completed. Because Clifton does not anticipate asking RP Financial to update its
opinion, the opinion will not address the fairness of the merger consideration from a financial point of view at the time the merger
is completed or as of any other date other than the date of such opinion.

The description of the opinion set forth herein is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the opinion, which is
attached as Annex B to this document and is incorporated herein by reference, and describes the procedures followed, assumptions
made, matters considered, and qualifications and limitations on the review undertaken by RP Financial in preparing the opinion.

RP Financial’s opinion speaks only as of the date of the opinion. The opinion was for the information of, and was directed to,
the Clifton board of directors (in its capacity as such) in connection with its consideration of the financial terms of the merger. The
opinion addressed only the fairness, from a financial point of view, as of the date of the opinion, of the exchange ratio in the
merger to the holders of Clifton common stock. It did not address, among other things as set forth in RP Financial’s opinion, the
underlying business decision of the Clifton board of directors to engage in the merger or enter into the merger agreement or
constitute a recommendation to the Clifton board of directors in connection with the merger, and it does not constitute a
recommendation to any holder of Clifton common stock as to how to vote in connection with the merger or any other matter.

financial point of view and as of the date of the opinion, to Kearny of the exchange ratio in the proposed merger. The full text of
KBW’s opinion, which describes the procedures followed, assumptions made, matters considered, and qualifications and
limitations on the review undertaken by KBW in preparing the opinion, is attached as Annex C to this document. The opinion
was for the information of, and was directed to, the Kearny board of directors (in its capacity as such) in connection with
its consideration of the financial terms of the merger. The opinion did not address the underlying business decision of
Kearny to engage in the merger or enter into the merger agreement or constitute a recommendation to the Kearny board
of directors in connection with the merger, and it does not constitute a recommendation to any holder of Kearny common
stock or any stockholder of any other entity as to how to vote in connection with the merger or any other matter.

Interests of Certain Persons in the Merger that are Different from Yours (page 76)

In considering the information contained in this document, you should be aware that Clifton’s directors and executive officers
have employment and other compensation agreements or plans that give them financial interests in the merger that are different
from, or in addition to, the interests of Clifton stockholders generally. The Clifton board of directors was aware of these interests at
the time it approved the merger agreement. These interests include, among other things:
 

 

•  employment agreements between Clifton, Clifton Savings Bank and each of Paul M. Aguggia, President and Chief
Executive Officer of Clifton, Christine R. Piano, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Clifton, and
Stephen Hoogerhyde, Executive Vice President of Clifton, that provide for cash severance payments and continued life,
medical, health and disability insurance if the executive’s employment is voluntarily terminated for good reason or
involuntarily terminated without just cause following a change in control and during the term of the employment
agreement;

 

 

•  change in control agreements between Clifton Savings Bank and each of Patricia C. Hrotko, Executive Vice President of
Clifton Savings Bank, Michael Lesler, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of Clifton Savings Bank,
and Diane Scriveri, Executive Vice President of Clifton Savings Bank, that each provide for cash severance payments
and continued life, medical, health and disability insurance if the executive’s employment is voluntarily terminated for
good reason or involuntarily terminated without just cause following a change in control and during the term of the
change in control agreement;

 

 
•  interests under an Amended and Restated Clifton Savings Bank Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan, which will be

terminated in connection with the merger, with the benefits paid to the participants, Mr. Aguggia and Ms. Piano, in a
lump sum;

 

 
•  interests of the directors (other than Mr. Aguggia) under the Clifton Savings Bank Directors’ Retirement Plan, which

will be terminated in connection with the merger, with the benefits paid to the participants in a lump sum;
 

 
•  the termination, accelerated vesting and payment of all outstanding Clifton stock options in an amount equal to $18.25

minus the exercise price of each option;
 

 
•  the acceleration of vesting of all outstanding Clifton restricted stock awards, which will be exchanged for the merger

consideration;
 

 
•  a Settlement Agreement that Kearny, Kearny Bank, Clifton and Clifton Savings Bank entered into with Mr. Aguggia, in

full satisfaction of Mr. Aguggia’s rights under his employment agreement in connection with his termination of
employment upon completion of the merger;

Table of Contents

 •  a Non-Competition Agreement that Kearny Bank entered into with Paul M. Aguggia;
 

 
•  the appointment of Mr. Aguggia and two other directors who are current directors of Clifton to Kearny’s board of

directors immediately following the merger; and
 

 
•  the rights of Clifton officers and directors under the merger agreement to continued indemnification coverage and

continued coverage under directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policies.

Regulatory Matters Relating to the Merger (page 75)

Under the terms of the merger agreement, the merger cannot be completed unless it is first approved by, or a waiver of such
applications is obtained from, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the “FDIC”), the Department of Banking and Insurance
of the State of New Jersey (the “NJDBI”), and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve”).
Kearny has filed the required applications and intends to request a waiver for filing an application with the Federal Reserve. While
Kearny does not know of any reason why it would not obtain the approvals in a timely manner, Kearny cannot be certain when or
if it will receive the regulatory approvals or requested waiver.

Conditions to Completing the Merger (page 81)

The completion of the merger is subject to the fulfillment of a number of customary closing conditions, including:
 

 •  approval of the merger agreement by Clifton and Kearny stockholders;
 

 •  receipt of all required regulatory approvals, consents or waivers and the expiration of all statutory waiting periods;
 

 
•  the absence of any order, decree, injunction, statute, rule or regulation that prevents the consummation of the merger or

the bank merger or that makes completion of the merger or the bank merger illegal;
 

 
•  receipt of consent of all third parties whose consent is required to consummate the merger, except where failure to obtain

such consent would not have a material adverse effect on Kearny;
 

 •  effectiveness of the registration statement of which this document is a part;
 

 •  authorization for listing on the Nasdaq Stock Market of the shares of Kearny common stock to be issued in the merger;
 

 
•  receipt by Kearny and Clifton of an opinion from their respective legal counsel to the effect that the merger will be

treated for federal income tax purposes as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal
Revenue Code;

 

 
•  subject to the materiality standards provided in the merger agreement, the continued accuracy of the representations and

warranties of Kearny and Clifton in the merger agreement;
 

 
•  performance in all material respects by each of Kearny and Clifton of its respective obligations under the merger

agreement, unless waived by the other party;
 

 •  the absence of any material adverse effect with respect to Kearny or Clifton since the date of the merger agreement; and
 

 •  none of the regulatory approvals containing any materially burdensome conditions.

Terminating the Merger Agreement (page 90)

The merger agreement may be terminated by mutual written consent of Kearny and Clifton at any time prior to the
completion of the merger. Additionally, subject to conditions and circumstances described in the merger

agreement, either Kearny or Clifton may terminate the merger agreement if, among other things, any of the following occur:
 

 
•  Clifton stockholders or Kearny stockholders do not approve the merger agreement at the Clifton special meeting or

Kearny special meeting, respectively, provided each party has complied with certain obligations pursuant to the merger
agreement;

 

 
•  any required regulatory approval has been denied and such denial has become final and non-appealable, or a

governmental authority or court has issued a final, unappealable order prohibiting consummation of the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement;

 

 
•  the merger has not been consummated by September 30, 2018, unless the failure to complete the merger by that time

was due to the failure of the party seeking to terminate the merger agreement to perform or observe the covenants and
agreements provided in the merger agreement; or

 

 

•  there is a breach by the other party of any covenant or agreement contained in the merger agreement, or any
representation or warranty of the other party becomes untrue, in each case such that the conditions to closing would not
be satisfied and such breach or untrue representation or warranty has not been or cannot be cured within 30 days after
the giving of written notice to such party of such breach.

Kearny may also terminate the merger agreement if Clifton breaches its obligations in any material respect regarding the
solicitation of other acquisition proposals or submission of the merger agreement to Clifton’s stockholders or if the Clifton board
of directors does not publicly recommend in this document that Clifton stockholders approve the merger agreement or withdraws
or revises its recommendation in a manner adverse to Kearny.

Clifton may also terminate the merger agreement:
 

 
•  if Kearny breaches its obligations in any material respect regarding the submission of the merger agreement to Kearny’s

stockholders or recommending approval and adoption of the merger agreement in this document;
 

 

•  prior to adoption and approval of the merger agreement by its stockholders, to enter into an agreement with respect to a
superior proposal to be acquired by a third party, but only if Clifton’s board of directors has determined in good faith
based on the advice of legal counsel that failure to take such action would cause the Clifton board of directors to violate
its fiduciary duties and subject to other conditions described in the merger agreement; and

 

 
•  within the five day period commencing with the tenth day prior to the closing date of the merger (which we refer to as

the “determination date”), if both of the following conditions have been satisfied:
 

 

•  the average of the daily closing sale prices of a share of Kearny common stock as reported on the Nasdaq Global
Select Market for the 20 consecutive trading days immediately preceding the determination date is less than
$12.42 (82.5% of the closing sale price of Kearny common stock on the last trading date before the date of the
first public announcement of the merger agreement); and

 

 •  Kearny common stock underperforms the NASDAQ Bank Index by more than 17.5% during the same period.

However, if Clifton chooses to exercise this termination right, Kearny has the option, within five business days of receipt of
notice from Clifton, to adjust the merger consideration and prevent termination under this provision.

Table of Contents

Termination Fee (page 91)

Under certain circumstances described in the merger agreement in connection with the termination of the merger agreement,
including circumstances involving alternative acquisition proposals with respect to Clifton and changes in the recommendation of
the Clifton board of directors, Clifton will owe Kearny a $15,000,000 termination fee. See “Description of the Merger—
Termination Fee” on page 91 for a description of the circumstances under which the termination fee is payable. The termination
fee could discourage other companies from seeking to acquire Clifton.

Accounting Treatment of the Merger (page 72)

The merger will be accounted for using the acquisition method in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles.

Comparison of Rights of Stockholders (page 106)

When the merger is completed, Clifton stockholders will receive shares of Kearny common stock and become Kearny
stockholders with their rights governed by Maryland law and by Kearny’s articles of incorporation and bylaws. The rights of
Clifton stockholders will change as a result of the merger due to differences in Kearny’s and Clifton’s governing documents. See
“Comparison of Rights of Stockholders” for a summary of the material differences between the respective rights of Clifton
stockholders and Kearny stockholders.

Clifton Stockholders are NOT entitled to Dissenters’ Rights (page 22)

Appraisal or dissenters’ rights are statutory rights that, if applicable under law, enable stockholders to dissent from an
extraordinary transaction, such as a merger, and to demand that the corporation pay the fair value for their shares as determined by
a court in a judicial proceeding instead of receiving the consideration offered to stockholders in that extraordinary transaction.
Under the Maryland General Corporation Law, and pursuant to Clifton’s articles of incorporation, holders of Clifton common
stock are not entitled to appraisal rights in the merger with respect to their shares of Clifton common stock because Clifton
common stock is listed on a national securities exchange and Clifton’s articles of incorporation do not provide for appraisal rights
unless specifically granted by Clifton’s board of directors.

Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger (page 72)

The merger is intended to qualify for U.S federal income tax purposes as a “reorganization” within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Accordingly, U.S. holders of Clifton common stock generally
will not recognize any gain or loss on the exchange of shares of Clifton common stock for shares of Kearny common stock.
However, a U.S. holder of Clifton common stock generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on cash received in lieu of
any fractional share of Kearny common stock that a holder would otherwise be entitled to receive.

This tax treatment may not apply to all Clifton stockholders. Determining the actual tax consequences of the merger
to Clifton stockholders can be complicated and will depend on your particular circumstances. Clifton stockholders should
consult their own tax advisor for a full understanding of the merger’s tax consequences that are particular to each
stockholder.

To review the tax consequences of the merger to Clifton stockholders in greater detail, please see the section “Description of
the Merger—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger.”

RISK FACTORS

In deciding how to vote, you should consider carefully all of the information included in this document and its annexes and all of
the information incorporated by reference and the risk factors identified by Kearny and Clifton with respect to their operations
included in their filings with the SEC, including Kearny’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2017 and Clifton’s
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2017. See “Where You Can Find More Information.” In addition, you
should consider the following risk factors.

Risks Related to the Merger and Kearny’s Business Upon Completion of the Merger

Because the price of Kearny common stock will fluctuate, Clifton stockholders cannot be certain of the market value of the
merger consideration.

Upon the completion of the merger, each share of Clifton common stock outstanding immediately prior to the completion of the
merger will be converted into the right to receive 1.191 shares of Kearny common stock. The market value of the merger consideration
may vary from the closing price of Kearny common stock on the date we announced the execution of the merger agreement, on the
date that this document was mailed to Clifton stockholders and Kearny stockholders, on the date of the Clifton special meeting and the
Kearny special meeting and on the date we complete the merger. The market price of Kearny common stock may fluctuate as a result
of a variety of factors, including general market and economic conditions, changes in Kearny’s business, operations and prospects, and
regulatory considerations. Therefore, at the time of the Clifton special meeting, Clifton stockholders will not know or be able to
calculate the market value of the Kearny common stock they will receive upon completion of the merger. For example, based on the
range of closing prices of Kearny common stock during the period from November 1, 2017, the last trading day before public
announcement of the merger, through January 9, 2018, the last practicable date before the date of this document, the merger
consideration represented a market value ranging from a low of $16.79 to a high of $17.98 for each share of Clifton common stock.
You should obtain current market quotations for shares of Kearny common stock and Clifton common stock. See “Market Price and
Dividend Information” on page 115 for ranges of historic market prices of Kearny common stock and Clifton common stock.

The price of Kearny common stock might decrease after the merger.

Upon completion of the merger, holders of Clifton common stock will become stockholders of Kearny. Kearny common stock
could decline in value after the merger. For example, during the twelve-month period ending on January 9, 2018 (the most recent
practicable date before the printing of this document), the closing price of Kearny common stock varied from a low of $13.60 to a high
of $15.65 and ended that period at $14.10. The market value of Kearny common stock fluctuates based upon general market
conditions, Kearny’s business, operations and prospects and other factors. Further, the market price of Kearny common stock after the
merger may be affected by factors different from those currently affecting the common stock of Kearny or Clifton. The businesses of
Clifton and Kearny differ and, accordingly, the results of operations of the combined company and the market price of the combined
company’s shares of common stock may be affected by factors different from those currently affecting the independent results of
operations and market prices of common stock of each of Clifton and Kearny. For a discussion of the businesses of Clifton and Kearny
and of certain factors to consider in connection with those businesses, see the documents incorporated by reference in this document
and referred to under “Where You Can Find More Information” beginning on page 121.

Clifton and Kearny will be subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the merger is pending.

Uncertainty about the effects of the merger on employees and customers may have an adverse effect on Clifton or Kearny. These
uncertainties may impair Clifton’s or Kearny’s ability to attract, retain and motivate key

Table of Contents

personnel until the merger is completed, and could cause customers and others that interact with Clifton or Kearny to seek to change
existing business relationships with Clifton or Kearny. Retention of certain employees by Clifton or Kearny may be challenging while
the merger is pending, as certain employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined company. If key
employees depart because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration, or a desire not to remain with Clifton or
Kearny, Clifton’s business or Kearny’s business could be harmed. In addition, subject to certain exceptions, Clifton has agreed to
operate its business in the ordinary course prior to closing. See “Description of the Merger—Conduct of Business Before the Merger”
for a description of the restrictive covenants applicable to Clifton and Kearny.

Failure to complete the merger could negatively impact the stock prices and future businesses and financial results of Kearny
and Clifton.

There can be no assurance that the merger will be completed. If the merger is not completed, the ongoing businesses of Kearny
and Clifton may be adversely affected and Kearny and Clifton will be subject to a number of risks, including the following:
 

 
•  Kearny and Clifton will be required to pay certain costs relating to the merger, whether or not the merger is completed, such

as legal, accounting, financial advisor, proxy solicitation and printing fees;
 

 
•  under the merger agreement, Kearny and Clifton are subject to certain restrictions on the conduct of their respective

businesses before completing the merger, which may adversely affect its ability to execute certain of its business strategies if
the merger is terminated; and

 

 
•  matters relating to the merger may require substantial commitments of time and resources by Kearny and Clifton

management, which could otherwise have been devoted to other opportunities that may have been beneficial to Kearny and
Clifton as independent companies, as the case may be.

In addition, if the merger is not completed, Kearny and/or Clifton may experience negative reactions from the financial markets
and from their respective customers and employees. Kearny and/or Clifton also could be subject to litigation related to any failure to
complete the merger or to proceedings commenced by Kearny or Clifton against the other seeking damages or to compel the other to
perform its obligations under the merger agreement. These factors and similar risks could have an adverse effect on the results of
operation, business and stock prices of Kearny and Clifton.

Kearny may be unable to successfully integrate Clifton’s operations or retain Clifton’s employees, which could adversely affect
the combined company.

The merger involves the integration of two companies that have previously operated independently. The difficulties of combining
the operations of the two companies include, among other things: integrating personnel with diverse business backgrounds; combining
different corporate cultures; and retaining key employees.

The process of integrating operations could cause an interruption of, or loss of momentum in, the activities of the business and the
loss of key personnel. The integration of the two companies will substantially benefit from the experience and expertise of certain key
employees of Clifton who are expected to be retained by Kearny. Kearny may not be successful in retaining these employees for the
time period necessary to successfully integrate Clifton’s operations with those of Kearny. The diversion of management’s attention and
any delays or difficulties encountered in connection with the merger and the integration of the two companies’ operations could have
an adverse effect on the business and results of operations of Kearny following the merger.

Additionally, Kearny may not be able to successfully achieve the level of cost savings, revenue enhancements and other synergies
that it expects, and may not be able to capitalize upon the existing customer relationships of Clifton to the extent anticipated, or it may
take longer, or be more difficult or expensive than expected, to achieve these goals. These matters could have an adverse effect on
Kearny’s business, results of operation and stock price.

Table of Contents

The termination fee and the restrictions on solicitation contained in the merger agreement may discourage other companies
from trying to acquire Clifton.

Until the completion of the merger, with some exceptions, Clifton is prohibited from soliciting, initiating, encouraging or
participating in any discussion of or otherwise considering any inquiry or proposal that may lead to an acquisition proposal, such as a
merger or other business combination transactions, with any person other than Kearny. In addition, Clifton has agreed to pay a
$15.0 million termination fee to Kearny in specified circumstances. These provisions could discourage other companies that may have
an interest in acquiring Clifton from considering or proposing such an acquisition even though those other companies might be willing
to offer greater value to Clifton’s stockholders than Kearny has offered in the merger. The payment of the termination fee could also
have a material adverse effect on Clifton’s financial condition.

Certain of Clifton’s officers and directors have interests that are different from, or in addition to, interests of Clifton
stockholders generally.

The directors and certain officers of Clifton have interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of
Clifton shareholders generally. These include: (1) employment and change in control agreements for certain officers of Clifton and
Clifton Savings Bank that provide for cash severance payments and continued health insurance benefits upon a termination without just
cause or a termination with good reason following the completion of the merger; (2) a cash payment in connection with the termination
of all outstanding Clifton stock options; (3) the acceleration of vesting of all outstanding restricted stock awards; (4) a
Non-Competition Agreement entered into with Paul M. Aguggia, President and Chief Executive Officer of Clifton; (5) a Settlement
Agreement entered into with Paul M. Aguggia, President and Chief Executive Officer of Clifton, concurrent with the execution of the
merger agreement; (6) cash payments in connection with the termination of the Amended and Restated Clifton Savings Bank
Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan and Clifton Savings Bank Directors’ Retirement Plan; (7) the appointment of three directors
of Clifton to the board of directors of Kearny immediately following the merger; and (8) provisions in the merger agreement relating to
indemnification of directors and officers and insurance for directors and officers of Clifton for events occurring before the merger. For
a more detailed discussion of these interests, see “Description of the Merger—Interests of Certain Persons in the Merger that are
Different from Yours” beginning on page 76.

Both Kearny and Clifton stockholders will have a reduced ownership and voting interest after the merger and will exercise less
influence over management of the combined organization.

Each of Kearny and Clifton stockholders currently have the right to vote in the election of their respective boards of directors and
on various other matters affecting their respective companies. Upon the completion of the merger, Clifton’s stockholders will become
stockholders of Kearny with a percentage ownership of the combined organization that is substantially smaller than such stockholders’
percentage ownership of Clifton. Further, because shares of Kearny common stock will be issued to existing Clifton stockholders, the
stockholders of Kearny common stock will have their ownership and voting interests diluted by approximately 24%.

The shares of Kearny common stock to be received by Clifton stockholders as a result of the merger will have different rights
from shares of Clifton common stock.

Following completion of the merger, Clifton stockholders will no longer be stockholders of Clifton but will instead be
stockholders of Kearny. There are differences between the current rights of Clifton stockholders and the rights of Kearny stockholders
that may be important to Clifton stockholders. See “Comparison of Rights of Stockholders” beginning on page 106 for a discussion of
the different rights associated with Kearny common stock and Clifton common stock.

Table of Contents

The fairness opinions to the boards of directors of Kearny and Clifton rendered on the date of the signing of the merger
agreement do not reflect any changes in circumstances after the date of such fairness opinions.

KBW, Kearny’s financial advisor in connection with the merger, delivered to the board of directors of Kearny its opinion on
November 1, 2017. RP Financial delivered to the board of directors of Clifton its opinion on November 1, 2017. The opinions do not
reflect changes that may occur or may have occurred after the date of such opinions, including changes to the operations and prospects
of Kearny or Clifton, changes in general market and economic conditions or regulatory or other factors that may materially alter or
affect the value of Kearny common stock or Clifton common stock. The opinions speak only as of the date on which they were
rendered and not as of the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus or any other date.

There is no assurance when or even if the merger will be completed.

Completion of the merger is subject to satisfaction or waiver of a number of conditions. See “Description of the Merger—
Conditions to Completing the Merger” beginning on page 81. There can be no assurance that Kearny and Clifton will be able to satisfy
the closing conditions or that closing conditions beyond their control will be satisfied or waived.

Kearny and Clifton can agree at any time to terminate the merger agreement, even if Clifton and Kearny stockholders have
already voted to approve the merger agreement and the merger. Kearny and Clifton can also terminate the merger agreement under
other specified circumstances.

Regulatory approvals may not be received, may take longer than expected, or may impose conditions that are not presently
anticipated or that could have an adverse effect on the combined company following the merger.

Before the merger and the bank merger may be completed, Kearny and Clifton must obtain approvals (or waivers) from the
Federal Reserve, the FDIC and the NJDBI. Other approvals, waivers or consents from regulators may also be required. In determining
whether to grant these approvals the regulators consider a variety of factors, including the regulatory standing of each party. An adverse
development in either party’s regulatory standing or other factors could result in an inability to obtain approval or delay their receipt.
These regulators may impose conditions on the completion of the merger or the bank merger or require changes to the terms of the
merger or the bank merger. Such conditions or changes could have the effect of delaying or preventing completion of the merger or the
bank merger or imposing additional costs on or limiting the revenues of the combined company following the merger and the bank
merger, any of which might have an adverse effect on the combined company following the merger.

Goodwill incurred in the merger may negatively affect Kearny’s financial condition.

To the extent that the merger consideration, consisting of shares of Kearny common stock to be issued in the merger, exceeds the
fair value of the net assets, including identifiable intangibles of Clifton, that amount will be reported as goodwill by Kearny. In
accordance with current accounting guidance, goodwill will not be amortized but will be evaluated for impairment annually. A failure
to realize expected benefits of the merger could adversely impact the carrying value of the goodwill recognized in the merger, and in
turn negatively affect Kearny’s financial condition.

The unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial statements included in this document are preliminary and the actual
financial condition and results of operations of Kearny after the merger may differ materially.

The unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial statements in this document are presented for illustrative purposes only
and are not necessarily indicative of what Kearny’s actual financial condition or results

of operations would have been had the merger been completed on the dates indicated. The unaudited pro forma combined condensed
financial data, while helpful in illustrating the financial characteristics of the combined company under one set of assumptions, does
not reflect the benefits of expected cost savings or opportunities to earn additional revenue and, accordingly, does not attempt to predict
or suggest future results. The unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial statements reflect adjustments, which are based upon
preliminary estimates, to record the Clifton identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at fair value and the resulting goodwill
recognized. The purchase price allocation reflected in this document is preliminary, and final allocation of the purchase price will be
based on the actual purchase price and the fair value of the assets and liabilities of Clifton as of the date of the completion of the
merger. Accordingly, the final acquisition accounting adjustments may differ materially from the pro forma adjustments reflected in
this document. For more information, please see “Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Condensed Consolidated Financial Data”
beginning on page 93.

Clifton stockholders do not have appraisal or dissenters’ rights in the merger.

Appraisal or dissenters’ rights are statutory rights that, if applicable under law, enable stockholders to dissent from an
extraordinary transaction, such as a merger, and to demand that the corporation pay the fair value for their shares as determined by a
court in a judicial proceeding instead of receiving the consideration offered to stockholders in that extraordinary transaction. Under the
Maryland General Corporation Law, and pursuant to Clifton’s articles of incorporation, holders of Clifton common stock are not
entitled to appraisal rights in the merger with respect to their shares of Clifton common stock because Clifton common stock is listed
on a national securities exchange and Clifton’s articles of incorporation do not provide for appraisal rights unless specifically granted

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT ABOUT FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

Some of the statements contained or incorporated by reference in this document are forward looking statements within the
meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 giving Kearny’s or Clifton’s expectations or predictions of future
financial or business performance or conditions. Forward-looking statements are typically identified by words such as “believe,”
“expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “target,” “estimate,” “continue,” “positions,” “projections,” “prospects” or “potential,” by future
conditional verbs such as “will,” “would,” “should,” “could” or “may,” or by variations of such words or by similar expressions. Such
forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements about the benefits of the merger or the bank merger, including
future financial and operating results of Kearny, Clifton or the combined company following the merger, the combined company’s
plans, objectives, expectations and intentions, the expected timing of the completion of the merger, financing plans and the availability
of capital, the likelihood of success and impact of litigation and other statements that are not historical facts. These statements are only
predictions based on Kearny’s and Clifton’s current expectations and projections about future events. There are important factors that
could cause Kearny’s and Clifton’s actual results, level of activity, performance or achievements to differ materially from the results,
level of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. In particular, you should
consider the numerous risks and uncertainties described in the section entitled “Risk Factors” beginning on page 18.

These forward-looking statements are subject to numerous assumptions, risks, and uncertainties which change over time. In
addition to factors previously disclosed in Kearny’s and Clifton’s reports filed with the SEC, the following factors, among others, could
cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements:
 

 •  the inability to close the merger and the bank merger in a timely manner;
 

 
•  the failure to complete the merger due to the failure of Kearny or Clifton stockholders to approve the merger agreement and

the merger;
 

 
•  failure to obtain applicable regulatory approvals and meet other closing conditions to the merger on the expected terms and

schedule;
 

 
•  the potential impact of announcement or consummation of the proposed merger with Clifton on relationships with third

parties, including customers, employees, and competitors;
 

 •  business disruption following the merger;
 

 •  difficulties and delays in integrating the Kearny and Clifton businesses or fully realizing cost savings and other benefits;
 

 •  Kearny’s potential exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of Clifton;
 

 •  the challenges of integrating, retaining, and hiring key personnel;
 

 •  failure to attract new customers and retain existing customers in the manner anticipated;
 

 
•  the outcome of pending or threatened litigation, or of matters before regulatory agencies, whether currently existing or

commencing in the future, including litigation related to the merger;
 

 
•  any interruption or breach of security resulting in failures or disruptions in customer account management, general ledger,

deposit, loan, or other systems;
 

 •  changes in Kearny’s stock price before closing, including as a result of the financial performance of Clifton prior to closing;
 

 
•  operational issues stemming from, and/or capital spending necessitated by, the potential need to adapt to industry changes in

information technology systems, on which Kearny and Clifton are highly dependent;

manner;

 

 
•  changes in the monetary and fiscal policies of the U.S. Government, including policies of the U.S. Department of the

Annualized, pro forma, projected and estimated numbers are used for illustrative purposes only, are not forecasts and may not
reflect actual results.

For any forward-looking statements made in this document or in any documents incorporated by reference into this document,
Kearny and Clifton claim the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation
Reform Act of 1995. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these statements, which speak only as of the date of this
document or the date of the applicable document incorporated by reference in this document. Except to the extent required by
applicable law, Kearny and Clifton do not undertake to update forward-looking statements to reflect facts, circumstances, assumptions,
or events that occur after the date the forward-looking statements are made. All written and oral forward-looking statements concerning
the merger or other matters addressed in this document and attributable to Kearny, Clifton, or any person acting on their behalf are
expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this document.

SUMMARY SELECTED UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED DATA

The following tables show selected unaudited financial information on a pro forma combined basis giving effect to the merger as
if the merger had become effective at the end of the period presented, in the case of balance sheet information, and at the beginning of
the periods presented, in the case of income statement information. The selected unaudited pro forma information reflects the
acquisition method of accounting.

Kearny anticipates that the combined company will derive financial benefits that include reduced operating expenses and the
opportunity to earn more revenue. The selected unaudited pro forma information, while helpful in illustrating the financial
characteristics of Kearny following the merger under one set of assumptions, does not reflect all of these benefits and, accordingly,
does not attempt to predict or suggest future results. The selected unaudited pro forma information also does not necessarily reflect
what the historical results of Kearny would have been had Kearny and Clifton been combined during these periods. The pro forma
balance sheet information presented below combines the historical balance sheet data of Kearny and Clifton as of September 30, 2017.
The pro forma income statement information for the three months ended September 30, 2017 presented below combines the historical
income statement data of Kearny and Clifton for that period. The pro forma income statement information for the year ended June 30,
2017 presented below combines the historical income statement data for Kearny for the year ended June 30, 2017 and Clifton for the
year ended March 31, 2017, as permitted under Regulation S-X for the calculation of pro forma financial information utilizing period
ends that differ by fewer than 93 days.

An exchange ratio of 1.191 was used in preparing this selected pro forma information. You should read this selected summary pro
forma information in conjunction with the information under “Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Condensed Consolidated Financial

UNAUDITED COMPARATIVE PRO FORMA PER SHARE DATA

The following table shows information about Kearny’s and Clifton’s earnings per common share, dividends per share and book
value per share, and similar information giving effect to the merger (which we refer to as “pro forma” information). In presenting the
unaudited comparative pro forma information as of and for the periods shown, we assumed that Kearny and Clifton had been merged
on the date indicated or at the beginning of the periods presented, as applicable. The pro forma balance sheet information presented
below combines the historical balance sheet data of Kearny and Clifton as of September 30, 2017. The pro forma income statement
information for the three months ended September 30, 2017 presented below combines the historical income statement data of Kearny
and Clifton for that period. The pro forma statement information for the year ended June 30, 2017 presented below combines the
historical income statement data of Kearny for the year ended June 30, 2017 and Clifton for the year ended March 31, 2017, as
permitted under Regulation S-X for the calculation of pro forma financial information utilizing period ends that differ by fewer than 93
days.

The information listed as “pro forma combined” was prepared using an exchange ratio of 1.191. The information listed as “per
equivalent Clifton share” was obtained by multiplying the pro forma amounts by an exchange ratio of 1.191. Kearny anticipates that
the combined company will derive financial benefits from the merger that include the opportunity to earn more revenue. The unaudited
pro forma combined information, while helpful in illustrating the financial characteristics of Kearny following the merger under one set
of assumptions, does not reflect these benefits and, accordingly, does not attempt to predict or suggest future results. The unaudited pro
forma combined information also does not necessarily reflect what the historical results of Kearny would have been had our companies
been combined during this period.

SPECIAL MEETING OF KEARNY STOCKHOLDERS

This document is being provided to holders of Kearny common stock as Kearny’s proxy statement in connection with the
solicitation of proxies by and on behalf of Kearny’s board of directors to be voted at the Kearny special meeting and at any
adjournment or postponement of the Kearny special meeting.

Date, Time and Place of Meeting

The Kearny special meeting is scheduled to be held as follows:

Date: March 1, 2018

Time: 10:00 a.m., local time

Place: Crowne Plaza Hotel, 690 Route 46 East, Fairfield, New Jersey 07004

Purpose of the Meeting

At the Kearny special meeting, Kearny’s stockholders will be asked to:
 

 
•  Approve the merger agreement and the merger, pursuant to which Clifton will merge with and into Kearny, with Kearny

surviving the merger, and each share of Clifton common stock outstanding immediately prior to the completion of the
merger will be converted into the right to receive 1.191 shares of Kearny common stock.

 

 •  Approve the Kearny adjournment proposal, if necessary.

Who Can Vote at the Meeting

You are entitled to vote if the records of Kearny showed that you held shares of Kearny common stock as of the close of business
on January 9, 2018, which is the record date for the Kearny special meeting. As of the close of business on the record date, 79,270,460
shares of Kearny common stock were outstanding. Each share of Kearny common stock has one vote on each matter presented to
stockholders. If your shares are held in “street name” by your broker, bank or other nominee and you wish to vote in person at the
Kearny special meeting, you will have to obtain a “legal proxy” from your broker, bank or other nominee entitling you to vote at the
Kearny special meeting.

Quorum; Vote Required

The presence, in person or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of Kearny common stock at
the Kearny special meeting constitutes a quorum for the transaction of business at the Kearny special meeting. If you submit valid
proxy instructions or attend the meeting in person, your shares will be counted to determine whether there is a quorum, even if you
abstain from voting. If you fail to provide voting instructions to your broker, bank or other nominee with respect to a proposal, that
broker, bank or other nominee will not vote your shares of Kearny common stock with respect to that proposal.

Approval of the merger agreement and the merger requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares
of Kearny common stock entitled to vote at the meeting. Failure to submit valid proxy instructions or to vote in person will have
the same effect as a vote against the merger agreement and the merger. Broker non-votes and abstentions from voting will have
the same effect as voting against the merger agreement and the merger.

The affirmative vote of a majority of votes cast at the Kearny special meeting is required to approve the Kearny adjournment
proposal. The failure to vote in person or submit valid proxy instructions, broker non-votes and abstentions will have no effect on the
voting on the proposal.

Table of Contents

Shares Held by Kearny Officers and Directors and by Clifton

his or her capacity as a Kearny stockholder, has entered into a separate voting agreement with Clifton, pursuant to which each such
director has agreed to vote all shares of Kearny common stock over which he or she exercises sole disposition and voting rights in
favor of the approval of the merger agreement and the merger and certain related matters and against alternative transactions. As of
January 9, 2018, the Kearny directors that are party to these voting agreements exercised sole disposition and voting rights with respect
to 2,083,428 shares of Kearny common stock, representing 2.63% of the outstanding shares of Kearny common stock. As of January 9,

Voting and Revocability of Proxies

You may vote in person or by proxy at the Kearny special meeting. To ensure your representation at the Kearny special meeting,
Kearny recommends that you vote by proxy even if you plan to attend the special meeting. You can always change your vote in person
at the special meeting.

If you are a “stockholder of record,” you can vote your shares:
 

 •  via internet at www.investorvote.com/KRNY;
 

 •  via telephone by calling 1-800-652-VOTE (8683);
 

 •  by completing and mailing the proxy card that is enclosed; or
 

 •  by voting in person at the special meeting.

Please refer to the specific instructions set forth on the proxy card. We encourage you to vote via the internet or by telephone.

Kearny stockholders whose shares are held in “street name” by their broker, bank or other nominee must follow the instructions
provided by their broker, bank or other nominee to vote their shares. Your broker, bank or other nominee may allow you to deliver your
voting instructions via telephone or the internet. If your shares are held in “street name” and you wish to vote in person at the special
meeting, you will have to obtain a “legal proxy” from your broker, bank or other nominee entitling you to vote at the special meeting.

If you are a holder of record of Kearny common stock, voting instructions are included on the enclosed proxy card. If you
properly complete and timely submit your proxy, your shares will be voted as you have directed. You may vote for, against or abstain
with respect to each matter. If you are the holder of record of your shares of Kearny common stock and submit your proxy without
specifying a voting instruction, your shares of Kearny common stock will be voted “FOR” the proposal to approve the merger
agreement and the merger and “FOR” the Kearny adjournment proposal. If your shares are held in street name and you return an
incomplete instruction card to your broker, bank or other nominee, that broker, bank or other nominee will not vote your shares with
respect to any matter.

You may revoke your proxy at any time before it is voted at the special meeting by:
 

 •  filing with the Corporate Secretary of Kearny a duly executed revocation of proxy;
 

 •  submitting a new proxy with a later date;
 

 •  voting again via the internet or by telephone not later than 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, on February 28, 2018; or
 

 •  voting in person at the special meeting.

Table of Contents

Attendance at the Kearny special meeting will not, in and of itself, constitute a revocation of a proxy. All written notices of
revocation and other communication with respect to the revocation of proxies should be addressed to:

Kearny Financial Corp.
120 Passaic Avenue,

Fairfield, New Jersey 07004
Attention: Gail Corrigan

If any matters not described in this document are properly presented at the Kearny special meeting, the persons named in the
proxy card will use their judgment to determine how to vote your shares of Kearny common stock. Kearny does not know of any other
matters to be presented at the Kearny special meeting.

Participants in the Kearny ESOP or the Kearny 401(k) Plan

Participants in the Kearny ESOP will each receive a Voting Instruction Form that reflects all of the shares that the participant may
direct the trustee to vote on his or her behalf under the Kearny ESOP. Under the terms of the Kearny ESOP, the Kearny ESOP trustee
votes all shares held by the Kearny ESOP, but each Kearny ESOP participant may direct the trustee how to vote the shares of Kearny
common stock allocated to his or her account. The Kearny ESOP trustee will vote all unallocated shares of Kearny common stock held
by the Kearny ESOP and allocated shares for which no voting instructions are received in the same proportion as shares for which it
has received timely voting instructions.

In addition, participants in the Kearny 401(k) Plan with an interest in the Kearny Stock Fund will receive a Voting Instruction
Form that allows them to direct the Kearny 401(k) Plan trustee to vote their interest in the Kearny Stock Fund. If a participant does not
direct the Kearny 401(k) Plan trustee how to vote his or her interests in the Kearny Stock Fund, the trustee will vote such interest in the
same proportion as it has received timely voting instructions from other Kearny 401(k) Plan participants. The deadline for returning
your Voting Instruction Form to each plan’s trustee is February 22, 2018.

Solicitation of Proxies

Kearny will pay for the solicitation of proxies from Kearny stockholders. In addition to soliciting proxies by mail, Laurel Hill
Advisory Group, LLC, a proxy solicitation firm, will assist Kearny in soliciting proxies for the Kearny special meeting. Kearny will
pay $8,000 for these services plus out-of-pocket expenses. Additionally, directors, officers and employees of Kearny may solicit
proxies personally and by telephone. None of these persons will receive additional or special compensation for soliciting proxies.
Kearny will, upon request, reimburse brokers, banks and other nominees for their expenses in sending proxy materials to their
customers who are beneficial owners and obtaining their voting instructions.

Who Can Vote at the Meeting

You are entitled to vote if the records of Clifton showed that you held shares of Clifton common stock as of the close of business
on January 9, 2018, which is the record date for the Clifton special meeting. As of the close of business on the record date, 22,099,814
shares of Clifton common stock were outstanding. Each share of Clifton common stock has one vote on each matter presented to
stockholders. If your shares are held in “street name” by your broker, bank or other nominee and you wish to vote in person at the
Clifton special meeting, you will have to obtain a “legal proxy” from your broker, bank or other nominee entitling you to vote at the
Clifton special meeting.

Quorum; Vote Required

The Clifton special meeting will conduct business only if a majority of the outstanding shares of Clifton common stock is
represented in person or by proxy at the meeting to constitute a quorum. If you submit valid proxy instructions or attend the meeting in
person, your shares will be counted to determine whether there is a quorum, even if you abstain from voting. If you fail to provide
voting instructions to your broker, bank or other nominee with respect to a proposal, that broker, bank or other nominee will not vote
your shares with respect to that proposal.

Approval of the merger agreement and the merger requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of Clifton
common stock. Failure to submit valid proxy instructions or to vote in person will have the same effect as a vote against the
merger agreement and the merger. Broker non-votes and abstentions from voting will have the same effect as voting against the
merger agreement and the merger.

Shares Held by Clifton Officers and Directors and by Kearny

As of January 9, 2018, directors and executive officers of Clifton beneficially owned 1,099,418 shares of Clifton common stock.
This equals 5.0% of the outstanding shares of Clifton common stock as of the January 9, 2018. Each of Clifton’s directors, solely in his
or her capacity as a Clifton stockholder, has entered into a separate voting agreement with Kearny, pursuant to which each such director
has agreed to vote all shares of Clifton common stock over which he or she exercises sole disposition and voting rights in favor of the
approval of the merger agreement and the merger and certain related matters and against alternative transactions. As of January 9,
2018, the Clifton directors that are party to these voting agreements exercised sole disposition and voting rights with respect to 679,067
shares of Clifton common stock, representing 3.1% of the outstanding shares of Clifton common stock. As of January 9, 2018, Kearny
did not own any shares of Clifton common stock.

vote on your behalf under the plans. Under the terms of the ESOP, the ESOP trustee votes all shares held by the ESOP, but each ESOP
participant may direct the trustee how to vote the shares of common stock allocated to his or her account. The ESOP trustee, subject to
the exercise of its fiduciary duties, will vote all unallocated shares of Clifton common stock held by the ESOP and allocated shares for
which no voting instructions are received in the same proportion as shares for which it has received timely voting instructions. Under
the terms of the 401(k) Plan, a participant is entitled to direct the trustee as to the shares in the Clifton Bancorp Inc. Stock Fund
credited to his or her account. The trustee, subject to its fiduciary duties, will vote all shares for which no directions are given or for
which instructions were not received in the same proportion as shares for which the trustee received timely voting instructions. The
deadline for returning your Voting Instruction Form to each plan’s trustee is February 22, 2018.

Solicitation of Proxies

Clifton will pay for the solicitation of proxies from Clifton shareholders. In addition to soliciting proxies by mail, Laurel Hill
Advisory Group, LLC, a proxy solicitation firm, will assist Clifton in soliciting proxies for the Clifton special meeting. Clifton will pay
$8,000 for these services plus out-of-pocket expenses. Additionally, directors, officers and employees of Clifton and Clifton Savings
Bank may solicit proxies personally and by telephone. None of these persons will receive additional or special compensation for
soliciting proxies. Clifton will, upon request, reimburse brokers, banks and other nominees for their expenses in sending proxy
materials to their customers who are beneficial owners and obtaining their voting instructions.

CLIFTON PROPOSAL NO. 1

APPROVAL OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT AND THE MERGER

At the Clifton special meeting, stockholders will consider and vote on a proposal to approve the merger agreement and the
merger. Details about the merger agreement, including each party’s reasons for the merger, the effect of approval and adoption of the
merger agreement and the timing of effectiveness of the merger, are discussed in the section entitled “Description of the Merger”
beginning on page 40 of this document.

Clifton’s board of directors unanimously recommends
that Clifton stockholders vote “FOR”

approval of the merger agreement and the merger.

CLIFTON PROPOSAL NO. 2

NON-BINDING ADVISORY VOTE TO APPROVE THE COMPENSATION THAT MAY BECOME
PAYABLE TO THE NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF CLIFTON IN CONNECTION WITH THE

MERGER

In accordance with the requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act and the rules of the SEC adopted thereunder, Clifton’s board of
directors is providing stockholders with the opportunity to cast a non-binding advisory vote on the compensation that may become
payable to the six “named executive officers” of Clifton in connection with the merger, as summarized in the table under the caption
“Description of the Merger— Interests of Certain Persons in the Merger that are Different from Yours —Merger-Related Executive
Compensation for Clifton’s Named Executive Officers” beginning on page 76 of this document.

Accordingly, at the Clifton special meeting, Clifton is asking its stockholders to approve, in a non-binding advisory vote, the
compensation that may become payable to its named executive officers in connection with the merger through the adoption of the
following resolution:

“RESOLVED, that the compensation that may become payable to its named executive officers in connection with the merger, as
disclosed in the table under the caption “Description of the Merger— Interests of Certain Persons in the Merger that are Different
from Yours —Merger-Related Executive Compensation for Clifton’s Named Executive Officers” in the joint proxy
statement/prospectus in accordance with Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K, including the associated narrative discussion, and the
agreements or understandings pursuant to which such compensation may be paid or become payable, is hereby APPROVED.”

The vote on this Proposal No. 2 is a vote separate and distinct from the vote on Proposal No. 1 to approve the merger agreement
and the merger. Because the vote is advisory in nature only, it will not be binding on either Clifton or Kearny, regardless of whether the
merger agreement and the merger are approved. Accordingly, as the compensation to be paid in connection with the merger is a
contractual obligation to the named executive officers of Clifton, regardless of the outcome of this advisory vote, such compensation
will be payable if the merger agreement and the merger are approved and the merger is completed, subject only to the contractual
conditions applicable to such payment.

Clifton’s board of directors unanimously recommends a vote “FOR”
approval of the merger-related compensation proposal.

CLIFTON PROPOSAL NO. 3

ADJOURNMENT OF THE CLIFTON SPECIAL MEETING

If there are insufficient proxies at the time of the Clifton special meeting to approve the merger agreement and the merger, Clifton
stockholders may be asked to vote on a proposal to adjourn the meeting to a later date to allow additional time to solicit additional
proxies. Clifton’s board of directors does not currently intend to propose adjournment at the Clifton special meeting if there are
sufficient votes to approve the merger agreement and the merger (Proposal No. 1).

Clifton’s board of directors unanimously recommends a vote “FOR”
approval of the Clifton adjournment proposal.

DESCRIPTION OF THE MERGER

The following summary of the merger agreement and the merger is qualified by reference to the complete text of the merger
agreement. A copy of the merger agreement is attached as Annex A to this document and is incorporated by reference into this
document. You should read the merger agreement completely and carefully as it, rather than this description, is the legal document that
governs the merger.

General

The merger agreement provides for the merger of Clifton with and into Kearny, with Kearny as the surviving entity. Immediately
following the merger of Clifton with Kearny, Clifton Savings Bank will merge with and into Kearny Bank, with Kearny Bank as the
surviving entity.

Consideration to be Received in the Merger

When the merger becomes effective, each share of Clifton common stock issued and outstanding immediately before completion
of the merger will automatically be converted into the right to receive 1.191 shares of Kearny common stock, plus cash in lieu of any
fractional share, without interest.

If Kearny declares a stock dividend or distribution on shares of its common stock or subdivides, splits, reclassifies or combines
the shares of Kearny common stock before the effective time of the merger, then the exchange ratio will be adjusted to provide Clifton
stockholders with the same economic effect as contemplated by the merger agreement before any of these events.

Clifton’s stockholders will not receive fractional shares of Kearny common stock. Instead, Clifton’s stockholders will receive a
cash payment for any fractional shares in an amount equal to the product of (1) the fraction of a share of Kearny common stock to
which he, she or it is entitled multiplied by (2) the average closing sales price of Kearny common stock over the 10 trading days ending
on the third business day before the closing date of the merger.

Background of the Merger

The Clifton board of directors has regularly reviewed and discussed Clifton’s business strategy, performance and prospects in the
context of the national and local economic environment, developments in the regulation of financial institutions and the competitive
landscape. Among other things, these reviews and discussions have included possible strategic initiatives available to Clifton, such as
capital management strategies, potential acquisitions, and business combinations involving other financial institutions. These reviews
and discussions included analyses of the mergers and acquisitions environment, including multiples and premiums being paid, and an
assessment of potential partners for Clifton. In connection with the evaluation of these strategic alternatives, Paul M. Aguggia,
President and Chief Executive Officer of Clifton, has had, from time to time, informal discussions with representatives of other
financial institutions, including Kearny, and has regularly updated the Clifton board of directors regarding such discussions.

On July 19, 2017, the Clifton board of directors held a special meeting that was attended by representatives of Sandler O’Neill &
Partners, L.P. (which we refer to as Sandler O’Neill). At this meeting, the Clifton board of directors discussed the future and strategic
plans of Clifton. Representatives of Sandler O’Neill provided the Clifton board of directors with an overview of the current mergers
and acquisitions market with respect to financial institutions generally and Clifton in particular. Representatives of Sandler O’Neill
reviewed, and the Clifton board of directors discussed, Clifton’s strategic plan and its prospects for creation of stockholder value
through organic growth, the viability of growth through acquisition, and the potential creation of value through a strategic business
combination with another financial institution. The Clifton board of directors discussed the risks and challenges associated with the
path of independence and organic growth, the attractiveness of potential

acquisition targets and likelihood of successfully consummating an acquisition, and the potential benefits associated with various
strategic business combinations. The Clifton board of directors noted that Kearny stood alone among the possible partners for a
business combination as having a strong strategic fit based on various factors, including its business model, corporate culture, financial
capacity to engage in a transaction and geographic footprint, and noted that for other likely merger partners the financial metrics were
significantly less attractive. As a result of this discussion, the Clifton board of directors authorized Mr. Aguggia to contact Kearny
management to determine Kearny’s interest in evaluating a business combination with Clifton.

Over the following weeks, Mr. Aguggia evaluated the viability of various potential acquisitions and consulted with the Clifton
board of directors as to the attractiveness of the potential acquisition targets from a strategic and financial point of view. The Clifton
board of directors determined that none of the potential acquisitions presented a viable or attractive strategic alternative for Clifton at
that time.

On August 10, 2017, Mr. Aguggia met with Craig L. Montanaro, President and Chief Executive Officer of Kearny. Their
discussion focused on the New Jersey and New York banking markets, their respective companies’ business models and strategies, and
the potential operational and cultural fit between Kearny and Clifton. In particular, they discussed the similarity of their respective
companies’ efforts to deploy their substantial capital bases following their conversions from mutual holding company to stock holding
company form, their need to generate additional earnings power and the synergies that might be achieved in combining the two
organizations in that effort. No specific terms of a business combination were discussed. Mr. Montanaro and Mr. Aguggia agreed to
discuss with their respective boards of directors their interest in evaluating specific terms of a business combination.

On August 15, 2017, Mr. Aguggia met with the chief executive officer of another financial institution that had previously
expressed an interest in a business combination with Clifton. The chief executive officer of the other financial institution informed
Mr. Aguggia that his company could not structure a transaction that would be financially attractive to Clifton.

On August 16, 2017, with all officers excused during the regular meeting of the Kearny board of directors, Mr. Montanaro
discussed his recent meeting with Mr. Aguggia, regarding the potential business combination between Clifton and Kearny. The
discussion focused on the similarities between the companies in terms of operating models, credit culture, market demographics,
capital structure and the potential earnings growth the combined entity could achieve through improved operating leverage and cost
efficiencies. The Kearny board agreed to move forward with further exploration of this potential business combination.

At the regular meeting of the Clifton board of directors held on August 16, 2017, Mr. Aguggia updated the directors on his
meeting with Mr. Montanaro.

On August 18, 2017, Mr. Montanaro informed Mr. Aguggia that the Kearny board of directors had an interest in a possible
transaction and had authorized Mr. Montanaro to prepare preliminary pro forma financial information to determine if a transaction
could be structured that would be financially attractive to both parties. Mr. Aguggia and Mr. Montanaro agreed to have Sandler O’Neill
assist them in generating a preliminary financial analysis of the transaction.

On August 23, 2017, Clifton and Kearny entered into a mutual non-disclosure agreement.

Over the following days, Sandler O’Neill, with input from management of Clifton and Kearny, prepared a preliminary financial
analysis of a combination of Clifton and Kearny. Mr. Aguggia and Mr. Montanaro discussed the financial analysis and Mr. Montanaro
informed Mr. Aguggia that Kearny had a strong interest in pursuing a transaction at up to $18.00 per share of Clifton common stock in
a stock-for-stock transaction. Mr. Aguggia and Mr. Montanaro also discussed the level of representation by Clifton directors on the
Kearny board of directors. Mr. Aguggia informed Mr. Montanaro that he believed that for a transaction to be of interest

to the Clifton board of directors the price needed to be within the range of $18.00 to $19.00 and that the Clifton stockholders would
need to be well represented on the Kearny board of directors.

On September 5, 2017, the Kearny board of directors held a special meeting to review and discuss the above-referenced
preliminary financial analysis. Mr. Montanaro reviewed the analysis, focusing on an offering range of $18.00 to $18.25 per share, the
earnings accretion achievable by this business combination, an acceptable level of tangible book value dilution and associated earn-
back period for the proposed transaction assuming an all-stock consideration. Following a comprehensive discussion of strategic,
economic, and social benefits of the proposed business combination, the Kearny board authorized President Montanaro to continue
discussions with Clifton relative to the proposed business combination.

After the meeting, Mr. Montanaro informed Mr. Aguggia that the Kearny board of directors continued to be interested in pursuing
a possible business combination on the terms that he and Mr. Aguggia had discussed. Mr. Montanaro also advised Mr. Aguggia that
Kearny had established, based on metrics widely used in the current mergers and acquisitions market, certain parameters regarding the
level of earnings accretion, tangible book value dilution and earn-back period that would have to be met in order for Kearny to proceed
with the transaction. Based on those metrics, Mr. Montanaro indicated that Kearny’s price range was $18.00 - $18.25 and that Kearny
would be unlikely to reach a price of $18.50.

On September 6, 2017, the Clifton board of directors held a special meeting at which Mr. Aguggia updated the Clifton board of
directors on the preliminary discussions with Kearny. Mr. Aguggia informed the Clifton board of directors that Clifton and Kearny had
shared financial projections pursuant to a non-disclosure agreement, and that Kearny continued to have an interest in a possible
transaction but had indicated that it would be unlikely to reach a price of $18.50. The Clifton board of directors discussed the fact that
Sandler O’Neill routinely represents both Clifton and Kearny in strategic matters and that Kearny will retain a different financial
advisor should the companies move forward with a transaction. The Clifton board of directors engaged in a robust discussion of the
advantages and disadvantages of engaging in a business combination with Kearny at this time. At the conclusion of the discussion, the
Clifton board of directors authorized Mr. Aguggia to inform Kearny that Clifton would be interested in pursuing a business
combination with Kearny if Kearny provided a fair value to Clifton stockholders, a meaningful role for Mr. Aguggia in the combined
company, and representation on the Kearny board of directors commensurate with the percentage interest of Clifton stockholders in the
combined company. The Clifton board of directors authorized management to provide additional non-public information to Kearny
through the electronic data room established for the parties.

On September 13, 2017, the Clifton board of directors held a special meeting at which Mr. Aguggia updated the directors on the
status of discussions with Kearny and the Clifton board of directors approved the retention of Sandler O’Neill as Clifton’s financial
advisor, based on, among other factors, Sandler O’Neill’s reputation, experience in mergers and acquisitions, valuations, financing and
capital markets and its familiarity with Clifton, Clifton’s strategic goals and the industry in which Clifton operates.

On September 25, 2017, Kearny delivered a non-binding indication of interest letter that proposed the acquisition of Clifton by
Kearny at a price of $18.00 to $18.25 per share in an all-stock transaction utilizing a fixed exchange ratio, which would be determined
prior to signing a definitive merger agreement.

Over the next several days, Mr. Aguggia and Mr. Montanaro discussed possible revisions to the indication of interest letter that
would make the proposal more attractive to the Clifton board of directors, including providing more specificity as to the value of the
merger consideration, the number of directors that would be added to the Kearny board of directors and the role that Mr. Aguggia
would play in the combined company.

On September 28, 2017, Kearny delivered an updated non-binding indication of interest letter that proposed the acquisition of
Clifton by Kearny at a price of $18.25 per share in an all-stock transaction utilizing a fixed exchange ratio. Kearny proposed to add
three directors to the Kearny board of directors, one of whom would be

Mr. Aguggia, and stated that Mr. Aguggia would serve as Chairman of Kearny’s Enterprise Risk Management Committee and board
liaison to Kearny’s Capital Markets Committee. The indication of interest letter required that Clifton agree to a 30-day period of
exclusive negotiations.

On September 29, 2017, the Clifton board of directors held a special meeting, attended by representatives of Sandler O’Neill and
Kilpatrick Townsend, to review the non-binding indication of interest letter. A representative of Kilpatrick Townsend reviewed with the
Clifton board of directors the applicable legal standards in connection with a possible transaction. The Clifton board of directors
engaged in a robust discussion regarding the indication of interest. There was significant discussion regarding the use of a fixed
exchange ratio, the process and timing for calculating the exchange ratio, and the impact on both Clifton and Kearny stockholders of
using a fixed exchange ratio. Representatives of Sandler O’Neill presented to the Clifton board of directors an analysis of the financial
condition and trading prices of Clifton and Kearny, its views on valuation and a pro forma analysis of the proposed transaction. The
Clifton board of directors determined to proceed with negotiation of a definitive merger agreement and authorized Mr. Aguggia to
execute the non-binding indication of interest letter.

On October 2, 2017, Clifton executed the non-binding indication of interest letter, which included the 30-day exclusivity period
discussed above. Promptly thereafter, Clifton and Kearny began to make available to each other additional non-public information
regarding their respective loans, investments and deposits, credit quality, vendor contracts, revenues and operating expenses.

On October 11, 2017, the Clifton board of directors held a special meeting at which it further considered Sandler O’Neill’s role in
the transaction and relationship with Kearny and determined to hire an independent third party that was familiar with Clifton but that
had not participated in any of the discussions relating to the proposed transaction to provide it with a fairness opinion in connection
with the proposed transaction. At this meeting, the Clifton board of directors approved the engagement of RP Financial, LC., which we
refer to as RP Financial, to provide the Clifton board of directors with a fairness opinion based on, among other factors, RP Financial’s
reputation, experience in mergers and acquisitions and valuations, and its familiarity with the industry in which Clifton operates.

On October 16, 2017, representatives of Clifton, Sandler O’Neill, RP Financial and Kilpatrick Townsend met with representatives
of Kearny, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc. (which we refer to as KBW) as Kearny’s financial advisor and Luse Gorman, PC (which we
refer to as Luse Gorman) as Kearny’s outside legal counsel, and engaged in detailed discussions regarding various aspects of the
parties’ respective businesses. KBW, which began providing services to Kearny in early September 2017, was selected by Kearny to
act as its financial advisor in connection with a possible transaction based on, among other factors, KBW’s reputation, experience in
mergers and acquisitions, valuations, financing and capital markets and its familiarity with the industry in which Kearny operates.

On October 18, 2017, the Clifton board of directors held a special meeting at which Mr. Aguggia updated the Clifton board of
directors on the status of discussions with Kearny and the companies’ reciprocal due diligence efforts.

On October 19, 2017, Kearny and Luse Gorman provided Clifton and Kilpatrick Townsend with an initial draft merger agreement
for the proposed transaction.

Over the following days, Kilpatrick Townsend and Luse Gorman exchanged drafts of the merger agreement and Luse Gorman
provided drafts of other transaction documents, including voting agreements to be entered into by the Clifton and Kearny directors and
a settlement agreement and non-competition agreement to be entered into by Mr. Aguggia in connection with the merger agreement,
and the two firms worked towards finalizing the terms and conditions of the transaction. During this period, Clifton and Kearny
continued their reciprocal due diligence efforts.

At its regular meeting held on October 24, 2017, which was attended by representatives of Sandler O’Neill, RP Financial and
Kilpatrick Townsend, as well as members of Clifton senior executive management, representatives of RP Financial, in connection with
the delivery of its fairness opinion, reviewed its financial analysis of the proposed transaction, including a comparison of transaction
pricing ratios and multiples and a net present value analysis of Clifton, and discussed with the directors the strategic rationale for a
combination with Kearny and the pro forma characteristics of the combined company. A representative of Kilpatrick Townsend
reviewed the then-current draft of the merger agreement and the Clifton directors engaged in a robust discussion regarding the terms
and conditions of the merger. The members of Clifton senior executive management reviewed the due diligence findings related to their
functional areas.

On October 25, 2017, the Kearny board of directors met to discuss the proposed transaction. Members of Kearny’s executive
management and representatives of KBW and Luse Gorman were also in attendance. Representatives of KBW discussed with the
Kearny board financial aspects of the proposed transaction, including transaction pricing ratios and multiples and the pro forma
financial characteristics of the combined company. A representative of Luse Gorman reviewed the then-current draft of the merger
agreement and the Kearny directors engaged in a discussion regarding the material terms of the merger. The members of Kearny’s
executive management reviewed the due diligence findings.

Over the following days, Clifton and Kearny, with the assistance of their financial and legal advisors, continued to negotiate the
outstanding terms of the merger agreement and related transaction documents. On October 31, 2017, Clifton and Kearny agreed to an
exchange ratio of 1.191, which was calculated as $18.25 divided by the 10-day volume-weighted average common stock price of
$15.32 for Kearny as of October 31, 2017.

At its regular meeting held on November 1, 2017, which was attended by members of Clifton’s senior executive management and
representatives of Sandler O’Neill, RP Financial and Kilpatrick Townsend, the Clifton board of directors considered the approval of the
merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. The Clifton board of directors had been provided with a
set of meeting materials in advance of the meeting, including the merger agreement and a summary of the material terms of the merger
agreement prepared by Kilpatrick Townsend. At the meeting, RP Financial rendered a written opinion (a copy of which is attached to
this joint proxy statement/prospectus as Annex B), to the effect that, as of that date and subject to the procedures followed,
assumptions made, matters considered, and qualifications and limitations on the review undertaken by RP Financial as set forth in such
opinion, the exchange ratio in the merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Clifton common stock. A
representative of Kilpatrick Townsend discussed the terms of the merger agreement and related transaction documents (including the

of directors, including the changes to the merger agreement since the meeting on October 24, 2017. After considering the proposed
terms of the merger agreement and related transaction documents and the various presentations of its financial and legal advisors, and
taking into consideration the matters discussed during that meeting and prior meetings of the Clifton board, including the strategic
alternatives discussed at those meetings and the factors described under the section of this joint proxy statement/prospectus entitled “—
Clifton’s Reasons for the Merger and Recommendation of the Board of Directors,” the Clifton board of directors unanimously
determined that the merger, the merger agreement and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement were in the best
interests of Clifton and its stockholders, and the directors unanimously approved and adopted the merger agreement and the
transactions contemplated by it and unanimously determined to recommend that Clifton’s stockholders approve the merger agreement.

Also on November 1, 2017, the Kearny board of directors met to discuss the proposed transaction. Members of Kearny’s
executive management and representatives of KBW and Luse Gorman were also in attendance as the Kearny board of directors
considered the approval of the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. The Kearny board of
directors had been provided with a set of meeting materials in advance of the meeting, including the merger agreement, a summary of
the material terms of the merger

agreement prepared by Luse Gorman and a financial presentation provided by KBW. At the meeting, KBW reviewed with the Kearny
board of directors its financial analysis of the exchange ratio and rendered its written opinion (a copy of which is attached to this joint
proxy statement/prospectus as Annex C), dated November 1, 2017, to the Kearny board of directors to the effect that, as of that date
and subject to the procedures followed, assumptions made, matters considered, and qualifications and limitations on the review
undertaken by KBW as set forth in such opinion, the exchange ratio in the merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to Kearny. A
representative of Luse Gorman discussed the terms of the merger agreement and related transaction documents with the Kearny board
of directors, including the changes to the merger agreement since the meeting on October 25, 2017. After considering the proposed
terms of the merger agreement and related transaction documents and the various presentations of its financial and legal advisors, and
taking into consideration the matters discussed during that meeting and prior meetings of the Kearny board, including the factors
described under the section of this joint proxy statement/prospectus entitled “ — Kearny’s Reasons for the Merger,” the Kearny board
of directors unanimously determined that the merger, the merger agreement and the other transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement were in the best interests of Kearny and its stockholders, and the directors unanimously approved and adopted the merger
agreement and the transactions contemplated by it and unanimously determined to recommend that Kearny’s stockholders approve the
merger agreement.

Following the respective board meetings of Clifton and Kearny, Clifton and Kearny executed the merger agreement, the directors
of Clifton executed the voting agreements with Kearny and the directors of Kearny executed the voting agreements with Clifton, and
Mr. Aguggia executed the settlement agreement and the non-competition agreement. Later that evening, Kearny and Clifton issued a
joint press release announcing the execution of the merger agreement.

Clifton’s Reasons for the Merger and Recommendation of the Board of Directors

After careful consideration, at a meeting held on November 1, 2017, the Clifton board of directors unanimously determined that
the merger agreement, including the merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby, is in the best interests of Clifton and its
stockholders and approved the merger agreement and the related transaction documents.

In reaching its decision to approve the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement and recommend that its stockholders vote “FOR” the merger agreement, the Clifton board of directors consulted with
Clifton management, as well as its independent financial and legal advisors, and considered a number of factors, including the
following material factors:
 

 
•  its knowledge of Clifton’s business, operations, regulatory and financial condition, asset quality, earnings, loan portfolio,

capital and prospects both as an independent organization, and as a part of a combined company with Kearny;
 

 
•  its understanding of Kearny’s business, operations, regulatory and financial condition, asset quality, earnings, capital and

prospects, taking into account presentations by senior management of its due diligence review of Kearny and information
furnished by Sandler O’Neill;

 

 
•  the Clifton board’s belief that significant growth in earnings is required for Clifton to be in a position to deliver a

competitive return to its stockholders and that achieving such growth in earnings would require significant investment in
both resources and time to achieve those results;

 

 
•  its belief that the merger will result in a more competitive banking franchise with strong capital ratios and an attractive

funding base that has the potential to deliver a higher value to Clifton’s stockholders as compared to continuing to operate as
a stand-alone entity;

 

 
•  the expanded possibilities, including organic growth and future acquisitions, that would be available to the combined

company, given its larger size, asset base, capital, market capitalization and footprint;

Table of Contents

 
•  the anticipated pro forma impact of the merger on Kearny, including potential synergies, and the expected impact on

financial metrics such as earnings and tangible common equity per share, as well as on regulatory capital levels;
 

 

•  the financial analyses of RP Financial and its written opinion, dated as of November 1, 2017, delivered to the board of
directors to the effect that, as of that date, and subject to and based on the various assumptions, considerations, qualifications
and limitations set forth in the opinion, the exchange ratio was fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Clifton
common stock;

 

 
•  the structure of the transaction as a stock-for-stock merger, which offers Clifton stockholders the opportunity to participate

as stockholders of Kearny in the future performance of the combined company;
 

 
•  the board’s understanding that the merger will qualify as a “reorganization” under Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue

Code and that, as a result, Clifton’s stockholders will not recognize gain or loss with respect to their receipt of Kearny
common stock in the merger;

 

 
•  the fact that the exchange ratio is fixed, which the Clifton board of directors believes is consistent with market practice for

transactions of this type and with the strategic purpose of the transaction;
 

 
•  the fact that the more active trading market in Kearny common stock would give Clifton stockholders greater liquidity for

their investment;
 

 
•  the benefits to Clifton and its customers of operating as a larger organization, including enhancements in products and

services, higher lending limits, and greater financial resources;
 

 
•  the increasing importance of operational scale and financial resources in maintaining efficiency and remaining competitive

over the long term and in being able to capitalize on technological developments that significantly impact industry
competitive conditions;

 

 
•  the expected social and economic impact of the merger on the constituencies served by Clifton, including its borrowers,

customers, depositors, employees, and communities;
 

 
•  the effects of the merger on Clifton employees, including the prospects for continued employment in a larger organization

and various benefits agreed to be provided to Clifton employees;
 

 

•  the enhanced likelihood of realizing the strategic benefits of the proposed combination that the Clifton board of directors
believes will result from the continuity provided to Clifton stockholders by the corporate governance aspects of the proposed
combination, including Clifton’s agreement, upon the closing of the merger, to appoint three current members of the Clifton
board of directors, including Mr. Aguggia, as directors of Kearny and Kearny Bank and to appoint Mr. Aguggia to certain
committee positions;

 

 

•  the Clifton board’s understanding of the current and prospective environment in which Clifton and Kearny operate,
including national and local economic conditions, the interest rate environment, increasing operating costs resulting from
regulatory initiatives and compliance mandates, and the competitive effects of the continuing consolidation in the banking
industry;

 

 •  the ability of Kearny to complete the merger from a financial and regulatory perspective;
 

 •  the low probability of securing a more attractive proposal from another institution capable of consummating the transaction;
 

 •  the low probability of Clifton completing a desirable acquisition in the near term; and
 

 

•  the board’s review with its independent legal advisor, Kilpatrick Townsend, of the material terms of the merger agreement,
including (i) the board’s ability, under certain circumstances, to consider an unsolicited acquisition proposal and terminate
the merger agreement in order to enter into an agreement with respect to a superior proposal, subject to the required payment
by Clifton of a termination fee to

Kearny, which the Clifton board of directors concluded was reasonable in the context of termination fees in comparable
transactions and in light of the overall terms of the merger agreement, and (ii) the board’s ability to terminate the merger
agreement if Kearny common stock both declined below $12.42 during a measurement period prior to the closing and
underperformed the Nasdaq Bank Index by a specified amount, as well as the nature of the covenants, representations and
warranties and termination provisions in the merger agreement.

The Clifton board of directors also considered a number of potential risks and uncertainties associated with the merger in
connection with its deliberation of the proposed transaction, including, without limitation, the following:
 

 
•  the risk that the consideration to be paid to Clifton stockholders could be adversely affected by a decrease in the trading

price of Kearny common stock during the pendency of the merger;
 

 
•  the potential risk of diverting management attention and resources from the operation of Clifton’s business and towards the

completion of the merger;
 

 

•  the restrictions on the conduct of Clifton’s business prior to the completion of the merger, which are customary for public
company merger agreements involving financial institutions, but which, subject to specific exceptions, could delay or
prevent Clifton from undertaking business opportunities that may arise or any other action it would otherwise take with
respect to the operations of Clifton absent the pending merger;

 

 
•  the potential risks associated with achieving anticipated cost synergies and savings and successfully integrating Clifton’s

business, operations and workforce with those of Kearny;
 

 
•  the fact that the interests of certain of Clifton’s directors and executive officers may be different from, or in addition to, the

interests of Clifton’s other stockholders as described under the heading “—Interests of Certain Persons in the Merger that
are Different from Yours”;

 

 
•  that Sandler O’Neill, Clifton’s financial advisor in connection with the transaction, also maintains an investment banking

relationship with Kearny, although Kearny engaged another investment banking firm as its financial advisor in connection
with the merger and Clifton engaged RP Financial to provide a fairness opinion with respect to the exchange ratio;

 

 
•  that, while Clifton expects that the merger will be consummated, there can be no assurance that all conditions to the parties’

obligations to complete the merger agreement will be satisfied, including the risk that necessary regulatory approvals or
Clifton or Kearny stockholder approval might not be obtained and, as a result, the merger may not be consummated;

 

 
•  the risk of potential employee attrition and/or adverse effects on business and customer relationships as a result of the

pending merger;
 

 

•  the fact that: (i) Clifton would be prohibited from affirmatively soliciting acquisition proposals after execution of the merger
agreement; and (ii) Clifton would be obligated to pay to Kearny a termination fee of $15 million if the merger agreement is
terminated under certain circumstances, which may discourage other parties potentially interested in a strategic transaction
with Clifton from pursuing such a transaction; and

 

 •  the possibility of litigation challenging the merger, and its belief that any such litigation would be without merit.

The foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by the Clifton board of directors is not intended to be
exhaustive, but includes the material factors considered by the board of directors. In reaching its decision to approve the merger
agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, the Clifton board of directors did not quantify
or assign any relative weights to the factors considered, and individual directors may have given different weights to different factors.
The Clifton board of directors

considered all these factors as a whole, including discussions with, and questioning of, Clifton’s management and Clifton’s
independent financial and legal advisors, and overall considered the factors to be favorable to, and to support, its determination.

The Clifton board of directors unanimously recommends that Clifton’s stockholders vote “FOR” the approval of the
merger agreement and the merger, “FOR” the merger-related compensation proposal and “FOR” the Clifton adjournment
proposal. Clifton stockholders should be aware that Clifton’s directors and executive officers have interests in the merger that are
different from, or in addition to, those of other Clifton stockholders. The Clifton board of directors was aware of and considered these
interests, among other matters, in evaluating and negotiating the merger agreement, and in recommending that the merger proposal be
approved by the stockholders of Clifton. See “ —Interests of Certain Persons in the Merger that are Different from Yours.”

This summary of the reasoning of the Clifton board of directors and other information presented in this section is forward-looking
in nature and, therefore, should be read in light of the factors discussed under the heading “Cautionary Statement About Forward-
Looking Statements.”

RP Financial’s Opinion to Clifton’s Board of Directors

Clifton retained RP Financial on October 16, 2017, to render an opinion regarding the fairness from a financial point of view of
the exchange ratio to be received by Clifton’s stockholders in the merger. In engaging RP Financial for its opinion regarding fairness,
the Clifton board of directors did not give any special instructions to RP Financial, nor did it impose any limitations upon the scope of
the investigation that RP Financial wished to conduct to enable it to give its opinion. RP Financial has delivered to Clifton its written
opinion, dated November 1, 2017, to the effect that, based upon and subject to the matters set forth therein, including various
assumptions, considerations, qualifications and limitations, and other matters it considered relevant, as of that date, the exchange ratio
to be received in connection with the merger with Kearny was fair to the Clifton stockholders from a financial point of view. The
opinion of RP Financial is directed to the board of directors of Clifton in its consideration of the merger agreement, and does not
constitute a recommendation to any stockholder of Clifton as to any action that such stockholder should take in connection with the
merger agreement or otherwise. RP Financial’s opinion is directed only to the fairness of the exchange ratio to the current stockholders
of Clifton from a financial point of view as of the date of the merger agreement. A copy of the RP Financial opinion is set forth as
Annex B to this joint proxy statement/prospectus, and Clifton stockholders should read it in its entirety. RP Financial has consented to
the inclusion and description of its written opinion in this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

Clifton selected RP Financial to render an opinion regarding fairness because of RP Financial’s expertise in the valuation of
financial services businesses and their securities for a variety of purposes, including its expertise in connection with mergers and
acquisitions of financial institutions. Pursuant to a letter agreement executed by Clifton on October 16, 2017, RP Financial estimates
that it will receive from Clifton total professional fees of approximately $250,000, $235,000 of which has been paid to date, plus
reimbursement of certain out-of-pocket expenses, for its services in connection with the merger.

In addition, Clifton has agreed to indemnify and hold harmless RP Financial, any affiliates of RP Financial, and the respective
directors, officers, agents and employees of RP Financial or their successors and assigns who act for or on behalf of RP Financial in
connection with the services called for under Clifton’s engagement letter with RP Financial, from and against any and all losses,
claims, damages and liabilities (including, but not limited to, all losses and expenses in connection with claims under the federal
securities laws), actually incurred by RP Financial and attributable to: (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material
fact contained in the financial statements or other information furnished or otherwise provided by Clifton to RP Financial, either orally
or in writing; (ii) the omission or alleged omission of a material fact from the financial statements or other information furnished or
otherwise made available by the Clifton to RP Financial; or (iii) any action or omission to act by Clifton or Clifton’s respective
officers, directors, employees or agents which action or omission is

willful or negligent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Clifton will be under no obligation to indemnify RP Financial hereunder if a court
determines that RP Financial was negligent or acted in bad faith or willfully with respect to any actions or omissions of RP Financial
related to a matter for which indemnification is sought. Any time devoted by employees of RP Financial to situations for which
indemnification is provided are indemnifiable costs payable by Clifton at the normal hourly professional rate chargeable by RP
Financial for such employee.

In rendering its opinion, RP Financial reviewed the following material and/or conducted the following analyses with respect to
the merger agreement and Clifton:
 

 •  the merger agreement, distributed to the Clifton board of directors on October 31, 2017;
 

 

•  the following financial information for Clifton – (a) certain annual reports, including audited financial statements, as
presented in Clifton’s Form 10-K filings, including for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017; (b) certain unaudited financial
data, including shareholder reports and financial statements, including for the quarter ended June 30, 2017; (c) certain
quarterly financial reports submitted to the OCC by Clifton Savings Bank, including for the quarter ended September 30,
2017; (d) certain historical publicly-available financial information as published by S&P Global Market Intelligence;
(e) certain internal financial statements and other financial and operating data concerning Clifton, including for the quarter
ended September 30, 2017; (f) publicly available mean and median analyst consensus earnings per share estimates for
Clifton for the years ending March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2019, provided by S&P Capital IQ, and a range of estimated
potential long-term annual growth rates in net income and net income per share thereafter provided by Clifton’s senior
management;

 

 
•  the financial terms of certain other recently completed and/or pending acquisitions of commercial banks and thrift

institutions nationwide with comparable financial characteristics as Clifton;
 

 
•  the financial terms of certain other recently completed and pending acquisitions of thrift institutions headquartered in the

Mid-Atlantic and Northeast regions of the United States with comparable financial characteristics as Clifton;
 

 •  the estimated pro forma financial benefits of the merger to Clifton’s stockholders;
 

 •  certain Clifton financial information versus a peer group of comparable publicly-traded financial institutions; and
 

 
•  in person and telephonic discussions with executive officers of Clifton regarding Clifton’s business, financial condition,

results of operations and future prospects; the history, past and current operations, historical financial performance; and their
assessment of the rationale for the merger.

In addition, RP Financial reviewed or considered the following materials or information for Kearny and as further described
below certain peers of Kearny:
 

 
•  certain annual reports, including audited financial statements, including for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017, as presented

in Kearny’s Form 10-K filings;
 

 
•  certain quarterly call reports submitted to the OCC and or FDIC by Kearny Bank, including for the quarter ended

September 30, 2017;
 

 
•  certain internal financial statements and other financial and operating data concerning Kearny, including for the quarter

ended September 30, 2017;
 

 •  the quarterly earnings release for Kearny for the quarter ended September 30, 2017;
 

 
•  publicly available mean and median analyst consensus earnings per share estimates for Kearny for the years ending June 30,

2018 and June 30, 2019, provided by S&P Capital IQ, and a long-term annual growth rate in net income and net income per
share thereafter provided by Kearny’s senior management;

 

 •  the stock price history for Kearny during the twelve months ended October 31, 2017;

Table of Contents

 •  certain Kearny financial information versus a peer group of comparable publicly-traded financial institutions; and
 

 
•  in person discussions with executive officers of Kearny regarding Kearny’s business, financial condition, results of

operations and future prospects; the history, past and current operations, historical financial performance and their
assessment of the rationale for the merger.

RP Financial also reviewed and considered certain information and materials detailing the merger provided by Kearny, including
the estimated amount and timing of the cost savings and related expenses, purchase accounting adjustment and synergies expected to
result from the merger, the pro forma financial impact of the merger on the combined company’s earnings, tangible book value,
financial ratios and other relevant financial metrics.

In rendering its opinion, RP Financial relied, without independent verification, on the accuracy and completeness of the
information concerning Clifton and Kearny furnished by or on behalf of the respective institutions to RP Financial for review for
purposes of its opinion, as well as publicly-available information regarding other financial institutions and competitive, economic and
demographic data. RP Financial has further relied on the assurances of management of Clifton and Kearny as included in the merger
agreement. RP Financial has also relied upon the management of Clifton and Kearny as to the reasonableness and achievability of the
financial forecasts, projections and other forward-looking information provided to RP Financial by or on behalf of Clifton and Kearny,
and RP Financial has assumed such forecasts, projections and other forward-looking information have been reasonably prepared by or
on behalf of Clifton and Kearny on a basis reflecting the best currently available information and Clifton’s and Kearny’s judgements
and estimates. RP Financial has assumed that such forecasts, projections and other forward-looking information would be realized in
the amounts and at the times contemplated thereby, and RP Financial does not assume any responsibility for the accuracy or
reasonableness thereof. RP Financial was authorized by Clifton to rely on such forecasts, projections and other information and data,
and RP Financial expressed no view as to the ability of Clifton to achieve the results set forth in any such forecasts, projections or other
forward-looking information or data, or the bases or assumptions on which they were prepared. RP Financial has not been asked to,
and has not undertaken an independent verification of any of such information, or information RP Financial obtained from public
sources and RP Financial did not assume any responsibility or liability for the accuracy or completeness thereof.

RP Financial has not undertaken any independent analysis of any pending or threatened litigation, regulatory action, possible
unasserted claims or other contingent liabilities to which Clifton or Kearny is a party or may be subject to, and RP Financial’s opinion
makes no assumption concerning, and therefore does not consider, the possible assertion of claims, outcomes or damages arising out of
any such matters. RP Financial also assumed that neither Clifton or Kearny is party to any material pending transaction, including
without limitation any financing, recapitalization, acquisition or merger, divestiture or spin-off, other than the merger contemplated by
the merger agreement. RP Financial, with Clifton’s consent, relied upon the advice Clifton has received from its legal, accounting,
financial and tax advisors as to all legal, accounting and tax matters relating to the merger agreement and other transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement. In rendering its opinion, RP Financial assumed that, in the course of obtaining the necessary
regulatory and governmental approvals for the proposed merger, no restriction will be imposed on Kearny that would have a material
adverse effect on the ability of the merger to be consummated as set forth in the merger agreement. RP Financial also assumed that
there have been no material changes in the financial condition of Clifton or Kearny since the date of the most recent financial statement
made available to RP Financial. RP Financial has assumed, in all respects material to RP Financial’s analyses, that all of the
representations and warranties contained in the merger agreement and all related agreements are true and correct, that each party to
such agreements will perform all of the covenants required to be performed by such party under such agreements and that the
conditions precedent in the merger agreement are not waived.

RP Financial’s opinion was based on market conditions and other circumstances existing on November 1, 2017. RP Financial
specifically stated in its opinion that events occurring after November 1, 2017, could

materially affect the assumptions RP Financial used in preparing its opinion. In connection with rendering its opinion dated
November 1, 2017, RP Financial performed a variety of financial analyses that are summarized below. Although the evaluation of the
fairness, from a financial point of view, of the exchange ratio was to some extent subjective based on the experience and judgment of
RP Financial and not merely the result of mathematical analyses of financial data, RP Financial relied, in part, on the financial analyses
summarized below in its determinations. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and RP Financial believes its
analyses must be considered as a whole. Selecting portions of such analyses and factors considered by RP Financial without
considering all such analyses and factors could create an incomplete view of the process underlying RP Financial’s opinion. In its
analyses, RP Financial took into account its assessment of general business, market, financial and economic conditions, banking and
thrift industry performance and other matters, many of which are beyond the control of Clifton and Kearny, as well as RP Financial’s
experience in securities valuation, its knowledge of financial institutions, its knowledge of the current operating and merger and
acquisition environments for financial institutions, and its experience in similar transactions. With respect to the comparable
transactions and control premium analyses described below, no public company utilized as a comparison is identical to Clifton and
such analyses necessarily involve complex considerations and judgments concerning the differences in financial and operating
characteristics of the companies and other factors that could affect the trading and/or acquisition values of the companies concerned.
RP Financial prepared its analyses solely for purposes of providing its opinion as to the fairness of the exchange ratio.

Comparable Transactions Analysis. RP Financial compared the merger on the basis of multiples and/or ratios involving reported
earnings, tangible book value and tangible book premium to core deposits reported in a selected comparable group of completed and
pending bank and thrift mergers and acquisitions. The comparable transaction groups consisted of sale of control transactions and
included two groups with the following characteristics:
 

 
(1) Nationwide transactions included all nationwide bank and thrift transactions announced during the period from January 1,

2016, through October 20, 2017, involving targets with the following financial characteristics at the announcement date:
 

 •  total assets between $750 million and $3.0 billion;
 

 •  tangible equity/tangible assets ratios greater than or equal to 10%;
 

 •  return on average equity less than 10%;
 

 •  profitable on a trailing twelve-month basis; and
 

 •  non-performing assets/total assets ratios of less than 3%.
 

 

(2) Regional transactions included all transactions where the targets were thrift institutions, which operate with a savings and
loan association or savings bank charter, and the transactions were announced during the period from January 1, 2015,
through October 20, 2017 and where the target was located in the Mid-Atlantic or New England region of the U.S. and had
the following financial characteristics at the announcement date:

 

 •  total assets between $500 million and $3.0 billion;
 

 •  tangible equity/tangible assets ratios greater than or equal to 9%;
 

 •  return on average equity less than 10%;
 

 •  profitable on a trailing twelve-month basis; and
 

 •  non-performing assets/total assets ratios of less than 3%.

(1) Pricing ratios at announcement.
(2) Reflects financial data as of or for the trailing 12 months ended September 30, 2017.
(3) Deal value and multiples for Clifton based on the volume weighted average price for Kearny for the ten trading days ended

October 31, 2017.

The average and median pricing multiples (price/tangible book value multiple, price/earnings multiple and core deposit premium
multiple) of the nationwide transactions group and regional transactions group were applied to Clifton’s actual financial measures as of
or for the last twelve months through September 30, 2017 and budgeted earnings for the 12 months ending June 30, 2018 (tangible
book value, core and budgeted earnings and core deposits) to derive a valuation range before adjustments. The resulting values
indicated by the comparable transactions indicated a range of value of $7.58 per share to $20.38 per share. RP Financial concluded
with a valuation range of $15.00 per share to $19.00 per share pursuant to the comparable transactions approach after taking into
consideration, among other things, Clifton’s lower return on assets and return on equity relative to both the nationwide transactions
group and regional transactions group average and median values. In addition, RP Financial considered Clifton’s high tangible
equity/assets ratio as acquirers are typically unwilling to pay a premium on capital materially in excess of industry norms for
community banks and thrifts. Overall, the value of the merger consideration implied by the exchange ratio of $18.25 per share was at
the upper end of the $15.00 to $19.00 per share value range derived pursuant to the comparable transactions approach.

Control Premium Analysis. In the control premium analysis, RP Financial applied a multiple to the pre-announcement fair
market value or trading value of an acquisition target’s common stock at various points in time (one week and one month prior to
announcement) to derive a sale of control value for a share of the acquisition target’s stock. It is a two-step process.

First the fair market value of a minority ownership position (i.e., non-controlling) of Clifton common stock was estimated based
on a peer group of comparable publicly-traded companies. Then a multiple was applied to the fair market value and the trading value of
Clifton common stock based on control premium multiples paid in comparable transactions.

The fair market value of Clifton common stock was based on the trading multiples of a peer group of comparable publicly-traded
institutions. The peer group consisted of a group of publicly-traded (listed on the NASDAQ Stock Market or the New York Stock
Exchange) thrift holding companies where the principal operating subsidiary was a thrift with total assets of between $1 billion and
$5 billion and which were profitable on a trailing twelve month basis through June 30, 2017, had tangible equity/tangible assets ratios
greater than 12% and non-performing assets/total assets ratios less than 3%. There were a total of 9 institutions included in the peer
group as follows:

RP Financial compared the financial condition and recent performance of Clifton to the median financial conditions and recent
performance measures of the peer group, as displayed in the table on the following below.

(1) Based on September 30, 2017 financial data.
(2) Market capitalization and pricing ratios for Clifton were based on Clifton’s estimated trading value of $14.50 per share. The

estimated trading value was determined by RP Financial by applying trading multiples of the peer group of comparable publicly-
traded institutions listed above.    Based on the $17.03 per share closing price as of October 31, 2017 and the 22,064,768 shares of
Clifton outstanding as of September 30, 2017, the market capitalization was $375.8 million, the price/tangible book ratio equaled
131.4% and the price/earnings multiple equaled 58.72x.

Relative to the peer group, RP Financial made qualitative valuation adjustments to account for differences between Clifton and
the peer group from a valuation standpoint including, but not limited to, downward valuation adjustments for Clifton’s smaller asset
size, higher tangible equity/tangible assets ratio, lower return on average assets and return on average equity ratio and an upward
valuation adjustment for credit quality. RP Financial concluded with a public equivalent value for Clifton equal to $14.50 per share.

Second, a control premium analysis, which involved applying a control premium to the estimated peer group based trading value
of Clifton stock of $14.50, was applied by RP Financial. The control premium was applied to the $14.50 per share as well as to the
actual trading value of Clifton stock as of October 31, 2017, which equaled $17.03 per share (Clifton’s stock traded on the NASDAQ
Market) to arrive at a range of sale of control values under this approach. The control premium applied was the median of the 1-week,
1-month and 3-month premiums paid over the trading value of the stock (i.e., acquisition price at announcement divided by price of
target 1-week, 1-month and 3-months prior to announcement date involving selling institutions with total assets between $1 billion and
$5 billion that announced a transaction over the period from October 21, 2016 through October 20, 2017). The control premiums
ranged from 14% to 30% relative to the pre-announcement trading prices

Applying this premium to the fair market value of Clifton’s stock that RP Financial derived based on the peer group-based
valuation of $14.50 per share resulted in a sale of control valuation range of $16.55 to $18.85 per share. The value of the merger
consideration as of October 31, 2017, implied by the exchange ratio, was within the range of value indicated pursuant to the control
premium approach.

Discounted Cash Flow Analysis. RP Financial evaluated the value per share of the current offer to the implied value of Clifton’s
current business plan under two alternative scenarios. Pursuant to the application of the discounted cash flow approach, RP Financial
measured the present value per share of future dividends and the terminal value to Clifton’s current stockholders, based on financial
data as of September 30, 2017, and shares outstanding of 22,064,768, for a five year period through September 30, 2022, under the two
alternative operating scenarios.

Table of Contents

The first scenario was based on Clifton’s internal budget through September 30, 2019. Projected earnings and asset growth
estimates for the period from September 30, 2019 to September 30, 2022, were derived based on information provided by management
of Clifton to RP Financial, under the assumption that Clifton would remain an independent financial institution.

The discounted cash flow analysis pursuant to the first scenario incorporated the following assumptions:
 

 •  Beginning balance sheet as of September 30, 2017, was utilized for modeling purposes;
 

 •  Earnings and asset growth assumptions were generally consistent with the internal budget through September 30, 2019;
 

 •  Asset growth was assumed to equal 15% for the twelve months ending September 30, 2020, and 10% annually thereafter;
 

 
•  The projected return on average assets was projected to equal 0.52% or $8.9 million for the 12 months ending September 30,

2018, increasing in each year of the modeling horizon thereafter to 0.78%, equal to $23.0 million for the 12 months ending
September 30, 2022;

 

 •  Dividends were assumed to equal $0.24 per share annually; and
 

 
•  Stock repurchases are assumed to equal 4% of the outstanding shares for the 12 months ending September 30, 2018 and 2%

of the outstanding shares for the 12 months ending September 30, 2019, all at a price equal to 125% of book value per share,
with no stock repurchases thereafter.

This first scenario was based on Clifton management’s belief and projections regarding its long term earnings, assets and other
growth targets. RP Financial also considered a second scenario based upon information provided by and discussed with Clifton’s
management using assumptions focusing on potential adverse conditions such as business plan execution risk attributable to regulatory,
competitive interest rate and a variety of other internal and external factors which could individually or in the aggregate negatively or
positively impact Clifton’s ability to achieve the projected financial results. Accordingly, RP Financial considered a second operating
scenario.

The second scenario incorporated into the discounted cash flow analysis is based on Clifton’s internal budget through
September 30, 2019 and projected earnings and asset growth estimates for the period from September 30, 2019 to September 30, 2022.
The second scenario reflects lower earnings and asset growth assumptions relative to the assumptions incorporated into the first
scenario and was undertaken in consultation with and based on information provided by management of Clifton.

The discounted cash flow analysis pursuant to the second scenario incorporated the following assumptions:
 

 •  Beginning balance sheet as of September 30, 2017, was utilized for modeling purposes;
 

 •  Earnings and asset growth assumptions were generally consistent with the internal budget through September 30, 2019;
 

 •  Asset growth was assumed to equal 7.5% annually thereafter;
 

 
•  The projected return on average assets was projected to equal 0.52% or $8.9 million for the 12 months ending September 30,

2018, increasing in each year of the modeling horizon thereafter to 0.66%, equal to $17.7 million for the 12 months ending
September 30, 2022;

 

 •  Dividends were assumed to equal $0.24 per share annually; and
 

 
•  Stock repurchases were assumed to equal 4% of the outstanding shares for the 12 months ending September 30, 2018 and

2% of the outstanding shares annually thereafter through September 30, 2022, all at a price equal to 125% of book value per
share.

Table of Contents

The discounted cash flow analyses reflected the following valuation and discount rate assumptions:
 

 
•  Fifth year terminal value multipliers for earnings per share were in a range of 23 to 27 times earnings per share while the

fifth year terminal value multipliers for tangible book value per share were in a range of 1.40 times to 1.70 times tangible
book value per share; and

 

 

•  The cash flows were then discounted to present value using a range of discount rates, which were derived from a capital
asset pricing model. The dividend and terminal value cash flows in the first scenario were discounted at a range of discount
rates from 13.5% to 15.5% while the dividend and terminal value cash flows in the second scenario were discounted at range
of discount rates from 11.5% to 13.5%.

The present per share value generated by the discounted cash flow under these assumptions ranged from $12.30 per share to
$15.78 per share in the first scenario and $11.98 to $15.38 per share in the second scenario. The value of the merger consideration as of
October 31, 2017, implied by the exchange ratio exceeded the range of value indicated pursuant to the discounted cash flow approach.

Pro Forma Impact Analysis. Since the merger consideration consists solely of Kearny common stock, RP Financial considered
the estimated pro forma impact of the merger on Kearny’s financial condition, operating results and stock pricing ratios. Based on,
among other things, estimated transaction costs, restructuring charges and cost saves, RP Financial estimated the merger to be
approximately 3% dilutive to Kearny’s tangible book value per share. In addition, RP Financial estimated the merger to be accretive to
Kearny’s pro forma earnings per share within the first year of completing the merger, assuming incorporation of certain anticipated
merger synergies and core earnings estimates for Clifton. RP Financial further considered that the merger will increase Kearny’s
market capitalization and shares outstanding. Furthermore, RP Financial considered the increased asset size, competitive profile and
geographic footprint of Kearny on a pro forma basis. RP Financial also considered the pro forma impact of the merger on Kearny’s per
share data and pricing ratios based on Kearny’s pre-announcement trading price. RP Financial further considered other benefits of the
merger to Clifton’s stockholders, including but not limited to, the potential for increased liquidity of the stock for Clifton’s stockholders
given Kearny’s larger size, greater market capitalization, greater number of shares outstanding, and greater liquidity of Kearny’s
common stock on a post- acquisition basis. Moreover, RP Financial considered the enhanced ability to pursue growth within the
expanded market area and expanded management team. In comparing the pro forma impact of the merger, RP Financial also took into
consideration that, following the merger, Clifton’s stockholders will own approximately 24% of the common stock in Kearny and that
three directors of Clifton, including its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, will serve on the board of directors of both Kearny Bank
and Kearny following the closing of the merger.

In addition to the above analyses and other factors considered, RP Financial considered and evaluated the operating history of
Clifton, the historical trading activity and trading price of Clifton common stock, and the national, regional and local risks that could
both negatively and positively impact Clifton’s future operations on a stand-alone basis. RP Financial’s opinion and presentation to the
Clifton board of directors was one of many factors taken into consideration by the Clifton board of directors in making its
determination to approve the merger agreement. Although the foregoing summary describes the material components of the analyses
presented by RP Financial to the Clifton board of directors in anticipation of issuing the November 1, 2017 opinion, it does not purport
to be a complete description of all the analyses performed by RP Financial and is qualified by reference to the written opinion of RP
Financial set forth as Annex B, which Clifton stockholders are urged to read in its entirety.

RP Financial Background and Experience. RP Financial, as part of its financial institution valuation and financial advisory
practice, is regularly engaged in the valuation of federally-insured depository institution securities in connection with mergers and
acquisitions, initial and secondary stock offerings, and business valuations for financial institutions for other purposes. As specialists in
the valuation of securities and providing financial advisory services to insured financial institutions, RP Financial has experience in,
and knowledge of, the markets for the securities of such institutions nationwide.

Kearny’s Reasons for the Merger

Kearny’s board of directors believes that the merger is in the best interests of Kearny and its stockholders. In deciding to approve
the merger and the merger agreement, Kearny’s board of directors considered a number of factors, including:
 

 
•  Clifton’s community banking orientation, its favorable reputation within its local communities and its compatibility with

Kearny and its subsidiaries;
 

 
•  Kearny management’s review of the business, operations, earnings and financial condition, including asset quality, of

Clifton;
 

 
•  the scale, scope and strength of operations, product lines and delivery systems that could be achieved by combining Kearny

and Clifton;
 

 •  the complementary nature of the business, market areas and corporate cultures of Kearny and Clifton;
 

 •  Kearny’s historic performance in similar markets;
 

 
•  the expectation that the merger will create the opportunity for the combined company to have superior future earnings and

prospects compared to Kearny’s earnings and prospects on a stand-alone basis;
 

 
•  Kearny’s successful track record of creating stockholder value through merger and acquisition transactions, including its

proven experience in successfully integrating acquired businesses, and management’s belief that Kearny will be able to
integrate Clifton with Kearny successfully;

 

 •  the historical and current market prices of Kearny common stock and Clifton common stock;
 

 

•  the financial presentation, dated November 1, 2017, of KBW to the Kearny board of directors and the opinion, dated
November 1, 2017, of KBW to the Kearny board of directors as to the fairness, from a financial point of view and as of the
date of the opinion, to Kearny of the exchange ratio in the proposed merger, as more fully described below under “Opinion
of Kearny’s Financial Advisor;”

 

 

•  the review by Kearny’s board of directors with its management and legal advisors of the structure and other terms of the
merger and the expectation of Kearny’s legal advisors that the merger will qualify as a transaction of a type that is generally
tax-free to Clifton stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes (except with respect to cash received in lieu of
fractional shares of Kearny common stock);

 

 

•  that Kearny’s management team will remain intact following the merger and that Kearny’s board of directors will be
increased to accommodate the addition of three current members of Clifton’s board of directors, including Clifton’s
Chairman of the Board of Directors, President and Chief Executive Officer, Paul M. Aguggia, which the Kearny board of
directors believed would enhance the likelihood of realizing the strategic benefits that Kearny expects to derive from the
merger;

 

 •  that the combined company will have an attractive commercial and community banking franchise;
 

 
•  the expanded possibilities, including organic growth and future acquisitions, that would be available to the combined

company given its larger size, asset base, capital and footprint;
 

 
•  its review and discussions with Kearny’s management and certain advisors concerning Kearny’s due diligence examination

of Clifton’s business;
 

 •  Kearny’s expectation that it will achieve cost savings equal to 35% of Clifton’s current annualized non-interest expenses;
 

 •  that the transaction is expected to be accretive to its fiscal 2019 earnings per share;
 

 
•  the pro forma financial effects of the proposed transaction, including the expected dilution to tangible book value per share

and subsequent earn back of the dilution; and
 

 •  the likelihood of regulators approving the merger without burdensome conditions or delay.

Table of Contents

Kearny’s board of directors also considered a number of potential risks and uncertainties associated with the merger in connection
with its deliberation of the merger, including, without limitation, the following:
 

 
•  the potential risk of diverting management attention and resources from the operation of Kearny’s business and towards the

completion of the merger;
 

 
•  the potential risks associated with achieving anticipated cost synergies and savings and successfully integrating Clifton’s

business, operations and workforce with those of Kearny;
 

 
•  the transaction-related restructuring charges and other merger-related costs, including the payments and other benefits to be

received by Clifton management;
 

 
•  the possibility of encountering difficulties in successfully integrating Clifton’s business, operations and workforce with those

of Kearny;
 

 
•  the risk that the conditions to the parties’ obligations to complete the merger agreement may not be satisfied, including the

risk that necessary regulatory or stockholder approvals might not be obtained and, as a result, the merger may not be
consummated; and

 

 •  the other risks described in this document under the heading “Risk Factors.”

The foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by Kearny’s board of directors is not intended to be
exhaustive, but includes the material factors considered by Kearny’s board of directors. In reaching its decision to approve the merger
agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, Kearny’s board of directors did not quantify
or assign any relative weights to the factors considered, and individual directors may have given different weights to different factors.
Kearny’s board of directors considered all these factors as a whole, with the assistance of Kearny’s management and Kearny’s outside
financial and legal advisors, and overall considered the factors to be favorable to, and to support, its determination.

Recommendation of Kearny’s Board of Directors

Kearny’s board of directors has unanimously approved the merger agreement and the merger and unanimously
recommends that Kearny stockholders vote “FOR” the approval of the merger agreement and the merger.

Opinion of Kearny’s Financial Advisor

Kearny engaged Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc. to render financial advisory and investment banking services to Kearny, including
an opinion to the Kearny board of directors as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to Kearny of the exchange ratio in the
proposed merger. Kearny selected KBW because KBW is a nationally recognized investment banking firm with substantial experience
in transactions similar to the merger. As part of its investment banking business, KBW is continually engaged in the valuation of
financial services businesses and their securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions.

As part of its engagement, representatives of KBW attended the meeting of the Kearny board held on November 1, 2017 at which
the Kearny board evaluated the proposed merger. At this meeting, KBW reviewed the financial aspects of the proposed merger and
rendered an opinion to the Kearny board of directors to the effect that, as of such date and subject to the procedures followed,
assumptions made, matters considered, and qualifications and limitations on the review undertaken by KBW as set forth in such
opinion, the exchange ratio in the proposed merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to Kearny. The Kearny board approved the
merger agreement at this meeting.

The description of the opinion set forth herein is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the opinion, which is
attached as Annex C to this document and is incorporated herein by reference, and describes the procedures followed, assumptions
made, matters considered, and qualifications and limitations on the review undertaken by KBW in preparing the opinion.

Table of Contents

KBW’s opinion speaks only as of the date of the opinion. The opinion was for the information of, and was directed to, the
Kearny board (in its capacity as such) in connection with its consideration of the financial terms of the merger. The opinion
addressed only the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the exchange ratio in the merger to Kearny. It did not address the
underlying business decision of Kearny to engage in the merger or enter into the merger agreement or constitute a
recommendation to the Kearny board in connection with the merger, and it does not constitute a recommendation to any
holder of Kearny common stock or any stockholder of any other entity as to how to vote in connection with the merger or any
other matter, nor does it constitute a recommendation as to whether or not any such stockholder should enter into a voting,
stockholders’, affiliates’ or other agreement with respect to the merger or exercise any dissenters’ or appraisal rights that may
be available to such stockholder.

KBW’s opinion was reviewed and approved by KBW’s Fairness Opinion Committee in conformity with its policies and
procedures established under the requirements of Rule 5150 of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.

In connection with the opinion, KBW reviewed, analyzed and relied upon material bearing upon the financial and operating
condition of Kearny and Clifton and bearing upon the merger, including, among other things:
 

 •  a draft of the merger agreement, dated October 25, 2017 (the most recent draft then made available to KBW);
 

 
•  the audited financial statements and the Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the three fiscal years ended June 30, 2017 of

Kearny;
 

 
•  certain unaudited and preliminary financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2017 of Kearny (provided to KBW

by representatives of Kearny);
 

 
•  the audited financial statements and the Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the three fiscal years ended March 31, 2017 of

Clifton;
 

 
•  the unaudited quarterly financial statements and the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2017 of

Clifton;
 

 
•  certain unaudited and preliminary financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2017 of Clifton (provided to KBW

by representatives of Clifton);
 

 

•  certain regulatory filings of Kearny, Clifton and their respective subsidiaries, including (as applicable) the quarterly reports
on Form FRY-9C and quarterly call reports that were filed with respect to each quarter during the three year period ended
June 30, 2017 (in the case of Kearny), the three year period ended March 31, 2017 and the quarter ended June 30, 2017 (in
the case of Clifton);

 

 •  certain other interim reports and other communications of Kearny and Clifton to their respective stockholders; and
 

 
•  other financial information concerning the respective businesses and operations of Kearny and Clifton that was furnished to

KBW by Kearny and Clifton or which KBW was otherwise directed to use for purposes of its analysis.

KBW’s consideration of financial information and other factors that it deemed appropriate under the circumstances or relevant to
its analyses included, among others, the following:
 

 •  the historical and current financial position and results of operations of Kearny and Clifton;
 

 •  the assets and liabilities of Kearny and Clifton;
 

 •  the nature and terms of certain other merger transactions and business combinations in the banking industry;

Table of Contents

 
•  a comparison of certain financial and stock market information of Kearny and Clifton with similar information for certain

other companies, the securities of which were publicly traded;
 

 

•  publicly available consensus “street estimates” of Clifton (giving effect to certain adjustments thereto provided to KBW by
Kearny management), as well as assumed Clifton long-term growth rates provided to KBW by Kearny management, all of
which information was discussed with KBW by Kearny management and used and relied upon by KBW at the direction of
Kearny management and with the consent of the Kearny board;

 

 

•  publicly available consensus “street estimates” of Kearny (giving effect to certain adjustments thereto provided to KBW by
Kearny management), as well as assumed Kearny long term growth rates provided to KBW by Kearny management, all of
which information was discussed with KBW by such management and used and relied upon by KBW at the direction of
such management and with the consent of the Kearny board; and

 

 

•  estimates regarding certain pro forma financial effects of the merger on Kearny (including without limitation the cost
savings and related expenses expected to result or be derived from the merger) that were prepared by Kearny management,
provided to and discussed with KBW by such management, and used and relied upon by KBW at the direction of such
management and with the consent of the Kearny board.

KBW also performed such other studies and analyses as it considered appropriate and took into account its assessment of general
economic, market and financial conditions and its experience in other transactions, as well as its experience in securities valuation and
knowledge of the banking industry generally. KBW also participated in discussions that were held by the managements of Kearny and
Clifton regarding the past and current business operations, regulatory relations, financial condition and future prospects of their
respective companies and such other matters as KBW deemed relevant to its inquiry.

In conducting its review and arriving at its opinion, KBW relied upon and assumed the accuracy and completeness of all of the
financial and other information provided to it or that was publicly available and did not independently verify the accuracy or
completeness of any such information or assume any responsibility or liability for such verification, accuracy or completeness. KBW
relied upon the management of Kearny as to the reasonableness and achievability of the publicly available consensus “street estimates”
of Clifton and Kearny (in each case as adjusted as referred to above), the assumed long-term growth rates of Clifton and Kearny, and
the estimates regarding certain pro forma financial effects of the merger on Kearny (including, without limitation, the cost savings and
related expenses expected to result or be derived from the merger), all as referred to above, as well as the assumptions set forth in and
the bases for all such information. KBW assumed, at the direction of Kearny, that all of such information was reasonably prepared and
represented, or in the case of the publicly available consensus “street estimates” of Clifton and Kearny referred to above that such
estimates (as adjusted) were consistent with, the best currently available estimates and judgments of Kearny management, and that the
forecasts, projections and estimates reflected in such information would be realized in the amounts and in the time periods estimated.

It is understood that the portion of the foregoing financial information of Kearny and Clifton that was provided to KBW was not
prepared with the expectation of public disclosure, that all of the foregoing financial information, including the publicly available
consensus “street estimates” of Kearny and Clifton referred to above, was based on numerous variables and assumptions that are
inherently uncertain, including, without limitation, factors related to general economic and competitive conditions and that,
accordingly, actual results could vary significantly from those set forth in such information. KBW assumed, based on discussions with
Kearny management and with the consent of the Kearny board, that all such information provided a reasonable basis upon which KBW
could form its opinion and KBW expressed no view as to any such information or the assumptions or bases therefor. KBW relied on all
such information without independent verification or analysis and did not in any respect assume any responsibility or liability for the
accuracy or completeness thereof. Given

the substantial level of excess capital currently at both Clifton and Kearny and given that the publicly available consensus “street
estimates” of Clifton and Kearny (in each case as adjusted by Kearny management) and the assumed Clifton and Kearny long-term
growth rates provided to KBW by Kearny management did not reflect the impact of the expected future deployment of such excess
capital (the actual timing and amount of which deployment are subject to substantial uncertainty), KBW did not rely upon a discounted
cash flow analysis of either Clifton or Kearny.

KBW also assumed that there were no material changes in the assets, liabilities, financial condition, results of operations,
business or prospects of either Kearny or Clifton since the date of the last financial statements of each such entity that were made
available to KBW and that KBW was directed to use. KBW is not an expert in the independent verification of the adequacy of
allowances for loan and lease losses and KBW assumed, without independent verification and with Kearny’s consent, that the
aggregate allowances for loan and lease losses for each of Kearny and Clifton are adequate to cover such losses. In rendering its
opinion, KBW did not make or obtain any evaluations or appraisals or physical inspection of the property, assets or liabilities
(contingent or otherwise) of Kearny or Clifton, the collateral securing any of such assets or liabilities, or the collectability of any such
assets, nor did KBW examine any individual loan or credit files, nor did it evaluate the solvency, financial capability or fair value of
Kearny or Clifton under any state or federal laws, including those relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or other matters. Estimates of
values of companies and assets do not purport to be appraisals or necessarily reflect the prices at which companies or assets may
actually be sold. Because such estimates are inherently subject to uncertainty, KBW assumed no responsibility or liability for their
accuracy.

KBW assumed, in all respects material to its analyses, that:
 

 

•  the merger and any related transactions (including the bank subsidiary merger) would be completed substantially in
accordance with the terms set forth in the merger agreement (the final terms of which KBW assumed would not differ in any
respect material to its analyses from the draft version of the merger agreement that had been reviewed by KBW and referred
to above) with no adjustments to the exchange ratio and with no other consideration or payments in respect of Clifton
common stock;

 

 
•  the representations and warranties of each party in the merger agreement and in all related documents and instruments

referred to in the merger agreement were true and correct;
 

 
•  each party to the merger agreement or any of the related documents would perform all of the covenants and agreements

required to be performed by such party under such documents;
 

 

•  there are no factors that would delay or subject to any adverse conditions, any necessary regulatory or governmental
approval for the merger or any related transaction (including the bank subsidiary merger) and all conditions to the
completion of the merger and any such related transaction would be satisfied without any waivers or modifications to the
merger agreement or any of the related documents; and

 

 

•  in the course of obtaining the necessary regulatory, contractual, or other consents or approvals for the merger and any related
transactions (including the bank subsidiary merger), no restrictions, including any divestiture requirements, termination or
other payments or amendments or modifications, would be imposed that would have a material adverse effect on the future
results of operations or financial condition of Kearny, Clifton or the pro forma entity or the contemplated benefits of the
merger, including without limitation the cost savings and related expenses expected to result or be derived from the merger.

KBW assumed that the merger would be consummated in a manner that complied with the applicable provisions of the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and all other applicable federal and state statutes, rules
and regulations. KBW was further advised by representatives of Kearny that Kearny relied upon advice from its advisors (other than
KBW) or other appropriate sources as to all legal, financial reporting, tax, accounting and regulatory matters with respect to Kearny,
Clifton, the merger and any related transaction (including the bank subsidiary merger), and the merger agreement. KBW did not
provide advice with respect to any such matters.

KBW’s opinion addressed only the fairness, from a financial point of view, as of the date of such opinion, of the exchange ratio in
the merger to Kearny. KBW expressed no view or opinion as to any other terms or aspects of the merger or any term or aspect of any
related transaction (including the bank subsidiary merger), including without limitation, the form or structure of the merger or any such
related transaction, any consequences of the merger to Kearny, its stockholders, creditors or otherwise, or any terms, aspects, merits or
implications of any employment, retention, consulting, voting, support, cooperation, stockholder or other agreements, arrangements or
understandings contemplated or entered into in connection with the merger, any such related transaction, or otherwise. KBW’s opinion
was necessarily based upon conditions as they existed and could be evaluated on the date of such opinion and the information made
available to KBW through such date. Developments subsequent to the date of KBW’s opinion may have affected, and may affect, the
conclusion reached in KBW’s opinion and KBW did not and does not have an obligation to update, revise or reaffirm its opinion. For
purposes of its analyses, KBW did not incorporate previously publicly-announced proposed changes to United States tax laws
regarding corporate tax rates. KBW’s opinion did not address, and KBW expressed no view or opinion with respect to:
 

 •  the underlying business decision of Kearny to engage in the merger or enter into the merger agreement;
 

 
•  the relative merits of the merger as compared to any strategic alternatives that are, have been or may be available to or

contemplated by Kearny or the Kearny board;
 

 
•  any business, operational or other plans with respect to Clifton or the pro forma entity that may be currently contemplated by

Kearny or the Kearny board or that may be implemented subsequent to the closing of the merger;
 

 
•  the fairness of the amount or nature of any compensation to any of Kearny’s officers, directors or employees, or any class of

such persons, relative to any compensation to the holders of Kearny common stock or relative to the exchange ratio;
 

 
•  the effect of the merger or any related transaction (including the bank subsidiary merger) on, or the fairness of the

consideration to be received by, holders of any class of securities of Kearny, Clifton or any other party to any transaction
contemplated by the merger agreement;

 

 •  any adjustment (as provided in the merger agreement) to the exchange ratio assumed for purposes of KBW’s opinion;
 

 •  the actual value of Kearny common stock to be issued in connection with the merger;
 

 
•  the prices, trading range or volume at which Kearny common stock or Clifton common stock would trade following the

public announcement of the merger or the prices, trading range or volume at which Kearny common stock would trade
following the consummation of the merger;

 

 
•  any advice or opinions provided by any other advisor to any of the parties to the merger or any other transaction

contemplated by the merger agreement; or
 

 

•  any legal, regulatory, accounting, tax or similar matters relating to Kearny, Clifton, any of their respective stockholders, or
relating to or arising out of or as a consequence of the merger or any other related transaction (including the bank subsidiary
merger), including whether or not the merger would qualify as a tax-free reorganization for United States federal income tax
purposes.

In performing its analyses, KBW made numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance, general business, economic,
market and financial conditions and other matters, which are beyond the control of KBW, Kearny and Clifton. Any estimates contained
in the analyses performed by KBW are not necessarily indicative of actual values or future results, which may be significantly more or
less favorable than suggested by these analyses. Additionally, estimates of the value of businesses or securities do not purport to be
appraisals or to reflect the prices at which such businesses or securities might actually be sold. Accordingly, these analyses and
estimates are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty. In addition, the KBW opinion was among several factors taken into
consideration by the Kearny board in making its determination to approve the merger

agreement and the merger. Consequently, the analyses described below should not be viewed as determinative of the decision of the
Kearny board with respect to the fairness of the exchange ratio. The type and amount of consideration payable in the merger were
determined through negotiation between Kearny and Clifton and the decision of Kearny to enter into the merger agreement was solely
that of the Kearny board.

The following is a summary of the material financial analyses presented by KBW to the Kearny board in connection with its
opinion. The summary is not a complete description of the financial analyses underlying the opinion or the presentation made by KBW
to the Kearny board, but summarizes the material analyses performed and presented in connection with such opinion. The financial
analyses summarized below include information presented in tabular format. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description
of the financial analyses. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex analytic process involving various determinations as to
appropriate and relevant methods of financial analysis and the application of those methods to the particular circumstances. Therefore,
a fairness opinion is not readily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. In arriving at its opinion, KBW did not attribute
any particular weight to any analysis or factor that it considered, but rather made qualitative judgments as to the significance and
relevance of each analysis and factor. Accordingly, KBW believes that its analyses and the summary of its analyses must be considered
as a whole and that selecting portions of its analyses and factors or focusing on the information presented below in tabular format,
without considering all analyses and factors or the full narrative description of the financial analyses, including the methodologies and
assumptions underlying the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the process underlying its analyses and opinion.

For purposes of the financial analyses described below, KBW utilized an implied transaction value for the proposed merger of
$400.6 million, or $17.92 per outstanding share of Clifton common stock, based on the 1.191x exchange ratio in the proposed merger
and the closing price of Kearny common stock on October 31, 2017. In addition to the financial analyses described below, KBW
reviewed with the Kearny board of directors for informational purposes, among other things, implied transaction multiples for the
proposed merger (based on the implied transaction value for the merger of $17.92 per outstanding share of Clifton common stock) of
47.9x Clifton’s estimated earnings per share (“EPS”) corresponding to Kearny’s fiscal year ending June 30, 2018 and 41.7x Clifton’s
estimated EPS corresponding to Kearny’s fiscal year ending June 30, 2019 using publicly available EPS consensus “street estimates” of
Clifton (giving effect to certain adjustments provided by Kearny management regarding the number of diluted shares of Clifton
common stock) as well as assumed Clifton long-term growth rates provided to KBW by Kearny management.

Kearny Selected Companies Analysis. Using publicly available information, KBW compared the financial performance, financial
condition and market performance of Kearny to 11 selected banks and thrifts that were listed on NASDAQ, the New York Stock
Exchange or NYSE MKT and headquartered in the Mid-Atlantic or Northeast United States with total assets between $1.0 billion and
$10.0 billion, latest twelve months (“LTM”) core return on average assets less than 1%, and tangible common equity / tangible assets
ratio greater than 10%. Merger targets and mutual holding companies were excluded from the selected companies.

The selected companies were as follows:
 

Beneficial Bancorp, Inc.   Meridian Bancorp, Inc.
Blue Hills Bancorp, Inc.   Northfield Bancorp, Inc.
Brookline Bancorp, Inc.   PCSB Financial Corporation
Clifton Bancorp Inc.   Republic First Bancorp, Inc.
First Bank   Western New England Bancorp, Inc.
Howard Bancorp, Inc.   

To perform this analysis, KBW used profitability and other financial information for the LTM period available (which in the case
of Kearny and Clifton were the twelve months ended September 30, 2017 as provided by Kearny management and Clifton
management, respectively) or as of the end of such LTM period

and market price information as of October 31, 2017. KBW also used EPS estimates taken from consensus “street estimates” for
Kearny and the selected companies, giving effect to certain adjustments provided by Kearny management regarding the number of
diluted shares in the case of Kearny and Clifton. Where consolidated holding company level financial data for the selected companies
was unreported, subsidiary bank level data was utilized to calculate ratios. Certain financial data prepared by KBW, as referenced in the
tables presented below, may not correspond to the data presented in Kearny’s historical financial statements, or the data prepared by RP
Financial presented under the section “ — RP Financial’s Opinion to Clifton’s Board of Directors,” as a result of the different periods,
assumptions and methods used by KBW to compute the financial data presented.

KBW’s analysis showed the following concerning the financial performance of Kearny and the selected companies:
 
       Selected Companies  
   Kearny    Bottom Quartile   Average   Median   Top Quartile 
LTM Core Return on Average Assets (%)(1)    0.40    0.52    0.67    0.78    0.80

(1) Core Income excluded extraordinary items, non-recurring items, gains / (losses) on sale of securities and amortization of

intangibles as calculated by SNL Financial.

LTM Net Charge-Offs / Average Loans (%)    0.01    0.13    0.07    0.03    —   

In addition, KBW’s analysis showed the following concerning the market performance of Kearny and the selected companies
(excluding the impact of the LTM EPS multiple for one of the selected companies, which multiple was considered to be not meaningful
because it was greater than 75.0x):

on Clifton’s EPS corresponding to Kearny’s fiscal year ended June 30, 2017.

(3) Based on Kearny’s estimated EPS for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2018 (giving effect to certain adjustments provided by
Kearny management regarding the number of diluted shares of Kearny common stock). Selected companies’ multiples included
Clifton’s multiple based on Clifton’s estimated EPS corresponding to Kearny’s fiscal year ending June 30, 2018 (giving effect to
certain adjustments provided by Kearny management regarding the number of diluted shares of Clifton common stock).

(4) Dividend yield and LTM dividend payout ratio reflected LTM dividends, excluding special dividends, as a percentage of stock
price and estimated LTM EPS, respectively.

No company used as a comparison in the above selected companies analysis is identical to Kearny. Accordingly, an analysis of
these results is not mathematical. Rather, it involves complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and
operating characteristics of the companies involved.

Clifton Selected Companies Analysis. Using publicly available information, KBW compared the financial performance, financial
condition and market performance of Clifton to 15 selected banks that were listed on NASDAQ, the New York Stock Exchange or
NYSE MKT and headquartered in the Mid-Atlantic or Northeast United States with total assets between $500 million and $5.0 billion,
LTM core return on average assets less than 1%, and tangible common equity / tangible assets ratio greater than 10%. Merger targets
and mutual holding companies were excluded from the selected companies.

The selected companies were as follows:
 

Blue Hills Bancorp, Inc.   PB Bancorp, Inc.
Coastway Bancorp, Inc.   PCSB Financial Corporation
First Bank   Prudential Bancorp, Inc.
Hamilton Bancorp, Inc.   Randolph Bancorp, Inc.
Howard Bancorp, Inc.   Republic First Bancorp, Inc.
Kearny Financial Corp.   Severn Bancorp, Inc.
MSB Financial Corp.   Western New England Bancorp, Inc.
Northfield Bancorp, Inc.   

To perform this analysis, KBW used profitability and other financial information for the LTM period available (which in the case
of Clifton and Kearny were the twelve months ended September 30, 2017 as provided by Clifton management and Kearny
management, respectively) or as of the end of such LTM period and market price information as of October 31, 2017. KBW also used
EPS estimates taken from consensus “street estimates” for Clifton and the selected companies, to the extent publicly available
(consensus “street” estimates were not publicly available for six of the selected companies) and giving effect to certain adjustments
provided by Kearny management regarding the number of diluted shares in the case of Clifton and Kearny. Where consolidated holding
company level financial data for the selected companies was unreported, subsidiary bank level data was utilized to calculate ratios.
Certain financial data prepared by KBW, as referenced in the tables presented below, may not correspond to the data presented in
Clifton’s historical financial statements, or the data prepared by RP Financial presented under the section “— RP Financial’s Opinion
to Clifton’s Board of Directors,” as a result of the different periods, assumptions and methods used by KBW to compute the financial
data presented.

No company used as a comparison in the above selected companies analysis is identical to Clifton. Accordingly, an analysis of
these results is not mathematical. Rather, it involves complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and
operating characteristics of the companies involved.

For each selected transaction, KBW derived the following implied transaction statistics, in each case based on the transaction
consideration value paid for the acquired company and using financial data based on the acquired company’s then latest publicly
available financial statements prior to the announcement of the acquisition:
 

 
•  Price per common share to tangible book value per share of the acquired company (in the case of selected transactions

involving a private acquired company, this transaction statistic was calculated as total transaction consideration divided by
total tangible common equity);

 

 
•  Tangible equity premium to core deposits (total deposits less time deposits greater than $100,000) of the acquired company,

referred to as core deposit premium; and
 

 
•  Price per LTM core EPS of the acquired company (in the case of selected transactions involving a private acquired company,

this transaction statistic was calculated as total transaction consideration divided by LTM core net income).

KBW also reviewed the price per share paid for the acquired company for the 13 selected transactions in which the acquired
company was publicly traded as a premium to the closing price of the acquired company one

day prior to the announcement of the respective transaction (expressed as a percentage and referred to as the one-day market premium).
The above transaction statistics for the selected transactions were compared with the corresponding transaction statistics for the
proposed merger based on the implied transaction value for the proposed merger of $400.6 million and using historical financial
information for Clifton as of or for the 12 months ended September 30, 2017 provided by Clifton management.

The results of the analysis are set forth in the following table (excluding the impact of the LTM EPS multiple for one of the
selected transactions, which multiple was considered to be not meaningful because it was greater than 75.0x):
 
       Selected Transactions  
Transaction Price to   Kearny /Clifton   Bottom Quartile   Average   Median   Top Quartile 
Tangible Book Value (x)    1.38    1.37    1.63    1.68    1.83 
Core Deposit Premium (%)    18.70    6.00    10.70    11.70    13.90 
Core LTM EPS (x)(1)    59.70    16.50    24.50    23.10    32.40 
One Day Market Premium (%)    5.30    10.40    23.20    15.80    25.70 
 
(1) Core income excluded extraordinary items, non-recurring items, gains/losses on sale of securities and amortization of intangibles

as calculated by SNL Financial.

No company or transaction used as a comparison in the above selected transaction analysis is identical to Clifton or the proposed
merger. Accordingly, an analysis of these results is not mathematical. Rather, it involves complex considerations and judgments
concerning differences in financial and operating characteristics of the companies involved.

Relative Contribution Analysis. KBW analyzed the relative standalone contribution of Kearny and Clifton to various pro forma
balance sheet and income statement items and the pro forma market capitalization of the combined entity. This analysis did not include
purchase accounting adjustments or cost savings. To perform this analysis, KBW used (i) historical balance sheet data for Kearny and
Clifton as of September 30, 2017 provided by Kearny management and Clifton management, respectively, (ii) publicly available net
income consensus “street estimates” of Kearny and Clifton, (iii) assumed Kearny and Clifton long-term growth rates provided by
Kearny management, and (iv) market price data as of October 31, 2017. The results of KBW’s analysis are set forth in the following
table, which also compares the results of KBW’s analysis with the implied pro forma ownership percentages of Kearny and Clifton
shareholders in the combined company based on the 1.191x exchange ratio in the proposed merger:
 

   
Kearny

as a % of Total  
Clifton

as a % of Total 
Ownership    

Pro Forma Ownership    76%   24% 
Balance Sheet    

Total Assets    76%   24% 
Gross Loans Held For Investment    74%   26% 
Total Deposits    76%   24% 
Tangible Common Equity    76%   24% 

Income Statement    
Fiscal Year Ending June 30, 2018 Estimated Net Income    71%   29% 
Fiscal Year Ending June 30, 2019 Estimated Net Income    69%   31% 

Market Capitalization

Pro Forma Financial Impact Analysis. KBW performed a pro forma financial impact analysis that combined projected income
statement and balance sheet information of Kearny and Clifton. Using closing

balance sheet estimates as of March 31, 2018 for Kearny and Clifton provided by Kearny management, publicly available net income
consensus “street estimates” of Kearny and Clifton, assumed Kearny and Clifton long-term growth rates provided by Kearny
management, and pro forma assumptions (including, without limitation, the cost savings and related expenses expected to result from
the merger, certain accounting adjustments and restructuring charges) provided by Kearny management, KBW analyzed the estimated
financial impact of the merger on certain projected financial results. This analysis indicated that the merger could be accretive to
Kearny’s estimated EPS for the fiscal years ending June 30, 2019 and June 30, 2020 and dilutive to Kearny’s estimated tangible book
value per share at closing. Furthermore, the analysis indicated that, pro forma for the merger, each of Kearny’s tangible common equity
to tangible assets ratio and Leverage Ratio at closing could be lower and each of Kearny’s Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio and Total
Risk-Based Capital Ratio at closing could be higher. For all of the above analysis, the actual results achieved by Kearny following the
merger may vary from the projected results, and the variations may be material.

Miscellaneous. KBW acted as financial advisor to Kearny in connection with the proposed merger and did not act as an advisor
to or agent of any other person. As part of its investment banking business, KBW is continually engaged in the valuation of bank and
bank holding company securities in connection with acquisitions, negotiated underwritings, secondary distributions of listed and
unlisted securities, private placements and valuations for various other purposes. As specialists in the securities of banking companies,
KBW has experience in, and knowledge of, the valuation of banking enterprises. KBW and its affiliates, in the ordinary course of its
and their broker-dealer businesses (and in the case of Kearny, further to an existing sales and trading relationship with a KBW broker-
dealer affiliate), may from time to time purchase securities from, and sell securities to, Kearny and Clifton. In addition, as a market
maker in securities, KBW and its affiliates may from time to time have a long or short position in, and buy or sell, debt or equity
securities of Kearny or Clifton for its and their own accounts and for the accounts of its and their respective customers and clients.

Pursuant to the KBW engagement agreement, Kearny agreed to pay KBW a non-refundable cash fee equal to 0.67% of the
aggregate merger consideration, $500,000 of which became payable concurrently with the rendering of KBW’s opinion and the balance
of which is contingent upon the consummation of the merger. Kearny also agreed to reimburse KBW for reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses and disbursements incurred in connection with its engagement and to indemnify KBW against certain liabilities relating to or
arising out of KBW’s engagement or KBW’s role in connection therewith. Other than in connection with this present engagement, in
the two years preceding the date of KBW’s opinion, KBW has not provided investment banking and financial advisory services to
Kearny. In the two years preceding the date of KBW’s opinion, KBW has not provided investment banking and financial advisory
services to Clifton. KBW may in the future provide investment banking and financial advisory services to Kearny or Clifton and
receive compensation for such services.

Unaudited Prospective Financial Information

Neither Kearny nor Clifton as a matter of course makes public projections as to future performance, revenues, earnings or other
financial results due to, among other reasons, the inherent uncertainty of the underlying assumptions and estimates. However, Kearny
and Clifton are each including in this document certain unaudited prospective financial information that was made available by Clifton
or by Kearny in connection with the merger as described below. The inclusion of this information should not be regarded as an
indication that any of Clifton, Kearny, RP Financial or KBW, their respective representatives or any other recipient of this information
considered, or now considers, it to be necessarily predictive of actual future results, or that it should be construed as financial guidance,
and it should not be relied on as such. This information was prepared solely for internal use and is subjective in many respects. While
presented with numeric specificity, the unaudited prospective financial information reflects numerous estimates and assumptions made
with respect to business, economic, market, competition, regulatory and financial conditions and matters specific to Kearny’s and
Clifton’s business, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond each party’s control. The unaudited prospective
financial information reflects both assumptions as to certain business decisions that are

subject to change and, in many respects, subjective judgment, and thus is susceptible to multiple interpretations and periodic revisions
based on actual experience and business developments. No assurance can be given that the unaudited prospective financial information
and the underlying estimates and assumptions will be realized. In addition, since the unaudited prospective financial information covers
multiple years, such information by its nature becomes less predictive with each successive year. Actual results may differ materially
from those set forth below, and important factors that may affect actual results and cause the unaudited prospective financial
information to be inaccurate include, but are not limited to, risks and uncertainties relating to Kearny’s and Clifton’s business, industry
performance, general business and economic conditions, customer requirements, competition and adverse changes in applicable laws,
regulations or rules. For other factors that could cause actual results to differ, please see the sections entitled “Risk Factors” and
“Cautionary Statement About Forward-Looking Statements” beginning on pages 18 and 23, respectively, of this document.

The unaudited prospective financial information was not prepared with a view toward public disclosure, nor was it prepared with
a view toward compliance with generally accepted accounting principles, published guidelines of the SEC or the guidelines established
by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation and presentation of prospective financial information. In
addition, the unaudited prospective financial information requires significant estimates and assumptions that make it inherently less
comparable to the similarly titled generally accepted accounting principles measures in each party’s historical generally accepted
accounting principles financial statements. Neither Kearny’s nor Clifton’s independent registered public accounting firm, nor any other
independent accountants, have compiled, examined or performed any procedures with respect to the unaudited prospective financial
information contained in this document, nor have they expressed any opinion or any other form of assurance on such information or its
achievability.

Furthermore, the unaudited prospective financial information does not take into account any circumstances or events occurring
after the date it was prepared. No assurance can be given that, had the unaudited prospective financial information been prepared as of
the date of this document, similar estimates and assumptions would be used. Neither Kearny nor Clifton intends to, and each party
disclaims any obligation to, make publicly available any update or other revision to the unaudited prospective financial information to
reflect circumstances existing since their preparation or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events, even if any or all of the
underlying assumptions are shown to be in error, or to reflect changes in general economic or industry conditions. The unaudited
prospective financial information does not take into account the possible financial and other effects on either Clifton or Kearny, as
applicable, of the merger and does not attempt to predict or suggest future results of the combined company after giving effect to the
merger. The unaudited prospective financial information does not give effect to the merger, including the impact of negotiating or
executing the merger agreement, the expenses that may be incurred in connection with completing the merger, the potential synergies
that may be achieved by the combined company as a result of the merger, the effect on either Clifton or Kearny, as applicable, of any
business or strategic decision or action that has been or will be taken as a result of the merger agreement having been executed, or the
effect of any business or strategic decisions or actions that would likely have been taken if the merger agreement had not been
executed, but that were instead altered, accelerated, postponed or not taken in anticipation of the merger. Further, the unaudited
prospective financial information does not take into account the effect on either Clifton or Kearny, as applicable, of any possible failure
of the merger to occur. By inclusion of the unaudited prospective financial information in this document, none of Clifton, Kearny, RP
Financial, KBW or their respective affiliates, associates, officers, directors, advisors, agents or other representatives makes any
representation to any stockholder of Clifton, stockholder of Kearny or any other person regarding Clifton’s ultimate performance
compared to the information contained in the unaudited prospective financial information or that the projected results will be achieved.
The inclusion of the unaudited prospective financial information in this document should not be deemed an admission or representation
by Clifton or Kearny that it is viewed as material information, particularly in light of the inherent risks and uncertainties associated
with such forecasts. The summary of the unaudited prospective financial information included below is not being included to influence
your decision whether to vote for the merger agreement, but is being provided solely because it was made available by Clifton or by
Kearny, in connection with the merger as described below.

In light of the foregoing, and considering that the special meetings of Kearny’s and Clifton’s stockholders will be held many
months after the unaudited prospective financial information was prepared, as well as the uncertainties inherent in any forecasted
information, stockholders are cautioned not to place unwarranted reliance on such information, and Kearny and Clifton urge all
stockholders to review Kearny’s and Clifton’s financial statements and other information contained elsewhere in this document for a
description of Kearny’s and Clifton’s respective businesses and reported financial results.

In addition, for purposes of the financial analyses performed in connection with KBW’s opinion, Kearny discussed with KBW,
and KBW used (except with respect to Clifton’s fiscal quarters ended June 30, 2017 and September 30, 2017 and Kearny’s fiscal
quarter ended September 30, 2017), publicly available consensus “street estimates” of net income for Clifton and Kearny, which were
$6.8 million for Clifton’s fiscal year ending March 31, 2018, $8.9 million for Clifton’s fiscal year ending March 31, 2019, $18.2
million for Kearny’s fiscal year ending June 30, 2018 and $20.6 million for Kearny’s fiscal year ending June 30, 2019. For purposes of
these financial analysis, Kearny management also provided to and discussed with KBW an estimated annual earnings growth rate for
Clifton and Kearny of 8% per year for periods beyond June 30, 2019.

Treatment of Clifton Stock Options and Restricted Stock

At the effective time of the merger, each option to purchase shares of Clifton common stock outstanding immediately before the
effective time of the merger, whether or not vested, will be canceled and, upon Kearny’s receipt of an option surrender agreement from
the holder, exchanged for a cash payment equal to the product of (1) the number of shares of Clifton common stock subject to the stock
option multiplied by (2) the amount by which $18.25 exceeds the exercise price of such option, less applicable withholding taxes.

At the effective time of the merger, each outstanding share of restricted stock will vest and be converted into the right to receive
1.191 shares of Kearny common stock.

Table of Contents

Surrender of Stock Certificates

The conversion of Clifton common stock into the right to receive the merger consideration will occur automatically at the
effective time of the merger. As soon as practicable after the completion of the merger, but in no event later than five business days
thereafter, the exchange agent will mail to Clifton stockholders a letter of transmittal, together with instructions for the exchange of
their Clifton common stock certificates for the merger consideration. Until you surrender your Clifton stock certificates for exchange
after completion of the merger, you will not be paid dividends or other distributions declared after the merger with respect to any
Kearny common stock into which your Clifton shares have been converted. When you surrender your Clifton stock certificates
accompanied by a properly completed letter of transmittal, Kearny will pay any unpaid dividends or other distributions, without
interest, that had become payable with respect to the shares of Kearny common stock into which your Clifton shares had been
converted.

If you own shares of Clifton common stock in “street name” through a broker, bank or other nominee, you should receive or seek
instructions from the broker, bank or other nominee holding your shares concerning how to surrender your shares of Clifton common
stock in exchange for the merger consideration.

If your Clifton stock certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed, you will have to provide an affidavit claiming your Clifton
stock certificates to be lost, stolen or destroyed, and post a bond in such amount as the exchange agent may direct before you receive
any consideration for your shares.

After the completion of the merger, there will be no further transfers of Clifton common stock. Clifton stock certificates presented
for transfer after the completion of the merger will be canceled and exchanged for the merger consideration.

Accounting Treatment of the Merger

Kearny will account for the merger under the “acquisition” method of accounting according to U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles. Using the acquisition method of accounting, the assets (including identifiable intangible assets) and liabilities of
Clifton will be recorded by Kearny at their respective fair values at the time of the completion of the merger. The excess of Kearny’s
purchase price over the net fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed will then be recorded as goodwill.

Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger

General. The following discussion sets forth the material United States federal income tax consequences of the merger to U.S.
holders (as defined below) of Clifton common stock. This discussion does not address any tax consequences arising under the laws of
any state, locality, foreign jurisdiction or U.S. federal tax laws other than federal income tax law. This discussion is based upon the
Internal Revenue Code, the regulations of the United States Department of the Treasury and court and administrative rulings and
decisions in effect on the date of this document. These laws may change, possibly retroactively, and any change could affect the
continuing validity of this discussion.

For purposes of this discussion, the term “U.S. holder” means:
 

 •  a citizen or resident of the United States for U.S. federal income tax purposes;
 

 •  a corporation created or organized under the laws of the United States or any of its political subdivisions;
 

 
•  a trust that (1) is subject to the supervision of a court within the United States and the control of one or more United States

persons or (2) has a valid election in effect under applicable United States Treasury regulations to be treated as United States
person; or

 

 •  an estate that is subject to United States federal income tax on its income regardless of its source.

Table of Contents

This discussion assumes that you hold your shares of Clifton common stock as a capital asset within the meaning of Section 1221
of the Internal Revenue Code. Further, the discussion does not address all aspects of United States federal income taxation that may be
relevant to you in light of your particular circumstances or that may be applicable to you if you are subject to special treatment under
the United States federal income tax laws, including if you are:
 

 •  a financial institution;
 

 •  a tax-exempt organization;
 

 •  an S corporation or other pass-through entity;
 

 •  an insurance company;
 

 •  a mutual fund;
 

 •  a dealer in securities or foreign currencies;
 

 •  a trader in securities who elects the mark-to-market method of accounting for your securities;
 

 
•  a Clifton stockholder whose shares are qualified small business stock for purposes of Section 1202 of the Internal Revenue

Code or who may otherwise be subject to the alternative minimum tax provisions of the Internal Revenue Code;
 

 
•  a Clifton stockholder who received Clifton common stock through the exercise of employee stock options or otherwise as

compensation or through a tax-qualified retirement plan;
 

 •  a person who has a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar; or
 

 
•  a Clifton stockholder who holds Clifton common stock as part of a hedge, straddle or a constructive sale or conversion

transaction.

If a partnership (including an entity treated as a partnership for United States federal income tax purposes) holds Clifton common
stock, the tax treatment of a partner in the partnership will generally depend on the status of such partner and the activities of the
partnership.

This discussion is not intended to be tax advice to any particular holder of Clifton common stock. Tax matters regarding
the merger are complicated, and the tax consequences of the merger to you will depend on your particular situation. Clifton
stockholders are urged to consult their tax advisors as to the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger, as well as the
effects of state, local, federal non-income and non-U.S. tax laws.

It is a condition to the closing of the merger that Kearny receive the opinion of its legal counsel, Luse Gorman, PC, and Clifton
receive the opinion of its legal counsel, Kilpatrick Townsend & Stockton LLP, each dated as of the effective time of the merger,
substantially to the effect that, on the basis of facts, representations and assumptions set forth or referred to in that opinion (including
factual representations contained in certificates of officers of Kearny and Clifton), the merger will be treated for U.S. federal income
tax purposes as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. The tax opinions are not binding
on the Internal Revenue Service, or “IRS,” or any court. Kearny and Clifton have not sought and will not seek any ruling from the IRS
regarding any matters relating to the merger and, as a result, there can be no assurance that the IRS will not assert, or that a court would
not sustain, a position contrary to any of the conclusions set forth below. In addition, if any of the representations or assumptions upon
which the opinions are based are inconsistent with the actual facts, the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger could be
adversely affected.

Table of Contents

Based on the opinions that the merger will qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal
Revenue Code, the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger are as follows:
 

 
•  No gain or loss generally will be recognized by a U.S. holder of Clifton stock upon the receipt of shares of Kearny common

stock in exchange therefor pursuant to the merger (except in respect of cash received in lieu of fractional shares, as discussed
below);

 

 
•  The aggregate adjusted tax basis of the shares of Kearny common stock received by the U.S. holder in the merger will be the

same as the aggregate adjusted tax basis of shares of Clifton stock surrendered in exchange therefor, reduced by the tax basis
allocable to any fractional share of Kearny common stock for which cash is received;

 

 
•  The holding period of Kearny common stock received by a U.S. holder will include the holding period of the Clifton stock

exchanged therefor; and
 

 

•  Although no fractional shares of Kearny common stock will be issued in the merger, a U.S. holder who receives cash in lieu
of such a fractional share of Kearny common stock will generally be treated as having received the fractional share pursuant
to the merger and then having sold that fractional share of Kearny common stock for cash. As a result, a U.S. holder will
generally recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount of cash received and the portion of the holder’s
aggregate adjusted tax basis of the shares of Clifton stock surrendered that is allocable to its fractional share. Any capital
gain or loss will be long-term capital gain or loss if the holding period for the fractional share (including the holding period
of the shares of Clifton stock surrendered therefor) is more than one year. Long-term capital gains of individuals generally
are eligible for reduced rates of taxation. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.

For purposes of the above discussion of the bases and holding periods for shares of Clifton stock and Kearny common stock,
Clifton stockholders who acquired different blocks of Clifton stock at different times or at different prices must calculate their basis
and holding periods separately for each identifiable block of such stock exchanged or received in the merger.

Backup Withholding. Payments of cash (including cash in lieu of a fractional share, if any) to a U.S. holder of Clifton stock
may, under certain circumstances, be subject to information reporting and backup withholding (at a rate of 24% for 2018) unless such
holder provides proof of an applicable exemption or, in the case of backup withholding, furnishes its taxpayer identification number
and otherwise complies with the backup withholding rules. Any amounts withheld from payments to a U.S. holder of Clifton stock
under the backup withholding rules are not an additional tax and generally will be allowed as a refund or credit against such holder’s
federal income tax liability provided that the holder timely furnishes the required information to the IRS.

Reporting Requirements. U.S. holders of Clifton stock who receive Kearny common stock pursuant to the merger will be
required to retain records pertaining to the merger, and any such holder who, immediately before the merger, holds at least 5% (by vote
or value) of the outstanding Clifton stock, or securities of Clifton with a basis for federal income tax purposes of at least $1 million,
will be required to file with its U.S. federal income tax return for the year in which the merger takes place a statement setting forth
certain facts relating to the merger. U.S. holders are urged to consult with their tax advisors with respect to these and other reporting
requirements applicable to the merger.

The preceding discussion is a summary of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger to a U.S.
holder of Clifton stock does not address all potential tax consequences that apply or that may vary with, or are contingent on,
individual circumstances, and should not be construed as tax advice. Moreover, the discussion does not address any U.S. federal
non-income tax or any foreign, state or local tax consequences of the merger. Tax matters are very complicated and,
accordingly, we strongly urge you to consult with a tax advisor to determine the particular federal, state, local and foreign
income and other tax consequences to you of the merger.

Regulatory Matters Relating to the Merger

Completion of the merger is subject to the receipt of all required approvals and consents from regulatory authorities. The merger
is subject to approval by the FDIC, the NJDBI and the Federal Reserve. Kearny has filed the required applications and intends to
request a waiver for filing an application with the Federal Reserve.

Bank Merger. The bank merger whereby Clifton Savings Bank will merge with and into Kearny Bank is subject to the approval
of the FDIC under the Bank Merger Act and the NJDBI under applicable New Jersey law. In granting its approval under the Bank
Merger Act, the FDIC must consider the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the existing and resulting
institutions, the convenience and needs of the communities to be served, competitive factors, any risk to the stability of the United
States banking or financial system and the effectiveness of the institutions involved in combating money laundering activities. The
NJDBI follows criteria similar to those used by the FDIC.

Holding Company Merger. The merger of Clifton with and into Kearny, with Kearny as the surviving savings and loan holding
company, requires the approval of the Federal Reserve unless the Federal Reserve grants a waiver of the formal application process
upon request of the acquiror.

The Federal Reserve takes into consideration a number of factors when acting on applications under the Bank Merger Act and the
Home Owners Loan Act of 1934, including: (1) the financial and managerial resources and the effect of the proposed merger on these
resources (including capital and pro forma capital ratios of the combined organization, the management expertise, internal controls, and
risk management systems, especially those with respect to compliance with laws applicable to consumers and “fair lending” laws);
(2) the effect of the proposal on competition; (3) the future prospects of the existing and merged entities; (4) the convenience and needs
of the communities served; (5) any risk to the stability of the United States banking or financial system; and (6) the effectiveness of the
acquiring entity in combating money laundering activities. The Federal Reserve also reviews the records of the relevant insured
depository institutions under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1997, which we refer to in this document as the “CRA.” In
connection with such a review, the Federal Reserve will provide an opportunity for public comment on the application and is
authorized to hold a public meeting or other proceeding if it determines such meeting or other proceeding would be appropriate.

Anti-Competitive Matters. A period of 15 to 30 days must expire following approval by the FDIC before completion of the
merger is allowed, within which period the United States Department of Justice may file objections to the merger under the federal
antitrust laws. While Kearny and Clifton believe that the likelihood of objection to the merger by the Department of Justice is remote,
there can be no assurance that the Department of Justice will not initiate proceedings to block the merger, or that the Attorney General
of the State of New Jersey will not challenge the merger, or if any proceeding is instituted or challenge is made, what the result of such
challenge or proceeding would be.

The merger cannot proceed in the absence of the requisite regulatory approvals. See “—Conditions to Completing the Merger”
and “—Terminating the Merger Agreement.” There can be no assurance that the requisite regulatory approvals will be obtained, and if
obtained, there can be no assurance as to the date of any approval. There also can be no assurance that any regulatory approvals will
not contain a condition or requirement that causes the approvals to fail to satisfy one or more conditions set forth in the merger
agreement and described under “—Conditions to Completing the Merger.”

The approval of any application merely implies the satisfaction of regulatory criteria for approval, which does not include, for
example, review of the merger from the standpoint of the adequacy of the merger consideration. Furthermore, regulatory approvals do
not constitute an endorsement or recommendation with respect to the merger.

Interests of Certain Persons in the Merger that are Different from Yours

In considering the recommendation of the board of directors of Clifton to approve the merger agreement and the merger, you
should be aware that Clifton’s directors and executive officers have employment and other compensation agreements or plans that give
them financial interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of Clifton stockholders generally, which are
described below. Clifton’s board of directors was aware of these interests and considered them, among other matters, in approving the
merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

Treatment of Stock Options. The merger agreement provides that all options to purchase Clifton common stock outstanding at
the effective time of the merger, whether or not vested, will be canceled and, subject to Kearny’s receipt of an option surrender
agreement, the holder will be entitled to receive a lump sum cash payment equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Clifton
common stock subject to the Clifton stock option, multiplied by (ii) the amount by which $18.25 exceeds the exercise price of such
Clifton stock option, less required withholding taxes. If the exercise price of a Clifton stock option is greater than $18.25, then such
Clifton stock option shall be canceled without any payment made in exchange therefor.

Treatment of Restricted Stock Awards. The merger agreement provides that at the effective time of the merger, each unvested
share of restricted stock issued by Clifton and outstanding at the effective time of the merger will fully vest and convert into the right to
receive the same merger consideration that all other shares of Clifton common stock are entitled to receive in the merger.

Stock Options and Restricted Stock Awards Held by Clifton’s Executive Officers and Directors. For an estimate of the
amounts that would be payable to each of Clifton’s named executive officers on settlement of their unvested Clifton equity awards, see
“— Merger-Related Executive Compensation for Clifton’s Named Executive Officers” below. Clifton’s non-employee directors Stephen
Adzima, John H. Peto, Charles J. Pivirotto, Cynthia Sisco and Joseph C. Smith will be entitled to receive a cash payment of $300,930,
$300,930, $300,930, $0 and $300,930, respectively, in exchange for the cancellation of their outstanding stock options upon
consummation of the merger. Stephen Adzima, John H. Peto, Charles J. Pivirotto, Cynthia Sisco and Joseph C. Smith hold 17,077,
16,377, 16,377, 16,377 and 16,377 restricted stock awards, respectively, that will become fully vested at the effective time of the
merger and convert into the right to receive the same merger consideration that all other shares of Clifton common stock are entitled to
receive in the merger.

Payments Under Employment Agreements With Clifton and Clifton Savings Bank. Clifton and Clifton Savings Bank each
previously entered into separate employment agreements with Messrs. Aguggia, Hoogerhyde and Ms. Piano. The employment
agreements provide that in the event of an involuntary termination of employment without just cause (as defined in each executive’s
agreement) or voluntary termination by the executive for good reason (as defined in each executive’s agreement) following a change in
control and during the term of the agreement, the executive will receive a cash severance payment equal to the greater of (i) the
payments and benefits due for the remaining term of the employment agreement or (ii) three times the sum of: (a) the executive’s
average base salary for the five years preceding the change in control (or, if a lesser period, the executive’s actual period of
employment), (b) the average incentive or bonus compensation paid for the five years preceding the change in control (or, if a lesser
period, the executive’s actual period of employment), (c) the average income realized on the vesting of stock awards for the five years
preceding the change in control (or, if a lesser period, the executive’s actual period of employment), (d) the average of the contributions
made on an executive’s behalf to the Clifton 401(k) Plan or Clifton ESOP and supplemental plans for the five years preceding the
change in control (or, if a lesser period, the executive’s actual period of employment), and (e) the average of any other taxable income
for the five years preceding the change in control (or, if a lesser period, the executive’s actual period of employment) excluding income
realized with respect to stock options and income related to the distribution of benefits under any retirement plan. In addition, each
executive is entitled to continued participation in Clifton’s health and welfare plans, with the executive paying the employee share of
the insurance premiums, until the earlier of the executive’s death, his or her employment by another employer, or the

Table of Contents

expiration of 36 months. If Clifton ceases to offer such plans following the change in control, the executive is entitled to a payment
equal to the premiums for such benefits for the same time period. The payments to Mr. Hoogerhyde and Ms. Piano will be reduced by
the minimum amount necessary so that such payments would not result in the loss of deductibility to Clifton under Section 280G of the
Internal Revenue Code or imposition of excise taxes on the executive under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code. Mr. Aguggia’s
benefits under his employment agreements will be determined pursuant to a settlement agreement entered into concurrent with the
execution of the merger agreement, as discussed in more detail below. For an estimate of the amounts that would be payable to each of
Clifton’s named executive officers under their employment agreements, see “— Merger-Related Executive Compensation for Clifton’s
Named Executive Officers” below.

Payments Under Change in Control Agreements With Clifton Savings Bank. Clifton Savings Bank previously entered into
change in control agreements with Ms. Hrotko, Mr. Lesler and Ms. Scriveri that provide that, in the event that the executive’s
employment is terminated in connection with a change in control (as such term defined in the agreement), he or she will be entitled to
receive (i) a lump sum payment equal to two times his or her base salary as of his or her termination date and (ii) continued benefits
coverage under the Bank’s health and welfare plans for a period of twenty-four months following his or her termination of
employment. The change in control payments to Ms. Hrotko, Mr. Lesler and Ms. Scriveri will be reduced by the minimum amount
necessary so that such payments would not result in the loss of deductibility to Clifton under Section 280G of the Internal Revenue
Code or imposition of excise taxes on the executive under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code. For an estimate of the amounts
that would be payable to each of Clifton’s named executive officers under their change in control agreements, see “— Merger-Related
Executive Compensation for Clifton’s Named Executive Officers” below.

Settlement Agreement with Paul M. Aguggia. In connection with the merger agreement, Kearny, Kearny Bank, Clifton and
Clifton Savings Bank entered into a settlement agreement with Mr. Aguggia that fixed the amount of cash severance payable pursuant
to the terms of his employment agreements with Clifton and Clifton Savings Bank, subject to possible reduction so that no payments to
Mr. Aguggia would result in the loss of deductibility to Clifton under Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code or imposition of
excise taxes on Mr. Aguggia under Section 4899 of the Internal Revenue Code, and waived his right to continued insurance coverage.
For an estimate of the amount that would be payable to Mr. Aguggia under this agreement, see “— Merger-Related Executive
Compensation for Clifton’s Named Executive Officers” below.

Non-Competition Agreement With Paul M. Aguggia. In connection with the merger agreement, Kearny Bank entered into a
non-competition agreement with Mr. Aguggia, which was subsequently amended and restated to finalize the compensation payable to
Mr. Aguggia, which provides generally that Mr. Aguggia may not compete with Kearny Bank for six months following the date of the
merger and he may not solicit business, customers and employees for two years following the date of the merger. For the amount that
would be payable to Mr. Aguggia under this agreement, see “— Merger-Related Executive Compensation for Clifton’s Named
Executive Officers” below.

Payments under Amended and Restated Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan. Clifton Savings Bank maintains an
Amended and Restated Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan, in which Mr. Aguggia and Ms. Piano are the only participants. This
plan provides for a benefit if a change in control occurs prior to the complete scheduled payment of the employee stock ownership plan
(ESOP) acquisition loans. The amount of the change in control benefit is equal to the benefit the participant would have received under
the Clifton ESOP and the supplemental executive retirement plan had the participant remained employed throughout the term of the
employee stock ownership plan loan, less the benefits actually provided under the employee stock ownership plan and the
supplemental executive retirement plan on the participant’s behalf. The merger agreement provides that the Amended and Restated
Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan will be terminated at or immediately prior to the effective time of the merger and each
participant will receive a lump sum payment equal to the benefit which such participant is entitled to under the terms of the plan. For
an estimate of the amounts that would be payable to Mr. Aguggia and Ms. Piano, see “— Merger-Related Executive Compensation for
Clifton’s Named Executive Officers” below.

Table of Contents

Payments under Directors’ Retirement Plan. Clifton Savings Bank maintains the Clifton Savings Bank Directors’ Retirement
Plan to provide non-employee directors with supplemental retirement income. All current non-employee directors participate in the
plan. Upon a directors’ retirement following the completion of three years of service and the attainment of age 68, participants receive
an annual retirement benefit, payable for life, equal to a percentage of the sum of the annual fees and retainer paid during the twelve-
month period ending on the (or for a minimum of 10 years) date preceding retirement. The percentage paid as an annual benefit is
determined by multiplying the participant’s years of service (up to a maximum of 10) by 10 percent. Upon a change in control, the
benefit equals the sum of the annual fees and retainer paid to the participant during the twelve-month period preceding the date of a
termination of service due to a change in control, payable annually for the life of the participant (or for a minimum of 15 years) or, at a
director’s election, an actuarially equivalent determined lump sum payment. The merger agreement provides that the Directors’
Retirement Plan will be terminated at or immediately prior to the effective time of the merger and each participant will receive a lump
sum payment equal to their change in control benefit. Clifton’s non-employee directors Stephen Adzima, John H. Peto, Charles J.
Pivirotto, Cynthia Sisco and Joseph C. Smith, respectively, will receive an estimated cash payment of $895,428, $862,578, $852,954,
$803,940, and $883,900, respectively, upon termination of the plan, payable at the effective time of the merger. In connection with the
merger agreement, Cynthia Sisco entered into a cutback agreement which provides that payments made to her as a result of the merger,
which include payments under the Clifton Savings Bank Directors’ Retirement Plan, will be reduced, if necessary, so that such
payments would not result in the loss of deductibility to Clifton under Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code or imposition of
excise taxes on Ms. Sisco under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code.

Appointment of Three Directors to Kearny’s Board of Directors. The merger agreement provides that immediately following
the effective time of the merger, Paul M. Aguggia and two other members of Clifton’s board of directors will be appointed to Kearny’s
board of directors and that it is the intent of Kearny to appoint Paul M. Aguggia as Chairman of Kearny’s Enterprise Risk Management
Committee and as a Board liaison to Kearny’s Capital Markets Committee, effective immediately following the date of the merger.

Indemnification and Insurance of Directors and Officers. In the merger agreement, Kearny has agreed to indemnify and hold
harmless each of the current and former officers and directors of Clifton and its subsidiaries against any costs, expenses, judgments,
fines, amounts paid in settlements, damages and other liabilities incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether arising before or after the effective time of the merger, pertaining to any matter that existed or occurred at or
before the effective time of the merger to the same extent as Clifton currently provides for indemnification of its officers and directors.
Kearny has also agreed to maintain in effect for a period of six years following the effective time of the merger the directors’ and
officers’ liability insurance policy currently maintained by Clifton or to provide a policy with comparable coverage, provided that, to
obtain such insurance coverage, Kearny is not obligated to expend, in the aggregate, an amount exceeding 250% of the amount of the
annual premiums currently paid by Clifton for such insurance.

Merger-Related Executive Compensation for Clifton’s Named Executive Officers. The information set forth in the following
table is intended to comply with Item 402(t) of the SEC’s Regulation S-K, which requires disclosure of information about certain
compensation for each of Clifton’s named executive officers that is based on, or otherwise relates to, the merger (which we refer to as
“merger-related compensation”). The merger-related compensation payable to these individuals is the subject of a non-binding advisory
vote of Clifton stockholders, as described above in “Special Meeting of Clifton Stockholders — Clifton Proposal No. 2 — Non-Binding
Advisory Vote to Approve the Compensation That May Become Payable to the Named Executive Officers of Clifton in Connection with
the Merger.”

The following table sets forth the amount of payments and benefits that each of Clifton’s named executive officers would receive
in connection with the merger, assuming: (i) that the effective time of the merger was November 30, 2017, the last practicable date
prior to the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus; (ii) a per share price of Clifton common stock of $17.25, which is the average
closing price per share over the first five

business days following the announcement of the merger agreement; and (iii) each named executive officer experiences a qualifying
termination of employment on November 30, 2017. If the merger closes after September 2, 2018, then the estimated payment in
connection with a change of control listed below will change as some of the stock options and restricted stock awards will have vested
without regard to the change of control and cash payments may change because of the requirements to reduce severance under the
employment agreements and change in control agreements if an executive is initially determined to be subject to excise taxes imposed
under Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code. This table does not include the value of benefits in which the named executive
officers are vested without regard to the occurrence of a change in control. The amounts shown below are estimates based on multiple
assumptions that may or may not actually occur, and as a result, the actual amounts to be received by a named executive officer may
differ materially from the amounts shown below.

agreement, a payment in the amount of $655,000 pursuant to a non-competition agreement; and (b) for the remaining executives,
the estimated amount payable under each individual’s employment or change in control agreement, as applicable. The amounts
payable to Mr. Aguggia are considered a “single trigger” benefit since the amounts are payable upon the occurrence of the merger
without regard to termination of employment and the cash severance payable to the remaining executives are considered a
“double trigger” benefit since the severance amounts are payable upon a change in control of Clifton and termination of
employment. The cash severance payments under each individual’s employment agreements, change in control agreements and
settlement agreement, as applicable, will be reduced in order to avoid excise taxes under Section 280G of the Internal Revenue
Code; and accordingly, the above cash payments reflect a reduction for Ms. Piano and Mr. Hoogerhyde, respectively, of $775,147
and $229,787, respectively.

price of Clifton common stock of $17.25, which is the average closing market price of Clifton common stock over the five
business days following the public announcement of the merger. The amounts payable under this column are considered a “single
trigger” benefit since they are payable upon a change in control of Clifton without regard to termination of employment. Set forth

(3) Represents the estimated cash payment to be made in connection with the termination of the Clifton Savings Bank Amended and
Restated Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan. This payment is considered a “single trigger” benefit since it is payable solely
as a result of the merger.

Mr. Hoogerhyde and 24 months for Ms. Hrotko, Mr. Lesler and Ms. Scriveri, with the executive paying the employee share of the
insurance premiums.

Employee Matters

Each person who is an employee of Clifton Savings Bank as of the effective time of the merger (whose employment is not
specifically terminated as of the merger date) will become an employee of Kearny Bank and will be eligible to participate in employee
benefit plans and compensation opportunities that are substantially comparable to the employee benefit and compensation opportunities
that are generally made available to similarly situated employees of Kearny Bank; provided, however, that continuing employees will
not be eligible to participate in any frozen plans of Kearny Bank. With respect to any Kearny Bank medical, dental or vision insurance
plan, Kearny Bank will cause any preexisting condition limitations or eligibility waiting periods to be waived and credit each
continuing employee for any co-payments or deductibles incurred by such continuing employee under a Clifton health plan for the plan
year in which coverage commences under Kearny Bank’s health plan. Terminated Clifton Savings Bank employees that do not
continue as employees of Kearny Bank following the effective time of the merger, and their qualified beneficiaries, will have the right
to continued coverage in accordance with the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (“COBRA”).

Continuing employees will receive prior service credit for purposes of eligibility and vesting (but not for purposes of benefit
accrual) provided that such recognition of service will not (1) apply to the Kearny ESOP, (2) apply to paid time-off, to the extent, at
Kearny Bank’s discretion, the cash value of unused paid time-off is paid to continuing employees, or (3) operate to duplicate any
benefits with respect to the same period of service.

Each full-time employee of Clifton or Clifton Savings Bank whose employment is involuntarily terminated by Kearny (other than
for cause) or who voluntarily terminates employment for good reason within six months following the effective time of the merger and
who is not covered by a separate employment agreement, change in control agreement or other agreement that provides for the
payment of severance will, upon executing an appropriate release in the form reasonably determined by Kearny, receive a severance
payment equal to two weeks of base pay for each year of service with Clifton, with a minimum payment equal to four weeks for base
pay and a maximum payment equal to 26 weeks of base pay. Kearny will offer Clifton Savings Bank employees whose jobs are
eliminated as a result of the merger priority in applying for open positions with Kearny and Kearny Bank.

Operations of Kearny Bank after the Merger

The merger agreement provides for the merger of Clifton with and into Kearny, with Kearny as the surviving entity. Following the
merger of Clifton with and into Kearny, Kearny will merge Clifton Savings Bank with and into Kearny Bank, with Kearny Bank as the
surviving bank.

The executive officers of Kearny Bank will remain the same following the merger, and Kearny Bank will appoint Paul M.
Aguggia and two additional current Clifton directors to serve on the Kearny Bank board of directors.

Resale of Shares of Kearny Common Stock

All shares of Kearny common stock issued to Clifton’s stockholders in connection with the merger will be freely transferable.
This document does not cover any resales of the shares of Kearny common stock to be received by Clifton’s stockholders upon
completion of the merger, and no person may use this document in connection with any resale.

Table of Contents

Time of Completion

Unless the parties agree otherwise and unless the merger agreement has otherwise been terminated, the closing of the merger will
take place no later than 30 days following the date on which all of the conditions to the merger contained in the merger agreement are
satisfied or waived. See “—Conditions to Completing the Merger.” On the closing date, to merge Clifton into Kearny, Kearny will file
Articles of Merger with the Maryland State Department of Assessments and Taxation. The merger will become effective at the time
stated in the Articles of Merger.

It is currently expected that the merger will be completed late in the first quarter or early in the second quarter of 2018. However,
because completion of the merger is subject to regulatory approvals and other conditions, the parties cannot be certain of the actual
timing of the completion of the merger.

Conditions to Completing the Merger

Kearny’s and Clifton’s obligations to consummate the merger are conditioned on the following:
 

 •  approval of the merger agreement by Clifton and Kearny stockholders;
 

 •  receipt of all required regulatory approvals, consents or waivers and the expiration of all statutory waiting periods;
 

 
•  the absence of any order, decree, injunction, statute, rule or regulation that prevents the consummation of the merger or the

bank merger or that makes completion of the merger or the bank merger illegal;
 

 
•  receipt of consent of all third parties whose consent is required to consummate the merger, except where failure to obtain

such consent would not have a material adverse effect on Kearny;
 

 •  effectiveness of the registration statement of which this document is a part;
 

 
•  Kearny filing a notice with The Nasdaq Stock Market for the listing of the shares of Kearny common stock to be issued by

Kearny in the merger, and The Nasdaq Stock Market authorizing and not objecting to the listing of such shares of Kearny
common stock; and

 

 
•  receipt by Kearny and Clifton of an opinion from their respective legal counsel to the effect that the merger will be treated

for federal income tax purposes as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code.

In addition, Kearny’s obligations to consummate the merger are conditioned on the following:
 

 

•  the representations and warranties of Clifton contained in the merger agreement will be true and correct as of the closing
date of the merger (except to the extent such representations and warranties speak as of an earlier date and subject to
materiality and material adverse effect standards described in the merger agreement), and the receipt by Kearny of a written
certificate from Clifton’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer to that effect;

 

 
•  Clifton’s performance in all material respects of all of its obligations and covenants required to be performed prior to the

effective time of the merger, and Kearny’s receipt of a written certificate from Clifton’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer to that effect; and

 

 

•  None of the regulatory approvals, consents or waivers necessary to consummate the merger and the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement includes any condition or requirement that would so materially and adversely impact
the economic or business benefits to Kearny of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement that, had such
condition or requirement been known, Kearny would not, in its reasonable judgment, have entered into the merger
agreement.

In addition, Clifton’s obligations to consummate the merger are conditioned on the following:
 

 
•  the representations and warranties of Kearny contained in the merger agreement will be true and correct as of the closing

date of the merger (except to the extent such representations and warranties

speak as of an earlier date and subject to materiality and material adverse effect standards described in the merger
agreement), and Clifton’s receipt of a written certificate from Kearny’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
to that effect; and

 

 
•  Kearny’s performance in all material respects of all of its obligations and covenants required to be performed prior to the

effective time of the merger, and Clifton’s receipt of a written certificate from Clifton’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer to that effect.

Kearny and Clifton cannot guarantee that all of the conditions to the merger will be satisfied or waived by the party permitted to
do so.

Conduct of Business Before the Merger

Clifton has agreed that, until completion of the merger and unless consented to by Kearny, or to the extent required by law or
regulation of any governmental entity, neither Clifton nor its subsidiaries will:

General Business
 

 •  conduct its business other than in the regular, ordinary and usual course consistent with past practice;
 

 
•  fail to use reasonable efforts to maintain and preserve intact its business organization, properties, leases, employees and

advantageous business relationships and retain the services of its officers and key employees;

Table of Contents

An acquisition proposal is a proposal that could lead to the following transactions:
 

 
•  any merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination or other similar transaction involving Clifton or its

subsidiaries;
 

 
•  any sale, lease, exchange, mortgage, pledge, transfer or other disposition of 20% or more of the consolidated assets of

Clifton in a single transaction or series of transactions;
 

 
•  any tender offer or exchange offer for 20% or more of the outstanding shares of Clifton capital stock or the filing of a

registration statement under the Securities Act in connection therewith; and
 

 •  any transaction that is similar in form, substance or purpose to any of the foregoing transactions; or
 

 
•  any public announcement, notice or regulatory filing or a proposal, plan or intention to do any of the foregoing transactions

or any agreement to engage in any of the foregoing transactions.

Despite the agreement of Clifton not to solicit other acquisition proposals, Clifton may generally negotiate or have discussions
with, or provide information to, a third party who makes a bona fide unsolicited written acquisition proposal prior to the adoption and
approval of the merger agreement by the Clifton stockholders at the meeting to vote on the merger agreement, provided that the Clifton
board of directors determines in its good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action
would reasonably be expected to violate the directors’ fiduciary obligations to Clifton’s stockholders under applicable law and that the
acquisition proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a superior proposal. A “superior proposal” is an unsolicited, bona fide
written offer or proposal made by a third party to consummate an acquisition proposal by a third party that: (i) Clifton’s board of
directors determines in good faith, after consulting with its outside legal counsel and its financial advisor, would, if consummated,
result in a transaction that is more favorable to the stockholders of Clifton than the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement
(taking into account all factors relating to such proposed transaction deemed relevant by Clifton’s board of directors, including without
limitation, the amount and form of consideration, the timing of payment, the risk of consummation of the transaction, the financing
thereof and all other conditions thereto (including any adjustments to the terms and conditions of such transactions proposed by Kearny
in response to such acquisition proposal)); (ii) is for 100% of the outstanding shares of Clifton common stock or all or substantially all
of the assets of Clifton; and (iii) is reasonably likely to be completed on the terms proposed, in each case taking into account all legal,
financial, regulatory and other aspects of such acquisition proposal.

If Clifton receives an acquisition proposal or information request from a third party or enters into negotiations with a third party
regarding a superior proposal, Clifton must notify Kearny orally within twenty-four hours, and within three days in writing, of the
receipt of the acquisition proposal or information request and provide Kearny with information about the third party and its proposal or
information request.

Certain Other Covenants. The merger agreement also contains other agreements relating to the conduct of Kearny and Clifton
before consummation of the merger, including the following:
 

 

•  each party will promptly advise the other party of (i) any representation or warranty made by it contained in the merger
agreement becoming untrue or inaccurate in any material respect or (ii) the failure by it to comply in any material respect
with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under the
merger agreement;

 

 
•  Kearny and Clifton will provide each other reasonable access during normal business hours to its books, records, contracts,

properties, personnel, information technology systems and such other information relating to the other party as may be
reasonably requested;

 

 
•  Clifton will provide Kearny with a copy of each report filed with a governmental entity, each periodic report furnished to its

board of directors, each press release and all other information concerning its business, properties and personnel as Kearny
may reasonably request;

concludes in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal advisors) that the failure to do so would be reasonably likely
to result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable law, withdraw, modify or change its recommendation that
Clifton’s stockholders approve the merger agreement in a manner adverse to Kearny provided Clifton has not breached its
obligation not to solicit other acquisition proposals and, if the third party acquisition proposal provided Kearny with an

agreement, either Kearny or Clifton may terminate the merger agreement if, among other things, any of the following occur:
 

 
•  Clifton stockholders or Kearny stockholders do not approve the merger agreement at the Clifton special meeting or Kearny

special meeting, respectively, provided each party has complied with certain obligations pursuant to the merger agreement;
 

 
•  any required regulatory approval has been denied and such denial has become final and non-appealable, or a governmental

authority or court has issued a final, unappealable order prohibiting consummation of the transactions contemplated by the
merger agreement;

 

 
•  the merger has not been consummated by September 30, 2018, unless the failure to complete the merger by that time was

due to the failure of the party seeking to terminate the merger agreement to perform or observe the covenants and
agreements provided in the merger agreement; or

 

 

•  there is a breach by the other party of any covenant or agreement contained in the merger agreement, or any representation
or warranty of the other party becomes untrue, in each case such that the conditions to closing would not be satisfied and
such breach or untrue representation or warranty has not been or cannot be cured within 30 days after the giving of written
notice to such party of such breach.

Kearny may also terminate the merger agreement if Clifton breaches its obligations in any material respect regarding the
solicitation of other acquisition proposals or submission of the merger agreement to Clifton’s stockholders or if the Clifton board of
directors does not publicly recommend in this document that Clifton stockholders approve the merger agreement or withdraws or
revises its recommendation in a manner adverse to Kearny.

stockholders or recommending approval and adoption of the merger agreement in this document;
 

 

•  prior to adoption and approval of the merger agreement by its stockholders, to enter into an agreement with respect to a
superior proposal to be acquired by a third party, but only if Clifton’s board of directors has determined in good faith based
on the advice of legal counsel that failure to take such action would cause the Clifton board of directors to violate its
fiduciary duties and subject to other conditions described in the merger agreement; and

 

 
•  within the five day period commencing with the tenth day prior to the closing date of the merger (which we refer to as the

“determination date”), if both of the following conditions have been satisfied:
 

 

•  the average of the daily closing sale prices of a share of Kearny common stock as reported on the Nasdaq Global
Select Market for the 20 consecutive trading days immediately preceding the determination date is less than $12.42
(82.5% of the closing sale price of Kearny common stock on the last trading date before the date of the first public
announcement of the merger agreement); and

 

 •  Kearny common stock underperforms the NASDAQ Bank Index by more than 17.5% during the same period.

However, if Clifton chooses to exercise this termination right, Kearny has the option, within five business days of receipt of
notice from Clifton, to adjust the merger consideration and prevent termination under this provision.

warranty of Clifton has become untrue and such breach or untrue representation or warranty has not been or cannot be cured within 30
days following written notice to Clifton and such breach giving rise to such termination was knowing and intentional, or (ii) either
party terminates the merger agreement because Clifton’s stockholders fail to approve and adopt the merger agreement, then Clifton
must pay the termination fee if (1) an acquisition proposal was publicly announced (y) before the termination of the merger agreement
if terminated in accordance with (i) above, or (z) before Clifton’s stockholder meeting if terminated in accordance with (ii), above, and
(2) within 12 months after termination of the merger agreement, Clifton consummates or enters into an agreement with respect to an
acquisition proposal.

Expenses

Each of Kearny and Clifton will pay its own costs and expenses incurred in connection with the merger.

Changing the Terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger

Before the completion of the merger, Kearny and Clifton may agree to waive, amend or modify any provision of the merger
agreement. However, after the vote by Clifton stockholders, Kearny and Clifton can make no amendment or modification that would
reduce the amount or alter or change the kind of consideration to be received by Clifton’s stockholders or that would contravene any
provisions of the MGCL or applicable state and federal banking laws, rules and regulations.

Voting Agreements

Each of Kearny’s directors, in his or her capacity as a Kearny stockholder, has entered into a separate voting agreement with
Clifton, pursuant to which each such director has agreed to vote all shares of Kearny common stock over which he or she exercises sole
disposition and voting rights in favor of the approval of the merger agreement and the merger and certain related matters and against
alternative transactions. Under the voting agreements, Kearny’s directors may not, without the prior written consent of Clifton, transfer
any of their shares of Kearny common stock except for certain limited purposes described in the voting agreements. These voting
agreements will terminate if the merger agreement is terminated. As of the January 9, 2018, shares constituting 2.63% of the voting
power of Kearny common stock were subject to the voting agreements.

UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL DATA

The unaudited pro forma combined condensed consolidated financial information has been prepared using the acquisition method
of accounting, giving effect to the merger of Clifton with Kearny. The unaudited pro forma combined condensed consolidated balance
sheet combines the historical information of Kearny and Clifton as of September 30, 2017 and assumes that the merger was completed
on that date. The unaudited pro forma combined condensed consolidated income statements combine the historical financial
information of Kearny and Clifton and give effect to the merger as if it had been completed as of the beginning of Kearny’s fiscal year
ended June 30, 2017 and Clifton’s fiscal year ended March 31, 2017, and as of the three months ended September 30, 2017. The
unaudited pro forma combined condensed consolidated financial information is presented for illustrative purposes only and is not
necessarily indicative of the results of operations or financial condition had the merger been completed on the dates described above,
nor is it necessarily indicative of the results of operations in future periods or the future financial position of the combined entities. The
financial information should be read in conjunction with the accompanying Notes to the Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Condensed
Consolidated Financial Information. Certain reclassifications have been made to Clifton’s historical financial information to conform to
Kearny’s presentation of financial information.

The actual value of Kearny common stock to be recorded as consideration in the merger will be based on the closing price of
Kearny common stock on the date that the merger is completed. The merger is targeted for completion late in the first quarter of 2018
or early in the second quarter of 2018. For purposes of the pro forma financial information, the fair value of Kearny common stock to
be issued in connection with the merger was based on Kearny’s closing stock price of $14.50 as of December 8, 2017.

The pro forma financial information includes estimated adjustments, including adjustments to record assets and liabilities of
Clifton at their respective fair values and represents the pro forma estimates by Kearny based on available fair value information as of
the date of the merger agreement. In some cases, where noted, more recent information has been used to support estimated adjustments
in the pro forma financial information.

The pro forma adjustments included in this section are subject to change depending on changes in interest rates and the
components of assets and liabilities and as additional information becomes available and additional analyses are performed. The final
allocation of the purchase price for the merger will be determined after the merger is completed and after completion of thorough
analyses to determine the fair value of Clifton tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities as of the date the merger is
completed. Increases or decreases in the estimated fair values of the net assets as compared with the information shown in the
unaudited pro forma combined condensed consolidated financial information may change the amount of the purchase price allocated to
other assets and liabilities and the residual goodwill value, and may impact Kearny’s income statement due to adjustments in yield
and/or amortization of the adjusted assets or liabilities. Any changes to Clifton’s stockholders’ equity, including results of operations
from September 30, 2017 through the date the merger is completed, will also change the purchase price allocation, which may include
the recording of a lower or higher amount of goodwill. The final adjustments may be materially different from the unaudited pro forma
adjustments presented in this document.

Kearny anticipates that the merger will provide the combined company with financial benefits that include reduced operating
expenses. The unaudited pro forma combined condensed consolidated financial data, while helpful in illustrating the financial
characteristics of the combined company under one set of assumptions, does not reflect the benefits of expected cost savings or
opportunities to earn additional revenue and, accordingly, does not attempt to predict or suggest future results. It also does not
necessarily reflect what the historical results of the combined company would have been had our companies been combined during
these periods.

The unaudited pro forma combined condensed consolidated financial information has been derived from and should be read in
conjunction with the historical consolidated financial statements and the related notes of Kearny and Clifton, which are incorporated in
this document by reference.

* Assumes that the merger was completed as of September 30, 2017 utilizing the acquisition method of accounting. Estimated fair

value adjustments for loans, securities, core deposit intangible assets, deposits and borrowings were determined by management
of Kearny and Clifton. Actual fair value adjustments, where appropriate, will be determined as of the merger completion date.

(1) The adjustment results from the assumption that cash and cash equivalents will be used to pay for after tax one-time merger and
integration expenses of Clifton, Kearny, and the assumed cash out of all of Clifton’s in-the-money options. Clifton’s expenses are
charged against Clifton’s income statement and result in an adjustment to Kearny’s goodwill. Clifton’s one-time merger and
integration costs include $5.7 million of professional fees. Kearny’s one-time merger and integration costs include $13.5 million
of professional fees, change-in-control agreements and other merger-related expenses. The adjustment also includes $5.1 million
cash out of in the money options paid to Clifton option-holders.

(2) The pro forma statement of financial condition includes a write-down of $0.5 million to the securities portfolio.
(3) The pro forma statement of financial condition includes a fair value credit adjustment to total loans to reflect the credit condition

of Clifton’s loan portfolio in the amount of $11.5 million. The fair value credit adjustment was considered to be fully accretable.
In order to determine the adjustment related to credit

deterioration, Kearny employed a detailed due diligence process. Members of Kearny’s senior management team, loan review and
credit department functions, supported by its outside loan review firm conducted a comprehensive review of Clifton’s loan
portfolio, underwriting methodology, loan-related policies and loan portfolio management processes. Kearny will update and
finalize its analysis at closing, which may change from the initial estimate. The pro forma adjustment of $19.6 million also
includes a fair value adjustment to total loans in the amount of $8.1 million reflecting differences in interest rates, which was
based primarily on an analysis of current market interest rates, loan types, maturity dates and potential prepayments. The fair
value adjustment will be accreted through loan interest income over the estimated lives of the affected loans. The weighted
average remaining life of the loan portfolio was estimated at approximately 4.3 years.

(4) Represents the reversal of Clifton’s allowance for loan losses. Purchased loans acquired in a business combination are recorded at
fair value and the recorded allowance of the acquired company is not carried over.

(5) Kearny’s estimate of fair value of core deposit intangible is $4.2 million. The core deposit intangible was determined by applying
a 1.25% premium on Clifton’s core deposits. The core deposit intangible will be amortized into noninterest expense over a ten
year period using the sum-of-the-years digits methodology. Kearny will update and finalize its analysis at closing, which may
change from the initial estimate.

Clifton, less amounts allocated to fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The preliminary purchase

The final purchase price and resulting goodwill from the acquisition will vary based on the market price of Kearny’s common stock as
of the consummation of the transaction. Management of Kearny estimates that a 17% fluctuation in the market price of its common
stock is reasonably possible based on the average volatility of Kearny’s stock price since the closing of its second-step conversion and
stock offering on May 18, 2015, resulting in the following aggregate purchase price and estimated goodwill.
 

   Price***    Goodwill  
As presented in the pro forma combined results   $386,148   $ 110,711 
17% increase in Kearny Common stock price   $450,926   $175,489 
17% decrease in Kearny Common stock price   $321,369   $ 45,933 

 
** The tax impacts of the acquisition were estimated based on the applicable laws in effect on September 30, 2017.
*** Purchase price includes the right to receive 1.1910 of Kearny common stock for each share of Clifton common stock plus the

impact of cashing out Clifton’s in-the money options.
(7) For pro forma purposes, the carrying value of premises and equipment and related lease obligations are assumed to represent the

fair value of the underlying assets and obligations. The fair values of Clifton’s premises and equipment, including the fair value
of real property acquired, will be determined at closing, but are not expected to materially impact the financial considerations of
the transaction or its anticipated results.

(8) Adjustment in other assets resulting from the fair value adjustments related to the acquired assets and liabilities, identifiable
intangibles and other current and deferred tax items (including $5.7 million for transaction and restructuring expenses, $2.1
million for cash out of stock options, $1.7 million for credit mark and $3.9 million for interest rate marks and core deposit
intangibles). The actual deferred tax adjustment will depend on facts and circumstances existing at the time of the merger. The
fair value adjustment of the net deferred tax asset assumes a marginal effective tax rate of 40.90%. The tax impacts of the
acquisition were estimated based on the applicable laws in effect on September 30, 2017.

(9) The deposits include a fair value adjustment to time deposits in the amount of $4.8 million to reflect differences in interest rates,
which was based primarily on an analysis of current market interest rates and maturity dates. This fair value adjustment will be
accreted into interest expense on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the affected time deposits, which is 1.5
years.

(10) The borrowings include a fair value adjustment to borrowings in the amount of $0.3 million to reflect differences in interest
rates, which was based primarily on an analysis of current market interest rates and maturity dates. This fair value adjustment
will be accreted into interest expense over the estimated life of the borrowings, which is 1.5 years.

(11) Adjustment in net capital resulting from the fair value adjustments related to the acquired assets and liabilities, identifiable
intangibles, purchase price allocation, and other adjustments reflecting elimination of Clifton stock and issuance of Kearny stock
as consideration.

(12) Resultant impact to tangible common equity based upon $86.1 million of net transaction adjustments to equity reduced by a
$114.9 million increase in intangibles.

(13) Resultant impact to common shares outstanding results from the exchange ratio of 1.191 being applied to Clifton’s 22,064,768
of outstanding shares at September 30, 2017.

DESCRIPTION OF KEARNY CAPITAL STOCK

General

Under its articles of incorporation, Kearny is authorized to issue 800,000,000 shares of common stock, par value of $0.01 per
share, and 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share. As of the record date for the Kearny special meeting, there
are 79,270,460 shares of Kearny common stock issued and outstanding and no shares of Kearny preferred stock issued or outstanding.
There are no other shares of capital stock of Kearny authorized, issued or outstanding. As of the record date for the Kearny special
meeting, Kearny had outstanding stock options to purchase an aggregate of 3,528,809 shares of Kearny common stock.

Common Stock

Dividends. Kearny may pay dividends up to an amount equal to the excess of its capital surplus over payments that would be
owed upon dissolution to stockholders whose preferential rights upon dissolution are superior to those receiving the dividend, and to an
amount that would not make us insolvent, as and when declared by the board of directors. The payment of dividends by Kearny is also
subject to limitations that are imposed by law and applicable regulation, including restrictions on payments of dividends that would
reduce Kearny’s assets below the then-adjusted balance of its liquidation account. The holders of common stock of Kearny will be
entitled to receive and share equally in dividends as may be declared by the board of directors out of funds legally available therefor. If
Kearny issues shares of preferred stock, the holders thereof may have a priority over the holders of the common stock with respect to
dividends.

Voting Rights. The holders of Kearny common stock have exclusive voting rights in Kearny. They elect Kearny’s board of
directors and act on other matters as are required to be presented to them under Maryland law or as are otherwise presented to them by
the board of directors. Generally, each holder of common stock is entitled to one vote per share and does not have any right to cumulate
votes in the election of directors. Unless previously approved by a majority of Kearny’s unaffiliated directors, any person who
beneficially owns more than 10% of the then-outstanding shares of Kearny’s common stock, however, is not be entitled or permitted to
vote any shares of common stock held in excess of the 10% limit. If Kearny issues shares of preferred stock, holders of the preferred
stock may also possess voting rights. Certain matters require the approval of 80% of Kearny’s outstanding common stock.

Liquidation. In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of Kearny Bank, Kearny, as the holder of 100% of Kearny
Bank’s capital stock, would be entitled to receive all assets of Kearny Bank available for distribution, after payment or provision for
payment of all debts and liabilities of Kearny Bank, including all deposit accounts and accrued interest thereon, and after distribution
of the balance in the liquidation account to Eligible Account Holders and Supplemental Eligible Account Holders. In the event of
liquidation, dissolution or winding up of Kearny, the holders of its common stock would be entitled to receive, after payment or
provision for payment of all its debts and liabilities (including payments with respect to its liquidation account), all of the assets of
Kearny available for distribution. If preferred stock is issued, the holders thereof may have a priority over the holders of the common
stock in the event of liquidation or dissolution.

Preemptive Rights. Holders of Kearny common stock do not have pre-emptive rights with respect to any shares that may be
issued, unless such preemptive rights are approved by the Board of Directors. The common stock is not subject to redemption.

Preferred Stock

Preferred stock may be issued with preferences and designations as the board of directors may from time to time determine. The
board of directors may, without stockholder approval, issue shares of preferred stock with voting, dividend, liquidation and conversion
rights that could dilute the voting strength of the holders of the common stock and may assist management in impeding an unfriendly
takeover or attempted change in control.

Anti-Takeover Provisions

Kearny’s articles of incorporation and bylaws and the Maryland General Corporation Law contain a number of provisions relating
to corporate governance and rights of stockholders that might discourage future takeover attempts. As a result, stockholders who might
desire to participate in such transactions may not have an opportunity to do so. In addition, such provisions may also render the
removal of the board of directors or management of Kearny more difficult. The following is a general summary of the material
provisions of such anti-takeover provisions.

Directors

The board of directors is divided into three classes. The members of each class are elected for a term of three years and only one
class of directors is elected annually. Thus, it would take at least two annual elections to replace a majority of Kearny’s directors. The
bylaws establish qualifications for board members, including a residency requirement, an age restriction, restrictions on affiliations
with competitors and restrictions based upon prior legal or regulatory violations. Further, the bylaws impose notice and information
requirements in connection with the nomination by stockholders of candidates for election to the board of directors or the proposal by
stockholders of business to be acted upon at an annual meeting of stockholders. Such notice and information requirements are
applicable to all stockholder business proposals and nominations, and are in addition to any requirements under the federal securities
laws.

Evaluation of Offers

The articles of incorporation of Kearny provide that its board of directors, when evaluating a transaction that would or may
involve a change in control of Kearny (whether by purchases of its securities, merger, consolidation, share exchange, dissolution,
liquidation, sale of all or substantially all of its assets, proxy solicitation or otherwise), may, in connection with the exercise of its
business judgment in determining what is in the best interests of Kearny and its stockholders and in making any recommendation to the
stockholders, give due consideration to all relevant factors, including, but not limited to:
 

 
(i) the economic effect, both immediate and long-term, upon Kearny’s stockholders, including stockholders, if any, who do not

participate in the transaction;
 

 
(ii) the social and economic effect on the present and future employees, creditors and customers of, and others dealing with,

Kearny and its subsidiaries and on the communities in which Kearny and its subsidiaries operate or are located;
 

 
(iii) whether the proposal is acceptable based on the historical, current or projected future operating results or financial

condition of Kearny;
 

 (iv) whether a more favorable price could be obtained for Kearny’s stock or other securities in the future;
 

 
(v) the reputation and business practices of the other entity to be involved in the transaction and its management and affiliates

as they would affect the employees of Kearny and its subsidiaries;
 

 (vi) the future value of the stock or any other securities of Kearny or the other entity to be involved in the proposed transaction;
 

 (vii) any antitrust or other legal and regulatory issues that are raised by the proposal;
 

 

(viii) the business and historical, current or expected future financial condition or operating results of the other entity to be
involved in the transaction, including, but not limited to, debt service and other existing financial obligations, financial
obligations to be incurred in connection with the proposed transaction, and other likely financial obligations of the other
entity to be involved in the proposed transaction; and

 

 
(ix) the ability of Kearny to fulfill its objectives as a holding company and on the ability of its subsidiaries to fulfill their

objectives under applicable statutes and regulations.

Table of Contents

If the board of directors determines that any proposed transaction should be rejected, it may take any lawful action to defeat such
transaction.

Restrictions on Call of Special Meetings

The bylaws provide that special meetings of stockholders can be called by the president, the chairperson of the board, by a
majority vote of the total number of directors that Kearny would have, if there were no vacancies on the board of directors, or by the
secretary following a written request of stockholders entitled to cast at least a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast at the meeting.

Prohibition of Cumulative Voting

The articles of incorporation prohibit cumulative voting for the election of directors.

Limitation of Voting Rights

The articles of incorporation provide that in no event will any person who beneficially owns more than 10% of the then-
outstanding shares of common stock, be entitled or permitted to vote any of the shares of common stock held in excess of the 10%
limit; provided that such 10% limit shall not apply if a majority of the unaffiliated directors approve the acquisition of shares in excess
of the 10% limit prior to such acquisition.

Restrictions on Removing Directors from Office

The articles of incorporation provide that directors may be removed only for cause, and only by the affirmative vote of the holders
of at least 80% of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding capital stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors
(after giving effect to the limitation on voting rights discussed above in “—Limitation of Voting Rights”), voting together as a single
class.

Authorized but Unissued Shares

Kearny has authorized but unissued shares of common and preferred stock. See “Description of Kearny Capital Stock.” Kearny is
authorized to issue preferred stock from time to time in one or more series subject to applicable provisions of law, and the board of
directors is authorized to fix the preferences, conversion and other rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to dividends,
qualifications and terms and conditions of redemption of such shares. In addition, the articles of incorporation provide that a majority
of the whole board may, without action by the stockholders, amend the articles of incorporation to increase or decrease the aggregate
number of shares of stock of any class or series that Kearny has the authority to issue. In the event of a proposed merger, tender offer or
other attempt to gain control of Kearny that the board of directors does not approve, it would be possible for the board of directors to
authorize the issuance of a series of preferred stock with rights and preferences that would impede the completion of the transaction.
An effect of the possible issuance of preferred stock therefore may be to deter a future attempt to gain control of Kearny. The board of
directors has no present plan or understanding to issue any preferred stock.

Amendments to Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws

Except as provided under “— Authorized but Unissued Shares,” above, Kearny’s articles of incorporation may be amended, upon
the submission of an amendment by the board of directors to a vote of the stockholders, by the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of
the outstanding shares of common stock, or by the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock if at least
two-thirds of the members of the whole board of directors approves such amendment; provided, however, that approval by at least 80%
of the outstanding voting stock is generally required to amend the following provisions:
 

 
(i) the limitation on voting rights of persons who directly or indirectly beneficially own more than 10% of the outstanding

shares of common stock;

 (xiv) the advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations; and
 

 (xv) the provision of the articles of incorporation regarding the amendment of the articles of incorporation.

The articles of incorporation also provide that the bylaws may be amended by the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors or
by the stockholders by the affirmative vote of at least 80% of the total votes eligible to be voted at a duly constituted meeting of
stockholders.

Business Combinations with Interested Stockholders

Under Maryland law, “business combinations” between Kearny and an interested stockholder or an affiliate of an interested
stockholder are prohibited for five years after the most recent date on which the interested stockholder becomes an interested
stockholder. These business combinations include a merger, consolidation, statutory share exchange or, in circumstances specified in
the statute, certain transfers of assets, certain stock issuances and transfers, liquidation plans and reclassifications involving interested
stockholders and their affiliates or issuance or reclassification of equity securities. Maryland law defines an interested stockholder as:
(i) any person who beneficially owns 10% or more of the voting power of Kearny’s voting stock after the date on which Kearny had
100 or more beneficial owners of its stock; or (ii) an affiliate or associate of Kearny at any time after the date on which Kearny had 100
or more beneficial owners of its stock who, within the two-year period prior to the date in question, was the beneficial owner of 10% or
more of the voting power of the then-outstanding voting stock of Kearny. A person is not an interested stockholder under the statute if
the board of directors approved in advance the transaction by which the person otherwise would have become an interested
stockholder. However, in approving a transaction, the board of directors may provide that its approval is subject to compliance, at or
after the time of approval, with any terms and conditions determined by the board.

After the five-year prohibition, any business combination between Kearny and an interested stockholder generally must be
recommended by the board of directors of Kearny and approved by the affirmative vote of at least: (i) 80% of the votes entitled to be
cast by holders of outstanding shares of voting stock of Kearny, and (ii) two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of voting
stock of Kearny other than shares held by the

previously paid by the interested stockholder for its shares.

Required Vote for Authorization of Certain Actions
Kearny    Clifton

•

  

Under Maryland law, certain business combinations involving
an interested stockholder or any affiliate of an interested
stockholder are prohibited for five years after the interested
stockholder becomes an interested stockholder. However, a
person is not an interested stockholder under the statute if the
board of directors approved in advance the transaction by
which the person otherwise would have become an interested
stockholder. In approving a transaction, the board of directors
may provide that its approval is subject to compliance, at or
after the time of approval, with any terms and conditions
determined by the board. After the five-year prohibition, any
business combination between Kearny and an interested
stockholder generally must be recommended by the board of
directors of Kearny and approved by the affirmative vote of at
least: (i) 80% of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of
outstanding shares of voting stock of Kearny, and
(ii) two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of
voting stock of Kearny other than shares held by the interested
stockholder with whom or with whose affiliate the business
combination is to be effected or held by an affiliate or
associate of the interested stockholder. These super-majority
vote requirements do not apply if Kearny’s common
stockholders receive a minimum price, as defined under
Maryland law, for their shares in the form of cash or other
consideration in the same form as previously paid by the
interested stockholder for its shares.   

•

  

As a Maryland corporation, Clifton is subject to the same
provisions under Maryland law regarding certain business
combinations involving an interested stockholder or any
affiliate of an interested stockholder.

savings equal to approximately 35% of Clifton’s current annualized non-interest expenses (excluding one-time non-recurring costs in
2017 identified by Clifton) through the elimination of redundant senior and executive management and other operating efficiencies

ended March 31, 2017 and management’s assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of March 31,
2017 incorporated by reference in this document have been so incorporated in reliance on the reports of BDO USA, LLP, an

STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS AND NOMINATIONS

Clifton intends to hold an annual meeting during the year ending March 31, 2018 only if the merger is not completed.

Clifton must receive proposals that stockholders seek to include in the proxy statement for Clifton’s next annual meeting no later
than March 1, 2018. If next year’s annual meeting is held on a date more than 30 calendar days from August 9, 2018, a stockholder
proposal must be received by a reasonable time before Clifton begins to print and mail its proxy solicitation material for such annual
meeting. Any stockholder proposals will be subject to the requirements of the proxy rules adopted by the SEC.

Clifton’s Bylaws provide that a person may not be nominated for election as a director of Clifton unless that person is nominated
by or at the direction of Clifton’s Board of Directors or by a stockholder who has given appropriate notice to Clifton before the
meeting. Similarly, a stockholder may not bring business before an annual meeting unless the stockholder has given Clifton appropriate
notice of their intention to bring that business before the meeting. Clifton’s secretary must receive notice of the nomination or proposal
not less than 90 days before the annual meeting; provided, however, that if less than 100 days’ notice of prior public disclosure of the
date of the meeting is given or made to the stockholders, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be received not later than the
close of business on the 10th day following the day on which such notice of the date of the annual meeting was mailed or such public
disclosure was made. A stockholder who desires to raise new business must provide certain information to Clifton concerning the
nature of the new business, the stockholder, the stockholder’s ownership in Clifton and the stockholder’s interest in the business matter.
Similarly, a stockholder wishing to nominate any person for election as a director must provide Clifton with certain information
concerning the nominee and the proposing stockholder. A copy of Clifton’s Bylaws may be obtained from Clifton.

Kearny’s 2018 annual meeting of stockholders is expected to be held on October 25, 2018. Advance written notice for certain
business, or nominations to the Board of Directors, to be brought before the next Kearny annual meeting must be provided to Kearny
no earlier than June 28, 2018 and no later than July 8, 2018. If notice is received before June 28, 2018 or later than July 8, 2018, it will
be considered untimely, and Kearny will not be required to present the matter at the stockholders meeting.

To be eligible for inclusion in the proxy materials for next year’s annual meeting of Kearny stockholders, any stockholder
proposal under SEC Rule 14a-8 to take action at such meeting must be received at Kearny’s executive office at 120 Passaic Avenue,
Fairfield, New Jersey 07004 no later than May 16, 2018. Any such proposals shall be subject to the requirements of the proxy rules
adopted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

The Bylaws of Kearny also provide an advance notice procedure for certain business, or nominations to the Board of Directors, to
be brought before an annual meeting of stockholders. In order for a stockholder to properly bring business before an annual meeting,
the stockholder must give written notice to the Secretary of Kearny not less than 110 days nor more than 120 days prior to the
anniversary of the prior year’s annual meeting of stockholders; provided, however, that if the date of the annual meeting is advanced
more than 30 days prior to the anniversary of the preceding year’s annual meeting, a stockholder’s written notice shall be timely only if
delivered or mailed to and received by the Secretary of Kearny at the principal executive office of the corporation no earlier than the
day on which public disclosure of the date of such annual meeting is first made and no later than the tenth day following the day on
which public disclosure of the date of such annual meeting is first made.

Purchaser (the “Merger”) at the Effective Time. At the Effective Time, the separate corporate existence of the Company shall cease.
Purchaser shall be the surviving corporation (hereinafter sometimes referred to in such capacity as the “Surviving Corporation”) in
the Merger and shall continue to be governed by the Maryland General Corporation Law (the “MGCL”) and its name and separate
corporate existence, with all of its rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises, shall continue unaffected by the Merger.

2.2 Closing. The closing of the Merger (the “Closing”) will take place by the electronic (PDF), facsimile or overnight courier
exchange of executed documents or at a location and at a time as agreed to by the parties hereto on the date designated by Purchaser
within thirty (30) days following satisfaction or waiver (subject to applicable law) of the conditions to Closing set forth in Article VI
(other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing), or such later date as the parties may otherwise agree
(the “Closing Date”).

2.3 Effective Time. In connection with the Closing, Purchaser and the Company shall duly execute and deliver Articles of
Merger (the “Articles of Merger”) to the Maryland Department for filing pursuant to the MGCL. The Merger shall become effective at
such time as the Articles of Merger are duly filed with the Maryland Department or at such later date or time as Purchaser and the
Company agree and specify in the Articles of Merger (the date and time the Merger becomes effective being the “Effective Time”).

2.4 Effects of the Merger. The Merger will have the effects set forth in this Agreement and in the MGCL. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, from and after the Effective Time, Purchaser shall possess all of the properties, rights,
privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and be subject to all of the debts, liabilities and obligations of the Company.

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, no fraction of a share of Purchaser Common Stock and no
certificates or scrip therefor will be issued in the Merger; instead, Purchaser shall pay to each holder of Company Common Stock who
would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a share of Purchaser Common Stock an amount in cash, rounded to the nearest cent,

paid, the Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted appropriately to provide the holders of Company Common Stock the same economic effect
as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.

payment shall be made with respect thereto. All shares of Purchaser Common Stock that are held by the Company, if any, other than

but unissued shares.

2.6 Exchange Procedures.

(a) At or prior to the Effective Time, Purchaser shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with Computershare, Inc. (the
“Exchange Agent”), pursuant to an agreement entered into prior to the Closing, for the benefit of the holders of record of shares of
Company Common Stock converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, for exchange in accordance with this
Section 2.6, (i) the number of shares of Purchaser Common Stock sufficient to deliver the aggregate Merger Consideration and (ii) any
cash payable in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.5(b), and Parent shall instruct the Exchange Agent to timely deliver the
Merger Consideration. Appropriate transmittal materials (“Letter of Transmittal”) in a form satisfactory to Purchaser and the
Company shall be mailed as soon as practicable (but not later than five (5) Business Days) after the Effective Time to each holder of
record of Company Common Stock. A Letter of Transmittal will be deemed properly completed only if the completed Letter of
Transmittal is accompanied by one or more Certificates representing Company Common Stock (or customary affidavits and, if required
by Purchaser pursuant to Section 2.6(i), indemnification regarding the loss or destruction of such Certificates or the guaranteed delivery
of such Certificates) representing all shares of Company Common Stock to be converted thereby.

(b) At and after the Effective Time, each Certificate shall represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration. The
Company shall provide to the Exchange Agent all information reasonably necessary for it to perform its obligations as specified herein.

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, Purchaser shall (i) reserve for issuance with its transfer agent and registrar a sufficient
number of shares of Purchaser Common Stock to provide for payment of the aggregate Merger Consideration and (ii) deposit, or cause

pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent, (ii) be in a form and contain any other provisions as Purchaser may
reasonably determine and (iii) include instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger
Consideration. Upon the proper surrender of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent, together with a properly completed and duly
executed Letter of Transmittal, the holder of such Certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a certificate, or, at the
election of Purchaser, a statement reflecting shares issued in book entry form, representing that number of whole shares of Purchaser
Common Stock that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.5(a) and a check in the amount equal to any cash in lieu
of fractional shares such holder is entitled to pursuant to Section 2.5(b) and any dividends or other distributions to which such holder is
entitled. Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. As soon as practicable (but not later than five (5) Business Days)

dividends or other distributions paid or distributed with respect to such shares for the account of the Persons entitled thereto. If there is
a transfer of ownership of any shares of Company Common Stock not registered in the transfer records of the Company, the Merger
Consideration shall be issued to the transferee thereof if the Certificates representing such Company Common Stock are presented to
the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required, in the reasonable judgment of Purchaser and the Exchange Agent, to
evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid.

(e) No dividends or other distributions declared or made after the Effective Time with respect to Purchaser Common Stock

the Effective Time had become payable but not paid with respect to shares of Purchaser Common Stock represented by such Person’s
Certificates.

(f) The stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed immediately upon the Effective Time and from and after the
Effective Time there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer records of the Company of any shares of Company Common Stock. If,

dividends or other distributions to be paid pursuant to this Section 2.6 or any proceeds from any investments thereof that remains

to Purchaser upon the written request of Purchaser. After such request is made, each holder of Company Common Stock who has not
theretofore complied with this Section 2.6 shall look only to Purchaser for the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect of each
share of Company Common Stock such stockholder holds, as determined pursuant to Section 2.5 of this Agreement, without any
interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Exchange Agent nor any party to this Agreement (or any Affiliate thereof)

abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.

(h) Purchaser and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to rely upon the Company’s stock transfer books to establish the

under the laws of the State of Maryland and is registered with the Federal Reserve as a savings and loan holding company. The
Company has all requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to conduct the business currently
being conducted by it. The Company is duly qualified or licensed as a foreign corporation to transact business and is in good standing
in each jurisdiction in which the character of the properties owned or leased by it or the nature of the business conducted by it makes
such qualification or licensing necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified or licensed and in good standing would not have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company. The Company engages only in activities, and holds properties only of the types, permitted to
savings and loan holding companies by the HOLA, and the rules, regulations and interpretations promulgated thereunder.

(b) Subsidiaries.

(i) The Company’s Disclosure Letter sets forth with respect to each of the Company’s direct and indirect Subsidiaries
its name, its jurisdiction of incorporation, the Company’s percentage ownership, the number of shares of stock or other equity interests
owned or controlled by the Company and the name and number of shares held by any other person who owns any stock of the

Subsidiaries is in compliance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations relating to equity investments by savings and loan holding
companies or federally chartered savings banks.

(ii) Each of the Company’s Subsidiaries is a corporation duly organized and validly existing under the laws of its
jurisdiction of incorporation, has all requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to conduct the
business currently being conducted by it and is duly qualified or licensed as a foreign corporation to transact business and is in good
standing in each jurisdiction in which the character of the properties owned or leased by it or the nature of the business conducted by it
makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified or licensed and in good standing would not
have a Material Adverse Effect.

(iii) The outstanding shares of capital stock of each Subsidiary have been validly authorized and are validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable. No shares of capital stock of any Subsidiary of the Company are or may be required to be issued by

or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the Company’s internal controls over
financial reporting.

CRA. Purchaser does not have Knowledge of any facts or circumstances that would cause Kearny Bank or any other Subsidiary of
Purchaser: (i) to be deemed not to be in satisfactory compliance in any material respect with the CRA, and the regulations promulgated
thereunder, or to be assigned a rating for CRA purposes by federal bank regulators of lower than “Satisfactory”; or (ii) to be deemed to
be operating in violation in any material respect of the Bank Secrecy Act, the USA PATRIOT Act, any order issued with respect to
anti-money laundering by the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, or any other applicable anti-money
laundering statute, rule or regulation; or (iii) to be deemed not to be in satisfactory compliance in any material respect with the
applicable privacy of customer information requirements contained in any federal and state privacy laws and regulations, including
without limitation, in Title V of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 and the regulations promulgated thereunder, as well as the
provisions of the information security program adopted by Kearny Bank. To the Knowledge of Purchaser, no non-public customer
information has been disclosed to or accessed by an unauthorized third party in a manner that would cause either Purchaser or any of
its Subsidiaries to undertake any remedial action. The Board of Directors of Kearny Bank (or where appropriate of any other
Subsidiary of Purchaser) has adopted, and Kearny Bank (or such other Subsidiary of Purchaser) has implemented, an anti-money
laundering program that contains adequate and appropriate customer identification verification procedures that comply with
Section 326 of the USA PATRIOT Act and such anti-money laundering program meets the requirements in all material respects of
Section 352 of the USA PATRIOT Act and the regulations thereunder, and Kearny Bank (or such other Subsidiary of Purchaser) has
complied in all material respects with any requirements to file reports and other necessary documents as required by the USA
PATRIOT Act and the regulations thereunder.

(x) Internal Controls. Purchaser and its Subsidiaries have devised and maintain a system of internal control over financial
reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act sufficient to provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP and to provide
reasonable assurances that (i) transactions are executed in accordance with management’s general or specific authorizations,
(ii) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP and to maintain
accountability for assets, and (iii) access to assets is permitted only in accordance with management’s general or specific authorization.
There are no significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls over financial reporting that
are reasonably likely to adversely affect in any material respect Purchaser’s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
information. To the Knowledge of Purchaser, there has occurred no fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in Purchaser’s internal controls over financial reporting.

been or will be confirmed by a written opinion, dated the same date) of Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc. to the effect that, as of the date

from a financial point of view, to Purchaser.

5.8 Stockholder Meetings.

(a) Purchaser and the Company will each submit to its respective stockholders this Agreement and any other matters
required to be approved or adopted by stockholders to carry out the intentions of this Agreement. In furtherance of that obligation,
Purchaser and the Company each will take, in accordance with applicable law and its Articles of Incorporation and bylaws, all action
necessary to call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders (the meeting of the stockholders of the Company
referred to herein as the “Company Stockholder Meeting” and the meeting of the stockholders of Purchaser referred to herein as the

so would be reasonably likely to result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable law, withdraw, modify or change its
recommendation that the stockholders of the Company approve this Agreement in a manner adverse to Purchaser (a “Change of
Recommendation”); provided that prior to any such Change of Recommendation, the Company shall have complied in all material
respects with Section 5.1, given Purchaser written notice promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours) advising it of the
decision of the Company’s Board of Directors to take such action and, if the decision relates to an Acquisition Proposal, given
Purchaser the material terms and conditions of the Acquisition Proposal or inquiry, including the identity of the Person making any
such Acquisition Proposal; and provided, further, that if the decision relates to an Acquisition Proposal: (i) the Company shall have
given Purchaser three (3) Business Days after delivery of such notice to Purchaser to propose revisions to the terms of this Agreement
(or make another proposal) and if Purchaser proposes to revise the terms of this Agreement, the Company shall have negotiated in
good faith with Purchaser with respect to such proposed revisions or other proposal; and (ii) the Company’s Board of Directors shall
have determined in good faith, after considering the results of such negotiations and giving effect to any proposals, amendments or
modifications made or agreed to by Purchaser, if any, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal. If the Company’s
Board of Directors does not make the determination that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and thereafter
determines not to withdraw, modify or change its recommendation that the stockholders of the Company approve this Agreement in
connection with a new Acquisition Proposal, the procedures referred to above shall apply anew and shall also apply to any subsequent
withdrawal, amendment or change. In the event of any material revisions to the Acquisition Proposal that result in terms that are less
favorable to the Company, the Company shall be required to deliver a new written notice to Purchaser and to again comply with the
requirements of this Section 5.8(b) with respect to such new written notice, except that the three (3) Business Day period referred to
above shall be reduced to two (2) Business Days. In addition to the foregoing, the Company shall not submit to the vote of its

meeting and shall also constitute the prospectus relating to the shares of Purchaser Common Stock to be issued in the Merger (such
proxy statement/prospectus, and any amendments or supplements thereto, the “Joint Proxy Statement-Prospectus”). The Company
will furnish to Purchaser the information required to be included in the Registration Statement with respect to its business and affairs
and shall have the right to review and consult with Purchaser and approve the form of, and any characterizations of such information
included in, the Registration Statement prior to its being filed with the SEC. Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to have the
Registration Statement declared effective by the SEC and to keep the Registration Statement effective as long as is necessary to
consummate the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby. Purchaser and the Company each will use reasonable best efforts to
cause the Joint Proxy Statement-Prospectus to be mailed to its respective stockholders as promptly as practicable after the Registration
Statement is declared effective under the Securities Act. Purchaser will advise the Company, promptly after it receives notice thereof,
of the time when the Registration Statement has become effective, the issuance of any stop order, the suspension of the qualification of
Purchaser Common Stock issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or any request by the SEC for
amendment of the Joint Proxy Statement-Prospectus or the Registration Statement. If at any time prior to the Effective Time any
information relating to Purchaser or the Company, or any of their respective Affiliates, officers or directors, should be discovered by
Purchaser or the Company that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to any of the Registration Statement or the Joint
Proxy Statement-Prospectus so that any of such documents would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the

regulations, an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed by Purchaser with the SEC
and disseminated by the Company to the stockholders of the Company.

Merger and each of the Company and Purchaser shall furnish all information concerning it and the holders of Company Common Stock
as may be reasonably requested in connection with any such action.

Common Stock to be issued by Purchaser in exchange for the shares of Company Common Stock.

5.10 Notification of Certain Matters. Each party shall give prompt notice to the other of: (i) any event or notice of, or other
communication relating to, a default or event that, with notice or lapse of time or both, would become a default, received by it or any of
its Subsidiaries subsequent to the date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time, under any contract material to the financial
condition, properties, businesses or results of operations of each party and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole to which each party or any
Subsidiary is a party or is subject; and (ii) any event, condition, change or occurrence that individually or in the aggregate has, or that,
so far as reasonably can be foreseen at the time of its occurrence, is reasonably likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect. Each of the
Company and Purchaser shall give prompt notice to the other party of any notice or other communication from any third party alleging
that the consent of such third party is or may be required in connection with any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

5.11 Employee Benefit Matters.

(a) Purchaser shall honor the Company Benefit Plans set forth in the Company’s Disclosure Letter in accordance with the
terms of such Company Benefit Plans, except to the extent an alternative treatment is set forth in this Section 5.11 or in Sections 2.10 or
2.11 of this Agreement. Following the Effective Time, Purchaser shall maintain or cause to be maintained employee benefit plans and
compensation opportunities for the benefit of all Persons who are employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to
the Effective Time and whose employment is not specifically terminated at or prior to the Effective Time (a “Continuing Employee”)
that, in the aggregate are substantially comparable to the employee benefit and compensation

opportunities that are generally made available to similarly situated employees of Purchaser or its Subsidiaries; provided, however, in
no event shall any Continuing Employee be eligible to participate in any frozen plan of Purchaser or its Subsidiaries.

(b) At the sole discretion of Purchaser, Purchaser may maintain the Company’s health and welfare plans through the end of
the calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Purchaser determines to terminate one or more
of Company’s health and/or welfare plans, then at the request of Purchaser made at least thirty (30) days prior to the Effective Time,
the Company shall adopt resolutions, to the extent required, providing that one or more of the Company’s health and welfare plans
(excluding any plans that are mutually agreed to in writing between the parties) will be terminated effective immediately prior to the
Effective Time (or such later date as requested by Purchaser in writing or as may be required to comply with any applicable advance
notice or other requirements contained in such plans) and shall arrange for termination of all corresponding insurance policies, service
agreements and related arrangements effective on the same date to the extent not prohibited by the terms of such arrangements.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no coverage of any of the Continuing Employees or their dependents shall terminate under any of the
Company’s health and welfare plans prior to the time such Continuing Employees or their dependents, as applicable, become eligible to
participate in the health plans, programs and benefits common to all employees of Purchaser and its Subsidiaries and their dependents
and, consequently, no Continuing Employee shall experience a gap in coverage. Continuing Employees who become covered under
health plans, programs and benefits of Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries shall receive credit for any co-payments and deductibles
paid under the Company’s health plan for the plan year in which coverage commences under Purchaser’s health plan and shall not be
subject to any pre-existing conditions under any such plans. Terminated Company employees and qualified beneficiaries will have the
right to continued coverage under group health plans of Purchaser in accordance with COBRA.

(c) Purchaser shall cause each Purchaser Benefit Plan in which Continuing Employees are eligible to participate to take into
account for purposes of eligibility and vesting under the Purchaser Benefit Plans (but not for purposes of benefit accrual) the service of
such employees with Company to the same extent as such service was credited for such purpose by Company; provided, however, that
such service shall not be recognized: (i) under the Purchaser’s ESOP, (ii) to the extent that such recognition would result in a
duplication of benefits under any of the Purchaser Benefit Plans, or (iii) to the extent, at the sole discretion of Purchaser, the cash value
of unused paid time-off is paid to Continuing Employees at the Effective Time. The value of each Company employee’s unused paid
time-off is set forth in the Company’s Disclosure Letter. This Agreement shall not be construed to limit the ability of Purchaser to
terminate the employment of any Company employee or to review any employee benefit plan or program from time to time and to
make such changes (including terminating any such plan or program) as Purchaser deems appropriate.

(d) The Company shall take all necessary and appropriate actions to cause the Company 401(k) Plan to be frozen as to future
contributions effective immediately prior to the Effective Time and Purchaser shall take all necessary and appropriate actions to allow
the Continuing Employees to participate in Purchaser’s 401(k) Plan on the first day immediately following the Effective Time. If
requested in writing by Purchaser no later than thirty (30) days prior to Closing, the Company will also take all necessary steps to
terminate the Company 401(k) Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time, subject to the occurrence of the Effective Time, and if
further requested, shall prepare and submit a request to the IRS for a favorable determination letter on termination. If Purchaser
requests that the Company apply for a favorable determination letter, then prior to the Effective Time, Company shall take all such
actions as are necessary (determined in consultation with Purchaser) to submit the application for favorable determination letter in
advance of the Effective Time, and following the Effective Time, Purchaser shall use its best efforts in good faith to obtain such
favorable determination letter as promptly as possible (including, but not limited to, making such changes to the Company 401(k) Plan
as may be required by the IRS as a condition to its issuance of a favorable determination letter). Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company, and following the Effective Time, Purchaser, will adopt such amendments to the Company 401(k) Plan to effect the
provisions of this Section 5.11(d). In the event Purchaser requests the Company to submit an application to the IRS for a determination
letter, Company 401(k) Plan participants who are terminated at or after the Closing, but

prior to the receipt of the IRS determination letter, may elect to receive a distribution from the Company 401(k) Plan upon termination
of their employment. Purchaser shall take any and all actions as may be required to permit Continuing Employees to roll over their
account balances in the Company’s 401(k) Plan into Purchaser’s 401(k) Plan.

(e) Purchaser agrees that each full-time Company employee who is involuntarily terminated by Purchaser (other than for
“Cause” as determined by Purchaser) or who voluntarily terminates employment for “Good Reason” (as defined below) within six
months following the Effective Time and who is not covered by a separate severance, change in control or employment agreement
shall, upon executing an appropriate release in the form reasonably determined by Purchaser, receive a severance payment equal to two
weeks of base pay (at the rate in effect on the termination date) for each year of service at the Company, with a minimum equal to four
weeks of base pay and a maximum equal to twenty-six (26) weeks of base pay. For purposes of calculating the number of years of
service, fractional years of service shall be rounded up or down to the nearest full year. For purposes of calculating base pay, Company
employees who are paid on an hourly basis shall be deemed to have a base pay equal to the employee’s average weekly compensation
over the two months prior to the termination date; provided that, in no event shall an employee’s base pay for this purpose be less than
the employee’s base pay with the Company as in effect immediately prior to Closing. For employees whose compensation is
determined in whole or in part on the basis of commission income, “base pay” shall include base salary or total hourly wages paid plus
commissions earned during the most recent twelve (12) months ended as of the date of termination of employment. Purchaser will offer
Clifton Savings employees whose jobs are eliminated as a result of the Bank Merger priority in applying for open positions within
Purchaser and Kearny Bank. Any employee of the Company who has or is a party to any employment agreement, severance agreement,
change in control agreement or any other agreement or arrangement that provides for any payment that may be triggered by a
termination, including a termination following the Merger, shall not receive the severance benefits as provided in this Section but will
receive the payment specified in such agreement or arrangement. “Good Reason” means a material decrease in the total amount of the
employee’s base salary below its level in effect on the Effective Date without the employee’s prior written consent or a material
geographical relocation of the employee without the employee’s prior written consent, which shall be deemed to mean relocation to an
office more than twenty-five (25) miles from the employee’s location on the Effective Date.

(f) Purchaser shall honor all obligations under the employment or change in control agreements as set forth in the
Company’s Disclosure Letter, except to the extent any such agreement is superseded or terminated as of, or following, the Effective
Time. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Company shall obtain from Paul M. Aguggia, in the form included in
Purchaser’s Disclosure Letter, an executed settlement agreement (a “Settlement Agreement”) to accept in full settlement of his rights
under his employment agreement, and an executed non-competition agreement with Paul M. Aguggia in the form included in
Purchaser’s Disclosure Letter, to be effective as of the Effective Time. Purchaser and the Company agree that severance payments
which may be triggered under the employment or change in control agreements entered into with Christine R. Piano, Stephen
Hoogerhyde, Patricia C. Hrotko, Michael Lesler and Diane Scriveri will be calculated under the same methodology as the Company’s
severance analysis attached to Company’s Disclosure Letter (the amounts of such potential payments to each executive to be specified
in the Company’s Disclosure Letter).

(g) Subject to the occurrence of the Closing, the Company ESOP shall be terminated by the Company. In connection with
the termination of the Company ESOP and the merger of the Company with Purchaser, all accounts shall be fully vested, all
outstanding indebtedness of the Company ESOP shall be repaid by delivering a sufficient number of unallocated shares of Company
Common Stock to the Company, immediately before the Effective Time, all remaining shares of Company Common Stock held by the
Company ESOP shall be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, and the balance of the unallocated shares and
any other unallocated assets remaining in the Company ESOP after repayment of the Company ESOP loan shall be allocated as

Exchange Ratio to be received by CSBK shareholders pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Agreement”), dated

earnings per share estimates for CSBK for the years ending March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2019, and a range of estimated potential
long-term annual growth rates in net income and net income per share thereafter provided by CSBK’s senior management; (3) the
financial terms of certain other recently completed and pending acquisitions of financial institutions nationwide with comparable
financial characteristics as CSBK; (4) the financial terms of certain other recently completed and pending acquisitions of thrift

versus a peer group of comparable publicly-traded financial institutions; and (7) in person and telephonic discussions with executive
officers of CSBK regarding CSBK’s business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects; the history, past and
current operations, historical financial performance and their assessment of the rationale for the Merger.

In addition, RP Financial reviewed or considered the following materials or information for KRNY, and as further described
below, certain peers of KRNY: (1) certain annual reports, including audited financial statements, including for the fiscal year ended
June 30, 2017, as presented in KRNY’s 10K filings; (2) certain quarterly call reports submitted to the OCC or FDIC by Kearny Bank,

regarding KRNY’s business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects; the history, past and current operations,
historical financial performance and their assessment of the rationale for the Merger.

RP Financial also reviewed and considered certain information and materials detailing the Merger prepared by KRNY’s financial
advisor, including the estimated amount and timing of the cost savings and related expenses, purchase accounting adjustment and
synergies expected to result from the Merger, the pro forma financial impact of the Merger on the combined company’s earnings,
tangible book value, financial ratios and other relevant financial metrics.

Moreover, RP Financial assessed general economic, market and financial conditions, reviewed the financial terms of the merger
and acquisition transactions, to the extent publicly available and involving financial institutions that we considered relevant. We also
took into consideration our experience in other similar transactions and securities valuations as well as our knowledge of the banking
and financial services industry. We reviewed market prices and trading volumes of CSBK and KRNY, reviewed certain publicly
available financial and stock market data relating to select public companies that we deemed relevant to our analysis; and performed
such other analyses and considered such other factors as we have deemed appropriate.

In rendering its opinion, RP Financial relied, without independent verification, on the accuracy and completeness of the
information concerning CSBK and KRNY furnished by the respective institutions as well as their respective financial advisors to RP
Financial for review for purposes of its opinion, as well as publicly-available information regarding other financial institutions and
competitive, economic and demographic data. We have further relied on the assurances of management of CSBK and KRNY as
included in the Agreement. We have also relied upon the management of CSBK and KRNY as to the reasonableness and achievability
of the financial forecasts, projections and other forward-looking information provided to RP Financial by CSBK and KRNY and their
respective financial advisors, and we have assumed such forecasts, projections and other

forward-looking information have been reasonably prepared by CSBK and KRNY as well as their respective financial advisors on a
basis reflecting the best currently available information and CSBK’s and KRNY’s judgements and estimates. We have assumed that
such forecasts, projections and other forward-looking information would be realized in the amounts and at the times contemplated
thereby, and we do not assume any responsibility for the accuracy or reasonableness thereof. We have been authorized by CSBK to rely
on such forecasts, projections and other information and data, and we express no view as to any such forecasts, projections or other
forward-looking information or data, or the bases or assumptions on which they were prepared. We have not been asked to and have
not undertaken an independent verification of any of such information or information we obtained from public sources and we do not
assume any responsibility or liability for the accuracy or completeness thereof. Neither CSBK nor KRNY restricted RP Financial as to
the material it was permitted to review.

RP Financial did not perform or obtain any independent appraisals or evaluations of the assets and liabilities, the collateral
securing the assets or the liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of CSBK or KRNY or the collectability of any such assets, nor have we
been furnished with any such evaluations or appraisals. We did not make an independent evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance
for loan losses of CSBK or KRNY nor have we reviewed any individual credit files relating to CSBK or KRNY. We are not experts in
the evaluation of loan and lease portfolios for purposes of assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. We have assumed
that such allowances for CSBK and KRNY are, in the aggregate, adequate to cover such losses, and will be adequate on a pro forma
basis for the combined entity.

We have undertaken no independent analysis of any pending or threatened litigation, regulatory action, possible unasserted claims
or other contingent liabilities to which CSBK or KRNY is a party or may be subject, and our opinion makes no assumption concerning,
and therefore does not consider, the possible assertion of claims, outcomes or damages arising out of any such matters. We have also
assumed that neither CSBK or KRNY is party to any material pending transaction, including without limitation any financing,
recapitalization, acquisition or merger, divestiture or spin-off, other than the Merger contemplated by the Agreement. RP Financial is
not opining in any manner on the future earnings, financial condition or operations of the parties generally, and we do not assume any
responsibility or liability for any matters relating thereto.

RP Financial, with your consent, has relied upon the advice CSBK has received from its legal, accounting, financial and tax
advisors as to all legal, accounting and tax matters relating to the Agreement and other transactions contemplated by the Agreement. In
rendering its opinion, RP Financial assumed that, in the course of obtaining the necessary regulatory and governmental approvals for
the proposed Merger, no restriction will be imposed on KRNY that would have a material adverse effect on the ability of the Merger to
be consummated as set forth in the Agreement. We have also assumed that there have been no material changes in the financial
condition of CSBK or KRNY since the date of the most recent financial statement made available to us. We have assumed, in all
respects material to our analyses, that all of the representations and warranties contained in the Agreement and all related agreements
are true and correct, that each party to such agreements will perform all of the covenants required to be performed by such party under
such agreements and that the conditions precedent in the Agreement are not waived.

Opinion

This letter is directed to the Board of Directors of CSBK in its consideration of the Agreement, and does not constitute a
recommendation to any shareholder of CSBK as to any action that such shareholder should take in connection with the Agreement, or
otherwise. Our opinion should not be construed as implying that the Merger Consideration is necessarily the highest or best price that
could be obtained in a sale, merger, or combination

transaction with a third party. We do not express any opinion as to the value of KRNY common stock following the announcement of
the proposed Merger, or the value of KRNY common stock following the consummation of the Merger, or the prices at which shares of
KRNY’ common stock may be purchased or sold at any time. Other than as specifically set forth herein, we are not expressing any
opinion with respect to the terms and provisions of the Agreement or the enforceability of any such terms or provisions.

Our opinion is directed only to the fairness of the Exchange Ratio to the current holders of CSBK Common Stock from a
financial point of view as of the date of the Agreement. It is understood that this opinion is based on market conditions and other
circumstances existing on the date hereof. Events occurring after the date hereof could materially affect this opinion.

We will receive a fee for our fairness opinion services. CSBK has agreed to indemnify us against certain liabilities arising out of
our engagement.

It is understood that this opinion may be included in its entirety in any communication by CSBK or its Board of Directors to the
stockholders of CSBK. It is also understood that this opinion may be included in its entirety in any regulatory filing by CSBK, and that
RP Financial consents to the summary of this opinion in the proxy materials of CSBK, and any amendments thereto. Except as
described above, this opinion may not be summarized, excerpted from or otherwise publicly referred to without RP Financial’s prior
written consent.

Based upon and subject to the foregoing, and other such matters we consider relevant, it is RP Financial’s opinion that, as of the
date hereof, the Exchange Ratio in the Merger is fair to the holders of CSBK Common Stock from a financial point of view.
 

  Respectfully submitted,

ANNEX C

November 1, 2017

The Board of Directors
Kearny Financial Corp.
120 Passaic Avenue
Fairfield, NJ 07004

Members of the Board:

You have requested the opinion of Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc. (“KBW” or “we”) as investment bankers as to the fairness,
from a financial point of view, to Kearny Financial Corp. (“Kearny”) of the Exchange Ratio (as defined below) in the proposed merger
(the “Merger”) of Clifton Bancorp Inc. (“Clifton”) with and into Kearny, pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the
“Agreement”) to be entered into by and between Kearny and Clifton. Pursuant to the Agreement and subject to the terms, conditions
and limitations set forth therein, by virtue of the Merger, automatically and without any action on the part of any holder of common
stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Clifton (“Clifton Common Stock”), each share of Clifton Common Stock that is issued and
outstanding at the Effective Time (as defined in the Agreement), other than Excluded Shares (as defined in the Agreement), shall
become and be converted into the right to receive 1.191 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Kearny (“Kearny
Common Stock”). The ratio of 1.191 shares of Kearny Common Stock for one share of Clifton Common Stock is referred to herein as
the “Exchange Ratio.” The terms and conditions of the Merger are more fully set forth in the Agreement.

The Agreement further provides that, simultaneously with or as soon as practicable following the Effective Time, Clifton Savings
Bank, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Clifton, will be merged with and into Kearny Bank, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Kearny,
pursuant to a separate plan of bank merger (such transaction, the “Bank Merger”).

KBW has acted as financial advisor to Kearny and not as an advisor to or agent of any other person. As part of our investment
banking business, we are continually engaged in the valuation of bank and bank holding company securities in connection with
acquisitions, negotiated underwritings, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements and valuations for
various other purposes. As specialists in the securities of banking companies, we have experience in, and knowledge of, the valuation
of banking enterprises. We and our affiliates, in the ordinary course of our and their broker-dealer businesses (and in the case of
Kearny, further to an existing sales and trading relationship with a KBW broker-dealer affiliate), may from time to time purchase
securities from, and sell securities to, Kearny and Clifton. In addition, as a market maker in securities, we and our affiliates may from
time to time have a long or short position in, and buy or sell, debt or equity securities of Kearny or Clifton for our and their own
accounts and for the accounts of our and their respective customers and clients. We have acted exclusively for the board of directors of
Kearny (the “Board”) in rendering this opinion and will receive a fee from Kearny for our services. A portion of our fee is payable
upon the rendering of this opinion, and a significant portion is contingent upon the successful completion of the Merger. In addition,
Kearny has agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities arising out of our engagement.

Other than in connection with this present engagement, in the past two years, KBW has not provided investment banking and
financial advisory services to Kearny. In the past two years, KBW has not provided investment banking and financial advisory services
to Clifton. We may in the future provide investment banking and financial advisory services to Kearny or Clifton and receive
compensation for such services.

In connection with this opinion, we have reviewed, analyzed and relied upon material bearing upon the financial and operating
condition of Kearny and Clifton and bearing upon the Merger, including among other things, the following: (i) a draft of the Agreement
dated October 25, 2017 (the most recent draft made available to us); (ii) the audited financial statements and the Annual Reports on
Form 10-K for the three fiscal years ended June 30, 2017 of Kearny; (iii) certain unaudited and preliminary financial results for the
quarter ended September 30, 2017 of Kearny (provided to us by representatives of Kearny); (iv) the audited financial statements and
the Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the three fiscal years ended March 31, 2017 of Clifton; (v) the unaudited quarterly financial
statements and the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2017 of Clifton; (vi) certain unaudited and
preliminary financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2017 of Clifton (provided to us by representatives of Clifton); (vii)
certain regulatory filings of Kearny, Clifton and their respective subsidiaries, including (as applicable) the quarterly reports on
Form FRY-9C and quarterly call reports that were filed with respect to each quarter during the three year period ended June 30, 2017
(in the case of Kearny), the three year period ended March 31, 2017 and the quarter ended June 30, 2017 (in the case of Clifton); (viii)
certain other interim reports and other communications of Kearny and Clifton to their respective stockholders; and (ix) other financial
information concerning the respective businesses and operations of Kearny and Clifton that was furnished to us by Kearny and Clifton
or which we were otherwise directed to use for purposes of our analysis. Our consideration of financial information and other factors
that we deemed appropriate under the circumstances or relevant to our analyses included, among others, the following: (i) the historical
and current financial position and results of operations of Kearny and Clifton; (ii) the assets and liabilities of Kearny and Clifton;
(iii) the nature and terms of certain other merger transactions and business combinations in the banking industry; (iv) a comparison of
certain financial and stock market information of Kearny and Clifton with similar information for certain other companies, the
securities of which are publicly traded; (v) the publicly-available consensus “street estimates” of Clifton (giving effect to certain
adjustments thereto provided to us by Kearny management), as well as assumed Clifton long-term growth rates provided to us by
Kearny management, all of which information was discussed with us by Kearny management and used and relied upon by us at the
direction of such management and with the consent of the Board; (vi) the publicly available consensus “street estimates” of Kearny
(giving effect to certain adjustments thereto provided to us by Kearny management), as well as assumed Kearny long-term growth rates
provided to us by Kearny management, all of which information was discussed with us by such management and used and relied upon
by us at the direction of such management and with the consent of the Board; and (vii) estimates regarding certain pro forma financial
effects of the Merger on Kearny (including without limitation the cost savings and related expenses expected to result or be derived
from the Merger) that were prepared by Kearny management, provided to and discussed with us by such management, and used and
relied upon by us at the direction of such management and with the consent of the Board. We have also performed such other studies
and analyses as we considered appropriate and have taken into account our assessment of general economic, market and financial
conditions and our experience in other transactions, as well as our experience in securities valuation and knowledge of the banking
industry generally. We have also participated in discussions that were held by the managements of Kearny and Clifton regarding the
past and current business operations, regulatory relations, financial condition and future prospects of their respective companies and
such other matters as we have deemed relevant to our inquiry.

In conducting our review and arriving at our opinion, we have relied upon and assumed the accuracy and completeness of all of
the financial and other information provided to us or that was publicly available and we have not independently verified the accuracy
or completeness of any such information or assumed any responsibility or liability for such verification, accuracy or completeness. We
have relied upon the management of Kearny as to the reasonableness and achievability of the publicly available consensus “street
estimates” of Clifton and Kearny (in each case as adjusted as referred to above), the assumed long-term growth rates of Clifton and
Kearny, and the estimates regarding certain pro forma financial effects of the Merger on Kearny (including,

without limitation, the cost savings and related expenses expected to result or be derived from the Merger), all as referred to above, as
well as the assumptions set forth in and the bases for all such information. We have assumed, at the direction of Kearny, that all of such
information was reasonably prepared and represents, or in the case of the publicly available consensus “street estimates” of Clifton and
Kearny referred to above that such estimates (as adjusted) are consistent with, the best currently available estimates and judgments of
Kearny management, and that the forecasts, projections and estimates reflected in such information will be realized in the amounts and
in the time periods currently estimated.

It is understood that the portion of the foregoing financial information of Kearny and Clifton that was provided to us was not
prepared with the expectation of public disclosure, that all of the foregoing financial information, including the publicly available
consensus “street estimates” of Clifton and Kearny referred to above, is based on numerous variables and assumptions that are
inherently uncertain, including, without limitation, factors related to general economic and competitive conditions and that,
accordingly, actual results could vary significantly from those set forth in such information. We have assumed, based on discussions
with Kearny management and with the consent of the Board, that all such information provides a reasonable basis upon which we
could form our opinion and we express no view as to any such information or the assumptions or bases therefor. We have relied on all
such information without independent verification or analysis and do not in any respect assume any responsibility or liability for the
accuracy or completeness thereof. Given the substantial level of excess capital currently at both Clifton and Kearny and given that the
publicly available consensus “street estimates” of Clifton and Kearny (in each case as adjusted by Kearny management) and the
assumed Clifton and Kearny long-term growth rates provided to us by Kearny management do not reflect the impact of the expected
future deployment of such excess capital (the actual timing and amount of which deployment are subject to substantial uncertainty), we
have not relied upon a discounted cash flow analysis of either Clifton or Kearny.

We also have assumed that there have been no material changes in the assets, liabilities, financial condition, results of operations,
business or prospects of either Kearny or Clifton since the date of the last financial statements of each such entity that were made
available to us and that we were directed to use. We are not experts in the independent verification of the adequacy of allowances for
loan and lease losses and we have assumed, without independent verification and with your consent, that the aggregate allowances for
loan and lease losses for each of Kearny and Clifton are adequate to cover such losses. In rendering our opinion, we have not made or
obtained any evaluations or appraisals or physical inspection of the property, assets or liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of Kearny or
Clifton, the collateral securing any of such assets or liabilities, or the collectability of any such assets, nor have we examined any
individual loan or credit files, nor did we evaluate the solvency, financial capability or fair value of Kearny or Clifton under any state
or federal laws, including those relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or other matters. Estimates of values of companies and assets do not
purport to be appraisals or necessarily reflect the prices at which companies or assets may actually be sold. Because such estimates are
inherently subject to uncertainty, we assume no responsibility or liability for their accuracy.

We have assumed, in all respects material to our analyses, the following: (i) that the Merger and any related transactions
(including the Bank Merger) will be completed substantially in accordance with the terms set forth in the Agreement (the final terms of
which we have assumed will not differ in any respect material to our analyses from the draft version reviewed by us and referred to
above), with no adjustments to the Exchange Ratio and with no other consideration or payments in respect of Clifton Common Stock;
(ii) that the representations and warranties of each party in the Agreement and in all related documents and instruments referred to in
the Agreement are true and correct; (iii) that each party to the Agreement or any of the related documents will perform all of the
covenants and agreements required to be performed by such party under such documents;

(iv) that there are no factors that would delay or subject to any adverse conditions, any necessary regulatory or governmental approval
for the Merger or any related transaction (including the Bank Merger) and that all conditions to the completion of the Merger and any
such related transaction will be satisfied without any waivers or modifications to the Agreement or any of the related documents; and
(v) that in the course of obtaining the necessary regulatory, contractual, or other consents or approvals for the Merger and any related
transactions (including the Bank Merger), no restrictions, including any divestiture requirements, termination or other payments or
amendments or modifications, will be imposed that will have a material adverse effect on the future results of operations or financial
condition of Kearny, Clifton or the pro forma entity, or the contemplated benefits of the Merger, including without limitation the cost
savings and related expenses expected to result or be derived from the Merger. We have assumed that the Merger will be consummated
in a manner that complies with the applicable provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended, and all other applicable federal and state statutes, rules and regulations. We have further been advised by
representatives of Kearny that Kearny has relied upon advice from its advisors (other than KBW) or other appropriate sources as to all
legal, financial reporting, tax, accounting and regulatory matters with respect to Kearny, Clifton, the Merger and any related transaction
(including the Bank Merger), and the Agreement. KBW has not provided advice with respect to any such matters.

This opinion addresses only the fairness, from a financial point of view, as of the date hereof, of the Exchange Ratio in the Merger
to Kearny. We express no view or opinion as to any other terms or aspects of the Merger or any term or aspect of any related
transaction (including the Bank Merger), including without limitation, the form or structure of the Merger or any such related
