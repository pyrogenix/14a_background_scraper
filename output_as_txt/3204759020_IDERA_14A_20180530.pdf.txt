EXPLANATORY NOTE

           This joint proxy statement/prospectus amends and restates the joint proxy statement/prospectus dated March 29, 2018, which was previously mailed to the
stockholders of BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and the stockholders of Idera Pharmaceuticals, Inc. on or about April 2, 2018 in connection with the proposed strategic
business combination of BioCryst and Idera in order to (1) revise the record date for the special meeting of Idera stockholders and the special meeting of BioCryst
stockholders to May 29, 2018 and (2) revise the date of the special meeting of Idera stockholders and the special meeting of BioCryst stockholders to July 10, 2018.

MERGERS PROPOSED—YOUR VOTE IS VERY IMPORTANT

Dear Stockholders:

           As previously disclosed, the BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ("BioCryst") board of directors (the "BioCryst board") and the Idera Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ("Idera") board of
directors (the "Idera board") have unanimously approved and BioCryst and Idera have entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of January 21, 2018 (the "merger
agreement") with respect to a strategic business combination. Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, (i) Island Merger Sub, Inc. ("Merger Sub A"), a wholly owned
subsidiary of Nautilus Holdco, Inc. ("Holdco"), which is in turn a wholly owned subsidiary of BioCryst and a party to the merger agreement, will merge with and into Idera, with
Idera surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of Holdco (the "Idera merger"), and (ii) Boat Merger Sub, Inc. ("Merger Sub B"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Holdco and a party to
the merger agreement, will merge with and into BioCryst, with BioCryst surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of Holdco (the "BioCryst merger" and together with the Idera
merger, the "mergers"). Upon completion of the mergers, BioCryst and Idera, and their respective subsidiaries, will become wholly owned subsidiaries of Holdco and will operate
as a combined company under the name Valenscion Incorporated.

           Upon completion of the mergers, each issued and outstanding share of Idera common stock will be converted into the right to receive 0.20 shares of Holdco common stock
(the "Idera exchange ratio"), and each issued and outstanding share of BioCryst common stock will be converted into the right to receive 0.50 shares of Holdco common stock (the
"BioCryst exchange ratio" and together with the Idera exchange ratio, the "exchange ratios"). The exchange ratios will not be adjusted for changes in the market price of either
BioCryst common stock or Idera common stock between the date of signing of the merger agreement and completion of the mergers. Upon completion of the mergers, each issued
and outstanding share of Idera preferred stock (with certain exceptions described in the accompanying joint proxy statement/prospectus) will be converted into the right to receive
an amount of Holdco common stock based on its liquidation preference.

           Upon closing of the mergers, BioCryst stockholders (including holders of securities convertible, exchangeable or exercisable for shares of BioCryst common stock)
immediately prior to the closing of the mergers will beneficially own approximately 51.6% of Holdco, and Idera stockholders (including holders of securities convertible,
exchangeable or exercisable for shares of Idera common stock) immediately prior to the effective time of the mergers will beneficially own approximately 48.4% of Holdco, each
calculated on a fully diluted basis using the treasury stock method. BioCryst and Idera will each hold a special meeting of its respective stockholders to consider the mergers. At the
special meeting of BioCryst stockholders (the "BioCryst special meeting"), BioCryst stockholders will be asked to vote on a proposal to adopt the merger agreement, a proposal to
approve, on a non-binding advisory basis, the compensation that may become payable to BioCryst's named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the mergers,
and a proposal to adjourn the BioCryst special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement. At
the special meeting of Idera stockholders (the "Idera special meeting"), Idera stockholders will be asked to vote on a proposal to adopt the merger agreement and a proposal to
approve, on a non-binding advisory basis, the compensation that may become payable to Idera's named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the mergers.

           Affiliates of Baker Bros. Advisors, LP ("Baker Brothers"), the beneficial owner of approximately 14% of issued and outstanding BioCryst common stock and approximately
18% of issued and outstanding Idera common stock, have agreed, among other things, to vote their shares of BioCryst common stock and Idera common stock in favor of the
proposal to adopt the merger agreement at each of the BioCryst special meeting and Idera special meeting.

           On or about April 2, 2018, Idera stockholders and BioCryst stockholders were mailed a joint proxy statement/prospectus related to the special meetings that were originally
scheduled for May 9, 2018. On April 10, 2018, BioCryst and Idera announced the postponement of their respective special meetings, following investor feedback, to provide
stockholders adequate time to consider new clinical data from Idera regarding its IMO-2125 program, which will be presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology
meeting being held June 1-5, 2018 in Chicago, Illinois. Each of the BioCryst special meeting and the Idera special meeting will now be held on July 10, 2018. In connection with
the postponed meeting dates, the revised record date for each of Idera and BioCryst is May 29, 2018.

           We cannot complete the mergers unless the BioCryst stockholders and Idera stockholders approve the respective proposals of each company with respect to the mergers as
described above. Your vote is very important, regardless of the number of shares you own. Whether or not you expect to attend either special meeting in person, please submit
a proxy to vote your shares as promptly as possible so that your shares may be represented and voted at the BioCryst special meeting or the Idera special meeting, as
applicable. However, if you previously submitted a proxy for either the Idera special meeting or the BioCryst special meeting originally scheduled for May 9, 2018, which
proxy has not subsequently been revoked, and are a holder of record on May 29, 2018 and you do not want to change or revoke your proxy, you do not need to take any
action. Accordingly, Idera or BioCryst, as applicable, intend to vote such proxy at the respective special meeting on July 10, 2018, as directed by your previously
submitted proxy.

           The BioCryst board has unanimously approved the merger agreement and determined that the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby,
including the mergers, are advisable, fair to and in the best interests of BioCryst and its stockholders. The BioCryst board unanimously recommends that BioCryst
stockholders vote "FOR" the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, "FOR" the proposal to approve, on a non-binding advisory basis, the compensation that may
become payable to BioCryst's named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the mergers and "FOR" the proposal to adjourn the BioCryst special
meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement.

           The Idera board has unanimously approved the merger agreement and determined that the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby,
including the mergers, are advisable, fair to and in the best interests of Idera and its stockholders. The Idera board unanimously recommends that Idera stockholders
vote "FOR" the proposal to adopt the merger agreement and "FOR" the proposal to approve, on a non-binding advisory basis, the compensation that may become
payable to Idera's named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the mergers.

           The obligations of BioCryst and Idera to complete the mergers are subject to the satisfaction or waiver of several conditions set forth in the merger agreement. The
accompanying joint proxy statement/prospectus contains detailed information about BioCryst, Idera, the special meetings, the merger agreement and the mergers. BioCryst and

Idera encourage you to read the joint proxy statement/prospectus carefully and in its entirety, including the section entitled "Risk Factors" beginning on page 22 of this
joint proxy statement/prospectus.

           We look forward to the successful combination of BioCryst and Idera.

           Neither the Securities and Exchange Commission nor any state securities commission has approved or disapproved the mergers and other transactions described
in the joint proxy statement/prospectus, nor have they approved or disapproved of the securities to be issued under this joint proxy statement/prospectus or determined if
this joint proxy statement/prospectus is accurate or complete. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense.

           This joint proxy statement/prospectus is dated May 30, 2018 and is first being mailed to Idera stockholders and BioCryst stockholders on or about June 4, 2018.

Sincerely,    Sincerely,

        The Idera board of directors (the "Idera board") has unanimously approved the merger agreement and determined that the
merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the mergers, are advisable, fair to and in the best interests
of Idera and its stockholders. The Idera board unanimously recommends that Idera stockholders vote "FOR" the proposal to
adopt the merger agreement and "FOR" the proposal to approve, on a non-binding advisory basis, the compensation that may
become payable to Idera's named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the mergers.

cannot be completed without the adoption of the merger agreement by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the issued and

        Whether or not you expect to attend the Idera special meeting in person, we urge you to submit a proxy to vote your shares as

Idera special meeting originally scheduled for May 9, 2018, which proxy has not subsequently been revoked, and are a holder of

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS 

        The following are some questions that you, as a stockholder of Idera or a stockholder of BioCryst, may have regarding the mergers
and the other matters being considered at the special meetings and the answers to those questions. Idera and BioCryst urge you to
carefully read the remainder of this joint proxy statement/prospectus because the information in this section does not provide all the
information that might be important to you with respect to the mergers and the other matters being considered at the special meetings.
Additional important information is also contained in the Annexes to, and the documents incorporated by reference into, this joint proxy
statement/prospectus.

Q:    Why am I receiving this joint proxy statement/prospectus and a new proxy card?

A: As previously disclosed, BioCryst and Idera have agreed to a strategic business combination pursuant to the terms of the merger
agreement that is described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus. A copy of the merger agreement is included as Annex A to
this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

In order to complete the mergers, among other things, Idera stockholders and BioCryst stockholders must approve the adoption of
the merger agreement.

BioCryst and Idera will hold separate special meetings of their respective stockholders to obtain these approvals. This joint proxy
statement/prospectus and a new proxy card are being sent to you following the postponement of each of the BioCryst special
meeting and the Idera special meeting that was originally scheduled for May 9, 2018 in connection with the proposal to adopt the
merger agreement and the other matters to be voted on at the each of the Idera special meeting and the BioCryst special meeting.
BioCryst and Idera are each rescheduling their respective special meeting, following investor feedback, to provide stockholders
adequate time to consider new clinical data from Idera regarding its IMO-2125 program, which will be presented at the American
Society of Clinical Oncology meeting being held June 1-5, 2018 in Chicago, Illinois. The Idera special meeting and the BioCryst
special meeting are now scheduled to occur on July 10, 2018.

This joint proxy statement/prospectus, including its Annexes, contains and incorporates by reference important information about
BioCryst, Idera, the special meetings, the merger agreement and the mergers. You should read all the available information
carefully and in its entirety.

Q:    What should I do if I already voted using the proxy card sent in the joint proxy statement/prospectus that was mailed on or
around April 2, 2018?

A: If you previously submitted a proxy for either the Idera special meeting or the BioCryst special meeting originally scheduled for
May 9, 2018, which proxy has not subsequently been revoked, and are a holder of record on May 29, 2018, BioCryst and Idera, as
applicable, intend to vote such proxy at the respective special meeting on July 10, 2018, as directed by the previously submitted
proxy by you. Accordingly, if you have already submitted a proxy, you do not need to take any action unless you want to change or
revoke your proxy.

However, if you are an Idera stockholder and have acquired shares after March 22, 2018 (the "original Idera record date") or if
you are a BioCryst stockholder and have acquired shares after April 4, 2018 (the "original BioCryst record date"), and those shares
are held by a bank, broker or other nominee to whom you did not previously issue voting instructions with respect to the Idera
special meeting or the BioCryst special meeting, as applicable, those newly acquired shares will not be voted unless you follow the
instructions on your voting card or otherwise provided by your broker, bank or other nominee for submitting a proxy with respect
to those newly acquired shares. Moreover, if you held shares in "street name" through a bank or broker on the original Idera record
date or the original BioCryst record date, as applicable, but have acquired shares after the

original Idera record date or the original BioCryst record date, as applicable, and you are the stockholder of record of those newly
acquired shares, then, whether or not you previously gave a voting instruction with respect to the shares that you held on the
original Idera record date or the original BioCryst record date, as applicable, those newly acquired shares will not be voted unless
you give a proxy with respect to those shares by completing, signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy card, by following
the instructions on the enclosed proxy card for Internet or telephone submissions or by attending the Idera special meeting or
BioCryst special meeting, as applicable, and voting in person. If you want to change or revoke your proxy, you must submit a new
proxy card, transmit additional voting instructions by telephone or through the Internet, or attend the Idera special meeting or
BioCryst special meeting, as applicable, and vote in person. Otherwise, you will be considered to have voted on the proposals as
indicated in the proxy card you previously provided and the proxies identified in the proxy card will vote your shares as indicated
in that previously submitted proxy card. If you are a registered holder and you wish to change or revoke your proxy, please
complete, sign, date and mail a new proxy card or submit a new proxy by telephone or through the Internet. If your shares are held
in "street name" by your broker, and you wish to change or revoke your proxy, please refer to your voting card or other information
forwarded by your broker, bank or other holder of record to determine whether you may submit a proxy by telephone or on the
Internet and follow the instructions on the card or other information provided by the record holder.

Q:    What will stockholders receive in the mergers?

A: Idera Stockholders:    If the mergers are completed, (i) holders of Idera common stock will receive 0.20 shares of Holdco common
stock for each share of Idera common stock they hold at the effective time of the mergers (the "Idera exchange ratio") and
(ii) holders of Idera preferred stock will receive for each share of Idera preferred stock they hold at the effective time of the
mergers, that number of shares of Holdco common stock equal to (a) $1.00 divided by the 20-trading-day average trading price of
Idera common stock, ending with the trading day prior to the third day prior to the closing date, multiplied by (b) 0.20. Holders of
Idera common stock and Idera preferred stock will not receive any fractional shares of Holdco common stock in the mergers.
Instead, Idera stockholders will receive cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Holdco common stock that the holders of Idera
common stock and Idera preferred stock would otherwise have been entitled to receive.

BioCryst Stockholders:    If the mergers are completed, holders of BioCryst common stock will receive 0.50 shares of Holdco
common stock for each share of BioCryst common stock they hold at the effective time of the mergers (the "BioCryst exchange
ratio" and together with the Idera exchange ratio, the "exchange ratios"). BioCryst stockholders will not receive any fractional
shares of Holdco common stock in the mergers. Instead, BioCryst stockholders will receive cash in lieu of any fractional shares of
Holdco common stock that the BioCryst stockholders would otherwise have been entitled to receive.

Q:    What is the value of the merger consideration?

A: BioCryst stockholders and Idera stockholders will receive a fixed number of shares of Holdco common stock in the BioCryst
merger and the Idera merger, respectively, rather than a number of shares of Holdco common stock with a particular fixed market
value. Because the exchange ratios are fixed and will not be adjusted to reflect any changes in the market prices of BioCryst
common stock or Idera common stock, the market value of the Holdco common stock issued in the BioCryst merger or the Idera
merger, as applicable, and the BioCryst common stock and Idera common stock surrendered in the BioCryst merger and the Idera
merger, respectively, may be higher or lower than the values of these shares on dates earlier to the effective time of the

mergers. We urge you to obtain current market quotations of BioCryst common stock and Idera common stock. See also
"Comparative Stock Price Data and Dividends" beginning on page 154 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

Q:    What percentage of Holdco will Idera stockholders and BioCryst stockholders, respectively, own following the mergers?

A: Upon completion of the mergers, BioCryst stockholders (including holders of securities convertible, exchangeable or exercisable
for shares of BioCryst common stock) immediately prior to the effective time of the mergers are expected to beneficially own
approximately 51.6% of Holdco and Idera stockholders (including holders of securities convertible, exchangeable or exercisable
for shares of Idera common stock) immediately prior to the effective time of the mergers are expected to beneficially own
approximately 48.4% of Holdco, in each case, calculated on a fully diluted basis (using the treasury method).

Q:    When and where will the special meetings be held?

A: Idera Stockholders:    The Idera special meeting will be held at Idera's offices located at 505 Eagleview Boulevard, Suite 212,

Q:    How do I vote if I am a stockholder of record?

A: If you are a stockholder of record of Idera as of May 29, 2018, which is referred to as the Idera record date, or a stockholder of
record of BioCryst as of May 29, 2018, which is referred to as the BioCryst record date, you may submit your proxy before your
respective company's special meeting in one of the following ways: 

• use the toll-free number shown on your proxy card; 

• visit the website shown on your proxy card to vote via the Internet; or 

• complete, sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card in the enclosed postage-paid envelope.

If you are a stockholder of record, you may also cast your vote in person at your respective company's special meeting.

If your shares are held in "street name," through a broker, trustee or other nominee, that institution will send you separate
instructions describing the procedure for voting your shares. "Street name" stockholders who wish to vote at the special meetings
will need to obtain a "legal proxy" form from their broker, trustee or other nominee.

Q:    How many votes do I have?

A: Idera Stockholders:    Holders of Idera common stock are entitled to one vote for each share owned as of the close of business on
the Idera record date. As of the close of business on the Idera record date, there were 217,310,991 shares of Idera common stock
issued and outstanding and entitled to vote at the Idera special meeting.

BioCryst Stockholders:    Holders of BioCryst common stock are entitled to one vote for each share owned as of the close of
business on the BioCryst record date. As of the close of business on the BioCryst record date, there were 98,821,091 shares of
BioCryst common stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote at the BioCryst special meeting.

Q:    My shares are held in "street name" by my broker, bank or other nominee. Will my broker, bank or other nominee
automatically vote my shares for me?

A: No. If your shares are held in the name of a broker, bank or other nominee, you are considered the "beneficial holder" of the shares
held for you in what is known as "street name." You are not the "record holder" (as defined in "The Idera Special Meeting—How
to Vote" beginning on page 46 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus) of such shares. If this is the case, this joint proxy
statement/prospectus has been forwarded to you by your broker, bank or other nominee. As the beneficial holder, unless your
broker, bank, or other nominee has discretionary authority over your shares, you generally have the right to direct your broker,
bank or other nominee as to how to vote your shares. If you do not provide voting instructions, your shares will not be voted on
any proposal, as your broker, bank or other nominee will not have discretionary voting authority with respect to any of the
proposals described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus. This is often called a "broker non-vote."

In connection with the Idera special meeting:

• broker non-votes, if any, will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the proposal to adopt the merger agreement; and 

• broker non-votes, if any, will have no effect on the Idera merger-related compensatory proposal (assuming a quorum is
present).

In connection with the BioCryst special meeting:

• broker non-votes, if any, will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the proposal to adopt the merger agreement; 

• broker non-votes, if any, will have no effect on the BioCryst merger-related compensation proposal (assuming a quorum is
present); and 

• broker non-votes, if any, will have no effect on the BioCryst adjournment proposal (assuming a quorum is present).

You should therefore provide your broker, bank or other nominee with instructions as to how to vote your shares of Idera common
stock or BioCryst common stock.

Please follow the voting instructions provided by your broker, bank or other nominee so that it may vote your shares on your
behalf. Please note that you may not vote shares held in street name by returning a proxy card directly to Idera or BioCryst or by
voting in person at your special meeting unless you first obtain a proxy from your broker, bank or other nominee.

Q:    What will happen if I fail to vote or I abstain from voting?

A: For purposes of each of the Idera special meeting and the BioCryst special meeting, an abstention occurs when a respective
stockholder attends the applicable special meeting in person and does not vote or returns a proxy with an "abstain" vote.

Idera

• Idera adoption of merger agreement proposal:  An abstention or failure to vote will have the same effect as a vote
"AGAINST" the proposal to adopt the merger agreement. 

• Idera merger-related compensation proposal:  If an Idera stockholder present in person at the Idera special meeting
abstains from voting, responds by proxy with an "abstain" vote, or is not present in person at the Idera special meeting and
does not respond by proxy, it will have no effect on the Idera merger-related compensation proposal (assuming a quorum is
present).

BioCryst

• BioCryst adoption of merger agreement proposal:  An abstention or failure to vote will have the same effect as a vote
"AGAINST" the proposal to adopt the merger agreement. 

• BioCryst merger-related compensation proposal:  If a BioCryst stockholder present in person at the BioCryst special
meeting abstains from voting, or responds by proxy with an "abstain" vote or is not present in person at the BioCryst
special meeting and does not respond by proxy, it will have no effect on the BioCryst merger-related compensation
proposal (assuming a quorum is present). 

• BioCryst adjournment proposal:  If a BioCryst stockholder present in person at the BioCryst special meeting abstains from
voting, responds by proxy with an "abstain" vote, or is not present in person at the BioCryst special meeting and does not
respond by proxy, it will have no effect on the BioCryst adjournment proposal (assuming a quorum is present).

Q:    What will happen if I return my proxy card without indicating how to vote?

A: Idera Stockholders:    If you properly complete and sign your proxy card but do not indicate how your shares of Idera common
stock should be voted on a matter, the shares of Idera common stock represented by your proxy will be voted as the Idera board
recommends and, therefore, "FOR" the proposal to adopt the merger agreement and "FOR" the proposal to approve, on a

non-binding advisory basis, the compensation that may become payable to Idera's named executive officers that is based on or
otherwise relates to the mergers.

BioCryst Stockholders:    If you properly complete and sign your proxy card but do not indicate how your shares of BioCryst
common stock should be voted on a matter, the shares of BioCryst common stock represented by your proxy will be voted as the
BioCryst board recommends and, therefore, "FOR" the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, "FOR" the proposal to approve, on
a non-binding advisory basis, the compensation that may become payable to BioCryst's named executive officers that is based on
or otherwise relates to the mergers and "FOR" the proposal to adjourn the BioCryst special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to
solicit additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement.

Q:    Can I change my vote or revoke my proxy after I have returned a proxy or voting instruction card?

A: Yes.

If you are a holder of record of either Idera or BioCryst shares:    If you are a holder of record of either Idera common stock or
BioCryst common stock, as applicable, you can change your vote or revoke your proxy at any time before your proxy is voted at
your respective special meeting. You can do this in one of three ways:

• timely delivering a signed written notice of revocation to the Assistant Secretary of Idera or the Corporate Secretary of
BioCryst, as applicable; 

• timely delivering a new, valid proxy for Idera or BioCryst, as applicable, bearing a later date than your original proxy by
submitting instructions through the Internet, by telephone or by mail as described on the applicable proxy card; or 

• attending your special meeting and voting in person, which will automatically cancel any proxy previously given, or you
can revoke your proxy in person. Simply attending the Idera special meeting or the BioCryst special meeting without
voting will not revoke any proxy that you have previously given or change your vote.

If you choose either of the first two methods, your notice of revocation or your new proxy must be received by Idera or BioCryst,
as applicable, no later than the beginning of the applicable special meeting. If you have submitted a proxy for your shares by
telephone or via the Internet, you may revoke your prior telephone or Internet proxy by any manner described above.

If you hold shares of either Idera or BioCryst in "street name":    If your shares are held in street name, you must contact your
broker, bank or other nominee to change your vote.

Q:    What are the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the mergers to U.S. holders of Idera common stock and BioCryst
common stock?

A: Consequences to holders of Idera common stock and BioCryst common stock:    It is a condition to BioCryst's obligation to
complete the BioCryst merger that BioCryst receive an opinion from Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP ("Skadden"),
dated as of the closing date of the mergers (the "closing date"), to the effect that the BioCryst merger will qualify as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") or,
alternatively, the mergers together will be treated as an "exchange" described in Section 351 of the Code. It is a condition to Idera's
obligation to complete the Idera merger that Idera receive an opinion from Latham & Watkins LLP ("Latham"), dated as of the
closing date, to the effect that the mergers together will be treated as an "exchange" described in Section 351 of the Code.

as described above, a "U.S. holder" (as defined in "U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Mergers" beginning on page 137
of this joint proxy statement/prospectus) of BioCryst common stock or Idera common stock will not recognize any gain or loss for
U.S. federal income tax purposes upon the exchange of shares of BioCryst common stock or Idera common stock for shares of
Holdco common stock in the BioCryst merger or the Idera merger, respectively, except with respect to cash received by BioCryst
stockholders and Idera stockholders in lieu of fractional shares of Holdco common stock.

Please carefully review the information set forth in the section entitled "U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Mergers"
beginning on page 137 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus for a discussion of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the
mergers. Please consult your own tax advisors as to the specific tax consequences to you of the mergers.

Q:    When do you expect the mergers to be completed?

A: Idera and BioCryst are working to complete the mergers as soon as practicable and expect the closing of the mergers to occur in
the third quarter of 2018. However, the mergers are subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions, and it is possible that
factors outside the control of Idera and BioCryst could result in the mergers being completed at a later time or not at all.

Q:    Do I need to do anything with my shares of Idera common stock or BioCryst common stock other than voting for the
proposals at the Idera special meeting or BioCryst special meeting, respectively?

A: Idera Stockholders:    If you are an Idera stockholder, at the effective time of the mergers, (i) each share of Idera common stock
you hold will be converted automatically into the right to receive 0.20 shares of Holdco common stock and (ii) each share of Idera
preferred stock will be converted automatically into the right to receive a number of shares of Holdco common stock equal to
(a) $1.00 divided by the 20-trading-day average trading price of Idera common stock, ending with the trading day prior to the third
day prior to the closing date, multiplied by (b) 0.20, in each case, together with cash in lieu of any fractional shares. You will
receive instructions at that time regarding exchanging your shares of Idera common stock and Idera preferred stock for shares of
Holdco common stock. You do not need to take any action at this time. Please do not send your Idera stock certificates with
your proxy card.

BioCryst Stockholders:    If you are a BioCryst stockholder, at the effective time of the mergers, each share of BioCryst common
stock you hold will be converted automatically into the right to receive 0.50 shares of Holdco common stock together with cash in
lieu of any fractional shares. You will receive instructions at that time regarding exchanging your shares of BioCryst common
stock for shares of Holdco common stock. You do not need to take any action at this time. Please do not send your BioCryst
stock certificates with your proxy card.

Q:    Are stockholders entitled to appraisal rights?

A: No. Under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, as amended (the "DGCL"), neither the Idera stockholders nor
the BioCryst stockholders will be entitled to exercise any appraisal rights in connection with the mergers or the other transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement.

Q:    What happens if I sell my shares of Idera common stock before the Idera special meeting?

A: The record date for the Idera special meeting is earlier than the date of the Idera special meeting and the date that the mergers are
expected to be completed. If you transfer your Idera shares after the Idera record date but before the Idera special meeting, you will
retain your right to vote at the

A: The record date for the BioCryst special meeting is earlier than the date of the BioCryst special meeting and the date that the

special meeting, you will retain your right to vote at the BioCryst special meeting, but will have transferred the right to receive the
merger consideration in the mergers. In order to receive the merger consideration, you must hold your shares through the effective
date of the mergers.

Q:    What if I hold shares in both Idera and BioCryst?

A: If you are a stockholder of both Idera and BioCryst, you will receive two separate packages of proxy materials. A vote cast as an
Idera stockholder will not count as a vote cast as a BioCryst stockholder, and a vote cast as a BioCryst stockholder will not count
as a vote cast as an Idera stockholder. Therefore, please submit separate proxies for your Idera shares and your BioCryst shares.

Q:    Who can help answer my questions?

A: Idera stockholders or BioCryst stockholders who have questions about the mergers, the other matters to be voted on at the special
meetings, or how to submit a proxy or desire additional copies of this joint proxy statement/prospectus or additional proxy cards

SUMMARY 

        This summary highlights selected information contained in this joint proxy statement/prospectus and does not contain all the
information that may be important to you with respect to the mergers and the other matters being considered at the Idera special
meeting and BioCryst special meeting. Idera and BioCryst urge you to read carefully this joint proxy statement/prospectus in its
entirety, including the attached Annexes, and the other documents to which we have referred you. See also the section entitled
"Where You Can Find More Information" beginning on page 172 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus. We have included page
references in this summary to direct you to a more complete description of the topics presented below.

The Companies 

Nautilus Holdco, Inc. (see page 33)

        Nautilus Holdco, Inc. is a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of BioCryst formed for the sole purpose of
becoming the parent entity of each of Idera and BioCryst following the mergers. At the effective time of the mergers, Nautilus
Holdco, Inc. will be renamed "Valenscion Incorporated."

Idera Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (see page 33)

        Idera is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of novel
oligonucleotide therapeutics for oncology and rare diseases. Idera uses two distinct proprietary drug discovery technology platforms
to design and develop drug candidates: its Toll-like receptor, or TLR, targeting technology and its nucleic acid chemistry technology
(formerly referred to as Idera's third generation antisenses, or 3GA technology). Idera developed these platforms based on its
scientific expertise and pioneering work with synthetic oligonucleotides as therapeutic agents. Using its TLR targeting technology,
Idera designs synthetic oligonucleotide-based drug candidates to modulate the activity of specific TLRs. Using its nucleic acid
chemistry technology, Idera is developing drug candidates to turn off the messenger RNA, or mRNA, associated with disease
causing genes. Idera believes that its nucleic acid chemistry technology may potentially reduce the immunotoxicity and increase the
potency of earlier generation antisense and RNA interference, or RNAi, technologies.

        Idera's business strategy is focused on the clinical development of drug candidates for oncology and rare diseases characterized
by small, well-defined patient populations with serious unmet medical needs. Idera believes it can develop and commercialize these
targeted therapies on its own. To the extent Idera seeks to develop drug candidates for broader disease indications, it has entered
into and may explore additional collaborative alliances to support development and commercialization.

        Idera's common stock is traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market (the "Nasdaq") under the symbol "IDRA."

        The principal executive offices of Idera are located at 167 Sidney Street, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139, and its telephone
number is (617) 679-5500. Idera maintains another office at 505 Eagleview Boulevard, Suite 212, Exton, Pennsylvania 19341.

BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (see page 33)

        BioCryst is a biotechnology company that designs, optimizes and develops novel small molecule drugs that block key enzymes
involved in the pathogenesis of diseases. BioCryst focuses on the treatment of rare diseases in which significant unmet medical

approach by which BioCryst designs synthetic compounds from detailed structural knowledge of the active sites of enzyme targets
associated with particular diseases. BioCryst uses X-ray crystallography, computer modeling of molecular structures and advanced
chemistry techniques to focus on the three-dimensional molecular structure and active site characteristics of the enzymes that
control cellular biology. Enzymes are proteins that act as catalysts for many vital biological reactions. BioCryst's goal generally is to
design a compound that will fit in the active site of an enzyme and thereby prevent its catalytic activity.

        BioCryst's common stock is traded on the Nasdaq under the symbol "BCRX."

        The principal executive offices of BioCryst are located at 4505 Emperor Blvd., Suite 200, Durham, North Carolina 27703, and

Effects of the Mergers (see page 53)

        Subject to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, at the effective time of the mergers:

• Merger Sub A, a Delaware corporation that was formed on January 16, 2018 as a wholly owned subsidiary of
Holdco for the sole purpose of effecting the mergers, will be merged with and into Idera, with Idera surviving the
Idera merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Holdco; and

U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Mergers (see page 137)

        It is a condition to BioCryst's obligation to complete the BioCryst merger that BioCryst receive an opinion from Skadden,
dated as of the closing date, to the effect that the BioCryst merger will qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code or, alternatively, the mergers together will be treated as an "exchange" described in Section 351 of the
Code. It is a condition to Idera's obligation to complete the Idera merger that Idera receive an opinion from Latham, dated as of the
closing date, to the effect that the mergers together will be treated as an "exchange" described in Section 351 of the Code. Assuming
the mergers are treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as described above, a U.S. holder of BioCryst common stock or Idera
common stock will not recognize any gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes upon the exchange of shares of BioCryst
common stock or Idera common stock for shares of Holdco common stock in the BioCryst merger or the Idera merger, respectively,
except with respect to cash received by BioCryst and Idera stockholders in lieu of fractional shares of Holdco common stock.

        Please carefully review the information set forth in the section entitled "U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the
Mergers" beginning on page 137 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus for a discussion of the U.S. federal income tax
consequences of the mergers. Please consult your own tax advisors as to the specific tax consequences to you of the mergers.

Opinion of Idera's Financial Advisor—Goldman Sachs (see page 84)

        At a meeting of the Idera board held on January 21, 2018, Goldman, Sachs & Co. LLC ("Goldman Sachs") delivered to the
Idera board its oral opinion, subsequently confirmed in writing, to the effect that, as of January 21, 2018 and based upon and subject
to the factors and assumptions set forth in Goldman Sachs' written opinion, the Idera exchange ratio of 0.20 shares of Holdco
common stock for each share of Idera common stock pursuant to the merger agreement was fair from a financial point of view to
the holders (other than BioCryst and its affiliates) of shares of Idera common stock.

        The full text of the written opinion of Goldman Sachs, dated January 21, 2018, which sets forth the assumptions made,
procedures followed, matters considered, qualifications and limitations on the review undertaken in connection with the
opinion, is attached as Annex B to this joint proxy statement/prospectus. The summary of Goldman Sachs' opinion
contained in this joint proxy statement/prospectus is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of Goldman Sachs'
written opinion. Goldman Sachs' advisory services and opinion were provided for the information and assistance of the
Idera board in connection with its consideration of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and the opinion
does not constitute a recommendation as to how any holder of shares of Idera common stock should vote with respect to the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement or any other matter.

        Pursuant to an engagement letter between Idera and Goldman Sachs, Idera has agreed to pay Goldman Sachs for its services in
connection with the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement an aggregate fee of $7.0 million, $0.7 million of which
became payable at announcement, and the remainder of which is contingent upon consummation of the transactions contemplated
by the merger agreement.

        BioCryst retained J.P. Morgan Securities LLC ("J.P. Morgan") to act as financial advisor to BioCryst in connection with the
mergers. At the meeting of the BioCryst board on January 21, 2018, J.P. Morgan rendered its oral opinion to the BioCryst board
that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and limitations
on the review

undertaken by J.P. Morgan in preparing the opinion, the BioCryst exchange ratio of 0.50 shares of Holdco common stock for each
share of BioCryst common stock pursuant to the merger agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of shares
of BioCryst common stock. J.P. Morgan confirmed this oral opinion by delivering its written opinion to the BioCryst board, dated
January 21, 2018.

        The full text of the written opinion of J.P. Morgan, dated January 21, 2018, which sets forth the assumptions made,
procedures followed, matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken by J.P. Morgan in preparing the opinion,
is attached as Annex C to this joint proxy statement/prospectus and is incorporated herein by reference. BioCryst
stockholders are urged to read the opinion in its entirety. J.P. Morgan's written opinion was addressed to the BioCryst
board (in its capacity as such) in connection with and for the purposes of its evaluation of the mergers, was directed only to
the BioCryst exchange ratio in the proposed BioCryst merger and did not address any other aspect of the mergers. The
opinion does not constitute a recommendation to any stockholder of BioCryst as to how such stockholder should vote with
respect to the mergers or any other matter.

        For a description of the opinion that the BioCryst board received from J.P. Morgan, see the section entitled "The Mergers—
Opinion of BioCryst's Financial Advisor—J.P. Morgan" beginning on page 94 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

        Pursuant to an engagement letter between BioCryst and J.P. Morgan, BioCryst has agreed to pay J.P. Morgan for its services in
connection with the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement an aggregate fee of $7.0 million, $2.0 million of which
became payable to J.P. Morgan for advisory services rendered up until the time J.P. Morgan delivered its opinion, and the remainder
of which is contingent upon the consummation of the mergers.

Interests of Idera Directors, Executive Officers and Certain of their Affiliates in the Mergers (see page 99)

        In considering the recommendation of the Idera board, Idera stockholders should be aware that certain of Idera's executive
officers, directors and certain of their affiliates have interests in the mergers that may be different from, or in addition to, those of
the Idera stockholders generally. These interests may present such executive officers, directors and certain of their affiliates with
actual or potential conflicts of interest. The Idera board was aware of these interests during its deliberations on the merits of the
mergers and in deciding to recommend that Idera stockholders vote for the Idera proposals. For additional information on the
interests of Idera's directors, officers and certain of their affiliates in the mergers, see "The Mergers—Interests of Idera Directors,
Executive Officers and Certain of their Affiliates in the Mergers" beginning on page 99 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

Interests of BioCryst Directors and Executive Officers in the Mergers (see page 106)

        In considering the recommendation of the BioCryst board, BioCryst stockholders should be aware that certain of BioCryst's
executive officers and directors have interests in the mergers that may be different from, or in addition to, those of the BioCryst
stockholders generally. These interests may present such executive officers and directors with actual or potential conflicts of
interest. The BioCryst board was aware of these interests during its deliberations on the merits of the mergers and in deciding to
recommend that BioCryst stockholders vote for the BioCryst proposals. For additional information on the interests of BioCryst's

Holdco Board, Management and Certain Governance Matters Following the Mergers (see page 114)

        Immediately following the effective time of the mergers, the board of the combined company will consist of nine members,
including: Vincent J. Milano, a director and the current chief executive officer of Idera, James A. Geraghty, the current chairman of
the Idera board, Maxine Gowen, Ph.D., a director of Idera, Mark Goldberg, M.D., a director of Idera, Jon P. Stonehouse, a director
and the current chief executive officer of BioCryst, Robert A. Ingram, the current chairman of the BioCryst board, Nancy
Hutson, Ph.D., a director of BioCryst, Kenneth B. Lee, Jr., a director of BioCryst, and one person to be mutually agreed to by the
Idera board and the BioCryst board who shall not be a director, officer or affiliate of either Idera or BioCryst. All directors, other
than Messrs. Milano and Stonehouse, will qualify as "independent directors" under the Nasdaq rules.

        Upon completion of the mergers, Mr. Ingram will serve as the chairman of the board of the combined company, and
Mr. Milano will serve as the chief executive officer of the combined company.

        The corporate headquarters for the combined company and its subsidiaries will be located in Exton, Pennsylvania, and the
primary location for research and development for the combined company and its subsidiaries will be located in Birmingham,
Alabama.

Regulatory Clearances Required for the Mergers (see page 114)

        BioCryst and Idera have each agreed to take certain actions in order to obtain the regulatory clearances required to complete
the mergers. Required regulatory clearances include expiration or termination of the required waiting period under the Hart-Scott
Rodino Antitrust Improvement Act of 1976, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the "HSR Act"),
following required notifications and review by either the Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC") or the Antitrust Division of the
U.S. Department of Justice (the "Antitrust Division"). On February 2, 2018, each of BioCryst and Idera filed its notification under
the HSR Act. On February 15, 2018, the FTC notified Idera and BioCryst that their request for early termination of the applicable
waiting period was granted, thereby satisfying the condition under the merger agreement relating to the expiration or termination of
the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act.

        The antitrust and competition laws of certain foreign countries often apply to transactions such as the mergers, and
notifications may be required when such laws are applicable. However, BioCryst and Idera do not believe that any such foreign
antitrust filings are required in connection with the mergers, and accordingly, the obligations of BioCryst and Idera to consummate
the mergers are not subject to conditions precedent related to any such foreign antitrust filings.

Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of Holdco (see page 99)

        The amended and restated certificate of incorporation of Holdco (the "Holdco charter") will be in substantially the same form
attached as Annex D to this joint proxy statement/prospectus. Please see the section entitled "Comparison of Rights of Idera
Stockholders, BioCryst Stockholders and Holdco Stockholders" beginning on page 164 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus for
a discussion of the Holdco charter.

Completion of the Mergers (see page 117)

        BioCryst and Idera are working to complete the mergers as soon as practicable and expect the closing of the mergers to occur
in the third quarter of 2018. However, the mergers are subject to the satisfaction or waiver of various conditions, and it is possible
that factors outside the control of BioCryst and Idera could result in the mergers being completed at a later time or not at all. There
may be a substantial amount of time between the BioCryst and Idera special meetings and the completion of the mergers.

The Merger Agreement 

Merger Consideration (see page 116)

        At the effective time of the mergers, each issued and outstanding share of Idera common stock (other than shares held by Idera,
BioCryst, Holdco, Merger Sub A or Merger Sub B, or any subsidiary of each of the aforementioned entities, or by Idera as treasury
shares, which will cease to remain outstanding and will be canceled and retired and cease to exist) will be converted into the right to
receive 0.20 fully paid and nonassessable shares of Holdco common stock, with cash paid in lieu of fractional shares.

        At the effective time of the mergers, each issued and outstanding share of Idera preferred stock (other than shares held by Idera,
BioCryst, Holdco, Merger Sub A or Merger Sub B, or any subsidiary of each of the aforementioned entities, or by Idera as treasury
shares, which will cease to remain outstanding and will be canceled and retired and cease to exist) will be converted into the right to
receive an amount of fully paid and nonassessable shares of Holdco common stock equal to (i) $1.00 divided by the 20-trading-day
average trading price of Idera common stock, ending with the trading day prior to the third day prior to the closing date, multiplied
by (ii) 0.20, with cash paid in lieu of fractional shares.

        At the effective time of the mergers, each issued outstanding share of BioCryst common stock (other than shares held by Idera,
BioCryst, Holdco, Merger Sub A or Merger Sub B, or any subsidiary of each of the aforementioned entities, or by BioCryst as
treasury shares, which will cease to remain outstanding and will be canceled and retired and cease to exist) will be converted into
the right to receive 0.50 fully paid and nonassessable shares of Holdco common stock, with cash paid in lieu of fractional shares.

No Solicitation of Competing Proposals (see page 123)

        The merger agreement prohibits BioCryst and Idera from soliciting or engaging in discussions or negotiations with a third
party with respect to a proposal for a competing transaction, including the acquisition of a significant interest in BioCryst common
stock or assets or Idera common stock or assets. However, if, prior to obtaining approval from its stockholders, BioCryst or Idera, as
the case may be, receives an unsolicited written proposal from a third party for a competing transaction that the BioCryst board or
the Idera board, as applicable, among other things, determines in good faith (i) after consultation with its outside legal and financial
advisors, is reasonably likely to lead to a proposal that is superior to the mergers and (ii) after consultation with its outside legal
advisors, the failure to enter discussions regarding such proposal would constitute a breach of its fiduciary obligations under
applicable law, BioCryst or Idera, as applicable, may furnish non-public information to and enter into discussions with, and only
with, that third party regarding such competing transaction.

Treatment of Idera Stock Options and Warrants (see page 128)

        Idera Stock Options.    As of the effective time of the mergers, each Idera stock option that is outstanding and unexercised
immediately prior to the effective time of the mergers, whether or not then vested or exercisable, will be assumed by Holdco and
converted into a Holdco stock option. In addition, each such stock option will vest in full, other than Idera stock options held by an
individual who is a party to a Severance and Change of Control Agreement (each, a "Severance and Change of Control
Agreement"). Each converted Holdco stock option will be subject to the same terms and conditions (other than, in the case described
above, vesting) as applied to the original Idera stock option immediately prior to the effective time of the mergers, except that it will
be exercisable for that number of whole shares of Holdco common stock (rounded down to the nearest whole share) equal to the
number of shares subject to the Idera stock option multiplied by the Idera exchange ratio (0.20), at an exercise price per share

the Code, as described in the merger agreement.

        Idera Warrants.    At the effective time of the mergers, each outstanding Idera warrant and Idera pre-funded warrant to
purchase shares of Idera common stock ("Idera warrants") will be assumed by Holdco and converted into a warrant to acquire
Holdco common stock on the same terms and conditions as applied to the Idera warrants immediately prior to the completion of the
mergers, except that each Idera warrant and Idera pre-funded warrant (i) will cover a number of whole shares of Holdco common
stock (rounded down to the nearest whole share) equal to the number of shares of Idera common stock subject to the Idera warrant
or Idera pre-funded warrant, as applicable, multiplied by 0.20, and (ii) will have an exercise price per share of Holdco common
stock (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to the per share exercise price of the Idera warrant or Idera pre-funded warrant,
as applicable, divided by 0.20.

Treatment of BioCryst Stock Options and RSUs (see page 129)

        BioCryst Stock Options.    As of the effective time of the mergers, each BioCryst stock option that is outstanding and
unexercised immediately prior to the effective time of the mergers, whether or not then vested or exercisable, will vest in full and be
assumed by Holdco and converted into a Holdco stock option. Each converted option will be subject to the same terms and
conditions (other than vesting) as applied to the original BioCryst stock option immediately prior to the effective time of the
mergers, except that it will be exercisable for that number of whole shares of Holdco common stock (rounded down to the nearest
whole share) equal to the number of shares subject to the BioCryst stock option multiplied by the BioCryst exchange ratio (0.50), at
an exercise price per share (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to the exercise price per share applicable to the BioCryst
stock option divided by BioCryst exchange ratio. This treatment will be subject to certain provisions of the Code, as described in the
merger agreement.

        BioCryst RSUs.    As of the effective time of the mergers, each restricted stock unit covering BioCryst common stock (a
"BioCryst RSU") that is outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the mergers will be assumed by Holdco and will vest
in full and be converted into a restricted stock unit covering Holdco common stock (a "Holdco RSU"). Each converted Holdco RSU
will be subject to the same terms and conditions (other than vesting) as applied to the original BioCryst RSU immediately prior to
the effective time of the mergers, except that it will be a restricted stock unit to acquire that number of whole shares of Holdco
common stock (rounded down to the nearest whole share) equal to the number of shares subject to the BioCryst RSU multiplied the
BioCryst exchange ratio.

• with respect to Idera's obligation, Idera's receipt of an opinion from Latham to the effect that the mergers together
will be treated as an "exchange" described in Section 351 of the Code.

Termination of the Merger Agreement (see page 133)

        BioCryst and Idera may mutually agree to terminate the merger agreement at any time. Either company may also terminate the
merger agreement if the mergers are not completed by July 21, 2018 (regardless of whether such date is before or after the
stockholders of the party approve the transactions). See the section entitled "The Merger Agreement—Termination of the Merger
Agreement" beginning on page 133 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus for a discussion of these and other rights of each of
BioCryst and Idera to terminate the merger agreement.

Expenses and Termination Fees (see page 134)

        Generally, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the
merger agreement will be paid by the party incurring those expenses, subject to the specific exceptions discussed in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus where (i) BioCryst may be required to pay a termination fee of $25 million to Idera and Idera may be required
to pay a termination fee of $25 million to BioCryst and (ii) either company may be required to pay the other company a fixed
expense reimbursement amount of $6 million. See the section entitled "The Merger Agreement—Expenses and Termination Fees;
Liability for Breach" beginning on page 134 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus for a discussion of the circumstances under
which such termination fee will be required to be paid.

Voting and Support Agreements (see pages 37 and 45)

        Simultaneously with the execution of the merger agreement, each of BioCryst and Idera entered into a voting and support
agreement with affiliates of Baker Brothers. Baker Brothers and its affiliates own approximately 14% of issued and outstanding
BioCryst common stock and approximately 18% of issued and outstanding Idera common stock. Pursuant to the voting and support
agreements, Baker Brothers has agreed, among other things, to vote its shares of BioCryst common stock and Idera common stock
in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement at each of the BioCryst special meeting and the Idera special meeting respectively.
In addition, Baker Brothers has agreed to be present at each of the BioCryst special meeting and the Idera special meeting for
purposes of establishing a quorum.

Table of Contents

Accounting Treatment (see page 140)

        Holdco prepares its financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
("GAAP"). The mergers will be accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. Although the business combination of
Idera and BioCryst is a "merger of equals," GAAP requires that one of the two companies in the merger be designated as the
acquirer for accounting purposes based on the evidence available. Accordingly, Idera will be treated as the acquirer for accounting
purposes. In identifying Idera as the acquiring entity, the companies took into account the structure of the transaction, the
composition of the governing body of the combined company and the designation of certain senior management positions of the
combined company. As a result, the historical financial statements of Idera will become the historical financial statements of the
combined company.

No Appraisal Rights (see page 169)

        Under the DGCL, none of the holders of shares of Idera common stock, Idera preferred stock or BioCryst common stock are
entitled to exercise any appraisal rights in connection with the mergers or the other transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement.

Litigation Related to the Mergers (see page 115) 

        Since the announcement on January 22, 2018 of the execution of the merger agreement, three putative class action complaints
have been filed in connection with the mergers. On March 6, 2018 plaintiff Melvin Klein filed a lawsuit captioned Klein v. BioCryst
Pharmaceuticals, Inc., et al., No. 1:18-cv-00358, in United States District Court for the District of Delaware, naming BioCryst,
members of the BioCryst board, Idera, Holdco, Merger Sub A and Merger Sub B as defendants. On March 14, 2018, plaintiff Lisa
Raatz filed a lawsuit captioned Raatz v. Idera Pharmaceuticals, Inc., et al., No. 1:18-cv-10485, in United States District Court for
the District of Massachusetts, naming Idera, members of the Idera board, BioCryst, Holdco, Merger Sub A and Merger Sub B as
defendants. On March 22, 2018, plaintiff Ricky Cohen filed a lawsuit captioned Cohen v. Idera Pharmaceuticals, Inc., et al., No.
1:18-cv-00428, in United States District Court for the District of Delaware, naming Idera and members of the Idera board as
defendants.

Risk Factors (see page 22)

        In deciding how to vote your shares of Idera common stock or BioCryst common stock, you should read carefully this entire
joint proxy statement/prospectus, including the documents incorporated by reference herein and the annexes and exhibits hereto,
and in particular, you should read the "Risk Factors" section beginning on page 22 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus. See also
"Where You Can Find More Information" beginning on page 172 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

Comparison of Rights of Idera Stockholders, BioCryst Stockholders and Holdco Stockholders (see page 164)

        Idera stockholders and BioCryst stockholders receiving merger consideration will have rights different from their rights prior
to the effective time of the mergers once they become stockholders of the combined company due to differences between the
governing corporate documents of Idera and BioCryst, respectively, and the proposed governing corporate documents of Holdco.
Please see the section entitled "Comparison of Rights of Idera Stockholders, BioCryst Stockholders and Holdco Stockholders"
beginning on page 164 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus for a discussion of these differences.

Listing of Holdco Common Stock; De-Listing and Deregistration of Idera Stock and BioCryst Stock (see page 115)

        It is a condition to the completion of the mergers that the shares of Holdco common stock to be issued to Idera stockholders
and BioCryst stockholders pursuant to the mergers be authorized for listing, and Idera and BioCryst have agreed to use their
reasonable best efforts to cause such shares to be listed, on the Nasdaq subject to official notice of issuance. Upon completion of the
mergers, shares of Idera common stock and shares of BioCryst common stock currently listed on the Nasdaq will cease to be listed
on the Nasdaq and will be subsequently deregistered under the Exchange Act.

The Idera Special Meeting (see page 44)

        The Idera special meeting is scheduled to be held at Idera'a offices located at 505 Eagleview Boulevard, Suite 212, Exton,
Pennsylvania 19341 on July 10, 2018 at 10:00 a.m., Eastern Time, subject to any adjournments or postponements thereof. The Idera
special meeting is being held in order to consider and vote on:

• the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, which is further described in the sections titled "The Mergers" and "The
Merger Agreement," beginning on pages 53 and 116, respectively, of this joint proxy statement/prospectus; and 

• the proposal to approve, on a non-binding advisory basis, the compensation that may become payable to Idera's
named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the mergers.

        Only holders of record of Idera common stock at the close of business on May 29, 2018, the record date for the Idera special
meeting, are entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the Idera special meeting or any adjournments or postponements thereof. At the
close of business on the Idera record date, 217,310,991 shares of Idera common stock were issued and outstanding, approximately
18% of which were held by Idera's directors and executive officers and their affiliates. We currently expect that Idera's directors and
executive officers will vote their shares in favor of each proposal being submitted to a vote of the Idera stockholders at the Idera
special meeting, although no director or executive officer has entered into any agreement obligating him or her to do so.

        You may cast one vote for each share of Idera common stock you own. The proposal to adopt the merger agreement requires
the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of Idera common stock entitled to vote on the
proposal. Assuming a quorum is present, approval of, on a non-binding advisory basis, the compensation that may become payable
to Idera's named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the mergers requires the affirmative vote of the holders of
a majority of the shares of Idera common stock present represented in person or by proxy at the Idera special meeting and voting on
the proposal, although such vote will not be binding on Idera, the Idera board or any of its committees, or, following completion of
the mergers, the combined company.

        If a quorum is not present, the Idera special meeting may be adjourned by the chairman of the Idera special meeting, to
reconvene at the same or another place, and notice need not be given of any such adjourned meeting if the time and place thereof
are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken.

The BioCryst Special Meeting (see page 35)

        The BioCryst special meeting is scheduled to be held at BioCryst's corporate offices at 4505 Emperor Blvd., Suite 200,
Durham, North Carolina 27703 on July 10, 2018 at 10:00 a.m.,

thereof. At the close of business on the BioCryst record date, 98,821,091 shares of BioCryst common stock were issued and
outstanding, approximately 1% of which were held by BioCryst's directors and executive officers and their affiliates. We currently

        If a quorum is not present, the BioCryst special meeting may be adjourned by the vote of the holders of a majority of the shares
of BioCryst common stock present or represented by proxy and entitled to vote, to reconvene at the same or another place. If a
quorum is present at the BioCryst special meeting but there are not sufficient votes at the time of the BioCryst special meeting to
adopt the merger agreement, then BioCryst stockholders may be asked to vote on the BioCryst adjournment proposal. Notice need
not be given of any such adjourned meeting if the time and place thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is
taken.

UNAUDITED EQUIVALENT AND COMPARATIVE PER SHARE DATA 

        Presented below are BioCryst's and Idera's historical per share data for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and the year ended
December 31, 2017 and unaudited pro forma combined per share data for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and the year ended
December 31, 2017. This information should be read together with the consolidated financial statements, in the case of BioCryst, the
financial statements, in the case of Idera, and related notes of BioCryst and Idera that are incorporated by reference in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus and with the unaudited pro forma combined financial data included under "Selected Unaudited Pro Forma
Condensed Combined Financial Information of Idera and BioCryst" beginning on page 141 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus. The
pro forma information is presented for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the operating results or financial
position that would have occurred if the mergers had been completed as of the beginning of the periods presented, nor is it necessarily
indicative of the future operating results or financial position of the combined company. The historical book value per share is computed
by dividing total stockholders' equity (deficit) by the number of shares of common stock issued and outstanding at the end of the period.
The pro forma income (loss) per share of the combined company is computed by dividing the pro forma income (loss) by the pro forma
weighted average number of shares issued and outstanding. The pro forma book value per share of the combined company is computed by
dividing total pro forma stockholders' equity (deficit) by the pro forma number of shares of common stock issued and outstanding at the
end of the period. The unaudited pro forma equivalent per share financial information for each company is computed by multiplying the
Holdco unaudited pro forma combined per share amounts by the respective exchange ratio (0.20 shares of Holdco common stock for each
share of Idera common stock and 0.50 shares of Holdco common stock for each share of BioCryst common stock).

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

        This joint proxy statement/prospectus and the documents incorporated by reference into this joint proxy statement/prospectus contain,
in addition to historical information, forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities law regarding, among other
things, future events or the future financial performance of Idera and BioCryst. Such statements are based upon current plans, estimates
and expectations that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. The inclusion of forward-looking statements should not be regarded as
a representation that such plans, estimates and expectations will be achieved. Words such as "anticipate," "expect," "project," "intend,"
"believe," "may," "will," "should," "plan," "could," "target," "contemplate," "estimate," "predict," "potential" and words and terms of
similar substance used in connection with any discussion of future plans, actions or events identify forward-looking statements.

        Forward-looking statements relating to the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement include, but are not limited to:
statements about the benefits of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement between Idera and BioCryst, including future
financial and operating results; Idera's and BioCryst's plans, objectives, expectations and intentions; the expected timing of completion of
the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement; and other statements relating to the mergers that are not historical facts. Forward-
looking statements are based on information currently available to Idera and BioCryst and involve estimates, expectations and projections.
Investors are cautioned that all such forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, and important factors could cause
actual events or results to differ materially from Idera's and BioCryst's plans. With respect to the transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement between Idera and BioCryst, these factors, in addition to those set forth under "Risk Factors," beginning on page 22 of this joint
proxy statement/prospectus, could include, but are not limited to: Idera or BioCryst may be unable to obtain stockholder approval as
required for the mergers; conditions to the closing of the mergers may not be satisfied; the mergers may involve unexpected costs,
liabilities or delays; the effect of the announcement of the mergers on the ability of Idera or BioCryst to retain and hire key personnel and
maintain relationships with patients, doctors and others with whom Idera or BioCryst does business, or on Idera's or BioCryst's operating
results and business generally; Idera's or BioCryst's respective businesses may suffer as a result of uncertainty surrounding the mergers and
disruption of management's attention due to the mergers; the outcome of any legal proceedings related to the mergers; Idera or BioCryst
may be adversely affected by other economic, business, and/or competitive factors; the occurrence of any event, change or other
circumstances that could give rise to the termination of the merger agreement; risks that the mergers disrupt current plans and operations
and the potential difficulties in employee retention as a result of the mergers; the risk that Idera or BioCryst may be unable to obtain
governmental and regulatory approvals required for the transactions, or that required governmental and regulatory approvals may delay the
transactions or result in the imposition of conditions that could reduce the anticipated benefits from the transactions contemplated by the
merger agreement or cause the parties to abandon the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement; risks that the anticipated
benefits of the mergers or other commercial opportunities may otherwise not be fully realized or may take longer to realize than expected;
the impact of legislative, regulatory, competitive and technological changes; risks relating to the value of the new holding company shares
to be issued in the mergers; expectations for future clinical trials, the timing and potential outcomes of clinical studies and interactions
with regulatory authorities; other risks to the consummation of the mergers, including the risk that the mergers will not be consummated
within the expected time period or at all; the risk that the credit ratings of the combined company or its subsidiaries may be different from
what the companies expect; economic and foreign exchange rate volatility; the continued strength of the medical and pharmaceutical
markets; the timing, success and market reception for Idera's and BioCryst's products; the possibility of new technologies outdating Idera's
or BioCryst's products; continued support of Idera's or BioCryst's products by influential medical professionals; reliance on and integration
of information technology systems; the risks associated with assumptions the parties make in

connection with the parties' critical accounting estimates and legal proceedings; and the potential of international unrest, economic
downturn or effects of currencies, tax assessments, tax adjustments, anticipated tax rates, raw material costs or availability, benefit or
retirement plan costs, or other regulatory compliance costs.

        Additional factors that may affect the future results of Idera and BioCryst are set forth in their respective filings with the SEC,
including each of Idera's and BioCryst's most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K and any amendments thereto, subsequent
Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and other filings with the SEC, which are available on the SEC's website
at www.sec.gov. See in particular Item 1A of Idera's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 under the
heading "Risk Factors" and Item 1A of BioCryst's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three months ended March 31, 2018, under the
heading "Risk Factors." The risks and uncertainties described above and in Idera's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and
BioCryst's most recent Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, are not exclusive and further information concerning Idera and BioCryst and their
respective businesses, including factors that potentially could materially affect their respective businesses, financial condition or operating
results, may emerge from time to time. Readers should also carefully review the risk factors described in other documents that Idera and
BioCryst file from time to time with the SEC.

        Many of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions are beyond Idera's or BioCryst's ability to control or predict. Because of these
risks, uncertainties and assumptions, you should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. Furthermore, forward-
looking statements speak only as of the information currently available to the parties on the date they are made, and neither Idera nor
BioCryst undertakes any obligation to update publicly or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that
may arise after the date of this communication. Nothing in this communication is intended, or is to be construed, as a profit forecast or to
be interpreted to mean that earnings per Idera share or BioCryst share for the current or any future financial years or those of the combined
company, will necessarily match or exceed the historical published earnings per Idera share or BioCryst share, as applicable. Neither Idera
nor BioCryst gives any assurance (1) that either Idera, BioCryst or the combined company will achieve its expectations, or (2) concerning
any result or the timing thereof, in each case, with respect to any regulatory action, administrative proceedings, government investigations,
litigation, warning letters, consent decree, cost reductions, business strategies, earnings or revenue trends or future financial results. All
subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements concerning Idera, BioCryst, the transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement, the combined company or other matters and attributable to Idera or BioCryst or any person acting on their behalf are expressly
qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements above.

RISK FACTORS 

        In addition to the other information included and incorporated by reference in this joint proxy statement/prospectus, including the
matters addressed in the section entitled "Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements," you should carefully consider
the following risks before deciding how to vote. In addition, you should read and consider the risks associated with each of the businesses
of Idera and BioCryst because these risks will also affect the combined company. These risks can be found in the Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, in the case of Idera, and in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2017, and any amendments thereto, in the case of BioCryst, as such risks may be updated or supplemented in each
company's subsequently filed Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q or Current Reports on Form 8-K, which are incorporated by reference into
this joint proxy statement/prospectus. You should also read and consider the other information in this joint proxy statement/prospectus and
the other documents incorporated by reference in this joint proxy statement/prospectus. See the section entitled "Where You Can Find
More Information" beginning on page 172 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

Risk Factors Relating to the Mergers 

BioCryst stockholders and Idera stockholders cannot be sure of the value of the merger consideration they will receive.

        BioCryst stockholders and Idera stockholders will receive a fixed number of shares of Holdco common stock in the BioCryst merger
and the Idera merger, respectively, rather than a number of shares of Holdco common stock with a particular fixed market value. The
market values of BioCryst common stock and Idera common stock at the effective time may vary significantly from their prices on the
date prior to the date the merger agreement was executed, the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus or the date on which BioCryst
stockholders and Idera stockholders vote on the proposal to adopt the merger agreement. Because the exchange ratios are fixed and will
not be adjusted to reflect any changes in the market prices of BioCryst common stock or Idera common stock, the market value of the
Holdco common stock issued in the BioCryst merger or the Idera merger, as applicable, and the BioCryst common stock and Idera
common stock surrendered in the BioCryst merger and the Idera merger, respectively, may be higher or lower than the values of these
shares on earlier dates. All of the merger consideration to be received by BioCryst stockholders and Idera stockholders will be Holdco
common stock (other than cash in lieu of fractional shares received by BioCryst stockholders and Idera stockholders). At the time of the
special meetings, BioCryst stockholders and Idera stockholders will not know or be able to determine the value of the Holdco common
stock they may receive upon completion of the mergers. Changes in the market prices of BioCryst common stock and Idera common stock
may result from a variety of factors that are beyond the control of BioCryst or Idera, including changes in their respective businesses,
operations and prospects, regulatory considerations, governmental actions, and legal proceedings and other developments. Market
assessments of the benefits of the mergers, the likelihood that the mergers will be completed and general and industry-specific market and
economic conditions may also have an effect on the market price of BioCryst common stock and Idera common stock. Changes in market
prices of BioCryst common stock and Idera common stock may also be caused by fluctuations and developments affecting industry-
specific and general economic and market conditions and may have an adverse effect on BioCryst common stock and Idera common stock
prior to the consummation of the mergers.

        Neither BioCryst nor Idera is permitted to terminate the merger agreement solely because of changes in the market prices of either
party's common stock. In addition, the market values of BioCryst common stock and Idera common stock may vary significantly from the
date of the special meetings to the date of the completion of the mergers. You are urged to obtain up-to-date prices for BioCryst common
stock and Idera common stock. There is no assurance that the mergers will be completed, that there will not be a delay in the completion of
the mergers or that all or any of the anticipated benefits of the mergers will be obtained. For ranges of historic prices of BioCryst common
stock and Idera common stock, see "Comparative Stock Price Data and Dividends" beginning on page 154 of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus.

Table of Contents

The market price for Holdco common stock may be affected by factors different from those that historically have affected BioCryst
common stock and Idera common stock.

        Upon completion of the mergers, holders of shares of BioCryst common stock (other than any shares held in treasury), holders of
shares of Idera common stock (other than any shares held in treasury) and holders of Idera preferred stock will become holders of shares of
Holdco common stock. BioCryst and Idera each have businesses that differ from each other. Accordingly, the results of operations of
Holdco will be affected by some factors that are different from those currently affecting the results of operations of each of BioCryst and
Idera. For a discussion of the businesses of BioCryst and Idera and of some important factors to consider in connection with those
businesses, see the documents incorporated by reference in this joint proxy statement/prospectus and referred to under "Where You Can
Find More Information" beginning on page 172 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

Any delay in completing the mergers may reduce or eliminate the benefits expected to be achieved thereunder.

        The mergers are subject to a number of conditions beyond BioCryst's and Idera's control that may prevent, delay or otherwise
materially adversely affect their completion. We cannot predict whether and when these other conditions will be satisfied. Any delay in
completing the mergers could cause the combined company not to realize, or to be delayed in realizing, some or all of the synergies and
other benefits that we expect to achieve if the mergers are successfully completed within their expected time frame. See "The Merger
Agreement—Conditions to Completion of the Mergers" beginning on page 131 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

BioCryst and Idera will be subject to business uncertainties while the mergers are pending, which may cause a loss of management
personnel and other key employees which could adversely affect the future business and operations of the combined company.

        Uncertainty about the completion or effect of the mergers may affect the relationship between BioCryst and Idera and their respective
patients, doctors, licensors and licensees and may have an adverse effect on BioCryst and/or Idera, and consequently on the combined
company. These uncertainties may cause patients, doctors, licensors and others that deal with the parties to seek to change existing
business relationships with them and to delay or defer decisions concerning BioCryst or Idera. Changes to existing business relationships,
including termination or modification, could negatively affect each of BioCryst's and Idera's revenues, earnings and cash flow, as well as
the market price of its common stock.

        BioCryst and Idera are dependent on the experience and industry knowledge of their respective officers and other key employees to
execute their business plans. The combined company's success after the mergers will depend in part upon the ability of BioCryst and Idera
to retain key management personnel and other key employees. Current and prospective employees of BioCryst and Idera may experience
uncertainty about their roles within the combined company following the mergers, which may have an adverse effect on the ability of each
of BioCryst and Idera to attract or retain key management and other key personnel. If key employees depart because of issues related to
the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain with the businesses, the combined company's business following the
consummation of the mergers could be negatively impacted. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that the combined company will be
able to attract or retain key management personnel and other key employees of BioCryst and Idera to the same extent that BioCryst and
Idera have previously been able to attract or retain their own employees. A failure by BioCryst, Idera or, following the completion of the
mergers, the combined company to attract, retain and motivate executives and other key employees during the period prior to or after the
completion of the mergers could have a negative impact on their respective businesses.

Table of Contents

BioCryst and Idera will be subject to certain contractual restrictions while the mergers are pending.

        The merger agreement restricts each of BioCryst and Idera from making certain acquisitions and divestitures, entering into certain
contracts, incurring certain indebtedness and expenditures, paying dividends, repurchasing or issuing securities outside of existing equity
award programs, and taking other specified actions, if outside the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice, until the earlier
of the completion of the mergers or the termination of the merger agreement without the consent of the other party. These restrictions may
prevent BioCryst and/or Idera from pursuing attractive business opportunities that may arise prior to the completion of the mergers and
could have the effect of delaying or preventing other strategic transactions. Adverse effects arising from the pendency of the mergers could
be exacerbated by any delays in consummation of the mergers or the termination of the merger agreement. See the section entitled "The
Merger Agreement—Conduct of Business Pending the Effective Time" beginning on page 120 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

Third parties may terminate or alter existing contracts or relationships with BioCryst or Idera.

        Each of BioCryst and Idera has contracts with doctors, vendors, landlords, licensors, joint venture partners, and other business
partners which may require BioCryst or Idera, as applicable, to obtain consent from these other parties in connection with the mergers. If
these consents cannot be obtained, the counterparties to these contracts and other third parties with which BioCryst and/or Idera currently
have relationships may have the ability to terminate, reduce the scope of or otherwise materially adversely alter their relationships with
either or both parties in anticipation of the mergers, or with the combined company following the mergers. The pursuit of such rights may
result in BioCryst, Idera or the combined company suffering a loss of potential future revenue or incurring liabilities in connection with a
breach of such agreements and may lose rights that are material to its business. Any such disruptions could limit the combined company's
ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the mergers. The adverse effect of such disruptions could also be exacerbated by a delay in the
completion of the mergers or the termination of the merger agreement.

Idera or BioCryst may waive one or more of the closing conditions without re-soliciting stockholder approval.

        Idera or BioCryst may determine to waive, in whole or in part, one or more of the conditions to its obligations to consummate the
mergers. Idera or BioCryst currently expect to evaluate the materiality of any waiver and its effect on Idera stockholders or BioCryst
stockholders, as applicable, in light of the facts and circumstances at the time to determine whether any amendment of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus or any re-solicitation of proxies or voting cards is required in light of such waiver. Any determination whether to
waive any condition to the mergers or as to re-soliciting stockholder approval or amending this joint proxy statement/prospectus as a result
of a waiver will be made by Idera or BioCryst, as applicable, at the time of such waiver based on the facts and circumstances as they exist
at that time.

The merger agreement may be terminated in accordance with its terms and the mergers may not be completed.

        The completion of the mergers is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of a number of conditions. Those conditions include: (i) the
adoption of the merger agreement by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of all issued and outstanding shares of Idera common
stock and BioCryst common stock, respectively, entitled to vote thereon; (ii) the authorization of the shares of Holdco common stock to be
issued to Idera stockholders and BioCryst stockholders for listing on the Nasdaq, subject to official notice of issuance; (iii) the
effectiveness of the registration statement of which this joint proxy statement/prospectus forms a part and the absence of any stop order in
respect thereof; (iv) the absence of certain governmental restraints or prohibitions preventing consummation of the mergers; (v) the receipt
of certain regulatory approvals under competition laws, including the termination or expiration of the waiting period under the HSR Act;
(vi) the truth and correctness of

Table of Contents

the representations and warranties made by both parties (generally subject to certain materiality and material adverse effect qualifiers);
(vii) the receipt by both parties of a certificate certifying that the aforementioned representations and warranties conditions and
performance conditions have been satisfied; (viii) the performance by Idera and BioCryst of their respective obligations under the merger
agreement in all material respects; (ix) the receipt by BioCryst of an opinion from Skadden to the effect that the BioCryst merger will
qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code or, alternatively, the mergers together will be treated as an
"exchange" described in Section 351 of the Code; and (x) the receipt by Idera of an opinion from Latham to the effect that the mergers
together will be treated as an "exchange" described in Section 351 of the Code.

        These conditions to the closing may not be fulfilled and, accordingly, the mergers may not be completed. In addition, if the mergers
are not completed by July 21, 2018, either Idera or BioCryst may choose not to proceed with the mergers and to terminate the merger
agreement, and the parties can mutually decide to terminate the merger agreement at any time prior to the consummation of the mergers,
before or after the required Idera stockholder and BioCryst stockholder approvals. In addition, Idera or BioCryst may elect to terminate the
merger agreement in certain other circumstances. If the merger agreement is terminated, Idera and BioCryst may incur substantial fees in
connection with termination of the merger agreement, will not recognize the anticipated benefits of the mergers and each party may be
adversely affected by a number of factors including the inability to pursue other beneficial opportunities and the focus of their respective
managements on the mergers for an extended period of time rather than on management opportunities or other issues. The market price of
Idera common stock and/or BioCryst common stock might decline as a result of any such failures to the extent that the current market
prices reflect a market assumption that the mergers will be completed. See the section entitled "The Merger Agreement—Termination of
the Merger Agreement" beginning on page 133 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

BioCryst and Idera will incur significant transaction costs in connection with the mergers.

        BioCryst and Idera have incurred and expect to incur a number of nonrecurring costs associated with the mergers. These costs and
expenses include financial advisory, legal, accounting, consulting and other advisory fees and expenses, reorganization and restructuring
costs, severance/employee benefit-related expenses, public company filing fees and other regulatory expenses, printing expenses and other
related charges. Some of these costs are payable by BioCryst and Idera regardless of whether the mergers are completed.

Lawsuits have been filed against BioCryst and Idera challenging the mergers and an adverse ruling may prevent the mergers from
being completed.

        Three putative class action lawsuits have been brought by three stockholders of Idera and/or BioCryst challenging the mergers and
seeking, among other things, injunctive relief to enjoin the defendants from completing the mergers on the agreed-upon terms. Additional
lawsuits may be filed against BioCryst, Idera and/or their respective directors or officers in connection with the mergers. See "The Mergers
—Litigation Related to the Mergers" beginning on page 115 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus for more information about the
lawsuits that have been filed related to the mergers.

        One of the conditions to the closing of the mergers is the absence of any law, order, injunction, decree, statute, rule or regulation by a
governmental entity that prohibits, restrains or makes illegal the consummation of the mergers. Consequently, if a settlement or other
resolution is not reached in the lawsuits referenced above and the plaintiffs secure injunctive or other relief prohibiting, delaying or
otherwise adversely affecting the parties' ability to complete the mergers, then such injunctive or other relief may prevent the mergers from
becoming effective within the expected time frame or at all.

Failure to complete the mergers could negatively impact the stock prices and the future business and financial results of BioCryst and
Idera.

        Completion of the mergers is not assured and is subject to risks, including the risks that approval of the transactions by BioCryst
stockholders and Idera stockholders or by governmental entities will not be obtained or that certain other closing conditions will not be
satisfied. If the mergers are not completed, the ongoing businesses and financial results of BioCryst and/or Idera may be adversely affected
and BioCryst and/or Idera will be subject to several risks, including the following:

• having to pay certain significant costs relating to the mergers without receiving the benefits of the mergers, including, in
certain circumstances, a termination fee of $25 million or a fixed expense reimbursement amount of $6 million; 

• the potential loss of key personnel during the pendency of the mergers as employees may experience uncertainty about
their future roles with the combined company; 

• BioCryst and Idera will have been subject to certain restrictions on the conduct of their businesses which may have
prevented them from making certain acquisitions or dispositions or pursuing certain business opportunities while the
mergers were pending; and 

• having had the focus of each companies' management on the mergers instead of on pursuing other opportunities that could
have been beneficial to the companies.

        If the mergers are not completed, BioCryst and Idera cannot assure their stockholders that these risks will not materialize and will not
materially adversely affect the businesses, financial results and stock prices of BioCryst or Idera.

The merger agreement contains provisions that could discourage a potential competing acquirer of either BioCryst or Idera.

        The merger agreement contains "no shop" provisions that generally restrict each of BioCryst's and Idera's ability to solicit, initiate or
knowingly encourage and induce, or take any other action designed to facilitate competing third-party proposals relating to a merger,
reorganization or consolidation of the company or an acquisition of the company's stock or assets. Further, even if the BioCryst board or
the Idera board withdraws or qualifies its recommendation with respect to the mergers, BioCryst or Idera, as the case may be, will still be
required to submit each of their merger-related proposals to a vote at their respective special meetings. In addition, the other party
generally has an opportunity to offer to modify the terms of the merger agreement in response to any competing acquisition proposals
before the board of directors of the company that has received a third-party proposal may withdraw or qualify its recommendation with
respect to the mergers. In addition, under specified circumstances, BioCryst or Idera may be required to pay a termination fee of
$25 million and a fixed reimbursement amount of $6 million if the mergers are not consummated. See the sections entitled "The Merger
Agreement—No Solicitation of Competing Proposals," "The Merger Agreement—Termination of the Merger Agreement" and "The
Merger Agreement—Expenses and Termination Fees; Liability for Breach" beginning on pages 123, 133 and 134, respectively, of this
joint proxy statement/prospectus for a discussion of these provisions.

        These provisions could discourage a potential third-party acquirer that might have an interest in acquiring all or a significant portion
of BioCryst or Idera from considering or proposing that acquisition, even if it were prepared to pay consideration with a higher per share
cash or market value than the market value of Holdco shares to be received in the mergers or might result in a potential third-party acquirer
proposing to pay a lower price to the stockholders than it might otherwise have proposed to pay because of the added expense of the
$25 million termination fee and a fixed expense reimbursement amount of $6 million that may become payable in certain circumstances.

        If the merger agreement is terminated and either BioCryst or Idera determines to seek another business combination, it may not be
able to negotiate a transaction with another party on terms comparable to, or better than, the terms of the mergers.

The fairness opinions obtained by the BioCryst board and the Idera board from their financial advisors will not reflect changes in
circumstances between signing the merger agreement and the completion of the mergers.

        Neither the BioCryst board nor the Idera board has obtained an updated fairness opinion as of the date of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus from J.P. Morgan, BioCryst's financial advisor, or Goldman Sachs, Idera's financial advisor.

        Changes in the operations and prospects of BioCryst or Idera, general market and economic conditions and other factors that may be
beyond the control of BioCryst and Idera, and on which the fairness opinions were based, may alter the value of BioCryst or Idera or the
prices of shares of BioCryst common stock or Idera common stock by the time the mergers are completed. The opinions do not speak as of
the time the mergers will be completed or as of any date other than the dates of such opinions. Because neither BioCryst nor Idera
anticipates asking its financial advisor to update its opinion, the January 21, 2018 opinions do not and will not address the fairness of the
exchange ratios, from a financial point of view, at the time the mergers are completed. The Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan opinions are
attached as Annexes B and C, respectively, to this joint proxy statement/prospectus. For a description of the opinion that the BioCryst
board received from its financial advisor and a summary of the material financial analyses provided to the BioCryst board in connection
with rendering such opinion, please refer to "The Mergers—Opinion of BioCryst's Financial Advisor—J.P. Morgan" beginning on page 94
of this joint proxy statement/prospectus. For a description of the opinion that the Idera board received from its financial advisor and a
summary of the material financial analyses provided to the Idera board in connection with rendering such opinion, please refer to "The
Mergers—Opinion of Idera's Financial Advisor—Goldman Sachs" beginning on page 84 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus. For a
description of the other factors considered by the BioCryst board in determining to approve the merger agreement and the mergers, please
refer to "The Mergers—BioCryst's Reasons for the Mergers; Recommendation of the BioCryst Board" beginning on page 71 of this joint
proxy statement/prospectus. For a description of the other factors considered by the Idera board in determining to approve the mergers,
please refer to "The Mergers—Idera's Reasons for the Mergers; Recommendation of the Idera Board" beginning on page 67 of this joint
proxy statement/prospectus.

Executive officers and directors of each of BioCryst and Idera and certain affiliates of the executive officers and directors of Idera
have certain interests in the mergers that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of BioCryst stockholders and Idera
stockholders generally.

        BioCryst's executive officers and Idera's executive officers negotiated the terms of the merger agreement. For additional information
on these interests, see "The Mergers—Interests of BioCryst Directors and Executive Officers in the Mergers" and "The Mergers—Interests
of Idera Directors, Executive Officers and Certain of their Affiliates in the Mergers" beginning on pages 106 and 99, respectively, of this
joint proxy statement/prospectus.

        Immediately following the effective time of the mergers, the board of the combined company will be comprised of nine members,
consisting of: Mr. Milano, currently a director and the chief executive officer of Idera; Mr. Geraghty, currently the chairman of the Idera
board; Dr. Gowen, currently a director of Idera; Dr. Goldberg, currently a director of Idera; Mr. Stonehouse, currently a director and the
chief executive officer of BioCryst; Mr. Ingram, currently the chairman of the BioCryst board, who will serve as the chairman of the board
of the combined company; Dr. Hutson, currently a director of BioCryst; Mr. Lee, currently a director of BioCryst; and one person to be
mutually agreed by the Idera board and the BioCryst board who is not an officer, director or affiliate of either Idera or BioCryst.

Table of Contents

        The BioCryst and Idera boards were aware of these interests at the time each approved the mergers and the transactions contemplated
by the merger agreement. These interests, including the continued employment of certain executive officers of BioCryst and Idera by the
combined company, the continued positions of certain directors of BioCryst and Idera as directors of the combined company and the
indemnification of former directors and officers by the combined company, may cause BioCryst's and Idera's directors and executive
officers to view the proposal to adopt the merger agreement differently and more favorably than you may view it. See "The Mergers—
Interests of BioCryst Directors and Executive Officers in the Mergers—Continued Service with the Combined Company," "The Mergers—
Employee Benefits," "The Mergers—Interests of Idera Directors, Executive Officers and Certain of their Affiliates in the Mergers—
Employee Benefits" and "The Mergers—Interests of Idera Directors, Executive Officers and Certain of their Affiliates in the Mergers—
Indemnification and Insurance" beginning on pages 106, 112, 103 and 103, respectively, of this joint proxy statement/prospectus for more
information.

Current BioCryst stockholders and Idera stockholders will have a reduced ownership and voting interest in Holdco after the mergers
compared to their respective interest in Idera or BioCryst.

        Current holders of BioCryst common stock and Idera common stock have the right to vote in the election of the board of directors and
on other matters affecting BioCryst and Idera, respectively. Upon the completion of the mergers, each Idera stockholder and each BioCryst
stockholder who receives shares of Holdco common stock will become a stockholder of the combined company with a percentage
ownership of the combined company that is smaller than such stockholder's percentage ownership of Idera or BioCryst, respectively. It is
currently expected that the Idera stockholders immediately prior to the effective time of the mergers as a group will receive shares in the
mergers constituting approximately 48.4% of the shares of combined company common stock immediately after the mergers, and the
BioCryst stockholders immediately prior to the effective time of the mergers as a group will receive shares in the mergers constituting
approximately 51.6% of the shares of combined company common stock immediately after the mergers, each calculated on a fully diluted
basis using the treasury stock method.

Shares of Holdco common stock to be received by BioCryst stockholders in the BioCryst merger and Idera stockholders in the Idera
merger will have rights different from the shares of BioCryst common stock and Idera common stock, respectively.

        Upon completion of the mergers, BioCryst stockholders and Idera stockholders will no longer be BioCryst stockholders and/or Idera
stockholders, as applicable, but will instead be Holdco stockholders. The rights of former BioCryst stockholders and Idera stockholders
who become Holdco stockholders will be governed by the Holdco charter and the amended and restated bylaws of Holdco (the "Holdco
bylaws"), each of which will be adopted, effective upon the effective time, in substantially the form attached as Annex D and Annex E,
respectively, to this joint proxy statement/prospectus. The rights associated with shares of Holdco common stock are different from the
rights associated with shares of BioCryst common stock or Idera common stock. See "Comparison of Rights of Idera Stockholders,
BioCryst Stockholders and Holdco Stockholders" beginning on page 164 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

BioCryst stockholders and Idera stockholders will not be entitled to appraisal rights in the mergers.

        Appraisal rights are statutory rights that, if applicable under law, enable stockholders to dissent from an extraordinary transaction,
such as a merger, and to demand that the corporation pay the fair value for their shares as determined by a court in a judicial proceeding
instead of receiving the consideration offered to stockholders in connection with the extraordinary transaction. Under the DGCL,
stockholders do not have appraisal rights if the shares of stock they hold, as of the record date

for determination of stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting of stockholders to act upon a merger, are either (i) listed on a national
securities exchange or (ii) held of record by more than 2,000 holders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, appraisal rights are available if
stockholders are required by the terms of the merger agreement to accept for their shares anything other than (a) shares of stock of the
surviving corporation, (b) shares of stock of another corporation that will either be listed on a national securities exchange or held of
record by more than 2,000 holders, (c) cash instead of fractional shares or (d) any combination of clauses (a) through (c).

        Because BioCryst common stock is listed on the Nasdaq, a national securities exchange, and is expected to continue to be so listed on
the record date for the BioCryst special meeting, and because BioCryst stockholders will receive shares of Holdco common stock in the
BioCryst merger, which is expected to be listed on the Nasdaq upon the effective time, BioCryst stockholders will not be entitled to
appraisal rights in the BioCryst merger with respect to their shares of BioCryst common stock. Similarly, Idera common stock is listed on
the Nasdaq and is expected to continue to be so listed on the record date for the Idera special meeting. Because holders of Idera common
stock and Idera preferred stock will also receive shares of Holdco common stock in the Idera merger, holders of Idera common stock and
Idera preferred stock will also not be entitled to appraisal rights in the Idera merger with respect to their shares of Idera common stock or
Idera preferred stock, respectively.

Risk Factors Relating to the Combined Company Following the Mergers 

The combined company may be unable to integrate successfully the businesses of BioCryst and Idera and realize the anticipated
benefits of the mergers.

        The success of the mergers will depend, in large part, on the ability of the combined company to realize the anticipated benefits,
including cost savings, from combining the businesses of BioCryst and Idera. To realize these anticipated benefits, the businesses of
BioCryst and Idera must be integrated successfully. This integration will be complex and time consuming. The failure to successfully
integrate and manage the challenges presented by the integration process may result in the combined company not fully achieving the
anticipated benefits of the mergers. Potential difficulties the combined company may encounter as part of the integration process, many of
which may be beyond the control of management, include the following:

• the inability to successfully combine the businesses of BioCryst and Idera in a manner that permits the combined company
to achieve the full synergies anticipated to result from the mergers; 

• complexities and unanticipated issues associated with managing the combined businesses, including the challenge of
integrating complex systems, technology, networks, financial procedures, communications programs and other assets,
procedures or policies of each of the companies in a seamless manner that minimizes any adverse impact on patients,
doctors and other constituencies; 

• coordinating geographically separated organizations, systems and facilities; 

• difficulties in managing a larger combined company, addressing possible differences in business backgrounds, corporate
cultures and management philosophies and retaining key personnel; 

• unanticipated changes in applicable laws and regulations; 

• integrating the workforces of the two companies while maintaining focus on achieving strategic initiatives; 

• the possibility of faulty assumptions underlying expectations regarding the integration process; and

Table of Contents

• potential unknown liabilities and unforeseen increased or new expenses, delays or regulatory conditions associated with the
mergers.

        In addition, BioCryst and Idera have operated and, until the completion of the mergers, will continue to operate independently. It is
possible that the integration process could result in:

• ongoing diversion of the attention of each company's management; 

• latent impacts resulting from the diversion of BioCryst's and Idera's respective management teams attention from ongoing
business concerns as a result of the devotion of management's attention to the mergers and performance shortfalls at one or
both of the companies; 

• disruption of existing relationships patients, doctors and business partners, including in connection with ongoing clinical
trials; and 

• the disruption of, or the loss of momentum in, each company's ongoing clinical trials or discovery programs or
inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies, any of which could adversely affect each company's ability
to maintain relationships with patients, doctors, business partners, employees and other constituencies or BioCryst's and
Idera's ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the mergers, or which could adversely affect the business and financial
results of the combined company.

The market price of Holdco's common stock may be volatile, and holders of Holdco's common stock could lose a significant portion of
their investment due to drops in the market price of Holdco's common stock following completion of the mergers.

        The market price of the combined company's common stock may be volatile, and following completion of the mergers stockholders
may not be able to resell their Holdco common stock at or above the price at which they acquired the common stock pursuant to the
merger agreement or otherwise due to fluctuations in its market price, including changes in price caused by factors unrelated to the
combined company's operating performance or prospects.

        Specific factors that may have a significant effect on the market price for Holdco's common stock include, among others, the
following:

• changes in the stock market analyst recommendations or earnings estimates regarding the combined company's common
stock, other companies comparable to it or companies in the industries they serve; 

• actual or anticipated fluctuations in the combined company's operating results of future prospects; 

• reaction to public announcements by the combined company; 

• results of clinical trials, the timing and future outcome of clinical studies and interactions with regulatory authorities; 

• strategic actions taken by the combined company or its competitors, such as acquisitions or restructurings; 

• failure of the combined company to achieve the perceived benefits of the transactions, including financial results and
anticipated synergies, as rapidly as or to the extent anticipated by financial or industry analysts; 

• adverse conditions in the financial market or general U.S. or international economic conditions, including those results
from war, incidents of terrorism and responses to such events; and

• sales of common stock by the combined company, members of its management team or significant stockholders.

The future results of the combined company will suffer if the combined company does not effectively manage its operations following
the mergers.

        The combined company's future success depends, in part, upon its ability to manage the combined businesses of Idera and BioCryst,
which will pose substantial challenges for management, including challenges related to the management and monitoring of new
operations. There can be no assurances that the combined company will be successful or that it will realize the expected operating
efficiencies, cost savings and other benefits currently anticipated from the mergers.

The combined company is expected to incur substantial expenses related to the mergers and the integration of BioCryst and Idera.

        The combined company is expected to incur substantial expenses in connection with the mergers and the integration of BioCryst and
Idera. There are a large number of processes, policies, procedures, operations, technologies and systems that must be integrated, including
purchasing, accounting and finance, payroll, research and development and benefits. While BioCryst and Idera have assumed that a certain
level of expenses would be incurred, there are many factors beyond their control that could affect the total amount or the timing of the
integration expenses. Moreover, many of the expenses that will be incurred are, by their nature, difficult to estimate accurately. These
expenses could, particularly in the near term, exceed the savings that the combined company expects to achieve from the elimination of
duplicative expenses and the realization of economies of scale and cost savings. These integration expenses likely will result in the
combined company taking significant charges against earnings following the completion of the mergers, and the amount and timing of
such charges are uncertain at present.

Holdco has no operating or financial history and the unaudited pro forma combined financial information included in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus are preliminary. Therefore, the actual financial condition and results of operations of Holdco after the mergers
may differ materially.

        Holdco has been recently incorporated in connection with the mergers and has no operating history or revenues. This joint proxy
statement/prospectus includes unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements for Holdco as of the year ended
December 31, 2017, that combines the audited historical consolidated financial statements of BioCryst for the year ended December 31,
2017 with the audited historical financial statements of Idera for the year ended December 31, 2017, and unaudited pro forma condensed
combined financial statements for Holdco as of the three months ended March 31, 2018 that combines the unaudited historical
consolidated financial statements of BioCryst for the three months ended March 31, 2018 with the unaudited historical financial statements
of Idera for the three months ended March 31, 2018, in each case, adjusted to give effect to the mergers, and should be read in conjunction
with such financial statements and accompanying notes which are incorporated by reference in this joint proxy statement/prospectus. The
unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet of Holdco as of March 31, 2018 combines the audited historical balance sheets of
BioCryst and Idera as of March 31, 2018 and gives pro forma effect to the mergers as if they had been consummated on March 31, 2018.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 and for the three months
ended March 31, 2018 combines the BioCryst audited consolidated statements of operations and the Idera audited statements of operations
for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, and the BioCryst unaudited consolidated statements of operations and the Idera unaudited
statements of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2018, in each case, giving effect to the mergers as if they had been
consummated on January 1, 2017. The pro forma financial statements are presented for illustrative

purposes only, are based on certain assumptions, address a hypothetical situation and reflect limited historical financial data. The pro
forma financial statements do not include, among other things, estimated cost or growth synergies, adjustments related to restructuring or
integration activities, future acquisitions or disposals not yet known or probable, including those that may be required by regulatory or
governmental authorities in connection with the mergers, or impacts of merger-related change in control provisions that are currently not
factually supportable and/or probable of occurring. Therefore, the pro forma financial statements are presented for informational purposes
only and are not necessarily indicative of what the combined company's actual financial condition or results of operations would have been
had the mergers been completed on the dates indicated. Accordingly, Holdco's business, assets, results of operations and financial
condition may differ significantly from those indicated by the pro forma combined financial information included in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus. For more information, see "Selected Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information of Idera and
BioCryst" beginning on page 141 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

The financial analyses and forecasts considered by BioCryst and Idera and their respective financial advisors may not be realized,
which may adversely affect the market price of Holdco common stock following the completion of the mergers.

        In performing their financial analyses and rendering their opinions regarding the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the
BioCryst exchange ratio and Idera exchange ratio, as applicable, each of the respective financial advisors to BioCryst and Idera relied on,
among other things, internal standalone financial analyses and forecasts as separately provided to each respective financial advisor by
BioCryst and Idera. See "The Mergers—Certain Financial Forecasts Utilized by the BioCryst Board and BioCryst's Financial Advisor in
Connection with the Mergers" and "The Mergers—Certain Financial Forecasts Utilized by the Idera Board and Idera's Financial Advisor
in Connection with the Mergers" beginning on pages 80 and 76, respectively, of this joint proxy statement/prospectus. These analyses and
forecasts were prepared by, or as directed by, the managements of BioCryst or Idera, as applicable. Since the forecasts cover a long period
of time, the forecasts by their nature are unlikely to anticipate each circumstance that will have an effect on the commercial value of
BioCryst's and Idera's product candidates and become subject to greater uncertainty with each successive year. None of these analyses or
forecasts were prepared with a view towards public disclosure or compliance with the published guidelines of the SEC, GAAP, or the
guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation and presentation of financial forecasts.
These projections are inherently based on various estimates and assumptions that are subject to the judgment of those preparing them.
These projections are also subject to significant economic, competitive, industry and other uncertainties and contingencies, all of which are
difficult or impossible to predict and many of which are beyond the control of BioCryst and Idera. There can be no assurance that
BioCryst's or Idera's financial condition or results of operations will be consistent with those set forth in such analyses and forecasts,
which could have a material impact on the market price of Holdco common stock following the mergers.

Other Risk Factors of Idera and BioCryst 

        Idera's and BioCryst's businesses are and will be subject to the risks described above. In addition, Idera's and BioCryst's businesses
are, and will continue to be, subject to the risks described in Part I, Item 1A of Idera's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2017 and described in Item 1A of BioCryst's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three months ended March 31,
2018, and any amendments thereto, each as updated by subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K, all
of which are or will be filed with the SEC and incorporated by reference into this joint proxy statement/prospectus. See "Where You Can

        Nautilus Holdco, Inc. is a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of BioCryst formed for the sole purpose of becoming
the parent entity of each of Idera and BioCryst following the mergers. At the effective time of the mergers, Nautilus Holdco, Inc., will be
renamed "Valenscion Incorporated."

Idera Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 

        Idera is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of novel
oligonucleotide therapeutics for oncology and rare diseases. Idera uses two distinct proprietary drug discovery technology platforms to
design and develop drug candidates: its Toll-like receptor, or TLR, targeting technology and its nucleic acid chemistry technology
(formerly referred to as Idera's third generation antisense, or 3GA technology). Idera developed these platforms based on its scientific
expertise and pioneering work with synthetic oligonucleotides as therapeutic agents. Using its TLR targeting technology, Idera designs
synthetic oligonucleotide-based drug candidates to modulate the activity of specific TLRs. Using its nucleic acid chemistry technology,
Idera is developing drug candidates to turn off the messenger RNA, or mRNA, associated with disease causing genes. Idera believes that
its nucleic acid chemistry technology may potentially reduce the immunotoxicity and increase the potency of earlier generation antisense
and RNA interference, or RNAi, technologies.

        Idera's business strategy is focused on the clinical development of drug candidates for oncology and rare diseases characterized by
small, well-defined patient populations with serious unmet medical needs. Idera believes that it can develop and commercialize these
targeted therapies on its own. To the extent Idera seeks to develop drug candidates for broader disease indications, it has entered into and
may explore additional collaborative alliances to support development and commercialization.

        Idera's common stock is traded on the Nasdaq under the symbol "IDRA." The principal executive offices of Idera are located at 167
Sidney Street, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139, and its telephone number is (617) 679-5500. Idera maintains another office at
505 Eagleview Boulevard, Suite 212, Exton, Pennsylvania 19341.

BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 

        BioCryst is a biotechnology company that designs, optimizes and develops novel small molecule drugs that block key enzymes
involved in the pathogenesis of diseases. BioCryst focuses on the treatment of rare diseases in which significant unmet medical needs exist
and align with BioCryst's capabilities and expertise. BioCryst integrates the disciplines of biology, crystallography, medicinal chemistry
and computer modeling to discover and develop small molecule pharmaceuticals through the process known as structure-guided drug
design. Structure-guided drug design is a drug discovery approach by which BioCryst designs synthetic compounds from detailed
structural knowledge of the active sites of enzyme targets associated with particular diseases. BioCryst uses X-ray crystallography,
computer modeling of molecular structures and advanced chemistry techniques to focus on the three-dimensional molecular structure and
active site characteristics of the enzymes that control cellular biology. Enzymes are proteins that act as catalysts for many vital biological
reactions. BioCryst's goal generally is to design a compound that will fit in the active site of an enzyme and thereby prevent its catalytic
activity.

        BioCryst's common stock is traded on the Nasdaq under the symbol "BCRX."

        The principal executive offices of BioCryst are located at 4505 Emperor Blvd., Suite 200, Durham, North Carolina 27703, and its
telephone number is (919) 859-1302.

        This joint proxy statement/prospectus is being provided to BioCryst stockholders as part of a solicitation of proxies by the BioCryst
board for use at the BioCryst special meeting and at any adjournments or postponements of such special meeting. This joint proxy
statement/prospectus provides BioCryst stockholders with information they need to know to be able to vote or instruct their vote to be cast
at the BioCryst special meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof and should be read carefully in its entirety. In addition, this
joint proxy statement/prospectus constitutes a prospectus for Holdco in connection with the issuance by Holdco of its common stock
pursuant to the merger agreement.

Date, Time and Place 

        The BioCryst special meeting is scheduled to be held at 4505 Emperor Blvd., Suite 200, Durham, North Carolina 27703 on July 10,
2018 at 10:00 a.m., Eastern Time, subject to any adjournments or postponements thereof.

Purpose of the BioCryst Special Meeting 

        At the BioCryst special meeting, BioCryst stockholders will be asked to consider and vote on:

• the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, which is further described in the sections titled "The Mergers" and "The
Merger Agreement," beginning on pages 53 and 116, respectively, of this joint proxy statement/prospectus; 

• the proposal to approve, on a non-binding advisory basis, the compensation that may become payable to BioCryst's named
executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the mergers, referred to below as the BioCryst merger-related
compensation proposal; and 

• the proposal to adjourn the BioCryst special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies in favor of
the merger agreement proposal if there are not sufficient votes at the time of such adjournment to adopt the merger
agreement, referred to as the "BioCryst adjournment proposal."

        Completion of the mergers is conditioned on, among other things, approval by BioCryst stockholders of the proposal to adopt the
merger agreement.

Recommendation of the BioCryst Board 

        BioCryst's board unanimously determined that the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the
mergers and the compensatory arrangements between BioCryst and its named executive officers, are fair, advisable and in the best
interests of BioCryst and its stockholders and approved the execution, delivery and performance by BioCryst of the merger agreement and
the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, including the mergers.

        The BioCryst board unanimously recommends that BioCryst stockholders vote "FOR" the proposal to adopt the merger
agreement, "FOR" the proposal to approve, on a non-binding advisory basis, the compensation that may become payable to
BioCryst's named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the mergers and "FOR" the proposal to adjourn the
BioCryst special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes to adopt the
merger agreement.

the BioCryst special meeting during the meeting.

BioCryst Voting and Support Agreement 

        Simultaneously with the execution of the merger agreement, each of BioCryst and Idera entered into a voting and support agreement
with affiliates of Baker Brothers. Baker Brothers is the beneficial owner of approximately 14% of issued and outstanding BioCryst
common stock and approximately 18% of issued and outstanding Idera common stock. Pursuant to the voting and support agreements,
Baker Brothers has agreed, among other things, to vote its shares of BioCryst common stock and Idera common stock in favor of the
adoption of the merger agreement at each of the BioCryst special meeting and the Idera special meeting, respectively. In addition, Baker
Brothers has agreed to be present at each of the BioCryst special meeting and the Idera special meeting for purposes of establishing a
quorum.

Voting by BioCryst's Directors and Executive Officers 

        At the close of business on the BioCryst record date, directors and executive officers of BioCryst and their affiliates were entitled to
vote 1,225,516 shares of BioCryst common stock, or approximately 1% of the shares of BioCryst common stock issued and outstanding on
that date. We currently expect that BioCryst's directors and executive officers will vote their shares in favor of each proposal being
submitted to a vote of the BioCryst stockholders at the BioCryst special meeting, although no director or officer has entered into any
agreement obligating him or her to do so.

Quorum

        In order for business to be conducted at the BioCryst special meeting, a quorum must be present. A quorum requires the presence, in
person or by proxy, of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of BioCryst common stock entitled to vote at the BioCryst special
meeting. For purposes of determining whether there is a quorum, all shares that are present will count towards the quorum, which will
include proxies received but marked as abstentions and will exclude broker non-votes. Broker non-votes occur when a beneficial owner
holding shares in "street name" does not instruct the broker, bank or other nominee that is the record owner of such stockholder's shares on
how to vote those shares on a particular proposal.

        If a quorum is not present, the BioCryst special meeting may be adjourned by the vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of
BioCryst common stock present or represented by proxy and entitled to vote, to reconvene at the same or another place. If a quorum is
present at the BioCryst special meeting but there are not sufficient votes at the time of the BioCryst special meeting to adopt the merger
agreement, then BioCryst stockholders may be asked to vote on the BioCryst adjournment proposal. Notice need not be given of any such
adjourned meeting if the time and place thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken.

Required Vote 

        The adoption of the merger agreement requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares
of BioCryst common stock entitled to vote on the proposal. Failures to vote, abstentions and broker non-votes will have the effect of a vote
against the proposal. Pursuant to the voting and support agreement, Baker Brothers has agreed to vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the
merger agreement.

        Approval of, on a non-binding advisory basis, the compensation that may become payable to BioCryst's named executive officers that
is based on or otherwise relates to the mergers requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of BioCryst common
stock present, in person

or represented by proxy, at the BioCryst special meeting and voting on the proposal, although such vote will not be binding on BioCryst,
the BioCryst board or any of its committees, or, following completion of the mergers, the combined company. Abstentions, failures to vote
(i.e., not submitting a proxy and not voting in person) and broker non-votes will have no effect on the proposal, assuming a quorum is
present.

        Approval of the BioCryst adjournment proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of BioCryst
common stock present, in person or represented by proxy, at the BioCryst special meeting and voting on the proposal. Abstentions, failures
to vote (i.e., not submitting a proxy and not voting in person) and broker non-votes will have no effect on the outcome of the BioCryst
adjournment proposal, assuming a quorum is present. Brokers, banks and other nominees do not have discretionary authority to vote on the
adjournment proposal and will not be able to vote on the adjournment proposal absent instructions from the beneficial owner.

How to Vote 

        BioCryst stockholders of record as of the close of business on the BioCryst record date may have their shares voted by submitting a
proxy or may vote in person at the BioCryst special meeting by following the instructions provided in the one-page notice regarding the
Internet availability of proxy materials. BioCryst recommends that BioCryst stockholders entitled to vote submit a proxy even if they plan
to attend the BioCryst special meeting.

        BioCryst stockholders who hold their shares beneficially in "street name" and wish to submit a proxy must provide instructions to the
broker, bank, trustee or other nominee that holds their shares of record as to how to vote their shares with respect to all proposals to be
voted on at the BioCryst special meeting. BioCryst stockholders who hold their shares beneficially and wish to vote in person at the
BioCryst special meeting must obtain a "legal proxy."

        BioCryst stockholders of record may submit a proxy in one of three ways or vote in person at the BioCryst special meeting:

• Internet:  BioCryst stockholders may submit their proxy over the Internet at the web address shown on their proxy card.
Internet voting is available 24 hours a day and will be accessible until 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time, on July 9, 2018.
Stockholders will be given an opportunity to confirm that their voting instructions have been properly recorded. BioCryst
stockholders who submit a proxy this way should NOT send in their proxy card. 

• Telephone:  BioCryst stockholders may submit their proxy by calling the toll-free telephone number shown on their proxy
card. Telephone voting is available 24 hours a day and will be accessible until 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time, on July 9, 2018.
BioCryst stockholders who submit a proxy this way should NOT send in their proxy card. 

• Mail:  BioCryst stockholders may submit their proxy by properly completing, signing, dating and mailing their proxy card
in the postage-paid envelope (if mailed in the United States) included with this joint proxy statement/prospectus. BioCryst
stockholders who vote this way should mail the proxy card early enough so that it is received before the date of the
BioCryst special meeting. 

• In Person:  BioCryst stockholders may vote in person at the BioCryst special meeting or by sending a representative with
an acceptable proxy that has been signed and dated. Attendance at the BioCryst special meeting will not, however, in and
of itself constitute a vote or a revocation of a prior proxy.

        BioCryst stockholders are encouraged to submit a proxy promptly. Each valid proxy received in time will be voted at the BioCryst
special meeting according to the choice specified, if any. Executed

Table of Contents

but uninstructed proxies (i.e., proxies that are properly signed, dated and returned but are not marked to tell the proxies how to vote) will
be voted in accordance with the recommendations of the BioCryst board. However, if you previously submitted a proxy for the BioCryst
special meeting originally scheduled for May 9, 2018, which proxy has not subsequently been revoked, and are a holder of record on
May 29, 2018 and you do not want to change or revoke your proxy, you do not need to take any action. Accordingly, BioCryst intends to
vote such proxy at the BioCryst special meeting on July 10, 2018, as directed by your previously submitted proxy.

Shares Held in Street Name 

        BioCryst stockholders who hold shares of BioCryst common stock in a stock brokerage account or through a bank, broker or other
nominee ("street name" stockholders) who wish to vote at the BioCryst special meeting should be provided a voting instruction form by
the institution that holds their shares. If this has not occurred, contact the institution that holds your shares. A number of banks and
brokerage firms participate in a program that also permits "street name" stockholders to direct their vote by telephone or over the Internet.
If your shares are held in an account at a bank or brokerage firm that participates in such a program, you may direct the vote of these
shares by telephone or over the Internet by following the voting instructions enclosed with the proxy form from the bank or brokerage
firm. The Internet and telephone proxy procedures are designed to authenticate stockholders' identities, to allow stockholders to give their
proxy voting instructions and to confirm that those instructions have been properly recorded. Votes directed by telephone or over the
Internet through such a program must be received by 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, on July 9, 2018. Directing the voting of your shares will
not affect your right to vote in person if you decide to attend the BioCryst special meeting; however, you must first obtain a signed and
properly executed legal proxy from your bank, broker or other nominee to vote your shares held in "street name" at the BioCryst special
meeting. Requesting a legal proxy prior to the deadline described above will automatically cancel any voting directions you have
previously given by telephone or over the Internet with respect to your shares. However, if you are a BioCryst stockholder as of the revised
May 29, 2018 record date who previously provided voting instructions to your bank, broker or other nominee, and do not wish to change
your vote, you will not need to provide voting instructions again and your BioCryst shares will be voted at the rescheduled July 10, 2018
BioCryst special meeting in accordance with your original voting instructions.

        In accordance with the rules of the Nasdaq, brokers, banks and other nominees who hold shares of BioCryst common stock in "street
name" for their customers do not have discretionary authority to vote the shares with respect to the proposal to adopt the merger
agreement, the BioCryst merger-related compensation proposal, or the BioCryst adjournment proposal. Accordingly, if brokers, banks or
other nominees do not receive specific voting instructions from the beneficial owner of such shares, they may not vote such shares with
respect to these proposals. Under such circumstance, a broker non-vote would arise. Broker non-votes, if any, will not be considered
present at the special meeting for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present at the special meeting, will have the same effect as
a vote "AGAINST" the proposal to adopt the merger agreement and, assuming a quorum is present, will have no effect on the BioCryst
merger-related compensation proposal or on the BioCryst adjournment proposal. Thus, for shares of BioCryst common stock held in
"street name," only shares of BioCryst common stock affirmatively voted "FOR" the proposal to adopt the merger agreement will be
counted as a vote in favor of such proposal.

Proxies and Revocation 

        BioCryst stockholders of record may revoke their proxies at any time before their shares are voted at the BioCryst special meeting in
any of the following ways:

• sending a written notice of revocation to BioCryst at 4505 Emperor Blvd., Suite 200, Durham, North Carolina 27703,
Attention: Corporate Secretary, which must be received before their shares are voted at the BioCryst special meeting; 

• properly submitting a new, later-dated proxy card, which must be received before their shares are voted at the BioCryst
special meeting (in which case only the later-dated proxy is counted and the earlier proxy is revoked); 

• submitting a proxy via the Internet or by telephone at a later date, which must be received by 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, on
July 9, 2018 (in which case only the later-dated proxy is counted and the earlier proxy is revoked); or 

• attending the BioCryst special meeting and voting in person. Attendance at the BioCryst special meeting will not, however,
in and of itself, constitute a vote or revocation of a prior proxy.

        BioCryst beneficial owners may change their voting instruction by submitting new voting instructions to the brokers, banks or other
nominees that hold their shares of record or by requesting a "legal proxy" from such broker, bank or other nominee and voting in person at
the BioCryst special meeting.

        BioCryst stockholders that hold their shares in "street name" through a broker, bank or other nominee will need to follow the
instructions provided by their broker, bank or other nominee in order to revoke their proxies or submit new voting instructions.

Tabulation of Votes 

        BioCryst has appointed Alane Barnes to serve as the Inspector of Election for the BioCryst special meeting. Alane Barnes will,
among other things, determine the number of shares of BioCryst common stock represented at the BioCryst special meeting to confirm the
existence of a quorum, determine the validity of all proxies and ballots and independently tabulate affirmative and negative votes and
abstentions.

Solicitation of Proxies 

        BioCryst is making this proxy solicitation both through the mail and Internet, although proxies may be solicited by personal
interview, telephone, facsimile, letter, e-mail or otherwise. Certain of BioCryst's directors, officers and other employees, without additional
compensation, may participate in the solicitation of proxies. BioCryst will pay the cost of this solicitation, including the reasonable charges
and expenses of brokerage firms and others who forward solicitation materials to beneficial owners of BioCryst common stock. BioCryst
has retained Innisfree M&A Incorporated, 501 Madison Avenue, 20th floor, New York, New York 10022 to act as proxy solicitor in
conjunction with the meeting. We have agreed to pay that firm approximately $18,500 plus reasonable out of pocket expenses for their
services.

Adjournments 

        If a quorum is not present, the BioCryst special meeting may be adjourned by the vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of
BioCryst common stock present or represented by proxy and entitled to vote, to reconvene at the same or another place. If a quorum is
present at the BioCryst special meeting but there are not sufficient votes at the time of the BioCryst special meeting to adopt the merger
agreement, then BioCryst stockholders may be asked to vote on the BioCryst adjournment

adjournment is taken.

Householding of Special Meeting Materials 

        The SEC has adopted rules that permit companies and intermediaries such as banks, brokers or nominees to satisfy delivery
requirements for proxy statements and annual reports with respect to two or more stockholders sharing the same address by delivering a
single proxy statement or annual report, as applicable, addressed to those stockholders. This process, which is commonly referred to as
"householding," reduces the volume of duplicate information received at your household and helps reduce BioCryst's expenses. Unless
BioCryst has received contrary instructions, BioCryst may send a single copy of this joint proxy statement/prospectus and notice to any
household at which two or more stockholders with the same surname reside if BioCryst believes the stockholders are members of the same
family. Each stockholder in the household will continue to receive a separate proxy card. We will promptly deliver a separate copy of our
proxy statement to any stockholder upon written request to BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Attention: Corporate Secretary, 4505 Emperor
Blvd., Suite 200, Durham, North Carolina 27703, telephone: (919) 859-1302. Any stockholder who wants to receive separate copies of our
proxy statement or annual report to stockholders in the future, or any stockholder who is receiving multiple copies and would like to
receive only one copy per household, should contact the stockholder's bank, broker or other nominee, or the stockholder may contact
BioCryst at the above address and phone number.

Questions and Additional Information 

        BioCryst stockholders may contact BioCryst's proxy solicitor, Innisfree M&A Incorporated, with any questions about the proposals or
how to vote or to request additional copies of any materials at:

Innisfree M&A Incorporated
501 Madison Avenue, 20th floor

New York, New York 10022
Stockholders May Call Toll Free: 888-750-5834

Banks & Brokers May Call Collect: 212-750-5833

        BioCryst stockholders should not return their stock certificates or send documents representing BioCryst common stock with
the proxy card. If the mergers are completed, the exchange agent for the BioCryst merger will send to BioCryst stockholders a
letter of transmittal and related materials and instructions for exchanging shares of BioCryst common stock.

BIOCRYST PROPOSALS 

BioCryst Proposal 1: The BioCryst Merger Proposal 

        BioCryst stockholders are asked to approve the proposal to adopt the merger agreement. For a summary and detailed information
regarding this proposal, see the information about the mergers and the merger agreement throughout this joint proxy statement/prospectus,
including the information set forth in sections entitled "The Mergers" and "The Merger Agreement" beginning on pages 53 and 116,
respectively, of this joint proxy statement/prospectus. A copy of the merger agreement is attached as Annex A to this joint proxy
statement/prospectus.

        Pursuant to the merger agreement, approval of this proposal by BioCryst stockholders is a condition to the consummation of the
mergers. If this proposal is not approved, the mergers will not be consummated.

        BioCryst is requesting that BioCryst stockholders approve the proposal to adopt the merger agreement. Approval of this proposal
requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of BioCryst common stock entitled to vote
on the proposal at the BioCryst special meeting.

Recommendation of the BioCryst board

        The BioCryst board unanimously recommends that BioCryst stockholders vote "FOR" the proposal to adopt the merger
agreement.

BioCryst Proposal 2: The BioCryst Merger-Related Compensation Proposal 

        BioCryst stockholders are asked to approve, on a non-binding advisory basis, the compensation that may become payable to
BioCryst's named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the mergers. For a summary and detailed information regarding
this proposal, see the information about the mergers and the merger agreement throughout this joint proxy statement/prospectus, including
the information set forth in the section entitled "The Mergers—Interests of BioCryst Directors and Executive Officers in the Mergers"
beginning on page 106 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

        Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 and Rule 14a-21(c) of the Exchange Act,
BioCryst is seeking non-binding, advisory stockholder approval of the compensation of BioCryst's named executive officers that is based
on or otherwise relates to the mergers as disclosed in the section entitled "The Mergers—Interests of BioCryst Directors and Executive
Officers in the Mergers" beginning on page 106 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus. The proposal gives BioCryst's stockholders the
opportunity to express their views on the merger-related compensation of BioCryst's named executive officers.

        Accordingly, BioCryst is requesting stockholders to adopt the following resolution, on a non-binding, advisory basis:

"RESOLVED, that the compensation that may be paid or become payable to BioCryst's named executive officers, in connection
with the mergers, and the agreements or understandings pursuant to which such compensation may be paid or become payable, in
each case as disclosed pursuant to Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K in 'Advisory Vote on Merger-Related Compensation for BioCryst
Named Executive Officers—Golden Parachute Compensation,' are hereby APPROVED."

        BioCryst stockholders should note that the BioCryst merger-related compensation proposal is merely an advisory vote, which will not
be binding on BioCryst or the BioCryst board. Further, the underlying plans and arrangements are contractual in nature and not, by their
terms, subject to stockholder approval. Accordingly, regardless of the outcome of the advisory vote, if the mergers are

consummated, the eligibility of the BioCryst named executive officers for such payments and benefits will not be affected by the outcome
of the advisory vote.

        The proposal to approve, on a non-binding advisory basis, the compensation that may be paid or become payable to BioCryst's named
executive officers in connection with the mergers is a vote separate and apart from the vote on the proposal to adopt the merger agreement.
Accordingly, a BioCryst stockholder may vote to approve one proposal and not the other. Approval of the BioCryst merger-related
compensation proposal is not a condition to the completion of the mergers.

Recommendation of the BioCryst board

        The BioCryst board unanimously recommends a vote "FOR" the approval of the BioCryst merger-related compensation
proposal.

BioCryst Proposal 3: The BioCryst Adjournment Proposal 

        BioCryst stockholders are asked to vote on a proposal to adjourn the BioCryst special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit
additional proxies in favor of the merger agreement proposal if there are not sufficient votes at the time of such adjournment to adopt the
merger agreement.

Recommendation of the BioCryst board

        The BioCryst board unanimously recommends a vote "FOR" the BioCryst adjournment proposal.

THE IDERA SPECIAL MEETING 

        This joint proxy statement/prospectus is being provided to the Idera stockholders as part of a solicitation of proxies by the Idera
board for use at the Idera special meeting to be held at the time and place specified below and at any properly convened meeting following
any adjournments or postponements thereof. This joint proxy statement/prospectus provides Idera stockholders with the information they
need to know to be able to vote or instruct their vote to be cast at the Idera special meeting.

Date, Time and Place 

        The Idera special meeting is scheduled to be held at Idera's offices located at 505 Eagleview Boulevard, Suite 212, Exton,
Pennsylvania 19341 on July 10, 2018 at 10:00 a.m., Eastern Time, subject to any adjournments or postponements thereof.

Purpose of the Idera Special Meeting 

        At the Idera special meeting, Idera stockholders will be asked to consider and vote on:

• the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, which is further described in the sections titled "The Mergers" and "The
Merger Agreement," beginning on pages 53 and 116, respectively, of this joint proxy statement/prospectus; and 

• the proposal to approve, on a non-binding advisory basis, the compensation that may become payable to Idera's named
executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the mergers.

        Completion of the mergers is conditioned on, among other things, approval by the Idera stockholders of the proposal to adopt the
merger agreement.

Recommendation of the Idera Board 

        The Idera board has unanimously approved the merger agreement and determined that the merger agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby, including the mergers and the compensatory arrangements between Idera and its named executive officers, are
advisable, fair to and in the best interests of Idera and its stockholders.

        The Idera board unanimously recommends that Idera stockholders vote "FOR" the proposal to adopt the merger agreement
and "FOR" the proposal to approve, on a non-binding advisory basis, the compensation that may become payable to Idera's
named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the mergers.

Idera Record Date; Stockholders Entitled to Vote 

        Only holders of record of Idera common stock at the close of business on May 29, 2018, the record date for the Idera special meeting,
will be entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the Idera special meeting or any adjournments or postponements thereof.

        At the close of business on the Idera record date, 217,310,991 shares of Idera common stock were issued and outstanding and held by
91 holders of record. Holders of record of Idera common stock on the Idera record date are entitled to one vote per share at the special
meeting on each proposal. A list of Idera stockholders will be available for review for any purpose germane to the Idera special meeting at
Idera's executive offices and principal place of business at the office of Idera's Assistant Secretary, 505 Eagleview Boulevard, Suite 212,

Idera Voting and Support Agreement 

        Simultaneously with the execution of the merger agreement, each of BioCryst and Idera entered into a voting and support agreement
with affiliates of Baker Brothers. Baker Brothers is the beneficial owner of approximately 14% of issued and outstanding BioCryst
common stock and approximately 18% of issued and outstanding Idera common stock. Pursuant to the voting and support agreements,
Baker Brothers has agreed, among other things, to vote its shares of BioCryst common stock and Idera common stock in favor of the
adoption of the merger agreement at each of the BioCryst special meeting and the Idera special meeting, respectively. In addition, Baker
Brothers has agreed to be present at each of the BioCryst special meeting and Idera special meeting for purposes of establishing a quorum.

Voting by Idera's Directors and Executive Officers 

        At the close of business on the Idera record date, directors and executive officers of Idera and their affiliates were entitled to vote
39,424,036 shares of Idera common stock, or approximately 18% of shares of Idera common stock issued and outstanding on that date. We
currently expect that Idera's directors and executive officers will vote their shares in favor of each proposal being submitted to a vote of the
Idera stockholders at the Idera special meeting, although no director or officer has entered into any agreement obligating him or her to do
so.

Quorum 

        No business may be transacted at the Idera special meeting unless a quorum is present. Stockholders who hold shares representing at
least a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock entitled to vote at the Idera special meeting must be present in
person or represented by proxy to constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at the meeting. If a quorum is not present, the special
meeting may be adjourned by the chairman of the Idera special meeting to allow additional time for obtaining additional proxies. At any
subsequent reconvening of the special meeting, all proxies will be voted in the same manner as they would have been voted at the original
convening of the special meeting, except for any proxies that have been effectively revoked or withdrawn prior to the subsequent meeting.

        Abstentions (shares of Idera common stock for which proxies have been received but for which the holders have abstained from
voting or as to which the holder attends the Idera special meeting in person but does not vote) will be included in the calculation of the
number of shares of Idera common stock represented at the special meeting for purposes of determining whether a quorum has been
achieved. However, broker non-votes will not be included in the calculation of the number of shares of Idera common stock represented at
the Idera special meeting for purposes of determining whether a quorum has been achieved.

        If a quorum is not present, the Idera special meeting may be adjourned by the chairman of the Idera special meeting, to reconvene at
the same or another place, and notice need not be given of any such adjourned meeting if the time and place thereof are announced at the
meeting at which the adjournment is taken.

Required Vote 

        The adoption of the merger agreement requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares
of Idera common stock entitled to vote on the proposal. Failures to vote, abstentions and broker non-votes will have the effect of a vote
against the proposal. Pursuant to the voting and support agreement, Baker Brothers has agreed to vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the
merger agreement.

Table of Contents

        Approval of, on a non-binding advisory basis, the compensation that may become payable to Idera's named executive officers that is
based on or otherwise relates to the mergers requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of Idera common stock
represented in person or by proxy at the Idera special meeting and voting on the proposal, although such vote will not be binding on Idera,
the Idera board or any of its committees, or, following completion of the mergers, the combined company. Abstentions, failures to vote
(i.e., not submitting a proxy and not voting in person) and broker non-votes will have no effect on the proposal, assuming a quorum is
present.

Failure to Vote, Broker Non-Votes and Abstentions 

        Under the rules of the Nasdaq, banks, brokers or other nominees holding shares of record may vote those shares in their discretion on
certain routine proposals when they do not receive timely voting instructions from the beneficial holders. A broker non-vote occurs under
these Nasdaq rules when a bank, broker or other nominee holding shares of record is not permitted to vote on a non-routine matter without
instructions from the beneficial owner of the shares and no instruction is given.

        In accordance with these Nasdaq rules, banks, brokers and other nominees who hold shares of Idera common stock in "street name"
for their customers, but do not have discretionary authority to vote the shares, may not exercise their voting discretion with respect to the
proposal to adopt the merger agreement. Accordingly, if banks, brokers or other nominees do not receive specific voting instructions from
the beneficial owner of such shares, they may not vote such shares with respect to the proposal to adopt the merger agreement and will
have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the proposal to adopt the merger agreement. For shares of Idera common stock held in "street
name," only shares of Idera common stock affirmatively voted "FOR" the proposal to adopt the merger agreement will be counted as a
favorable vote for such proposal. Abstaining from voting, or failing to provide voting instructions to your bank, broker or other nominee,
will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the proposal to adopt the merger agreement.

        Abstentions, failures to attend the Idera special meeting (in person or by proxy) and vote and broker non-votes will have no effect on
the Idera merger-related compensation proposal.

How to Vote 

        Whether or not you plan to attend the Idera special meeting, please vote your shares. If you are a registered or "record holder," which
means your shares are registered in your name with Computershare Trust Company, N.A., Idera's transfer agent and registrar, you may
vote in person at the Idera special meeting or by proxy. If your shares are held in "street name," which means your shares are held of
record in an account with a broker, bank or other nominee, you must follow the instructions from your broker, bank or other nominee in
order to vote.

        In addition, if you are a registered stockholder, please be prepared to provide proper identification, such as a driver's license. If you
hold your Idera shares in "street name," you will need to provide proof of ownership, such as a recent account statement or letter from your
bank, broker or other nominee, along with proper identification.

        Idera stockholders of record may submit a proxy in one of three ways or vote in person at the Idera special meeting:

• Internet.  To vote over the internet through services provided by Computershare Trust Company, N.A., please go to the
following website: http://www.investorvote.com/IDRA and follow the instructions at that site for submitting your proxy.
Internet voting is available 24 hours a day and will be accessible until 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time, on July 9, 2018. If you vote
over the internet, you do not need to complete and mail your proxy card.

• Telephone.  To vote by telephone through services provided by Computershare Trust Company, N.A., call 1-800-652-
VOTE (8683), and follow the instructions provided on the proxy card that accompanies this joint proxy
statement/prospectus. Telephone voting is available 24 hours a day and will be accessible until 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time, on
July 9, 2018. If you vote by telephone, you do not need to complete and mail your proxy card. 

• Mail.  To vote by mail, you need to complete, date and sign the proxy card that accompanies this joint proxy
statement/prospectus and promptly mail it in the enclosed postage-prepaid envelope. You do not need to put a stamp on the
enclosed envelope if you mail it from within the United States. Idera stockholders who vote in this way should mail the
proxy card early enough so that it is received before the date of the Idera special meeting. 

• In person.  If you attend the Idera special meeting, you may vote by delivering your completed proxy card in person or you
may vote by completing a ballot at the special meeting. Ballots will be available at the special meeting. Attendance at the
Idera special meeting will not, however, in and of itself constitute a vote or a revocation of a prior proxy.

        Idera stockholders are encouraged to submit a proxy promptly. Your proxy will only be valid if you complete and return the proxy
card, vote by telephone or vote over the internet at or before the Idera special meeting. The persons named in the proxy card will vote the
shares you own in accordance with your instructions on your proxy card, in your vote by telephone or in your vote over the internet. If you
return the proxy card, vote by telephone or vote over the internet, but do not give any instructions on a particular matter described in this
joint proxy statement/prospectus, the persons named in the proxy card will vote the shares you own in accordance with the
recommendations of the Idera board. However, if you previously submitted a proxy for the Idera special meeting originally scheduled for
May 9, 2018, which proxy has not subsequently been revoked, and are a holder of record on May 29, 2018 and you do not want to change
or revoke your proxy, you do not need to take any action. Accordingly, Idera intends to vote such proxy at the Idera special meeting on
July 10, 2018, as directed by your previously submitted proxy.

Voting of Idera Common Stock Held in Street Name 

        If you hold Idera shares through a bank, broker or other nominee, you may instruct your bank, broker or other nominee to vote your
Idera shares by following the instructions that the bank, broker or nominee provides to you with these materials. Most banks and brokers
offer the ability for stockholders to submit voting instructions by mail by completing a voting instruction card, by telephone and via the
Internet. If you do not provide voting instructions to your bank, broker or other nominee, your Idera shares will not be voted on any
proposal as your bank, broker or other nominee does not have discretionary authority to vote on any of the proposals to be voted on at the
Idera special meeting. However, if you are an Idera stockholder as of the revised May 29, 2018 record date who previously provided
voting instructions to your bank, broker or other nominee, and do not wish to change your vote, you will not need to provide voting
instructions again and your Idera shares will be voted at the rescheduled July 10, 2018 Idera special meeting in accordance with your
original voting instructions.

        Even if your shares are held in street name, you are welcome to attend the Idera special meeting. If your shares are held in street
name, you may not vote your shares in person at the Idera special meeting unless you obtain a proxy, executed in your favor, from the
holder of record (i.e., your bank, broker or other nominee). If you hold your shares in street name and wish to vote in person, please
contact your bank, broker or other nominee before the Idera special meeting to obtain the necessary proxy from the holder of record.

How Proxies are Counted 

        All shares represented by properly executed proxies received in time for the Idera special meeting will be voted at the meeting in the
manner specified by the stockholders giving those proxies. Properly executed proxies that do not contain voting instructions will be voted
"FOR" each of the proposals.

        Only shares affirmatively voted for the proposal, and properly executed proxies that do not contain voting instructions, will be
counted as favorable votes for the proposal to adopt the merger agreement. Abstentions and broker non-votes will have the same effect as
votes "AGAINST" the proposal to adopt the merger agreement. Abstentions, failures to vote and broker non-votes will have no effect on
the proposal to approve, on a non-binding advisory basis, the compensation that may become payable to Idera's named executive officers
that is based on or otherwise relates to the mergers. However, because none of the proposals to be voted on at the Idera special meeting are
routine matters for which brokers may have discretionary authority to vote, Idera does not expect any broker non-votes at the special
meeting.

Revocation of Proxies 

        If you are the record holder of Idera common stock, you can change your vote or revoke your proxy at any time before your proxy is
voted at the special meeting. You can do this by:

• timely delivering a signed written notice of revocation to the Assistant Secretary of Idera, dated as of a later date than the
date of the proxy and received prior to the Idera special meeting; 

• timely delivering a new, valid proxy bearing a later date than your original proxy by submitting instructions through the
Internet, by telephone or by mail as described on the proxy card and received prior to the Idera special meeting; or 

• attending the Idera special meeting and voting in person, which will automatically cancel any proxy previously given, or
you can revoke your proxy in person. Simply attending the Idera special meeting without voting will not revoke any proxy
that you have previously given or change your vote.

        A registered stockholder may revoke a proxy by any of these methods, regardless of the method used to deliver the stockholder's
previous proxy.

        Written notices of revocation and other communications with respect to the revocation of proxies should be addressed as follows:

Idera Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
167 Sidney Street

Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139
Attention: Assistant Secretary

        Please note that if your shares are held in "street name" through a broker, bank or other nominee, you may change your vote by
submitting new voting instructions to your broker, bank or nominee in accordance with its established procedures. If your shares are held
in the name of a broker, bank or other nominee and you decide to change your vote by attending the Idera special meeting and voting in
person, your vote in person at the Idera special meeting will not be effective unless you have obtained and present an executed proxy
issued in your name from the record holder (your broker, bank or other nominee).

Tabulation of Votes 

        Idera has appointed Robert Doody to serve as the inspector of election for the Idera special meeting. Robert Doody will, among other
things, determine the number of shares of Idera common stock represented at the Idera special meeting to confirm the existence of a
quorum, determine the validity of all proxies and ballots and independently tabulate affirmative and negative votes and abstentions.

Solicitation of Proxies 

        Idera is soliciting proxies for its special meeting from its stockholders. Idera will pay its own cost of soliciting proxies, including the
cost of mailing this joint proxy statement/prospectus, from its stockholders. In addition to solicitation by use of the mails, proxies may be
solicited by Idera's directors, officers and employees in person or by telephone or other means of communication. These persons will not
receive additional compensation, but may be reimbursed for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses in connection with this solicitation.

        Idera has retained the services of MacKenzie Partners, Inc. to assist in the solicitation of proxies for an estimated fee not to exceed
$17,500, plus reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses. Idera will make arrangements with brokerage houses, custodians, nominees and
fiduciaries to forward proxy solicitation materials to beneficial owners of shares held of record by them. Idera will also reimburse these
brokerage houses, custodians, nominees and fiduciaries for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in forwarding the proxy
materials.

Adjournments 

        If a quorum is not present, the Idera special meeting may be adjourned by the chairman of the Idera special meeting, to reconvene at
the same or another place, and notice need not be given of any such adjourned meeting if the time and place thereof are announced at the
meeting at which the adjournment is taken.

Householding of Special Meeting Materials 

        The SEC has adopted rules that permit companies and intermediaries such as banks, brokers or nominees to satisfy delivery
requirements for proxy statements and annual reports with respect to two or more stockholders sharing the same address by delivering a
single proxy statement or annual report, as applicable, addressed to those stockholders. This process, which is commonly referred to as
"householding," reduces the volume of duplicate information received at your household and helps reduce Idera's expenses. Unless Idera
has received contrary instructions, Idera may send a single copy of this joint proxy statement/prospectus and notice to any household at
which two or more stockholders with the same surname reside if Idera believes the stockholders are members of the same family. Each
stockholder in the household will continue to receive a separate proxy card. We will promptly deliver a separate copy of our proxy
statement to any stockholder upon written request to Idera Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Attention: Investor Relations, 167 Sidney Street,
Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139, or request via telephone: 1-877-888-6550 or email at ir@iderapharma.com. Any stockholder who wants
to receive separate copies of our proxy statement or annual report to stockholders in the future, or any stockholder who is receiving
multiple copies and would like to receive only one copy per household, should contact the stockholder's bank, broker or other nominee, or
the stockholder may contact Idera at the above address and phone number.

IDERA PROPOSALS 

Idera Proposal 1: The Idera Merger Proposal 

        Idera stockholders are asked to approve the proposal to adopt the merger agreement. For a summary and detailed information
regarding this proposal, see the information about the mergers and the merger agreement throughout this joint proxy statement/prospectus,
including the information set forth in sections entitled "The Mergers" and "The Merger Agreement" beginning on pages 53 and 116,
respectively, of this joint proxy statement/prospectus. A copy of the merger agreement is attached as Annex A to this joint proxy
statement/prospectus.

        Pursuant to the merger agreement, approval of this proposal by Idera stockholders is a condition to the consummation of the mergers.
If this proposal is not approved, the mergers will not be consummated.

        Idera is requesting that Idera stockholders approve the proposal to adopt the merger agreement. Approval of this proposal requires the
affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of all shares of Idera common stock entitled to vote at the Idera special
meeting.

Recommendation of the Idera Board

        The Idera board unanimously recommends that Idera stockholders vote "FOR" the proposal to approve the mergers.

Idera Proposal 2: The Idera Merger-Related Compensation Proposal 

        Idera stockholders are asked to approve, on a non-binding advisory basis, the compensation that may become payable to Idera's
named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the mergers. For a summary and detailed information regarding this
proposal, see the information about the mergers and the merger agreement throughout this joint proxy statement/prospectus, including the
information set forth in the section entitled "The Mergers—Idera Stockholder Advisory Vote on Merger-Related Compensation for Idera's
Named Executive Officers Proposal" beginning on page 103 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

is seeking non-binding, advisory stockholder approval of the compensation of Idera's named executive officers that is based on or
otherwise relates to the mergers as disclosed above in the section entitled "The Mergers—Idera Stockholder Advisory Vote on Merger-
Related Compensation for Idera's Named Executive Officers Proposal" beginning on page 103 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus.
The proposal gives Idera's stockholders the opportunity to express their views on the merger-related compensation of Idera's named
executive officers.

        Accordingly, Idera is requesting stockholders to adopt the following resolution, on a non-binding, advisory basis:

"RESOLVED, that the compensation that may be paid or become payable to Idera's named executive officers, in connection with
the mergers, and the agreements or understandings pursuant to which such compensation may be paid or become payable, in each
case as disclosed pursuant to Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K in 'Advisory Vote on Merger-Related Compensation for Idera Named
Executive Officers—Golden Parachute Compensation,' are hereby APPROVED."

        Idera stockholders should note that the Idera merger-related compensation proposal is merely an advisory vote, which will not be
binding on Idera or the Idera board. Further, the underlying plans and arrangements are contractual in nature and not, by their terms,
subject to stockholder approval. Accordingly, regardless of the outcome of the advisory vote, if the mergers are consummated, the

eligibility of the Idera named executive officers for such payments and benefits will not be affected by the outcome of the advisory vote.

        The proposal to approve, on a non-binding advisory basis, the compensation that may be paid or become payable to Idera's named
executive officers in connection with the mergers is a vote separate and apart from the vote on the proposal to adopt the merger agreement.
Accordingly, an Idera stockholder may vote to approve one proposal and not the other. Approval of the Idera merger-related compensation
proposal is not a condition to the completion of the mergers.

Recommendation of the Idera Board

        The Idera board unanimously recommends a vote "FOR" the approval of the Idera merger-related compensation proposal.

THE MERGERS 

        The following is a description of the material aspects of the mergers, including the merger agreement. While we believe that the
following description covers the material terms of the mergers, the description may not contain all of the information that is important to
you. We encourage you to read this joint proxy statement/prospectus carefully and in its entirety, including the merger agreement which is
attached as Annex A to this joint proxy statement/prospectus, for a more complete understanding of the mergers.

Effects of the Mergers 

        Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the merger agreement and in accordance with the DGCL, at the effective time of the
mergers, Merger Sub A, a wholly owned subsidiary of Holdco and a party to the merger agreement, will merge with and into Idera. Idera
will survive the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Holdco. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the merger agreement
and in accordance with the DGCL, at the effective time of the mergers, Merger Sub B, a wholly owned subsidiary of Holdco and a party to
the merger agreement, will merge with and into BioCryst. BioCryst will survive the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Holdco. As a
result, among other things, Holdco will become the ultimate parent of Idera, BioCryst and their respective subsidiaries. The mergers will
become effective at the time at which the certificates of merger have been duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or
at any later date or time mutually agreed to in writing by Idera and BioCryst and specified in the certificates of merger in accordance with
the DGCL.

        At the effective time of the mergers, each issued and outstanding share of Idera common stock (other than shares held by Idera,
BioCryst, Holdco, Merger Sub A or Merger Sub B, or any subsidiary of each of the aforementioned entities, or by Idera as treasury shares,
which will cease to remain outstanding and will be canceled and retired and cease to exist) will be converted into the right to receive 0.20
fully paid and nonassessable shares of Holdco common stock, with cash paid in lieu of fractional shares.

        At the effective time of the mergers, each issued and outstanding share of Idera preferred stock (other than shares held by Idera,
BioCryst, Holdco, Merger Sub A or Merger Sub B, or any subsidiary of each of the aforementioned entities, or by Idera as treasury shares,
which will cease to remain outstanding and will be canceled and retired and cease to exist) will be converted into the right to receive a
number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of Holdco common stock equal to (i) $1.00 divided by the 20-trading-day average trading
price of Idera common stock, ending with the trading day prior to the third day prior to the closing date, multiplied by (ii) 0.20, with cash
paid in lieu of fractional shares.

        At the effective time of the mergers, each issued and outstanding share of BioCryst common stock (other than shares held by Idera,
BioCryst, Holdco, Merger Sub A, or Merger Sub B, or any subsidiary of each of the aforementioned entities, or by BioCryst as treasury
shares, which will cease to remain outstanding and will be canceled and retired and cease to exist) will be converted into the right to
receive 0.50 fully paid and nonassessable shares of Holdco common stock, with cash paid in lieu of fractional shares.

        The exchange ratios are fixed and will not be adjusted to reflect stock price changes prior to the closing of the mergers.

        Idera and BioCryst are working to complete the mergers as soon as practicable and expect the closing of the mergers to occur in the
third quarter of 2018. However, the mergers are subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions, and it is possible that factors
outside the control of Idera and BioCryst could result in the mergers being completed at a later time or not at all.

Background of the Mergers 

        The BioCryst board and Idera board, together with their respective management, regularly reviews their respective company's
discovery and development programs, business opportunities and potential transactions to strengthen their respective position and enhance
stockholder value. Each of them also, from time to time in the past, has had informal discussions with a number of participants in the
biopharmaceutical industry relating to potential transactions or relationships, including mergers, collaborations, partnerships, combination
studies, licensing and other arrangements.

        In early February 2016, BioCryst announced the results of its Avoralstat in hereditary angioedema OPuS-2 (Oral ProphylaxiS-2)
clinical trial and that BioCryst would not be moving forward with further clinical trials for Avoralstat. At a meeting of the BioCryst board
held at that time to review the OPuS-2 results, the BioCryst board noted the early stage of clinical development for BioCryst's follow-on
lead compound, BCX-7353, and discussed potential opportunities for risk diversification to increase the number of potential product
candidates that could advance through clinical trials, including potential strategic opportunities such as mergers, bolt-on acquisitions or in-
licensing transactions with other participants in the biopharmaceutical industry.

        In early March 2016, Mr. Stonehouse, chief executive officer of BioCryst, called the chief executive officer of a privately held
biopharmaceutical company ("Company A") to discuss developments in the biopharmaceutical industry generally. On the call, each
expressed their mutual interest in learning more about the other company's clinical development programs, and the two agreed to meet in
person later that month. Following the call, on March 11, 2016, Company A and BioCryst entered into a non-disclosure agreement which
included a standstill provision that is inoperative in circumstances where BioCryst enters into a merger agreement with a third party or is
the subject of a tender offer, and does not prohibit Company A from requesting that the BioCryst board waive the restrictions in the
standstill provision. Beginning in mid-March 2016 and continuing through April 2016, Company A and BioCryst conducted due diligence
on each other.

        On March 29, 2016, Mr. Stonehouse and three independent directors of BioCryst met with the chief executive officer and senior
management of Company A, together with their respective legal and financial advisors, to learn more about each company's programs.
They discussed whether to explore a potential business combination that would be structured as a stock-for-stock transaction based on the
relative values of the two companies. Representatives of BioCryst and Company A also discussed their respective views on the values of
BioCryst and Company A. Over the next several weeks diligence was conducted by both companies. In late April 2016, the chief
executive officer of Company A called Mr. Stonehouse and informed him that Company A was not interested in pursuing a business
combination transaction at that time because Company A's due diligence review of BioCryst, given the lack of clinical data on BCX-7353,
did not support the relative valuation levels previously discussed by representatives of Company A and BioCryst.

        On May 24, 2016, the BioCryst board held a regularly scheduled meeting, which was also attended by members of BioCryst
management and representatives of an advisor engaged by BioCryst to assist in identifying potential strategic opportunities, such as
mergers, bolt-on acquisitions and in-licensing transactions. The BioCryst board discussed potential opportunities for risk diversification
and the desired criteria for a counterparty, including that the counterparty have a focus on chronic orphan and rare diseases and near term
clinical catalysts. Following a review of potential counterparties, the BioCryst board instructed BioCryst management to do further
analysis on the various biopharmaceutical companies discussed by the BioCryst board, in order to identify strategic opportunities that
could enhance stockholder value and provide risk diversification.

        On June 10, 2016, following an introduction by a BioCryst board member, Mr. Stonehouse called the chief executive officer of a
large publicly traded biopharmaceutical company ("Company B") who expressed interest in discussing their respective businesses.
Following this call, Mr. Stonehouse and the

chief executive officer of Company B agreed to meet in person to discuss potential opportunities for a strategic transaction between the
two companies. Mr. Stonehouse and the chief executive officer of Company B met on June 22, 2016 and on July 26, 2016 and discussed a
transaction proposed by the chief executive officer of Company B in which Company B would acquire BioCryst for cash. On July 27,
2016, BioCryst and Company B entered into a non-disclosure agreement, which included a standstill provision that is inoperative in
circumstances where BioCryst enters into a merger agreement or is the subject of a tender offer and does not prohibit Company B from
requesting that the BioCryst board waive the restrictions in the standstill. BioCryst made an online data room available to Company B, and
Company B and its advisors conducted preliminary due diligence on BioCryst. In early August the chief executive officer of Company B
called Mr. Stonehouse and told him that Company B was no longer interested in pursuing a transaction with BioCryst because, based on
the advice of Company B's financial advisor, Company B believed it would need to provide a meaningful premium to BioCryst
stockholders to successfully conclude a deal, and Company B was not willing to pay a price for BioCryst that provided a meaningful
premium to BioCryst stockholders based on the trading price of BioCryst common stock at the time.

        On August 5, 2016, the BioCryst board held a special telephonic meeting. At the meeting, Mr. Stonehouse informed the BioCryst
board of Company B's decision to terminate discussions at that time. The BioCryst board also discussed whether to explore other potential
sale transactions, and the BioCryst board's belief that other potential purchasers were not likely to appropriately value BioCryst until more
data was available from clinical trials. The BioCryst board instructed management to continue analyzing strategic opportunities that would
enhance stockholder value and provide risk diversification.

        As a follow up to an informal meeting at an investor conference in June 2016, Mr. Stonehouse and Mr Milano, chief executive officer
of Idera, spoke by telephone in July 2016 and discussed developments in the biopharmaceutical industry generally and their mutual
interest in learning more about the clinical and discovery programs of each other's company. Mr. Milano and Mr. Stonehouse met in person
in August 2016 and discussed their respective companies, whether a combination of the two companies could enhance stockholder value
for each respective company, and whether to explore a potential business combination at that time.

        The BioCryst board held a regularly scheduled meeting on September 27 and 28, 2016, and conducted its annual strategic review
which included an update from BioCryst management on developments in BioCryst's clinical programs and a discussion of potential
strategic combination opportunities and opportunities for diversification through bolt-on acquisitions of companies with an orphan/rare
disease focus. The BioCryst board discussed the status of the clinical program for BCX-7353 in hereditary angioedema, which had begun
enrolling patients in August 2016, and determined that further efforts with respect to strategic opportunities should be considered, but
meaningful progress was unlikely until closer to the time that additional data would be available from the BCX-7353 APeX-1 study.

        On October 27, 2016, as a follow up to the discussions between Mr. Stonehouse and Mr. Milano during the summer of 2016,
Mr. Stonehouse and Lynne Powell, Senior Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer of BioCryst, met with Mr. Milano and Clayton
Fletcher, Senior Vice President of Business Development and Strategic Planning of Idera, and discussed their respective company's
clinical development and preclinical programs. Each of BioCryst and Idera concluded at that time that each party should focus its efforts
on further progressing its own clinical development efforts for its lead products, and not to pursue a potential business combination, with
Mr. Milano and Mr. Stonehouse leaving open the possibility of further discussions after additional data was available from their respective
company's clinical development efforts.

        In December 2016, the CEO of a privately held biopharmaceutical company ("Company C") called Mr. Stonehouse, and, in light of
the anticipated announcement of additional data from the BCX-7353 APeX-1 study, expressed an interest in exploring a possible strategic
transaction with BioCryst. On December 22, 2016, BioCryst and Company C entered into a non-disclosure agreement which did not
include a standstill provision. Mr. Stonehouse and members of BioCryst management met with members of Company C management in
January 2017 and discussed their respective company's clinical development programs. Shortly thereafter, Company C informed
Mr. Stonehouse that Company C was not interested in pursuing a transaction with BioCryst, and there were no further discussions between
Company C and BioCryst following that meeting.

        In January 2017, Mr. Stonehouse attended an industry conference and had informal meetings with representatives of several
biopharmaceutical companies, including the CEO of a private biopharmaceutical company ("Company D"). Mr. Stonehouse met again
with the CEO of Company D on February 13, 2017 and discussed their mutual interest in exploring a strategic combination, following
such time as data from the clinical trials for BCX-7353 in hereditary angioedema became available.

        On February 27, 2017, BioCryst announced positive results from an interim analysis of its Phase 2 APeX-1 clinical trial for BCX-
7353 in hereditary angioedema.

        In February 2017, following the announcement of the interim results of the Phase 2 APeX-1 clinical trial for BCX-7353,
representatives of a mid-size publicly traded biopharmaceutical company ("Company E") contacted Mr. Stonehouse and indicated
Company E's interest in exploring a potential business combination transaction with BioCryst, following the availability of final results
from the BCX-7353 APeX-1 Phase 2 trial expected in late 2017.

        Also in February 2017, in a discussion with an investment banker, Idera became aware of a privately held rare disease company
("Company F") that was considering its strategic alternatives, including a possible sale of Company F. After a discussion at the March 7,
2017 regularly scheduled Idera board meeting, the Idera board requested that Mr. Milano follow up on this possible acquisition
opportunity. In April 2017, the CEO of Company F called Mr. Milano to discuss a possible strategic transaction with Idera. During May
2017, Idera and Company F entered into a non-disclosure agreement and Mr. Milano and members of Idera management met
telephonically with members of Company F management to discuss the lead asset of Company F.

        On May 9, 2017, BioCryst and Company E entered into a non-disclosure agreement which did not include a standstill provision.
BioCryst made an online data room available to Company E, and throughout the summer of 2017, Company E conducted a due diligence
review of BioCryst, and members of Company E management and Mr. Stonehouse engaged in preliminary discussions regarding possible
terms of a potential strategic transaction, including a stock-for-stock merger transaction.

        During the months of May and June 2017, Idera management, along with the Idera board, had a series of informational meetings to
discuss a possible merger agreement with Company F. Shortly thereafter, Company F informed Mr. Milano that Company F was pursuing
a different strategic alternative and would not continue to pursue a transaction with Idera.

        In August 2017, the chairman of Company D called Mr. Stonehouse and informed him that Company D remained interested in
discussing a transaction with BioCryst.

        On September 5, 2017, BioCryst announced the final results from the BCX-7353 Phase 2 trial, which showed a positive treatment
effect, and announced plans to meet with the Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency during the fourth quarter
of 2017 to finalize plans for Phase 3 study of BCX-7353.

        On September 10, 2017, Idera announced final results from the dose-selection phase of an ongoing Phase 1/2 trial investigating IMO-
2125, Idera's intratumorally-delivered Toll-like Receptor, or TLR,

9 agonist, in combination with ipilimumab (Yervoy®), manufactured by Bristol-Myers Squibb, which demonstrated positive and
encouraging response data in anti-PD-1 refractory melanoma.

        Following the announcement and the subsequent translational medicine presentation at the Society of Immunotherapy of Cancer on
November 9, 2017, there was substantial interest in IMO-2125 and Idera engaged in discussions with select parties regarding potential
licensing and collaboration arrangements between Idera and such parties, however, none of the parties proposed definitive terms regarding
a potential licensing or collaboration arrangement with Idera during the course of discussions with BioCryst regarding the potential
business combination.

        On September 12, 2017, a public offering of BioCryst common stock priced at $5.15 per share, which resulted in net proceeds to
BioCryst of $85.8 million.

        In mid-September 2017, the CEO of Company A contacted Mr. Stonehouse and indicated that Company A was again interested in
exploring a potential business combination transaction with BioCryst. Mr. Stonehouse told the CEO of Company A that he would
communicate Company A's renewed interest in a business combination transaction to the BioCryst board.

        On September 19, 2017, the Idera board held a regularly scheduled meeting with members of Idera management in attendance. At the
meeting, among other topics discussed, Mr. Milano led a discussion with the Idera board related to the landscape of the biopharmaceutical
industry, Idera's stand-alone business plan, the advantages of diversifying Idera's clinical portfolio and various organic and strategic
alternatives, including the potential licensing and collaboration arrangements discussed with third parties who had expressed an interest in
IMO-2125. As part of this discussion, Mr. Milano presented an overview of BioCryst based on publicly available information. Julian
Baker and Kelvin Neu, members of the Idera board, noted that affiliates of Baker Bros. Advisors ("BBA") held a minority interest in
BioCryst, and they recused themselves from the portion of the meeting regarding a potential business combination with BioCryst and from
future discussions regarding a potential business combination. Beginning at this meeting and continuing until January 21, 2018,
Messrs. Baker and Neu were not present for, and did not participate in, any discussions or determinations of the Idera board regarding the
potential business combination between BioCryst and Idera. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Idera board determined that
Mr. Milano should continue to explore potential licensing or collaboration arrangements and reach out to Mr. Stonehouse to see if there
was interest in restarting a discussion regarding a potential stock-for-stock business combination between BioCryst and Idera.

        On September 20, 2017, Mr. Milano and Mr. Stonehouse spoke by telephone and discussed progress in the respective clinical
programs of BioCryst and Idera. On the call, Mr. Milano inquired about Mr. Stonehouse's interest in having a further general discussion
about recent biopharmaceutical industry developments and the possibility of a potential business combination between BioCryst and Idera.
Mr. Stonehouse agreed to an in-person discussion, which was thereafter set for September 26, 2017.

        On September 22, 2017, the chairman of Company D called Mr. Stonehouse and informed him that Company D was not able to
consider further discussions at that time because of other corporate priorities of Company D.

        On September 26, 2017, Mr. Milano and Mr. Stonehouse met and discussed the possibility of exploring a potential business
combination transaction, given the additional data that was now available from their respective clinical development efforts.
Mr. Stonehouse told Mr. Milano that he would discuss the opportunity for a potential business combination between BioCryst and Idera
with the BioCryst board.

        On October 2, 2017, Company E informed BioCryst that it was no longer interested in pursuing a merger or acquisition transaction
with BioCryst, and was only interested in licensing BCX-7353.

Mr. Stonehouse informed representatives of Company E that BioCryst was not interested in a licensing transaction, given the recent
positive clinical trial results, BioCryst's ability to pursue the commercialization of BCX-7353 without a partner and the desire to preserve
upside potential for BioCryst stockholders.

        The BioCryst board held a regularly scheduled board meeting on October 11 and 12, 2017 at which the BioCryst board conducted its
annual strategic review of developments in the biopharmaceutical industry as they related to the treatment of rare diseases and potential
platforms for developing new treatments, BioCryst's clinical programs, commercialization and launch plans, financial position and
potential strategic combination opportunities. At this meeting, members of management of BioCryst presented preliminary internal
financial forecasts, which assigned various probabilities to the successful clinical development of BioCryst's pipeline product candidates,
and the BioCryst board and members of management discussed refinements to the assumptions underlying such forecasts. Representatives
of J.P. Morgan, a financial advisor that BioCryst had retained in considering strategic matters, presented an illustrative valuation of
BioCryst based on management's preliminary internal financial forecasts. Mr. Stonehouse informed the BioCryst board of his discussions
with Company A and Idera and the interest that each had indicated in exploring a potential strategic transaction with BioCryst. The
BioCryst board discussed BioCryst's stand-alone business plan, including its development, commercialization and launch plans for BCX-
7353, financing risks, the desirability of diversifying its pipeline of products in development and strategic alternatives that could be
available to BioCryst, which included a business combination transaction with Company A, Idera or other biotechnology or
pharmaceutical companies in a stock-for-stock transaction. The BioCryst board also discussed whether any biotechnology or
pharmaceutical companies would be interested in acquiring BioCryst in a cash transaction, and determined that a stock-for-stock
transaction based on the relative values of the constituent companies could be more value-enhancing for BioCryst stockholders than a cash
sale transaction in light of the status of BioCryst's development programs, and the BioCryst board's belief that an all-stock transaction
would allow BioCryst stockholders to participate in any upside potential for its products while providing diversification. The BioCryst
board authorized BioCryst management to exchange information and engage in due diligence with Company A and Idera and pursue
further discussions with both companies to explore whether a potential strategic transaction effecting a combination with either party
would be value-enhancing to BioCryst stockholders.

        On October 13, 2017, Mr. Stonehouse contacted Mr. Milano to inform him that the BioCryst board was interested in exploring a
potential business combination with Idera. They agreed to proceed with preliminary diligence on the other company's respective lead
product candidates, with the possibility of additional diligence if it was determined that a potential business combination was likely to be
in the best interests of their respective stockholders.

        On October 17, 2017, BioCryst entered into a mutual non-disclosure agreement with Company A, which included a standstill
provision that is inoperative in circumstances where BioCryst enters into a merger agreement with a third party or is the subject of a tender
offer, and which does not prohibit Company A from requesting that the BioCryst board waive the restrictions in the standstill provision.
Company A and BioCryst exchanged confidential information, engaged in management discussions about their respective businesses and
conducted due diligence on each other during October and November.

        On October 18, 2017, BioCryst entered into a mutual non-disclosure agreement with Idera, which did not include a standstill
provision, following which BioCryst and Idera granted the other party and its representatives access to its respective online data room with
materials limited to each company's respective lead product candidates. BioCryst and Idera periodically engaged in management
discussions about, and conducted preliminary due diligence with respect to, each company's respective lead product candidates during
October and November.

        On October 25, 2017, a public offering of Idera common stock priced at $1.50 per share, resulting in net proceeds to Idera of
$53.8 million.

        On October 26, 2017, members of Idera and BioCryst management and representatives of Goldman Sachs, financial advisor to Idera,
and J.P. Morgan met to discuss the two companies' respective clinical and preclinical development programs.

        Beginning on November 13, 2017 and continuing through the signing of the merger agreement, Mr. Milano had periodic discussions
with members of the Idera board to provide updates regarding the status of discussions regarding potential licensing or collaboration
arrangements and the exploration of the potential business combination with BioCryst. Mr. Stonehouse periodically updated members of
the BioCryst board on the status of discussions with Idera.

        On November 22, 2017, the CEO of Company A contacted Mr. Stonehouse to discuss Company A's continued interest in pursuing a
stock-for-stock business combination transaction with BioCryst based on the relative values of the companies, as well as the status of the
due diligence review being conducted by Company A and BioCryst. Representatives of Company A engaged in discussions with BioCryst
management and representatives of J.P. Morgan in late November and early December on due diligence matters. During their discussions,
representatives of Company A provided to J.P. Morgan Company A's views on the relative values of BioCryst and Company A, which
ascribed a higher value to Company A than to BioCryst.

        On November 28, 2017, the Idera board held a regularly scheduled in-person meeting, with members of Idera management and, for
the portion of the meeting regarding the potential business combination, representatives of Goldman Sachs in attendance. At the meeting,
Mr. Milano provided an update on the discussions with BioCryst regarding the potential business combination between BioCryst and
Idera. At this meeting, members of Idera management reviewed Idera's due diligence to date on BCX-7353, the commercial potential of
BCX-7353, and the capital structure and funding requirements, including the potential for raising capital through partnering arrangements.
Representatives of Goldman Sachs presented public market perspectives on BioCryst. The Idera board discussed the results of the due
diligence review and the strategic rationale for a combination with BioCryst. The Idera board determined that a potential business
combination transaction with BioCryst, on the right terms, could be attractive to Idera and its stockholders. The Idera board instructed
Idera management to continue its diligence and valuation work on BioCryst.

        Subsequently on November 28, 2017, Mr. Milano contacted Mr. Stonehouse to discuss the status of the parties' mutual due diligence
review, and Idera's continued interest in the possibility of a potential stock-for-stock business combination transaction with BioCryst.
Mr. Milano and Mr. Stonehouse also discussed potential synergies from combining headquarters and research and development facilities,
the relative representation of BioCryst directors and Idera directors on the board of directors of the combined company and perspectives
on key management roles. Mr. Milano and Mr. Stonehouse also discussed potential next steps, including completing diligence and
pursuing negotiation of a definitive agreement if the two companies' respective boards of directors wished to further pursue a potential
business combination.

        On December 6, 2017, the BioCryst board held a special meeting. Also in attendance were members of BioCryst management,
representatives of J.P. Morgan and representatives of Skadden, legal advisor to BioCryst. Mr. Stonehouse updated the BioCryst board on
discussions with each of Company A and Idera, including discussions between representatives of J.P. Morgan and representatives of
Company A with respect to Company A's views on the relative values of BioCryst and Company A, and his discussions with Mr. Milano
on the methodology for determining the relative values of BioCryst and Idera, and the corporate governance of a combined BioCryst/Idera
entity. At this meeting, members of BioCryst management reviewed BioCryst's due diligence to date on each of Company A and Idera,
focusing on the lead programs of each of Company A and Idera, the

commercial potential of their respective lead programs, and their respective capital structures and funding requirements, including the
potential for raising capital through partnering arrangements. Members of BioCryst management reviewed preliminary financial forecasts
for the lead programs of Company A, Idera and BioCryst prepared by BioCryst management, which assigned various probabilities to the
successful clinical development of the lead product candidates of each company. The BioCryst financial forecasts presented by BioCryst
management at the meeting reflected the refinements to probability of success and commercialization assumptions discussed with the
BioCryst board at the October 11-12 BioCryst board meeting, and the BioCryst board members discussed further adjustments to the
assumptions underlying the forecasts. Representatives of J.P. Morgan presented a preliminary valuation review, based on management's
preliminary financial forecasts, with respect only to the lead products of each of Company A, Idera and BioCryst, together with a
sensitivity analysis which varied certain assumptions for each of the lead products. The BioCryst board discussed the results of the due
diligence review, the preliminary valuation review and the strategic rationale for a combination with each of Idera and Company A. The
BioCryst board determined that the preliminary valuation review on Company A did not support the relative valuation levels that
Company A had indicated to representatives of J.P. Morgan that it would require in a business combination transaction, and determined
that a business combination transaction with Idera, on the right terms, could be attractive to BioCryst and its stockholders. The BioCryst
board instructed BioCryst management to continue its diligence and valuation work with respect to Idera only, and to inform Company A
that it was not interested in pursuing a transaction with Company A at that time.

        On December 6, 2017, at the instruction of the BioCryst board, Mr. Stonehouse called Company A and informed Company A of the
BioCryst board's determination that due diligence and preliminary valuation work on Company A did not support the valuation levels that
Company A had previously indicated it would require in a business combination transaction with BioCryst, and that the BioCryst board
determined not to further pursue a transaction with Company A at that time. Mr. Stonehouse also called Mr. Milano and informed him of
the BioCryst board's interest in pursuing further discussions and due diligence to determine whether an agreement could be reached with
respect to a business combination between Idera and BioCryst.

        Beginning the week of December 12, 2017 through January 21, 2018, each of BioCryst and Idera granted the other party and its
representatives expanded access to its respective online data room to include materials responsive to due diligence request lists supplied by
Idera and BioCryst, respectively, and any further due diligence requests made by either party.

        On December 13, 2017, members of Idera and BioCryst management and representatives of Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan held an
in-person meeting to discuss each company's respective commercialization plans for its product candidates, status of financial due
diligence, and Idera and BioCryst management's respective views on future performance.

        During the month of December 2017 and continuing into January 2018, management of BioCryst and Idera, together with their legal
and financial advisors, continued their mutual diligence review and participated in meetings and telephonic conferences where financial,
commercial, regulatory, R&D, tax, human resource, chemistry/manufacturing/control (CMC), legal and corporate information was
exchanged by the parties. Idera also discussed with BioCryst its plans for potential partnering arrangements involving rights to develop
and market one of Idera's lead product candidates in certain jurisdictions.

        On December 15, 2017, the Idera board met with members of Idera management and representatives of Goldman Sachs and Latham,
legal advisor to Idera, in attendance. At the meeting, representatives of Latham provided an overview of the duties of the Idera board in
evaluating a potential business combination with BioCryst. Idera management, along with representatives of Goldman Sachs and Latham,
then provided an update on the status of due diligence, document

requests and negotiations related to the potential business combination as well as the potential timing for receiving a first draft of the
merger agreement from BioCryst. Following the update, Idera management presented an update on the preparation of Idera management's
unadjusted financial forecasts and risk-adjusted financial forecasts reflecting Idera management's viewpoints on the likelihood of
successful commercialization of Idera's products. The Idera board provided guidance on the assumptions to be used for purposes of Idera
management's unadjusted and risk-adjusted financial forecasts and determined that Idera management, together with Idera's legal and
financial advisors, should continue discussions and negotiations with BioCryst and provided guidance with respect to such negotiations,
including with respect to ownership and governance of the combined company.

        On December 17, 2017, the BioCryst board held a special telephonic meeting, with members of BioCryst management and
representatives of J.P. Morgan and Skadden in attendance, to discuss the process for evaluating a potential business combination with
Idera, and to receive an update from BioCryst management on BioCryst's ongoing diligence with respect to Idera. BioCryst management
updated the BioCryst board on the status of due diligence and information requests by Idera and BioCryst, which included a request to
exchange non risk-adjusted forecasts for each company's lead product candidates. The BioCryst board instructed BioCryst management to
provide Idera with the non-risk-adjusted forecasts that had previously been reviewed with, and reflected the input of, the BioCryst board,
and to continue discussions with Idera regarding the terms of a business combination transaction. Skadden provided the BioCryst board
with a summary of the key terms to be included in the initial draft merger agreement, which included a reverse subsidiary merger structure
pursuant to which Idera would merge into a newly formed subsidiary of BioCryst with Idera stockholders receiving a fixed number of
BioCryst shares in the merger, acceleration and vesting of outstanding options, reciprocal representations, warranties and covenants,
mutual non-solicitation provisions and board recommendation requirements, and the obligation to put the merger to a stockholder vote
even if the BioCryst board were to change its recommendation, and the BioCryst board instructed Skadden to send the draft merger
agreement to Latham.

        On December 18, 2017, Skadden sent the initial draft merger agreement to Latham.

        On December 20, 2017, the BioCryst board held a special telephonic meeting, with members of BioCryst management and
representatives of J.P. Morgan and Skadden in attendance. Representatives of Skadden reviewed the terms of the initial draft merger
agreement with the BioCryst board. BioCryst management provided the BioCryst board with an update on the mutual due diligence review
and discussions with Idera management.

        On December 22, 2017, Mr. Milano and Mr. Stonehouse spoke by telephone and discussed the status of the mutual due diligence
review, and the financial analysis being done by both parties, including with respect to each party's development of assumptions to apply
to the non-risk adjusted forecasts of the other party and the methodology to be used in determining the appropriate relative ownership of
BioCryst stockholders and Idera stockholders in a combined company. On that call, Mr. Milano suggested that the transaction should be
structured in a manner in which each of BioCryst and Idera would merge into subsidiaries of a new holding company owned 50% by
BioCryst stockholders and 50% by Idera stockholders, reflecting the relative market capitalization based on current trading of the two
companies and taking the intrinsic value of the two companies into account. They also discussed issues related to corporate governance,
and agreed to speak again regarding those issues at a later date.

        Subsequently on December 22, 2017, the Idera board held a special telephonic meeting, with members of Idera management and
representatives of Goldman Sachs and Latham in attendance. At the meeting, Mr. Milano provided an update on the status of negotiations
of the potential business combination, including regarding the board of directors of the combined company and the headquarters of the
combined company. Representatives of Latham then provided an overview of the draft merger

agreement received from Skadden, and members of Idera management provided an update on the diligence review of BioCryst. Idera
management then reviewed Idera management's unadjusted financial forecasts and risk-adjusted financial forecasts reflecting Idera
management's viewpoints on the likelihood of successful commercialization of Idera's products. The Idera board then discussed
alternatives to the potential business combination with BioCryst, including remaining as a stand-alone company and exploring potential
licensing or partnership transactions. The Idera board instructed Idera management to provide Idera management's unadjusted financial
forecasts that had previously been reviewed by the Idera Board to BioCryst, and determined that Idera management, together with Idera's
legal and financial advisors, should continue discussions and negotiations with BioCryst and provided guidance with respect to such
negotiations, including with respect to ownership of the combined company.

        Later on December 22, 2017, BioCryst and Idera exchanged their respective management's unadjusted financial forecasts.

        During the last two weeks of December 2017, management of BioCryst and Idera, together with their legal and financial advisors,
continued to participate in meetings and telephonic conferences relating to due diligence, and discussed the appropriate assumptions to
apply to the non-risk adjusted forecasts exchanged by the parties and other valuation topics.

        On December 28, 2017, the BioCryst board held a special telephonic meeting, with members of BioCryst management and
representatives of J.P. Morgan, Skadden and Ernst & Young LLP, BioCryst's public accounting firm, in attendance. At the meeting,
management of BioCryst reviewed the results of the due diligence review of Idera, including an assessment of Idera's clinical programs
and pipeline, the commercial potential of Idera's lead products, accounting and tax matters, and human resource matters. Mr. Stonehouse
updated the BioCryst board on his recent discussions with Mr. Milano, which included the parties' respective views on relative values, the
appropriate relative ownership of BioCryst stockholders and Idera stockholders in a combined company and the proposed holding
company structure to effectuate the transaction. The BioCryst board instructed management and the advisors to continue discussions with
Idera and its advisors regarding the terms of a business combination transaction as discussed at the meeting and provided guidance as to
the BioCryst board's position that the exchange ratio for the transaction should be based on the relative intrinsic values of the two
companies and that BioCryst stockholder ownership in the combined company should be greater than 50% on a fully diluted basis.

        On December 29, 2017, representatives of Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan spoke to discuss the potential respective ownership by
BioCryst stockholders and Idera stockholders of the combined company following the potential business combination. Representatives of
Goldman Sachs indicated that Idera believed the parties needed to further discuss the relative values of the two companies.
Representatives of J.P. Morgan indicated that BioCryst believed BioCryst stockholder ownership in the combined company should be
greater than 50% on a fully diluted basis.

        Also on December 29, 2017, Latham sent a revised draft of the merger agreement to Skadden, which reflected the holding company
structure previously discussed by Mr. Milano and Mr. Stonehouse. Later that day Mr. Milano called Mr. Stonehouse to discuss Idera's
views on the methodology for determining relative ownership of BioCryst stockholders and Idera stockholders in a combined company
and advised Mr. Stonehouse that Idera believed that the appropriate valuation of the companies should take into account both intrinsic
value and their relative market capitalization based on current trading of the two companies. Mr. Milano and Mr. Stonehouse agreed that
further review and analysis of the forecasts assumptions was required in order for the parties to refine their respective views on relative
valuation, and they agreed to speak again in January when they would both be attending an industry conference.

        On January 3, 2018, the Idera board held a special telephonic meeting, with members of Idera management and representatives of
Goldman Sachs and Latham in attendance. At the meeting, Mr. Milano provided an update on the status of negotiations of a potential
business combination and considerations on relative valuation of the two companies.

        On January 9, 2018, Messrs. Stonehouse and Ingram, chairman of the BioCryst board, met with Mr. Milano and James Geraghty,
chairman of the Idera board, at an industry conference, and discussed the strategic rationale for, and benefits of, combining BioCryst and
Idera, and the proposed corporate governance of the new holding company, including the proposal for a combined company board
comprised of four directors from each of the Idera board and the BioCryst board, and one director who was not a BioCryst or Idera
director. Mr. Stonehouse and Mr. Milano agreed to speak again later in the week, together with their respective financial advisors,
regarding the financial forecasts exchanged between the companies and the assumptions around the major drivers of value.

        On January 11, 2018, Mr. Stonehouse and Mr. Milano, together with members of BioCryst management, Idera management and
representatives of J.P. Morgan and Goldman Sachs, met to discuss the financial forecasts of the companies' that the respective
managements exchanged. Following the meeting, Mr. Stonehouse and Mr. Milano met separately to discuss the appropriate exchange ratio
for the potential business combination between the two companies. Mr. Milano stated that the disinterested members of the Idera board
continued to be of the view that the negotiated exchange ratio should take into account both the intrinsic value of the two companies and
the recent trading performance of Idera and BioCryst common stock. On January 13, 2018, Mr. Stonehouse and Mr. Milano spoke again
by telephone to continue their discussion around the appropriate exchange ratio for the potential business combination.

        Representatives of Latham and Skadden continued to discuss the terms of the merger agreement during this period, including the
holding company structure, the treatment of employee equity awards, the circumstances giving rise to a termination fee and the amount of
the termination fee. Representatives of Latham and Skadden also discussed potential voting agreements between each of Idera and
BioCryst, and affiliates of BBA, pursuant to which affiliates of BBA would agree to vote in favor of the merger agreement at the BioCryst
stockholder meeting and at the Idera stockholder meeting, subject to certain exceptions.

        On January 14, 2018, the BioCryst board had a special telephonic meeting, with members of BioCryst management and
representatives of J.P. Morgan and Skadden in attendance. At the meeting, Mr. Stonehouse updated the BioCryst board on the status of
negotiations with Idera, and Idera's position regarding the exchange ratio. At the meeting, representatives of J.P. Morgan presented their
preliminary analysis with respect to the relative values of BioCryst and Idera based on the latest available financial forecasts of BioCryst
and Idera prepared by BioCryst management, and reviewed with the BioCryst board the recent trading history of the two companies. The
BioCryst board discussed the composition of the board of the combined company, and the roles of Mr. Milano, Mr. Stonehouse and
Mr. Ingram in the combined company. The BioCryst board instructed BioCryst management to continue discussions with Idera
management on a business combination transaction, but to inform Idera that the exchange ratio should reflect the relative intrinsic values
of BioCryst and Idera, and that on this basis the BioCryst board believed that this should yield BioCryst stockholder ownership in the
combined company of 52.0% on a fully diluted basis.

        On January 17, 2018, the Idera board held a special telephonic meeting, with members of Idera management and representatives of
Goldman Sachs and Latham in attendance. At the meeting, Mr. Milano provided an update on the status of negotiations of the exchange
ratio, the board of directors of the combined company and the headquarters of the combined company, as well as the timing for the
proposed business combination. Representatives of Latham then provided an overview of the open issues in the draft merger agreement,
and members of Idera management provided an update on the diligence review of BioCryst. Idera management and representatives of
Goldman Sachs then reviewed certain preliminary financial analyses of Idera, BioCryst and a potential business combination as well as
potential strategic alternatives to the potential business combination with BioCryst, including remaining as a stand-alone company, an
update to a potential partnership relating to IMO-2125 and a sale of Idera. Following this review, the Idera board confirmed that the
potential business combination

with BioCryst on acceptable terms was preferable to any other strategic alternatives. Mr. Milano then provided an overview of the possible
timing and process for signing the merger agreement with BioCryst. The Idera board then instructed Idera management, together with
Idera's legal and financial advisors, to continue discussions and negotiations with BioCryst and provided guidance with respect to such
negotiations, including with respect to ownership of the combined company.

        Over the next several days, Mr. Stonehouse and Mr. Milano spoke numerous times by telephone to negotiate the appropriate relative
ownership of BioCryst stockholders and Idera stockholders in a combined company, during which Mr. Milano objected to the implied
premium on the then-prevailing trading price of BioCryst common stock that would result from BioCryst's proposed relative ownership of
the combined company. During this period, representatives of Skadden and Latham continued to negotiate the open issues in the merger
agreement, which included the circumstances in which a termination fee would be payable and the amount of the termination fee and
expense reimbursement in specified circumstances. Representatives of Latham and Skadden also negotiated the terms of voting and
support agreements with legal counsel to BBA, pursuant to which affiliates of BBA would agree to vote the Idera and BioCryst shares
owned by them in favor of adoption of the mergers at the Idera stockholders meeting and at the BioCryst stockholder meeting. Such
discussions among representatives of Latham and Skadden and legal counsel to BBA purposefully excluded the relative valuations of
BioCryst and Idera or other terms or conditions of the potential business combination and focused on the principle of securing BBA's
voting support in the event that both the BioCryst board and the Idera board approved a potential business combination, and each of
BioCryst and Idera received a fairness opinion from their respective financial advisors. Messrs. Baker and Neu did not participate in these
negotiations nor were they aware of the terms of the voting and support agreements negotiated, other than being informed that Latham
would approach representatives of BBA (excluding Messrs. Baker and Neu) to initiate discussions regarding a voting and support
agreement.

        On January 19, 2018, the Idera board held a special telephonic meeting with representatives of each of Idera management, Goldman
Sachs and Latham in attendance. In advance of the meeting, the Idera board was provided with, among other things, a near-final draft of
the merger agreement and other business combination-related materials. At this meeting, Idera management reviewed with the Idera board
the results of the business, financial, accounting and legal due diligence review of BioCryst, provided a detailed overview of BioCryst's
business and the strategic rationale for the potential business combination and provided an update on remaining open items related to the
potential business combination, including the exchange ratio. Representatives of Latham then reviewed with the Idera board its duties
when considering the potential business combination and reviewed the process to date by which the Idera board had overseen negotiations
of the potential business combination. Representatives of Latham then discussed amending Idera's bylaws by adopting a forum selection
bylaw and amending the adjournment bylaw, and reviewed the next steps and timeline of the potential business combination.
Representatives of Latham provided a detailed summary of the business combination documents, including the terms and conditions of the
merger agreement, the proposed corporate governance of the combined company and the voting and support agreement proposed to be
entered into with BBA. Representatives of Latham noted that all discussions with legal counsel for BBA expressly excluded any
discussion with or input from BBA regarding the relative valuation of BioCryst and Idera and other terms of the potential business
combination. The Idera board, Idera management and representatives of Goldman Sachs and Latham discussed using volume-weighted
average prices of BioCryst common stock and Idera common stock as reference points in negotiating the exchange ratio. The Idera board
advised Mr. Milano to propose an exchange ratio to BioCryst ranging from 0.41 to 0.42 holding company shares for each share of Idera
and a BioCryst exchange ratio of 1.0 (to be adjusted as appropriate based on any reduced exchange ratio for BioCryst). The Idera board
then authorized Idera management, together with Idera's legal and financial advisors, to continue to negotiate the exchange ratio and other
remaining open issues.

        Also on January 19, 2018, the BioCryst board held a special telephonic meeting, with members of BioCryst management and
representatives of Skadden in attendance. Representatives of Skadden updated the BioCryst board on the status of negotiations with Idera
on the terms of the merger agreement and on the status of negotiations with legal counsel to BBA and the terms of the voting and support
agreements. Representatives of Skadden noted that all discussions with legal counsel for BBA expressly excluded any discussion with or
input from BBA regarding the relative valuation of BioCryst and Idera and other terms of the potential business combination. Later that
day, in a call between Mr. Milano and Mr. Stonehouse, Mr. Milano informed Mr. Stonehouse that he had spoken with Idera directors and
that, following such discussions, Mr. Milano believed that the Idera board would be willing to consider an exchange ratio which would
imply ownership in the new holding company of 51.2% to 51.5% for BioCryst stockholders on a fully diluted basis and would be
consistent with the 30-day volume-weighted average prices of BioCryst common stock and Idera common stock. The parties also
discussed the equivalent of a holding company reverse stock split on the call.

        On January 20, 2018, the BioCryst board held a special telephonic meeting, with members of BioCryst management and
representatives of Skadden and J.P. Morgan in attendance. Representatives of Skadden reviewed legal matters including directors'
fiduciary duties in connection with the proposed transaction with Idera. Representatives of Skadden updated the BioCryst board on the
status of negotiations with Idera on the merger agreement and the status of negotiations with BBA on the voting agreement, and also
discussed with the BioCryst board a proposed amendment to the BioCryst bylaws to adopt a forum selection bylaw. Mr. Stonehouse
updated the BioCryst board on recent discussions with Mr. Milano regarding the appropriate exchange ratio for the transaction, including
the suggested adjustment to the BioCryst exchange ratio in order to reduce the number of shares of the new holding company.
Representatives of J.P. Morgan reviewed the recent trading history of BioCryst and Idera. The BioCryst board instructed Mr. Stonehouse
to make a final proposal to Idera on the Idera exchange ratio of 0.40 holding company shares for each share of Idera and a BioCryst
exchange ratio of 1.0 (to be adjusted as appropriate based on any reduced exchange ratio for BioCryst) implying ownership by BioCryst
stockholders of approximately 51.6% in the new holding company on a fully diluted basis. Following the BioCryst board meeting, in
accordance with the BioCryst board's instructions, Mr. Stonehouse called Mr. Milano and communicated the BioCryst board's position on
the appropriate exchange ratio in the merger. Mr. Milano responded that he would discuss BioCryst's final proposal with the Idera board,
and confirmed that the Idera board was meeting the following day.

        On the morning of January 21, 2018, Messrs. Baker and Neu met telephonically with members of Idera management as well as
representatives of Goldman Sachs, Latham, and BBA in order for Messrs. Baker and Neu to become informed as part of the forthcoming
vote of the Idera board regarding the potential business combination and Idera's request that BBA sign a voting and support agreement.
Idera management and representatives of Goldman Sachs reviewed certain preliminary financial analyses of Idera, BioCryst and the
combined company. Messrs. Baker and Neu, Idera management and representatives of Goldman Sachs, Latham and BBA then discussed
the negotiation and diligence process of the potential business combination, Goldman Sachs' preliminary financial analysis of the potential
business combination, and the terms and conditions of the proposed merger agreement. During such discussions, Messrs. Baker and Neu
asked questions on the overall process and basis of Goldman Sachs' financial analyses, but did not comment or provide any opinion on the
relative valuation of BioCryst and Idera or the exchange ratio.

        Subsequently, on January 21, 2018, the Idera board held a special telephonic meeting with representatives of each of Idera
management, Goldman Sachs and Latham in attendance. In advance of the meeting, the directors were provided with, among other things,
final versions of the merger agreement and the other definitive documents, including the proposed certificate of incorporation of the
combined company and the proposed amendments to Idera's bylaws, draft proposed resolutions approving the business combination and
financial analyses prepared by Goldman Sachs (based on the

BioCryst Management Forecasts as adjusted by Idera management). Mr. Milano provided an update on the negotiation of the exchange
ratio and reviewed with the Idera board BioCryst's final offer of an exchange ratio of 0.40 holding company shares for each share of Idera
and a BioCryst exchange ratio of 1.0 (to be adjusted as appropriate based on any reduced exchange ratio for BioCryst), implying
ownership by Idera stockholders of approximately 48.4% in the combined company on a fully diluted basis. Mr. Milano noted that the
exchange ratio of 0.40, while implying a premium on the most recent closing price of BioCryst common stock of 14.1%, was consistent
with the 30-day volume-weighted average prices of BioCryst common stock and Idera common stock, and representatives of Goldman
Sachs and Latham provided their perspectives on the proposed exchange ratio. Mr. Milano then recommended approving the potential
business combination with an exchange ratio of 0.40 (to be adjusted as appropriate based on any reduced exchange ratio for BioCryst). At
this point, Messrs. Baker and Neu exited the meeting, and, following discussion among the remaining Idera board members, Idera
management and representatives of Goldman Sachs and Latham, the Idera board determined to move forward with the exchange ratio of
0.40 (to be adjusted as appropriate based on any reduced exchange ratio for BioCryst). At this point, Messrs. Baker and Neu rejoined the
meeting, and Messrs. Baker and Neu each read statements reminding the Idera board of BBA's affiliates' ownership interest in both Idera
and BioCryst as well as the personal ownership interest of each of Messrs. Baker and Neu in Idera and BioCryst, with such statements
noting the number and type of securities of Idera and BioCryst owned by BBA and its affiliates and each of Messrs. Baker and Neu
individually. See "The Mergers—Interests of Idera Directors, Executive Officers and Certain of their Affiliates in the Mergers—Holdings
of Baker Brothers as of January 21, 2018" beginning on page 100 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus for more information. The
statements also noted that Messrs. Baker and Neu's support of the potential business combination as Idera board members would take into
account discussions among members of Idera management, the Idera board, excluding Messrs. Baker and Neu, and Idera's advisors, as
well as the financial analyses of Goldman Sachs. Following the statements, the Idera board determined that Messrs. Baker and Neu could
participate in the remainder of the meeting. Representatives of Latham then provided an overview of the final merger agreement and a
summary of the resolved issues. Representatives of Goldman Sachs then reviewed with the Idera board its financial analysis and rendered
to the Idera board an oral opinion of Goldman Sachs, subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion, dated January 21, 2018, to
the effect that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the factors and the assumptions set forth in Goldman Sachs' written opinion,
the Idera exchange ratio pursuant to the merger agreement was fair from a financial point of view, to the holders (other than BioCryst and
its affiliates) of Idera common stock, as more fully described in the section entitled "The Mergers—Opinion of Idera's Financial Advisor—
Goldman Sachs" beginning on page 84 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus. A discussion ensued regarding the potential business
combination with BioCryst. In the course of its deliberations, the Idera board considered a number of factors, including those described
more fully below under the section entitled "The Mergers—Idera's Reasons for the Mergers; Recommendation of the Idera Board"
beginning on page 67 of this joint statement/prospectus. Following these discussions, representatives of Latham reviewed resolutions
approving the mergers, the merger agreement and the related matters that had been previously distributed to the Idera board. The Idera
board unanimously determined that the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the mergers, are advisable,
fair to and in the best interests of Idera and its stockholders and authorized the appropriate officers of Idera to execute and deliver the
merger agreement, the amendment to Idera's bylaws and related documents.

        On the afternoon of January 21, 2018, Mr. Milano called Mr. Stonehouse and informed him that the Idera board had approved the
transaction with the most recent relative exchange ratios as proposed by BioCryst.

        Later that day, a special telephonic meeting of the BioCryst board was held for the purpose of considering approval and adoption of
the merger agreement with Idera. Members of BioCryst

management and representatives of J.P. Morgan and Skadden participated in the meeting. Representatives of Skadden reviewed legal
matters including BioCryst directors' duties in connection with the proposed transaction with Idera and reviewed with the BioCryst board
key terms of the merger agreement and the voting and support agreements with BBA. Representatives of J.P. Morgan then reviewed with
the BioCryst board its financial analysis of the BioCryst exchange ratio in the proposed transaction and delivered to the BioCryst board its
oral opinion, which was confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated January 21, 2018, to the effect that, as of such date and based
upon and subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken by J.P.
Morgan in preparing the opinion, the BioCryst exchange ratio in the proposed transaction was fair, from a financial point of view, to the
holders of BioCryst common stock, as more fully described in the section entitled "The Mergers—Opinion of BioCryst's Financial
Advisor—J.P. Morgan" beginning on page 94 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus. Following the presentation, Mr. Stonehouse
provided BioCryst management's view of the proposed transaction, and the BioCryst board discussed the proposed transaction. Following
discussion the BioCryst board unanimously approved and adopted the merger agreement, approved the transactions contemplated by the
merger agreement and resolved to recommend that BioCryst stockholders approve the merger agreement.

        In the evening of January 21, 2018, the merger agreement and the voting and support agreements were executed by Idera and
BioCryst. The transaction was announced by joint press release on the morning of January 22, 2018.

Idera's Reasons for the Mergers; Recommendation of the Idera Board 

        In evaluating the mergers, the Idera board consulted with Idera's management and legal and financial advisors, and in reaching its
decision to approve the merger agreement and recommend its adoption by Idera stockholders, the Idera board considered a number of
factors and a substantial amount of information, including the following:

• Better Position as a Company with Diversified Late-Stage Pipeline.  The combined company will have a more robust
product pipeline led by two Phase 3 rare disease programs, two Phase 2 rare disease programs and a variety of early stage
programs and supporting assets. 

• Financial Strength and Opportunities.  The mergers will result in approximately $243 million net cash balance, excluding
any repayment of existing debt, at announcement of the mergers (unaudited pro forma cash balance as of December 31,
2017), providing capital for continued clinical development beyond each company's respective next milestone event and
allowing for commercial launch planning and preparation and opportunities to generate non-dilutive capital through non-
strategic assets and indications. 

• Significant Synergy Potential.  The combined company will have significant synergy potential with strong management,
modern facilities and institutional knowledge in rare diseases as well as potentially complimentary discovery engines. 

• Participation in Potential Appreciation.  The fact that Idera stockholders will own approximately 48.4% of the combined
company following completion of the mergers and will continue to participate in potential appreciation in equity value of
the combined company, in each case calculated on a fully diluted basis using the treasury stock method. 

• Significant Pre-Tax Synergies.  The combined company is expected to realize approximately $30 million in annual pre-tax
synergies by the third year following completion of the mergers, disclosed in the "Financial Forecasts" (as defined in
"Important Information About the Financial Forecasts" beginning on page 83 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus),
which synergies would not be achievable without completing the mergers.

financial point of view, to the holders of Idera common stock (other than BioCryst and its affiliates), which opinion was
based on and subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and limitations and qualifications
on the review undertaken by Goldman Sachs as set forth in Goldman Sachs' written opinion, as more fully described under

BioCryst, which included review of historical financial results and projections, existing agreements, contingent liabilities
and legal and other matters, and the subsequent recommendation of the mergers by Idera's management; 

• Financial Projections.  The financial projections prepared by Idera management for Idera as a standalone company through

statement/prospectus for a detailed discussion of the terms and conditions of the merger agreement. In particular, the Idera
board considered the following: 

• Fixed Exchange Ratio.  The fixed exchange ratio of 0.20 shares of Holdco common stock for each share of Idera
common stock, by its nature, would not adjust upwards to compensate

for declines, or downwards to compensate for increases, in Holdco's stock price prior to completion of the mergers;

• Reciprocity.  The review by the Idera board, in consultation with Idera's advisors, of the structure of the mergers
and terms of the merger agreement, including certain reciprocal provisions that may have the effect of discouraging
alternative acquisition proposals involving Idera or BioCryst and their ability to terminate the merger agreement; 

• Conditions to Consummation of the Merger.  The limited number and nature of the conditions to the parties'
obligations to complete the mergers and the belief of the Idera board of the likelihood of satisfying such conditions;

under the merger agreement to withdraw its recommendation to Idera stockholders that they adopt the merger
agreement as summarized under "The Merger Agreement—Changes in Board Recommendations" beginning on
page 124 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus; 

• Opportunity to Vote.  Idera stockholders will have an opportunity to vote on the adoption of the merger agreement;

complete the BioCryst merger that BioCryst receive an opinion from Skadden, dated as of the closing date, to the effect
that the BioCryst merger will qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code or,
alternatively, the mergers together will be treated as an "exchange" described in Section 351 of the Code; (ii) it is a
condition to Idera's obligation to complete the Idera merger that Idera receive an opinion from Latham, dated as of the
closing date, to the effect that the mergers together will be treated as an "exchange" described in Section 351 of the Code;
and (iii) assuming that the mergers are treated as described above for U.S. federal income tax purposes, a U.S. holder of
BioCryst common stock or Idera common stock will not recognize any gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes
upon the exchange of shares of BioCryst common stock or Idera common stock for shares of Holdco common stock in the
BioCryst merger or the Idera merger, respectively, except with respect to cash received by BioCryst and Idera stockholders
in lieu of fractional shares of Holdco common stock;

        The Idera board also weighed the factors described above against a number of risks and other factors identified in its deliberations as
weighing negatively against the mergers:

• the challenges inherent in combining the businesses, operations and workforces of Idera and BioCryst, including: (i) the
possible diversion of management focus and resources from operational matters and other strategic opportunities for an
extended period of time and (ii) difficulties in integrating and retaining management and employees, including from the
two companies' respective labor groups; 

• the fact that forecasts of future results of operations and synergies are necessarily estimates based on assumptions, the risk
of not realizing anticipated synergies and cost savings between Idera and BioCryst and the risk that other anticipated
benefits might not be realized; 

• the fact that Idera stockholders will be sharing participation of Idera's upside with BioCryst stockholders as part of the
combined company; 

• the amount of time it could take to consummate the mergers, including the fact that consummation of the mergers depends
on factors outside of Idera's control, and the risk that the conditions to consummation will not be satisfied, including as a
result of (i) Idera stockholders failing to grant the requisite approvals to consummate the mergers or (ii) the required
regulatory approvals for the mergers failing to be obtained; 

• the substantial costs to be incurred in connection with the mergers, including the substantial cash and other costs of
integrating the businesses of Idera and BioCryst, as well as the transaction expenses arising from the mergers; 

• the potential effect of the mergers on Idera's business and relationships with employees, doctors, patients, regulators and
the communities in which it operates; 

• the risk that governmental entities may not approve the mergers or may impose conditions on Idera or BioCryst in order to
gain approval for the mergers that may adversely impact the ability of the combined company to realize the anticipated
synergies in connection with the mergers; 

• the terms of the merger agreement, including generally reciprocal covenants relating to (i) the two companies' conduct of
their respective businesses during the period between the signing of the merger agreement and the completion of the
mergers, (ii) the restriction on the two companies' ability to solicit alternative transaction proposals and (iii) the fact that
Idera might be required to hold a stockholder vote to adopt the merger agreement and approve the transactions
contemplated thereby, including the mergers, even though the Idera board might have withdrawn its recommendation prior
to such stockholder vote; 

• the fact that, in certain circumstances, the BioCryst board has the right under the merger agreement to withdraw its
recommendation to BioCryst stockholders that they adopt the merger agreement as summarized under "The Merger
Agreement—Changes in Board Recommendations" beginning on page 124 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus; 

• the fact that Idera is obligated to pay BioCryst a termination fee of $25 million in certain circumstances as summarized
under "The Merger Agreement—Expenses and Termination Fees; Liability for Breach" beginning on page 134 of this joint
proxy statement/prospectus; 

• the fact that Idera is obligated to reimburse BioCryst a fixed expense reimbursement amount of $6 million under certain
circumstances as summarized under "The Merger Agreement—Expenses and Termination Fees; Liability for Breach"
beginning on page 134 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus;

• the possibility that the mergers might not be completed, or that completion might be unduly delayed, for reasons beyond
Idera's or BioCryst's control and the potential negative impact that may have on Idera's business and relationships with
employees, doctors, patients, regulators and the communities in which it operates; 

• the fact that the applicable merger exchange ratios are fixed and will not be adjusted on the closing date based on the
relative market values of shares of Idera common stock or BioCryst common stock, which means that the market value of
the merger consideration received by Idera stockholders could decrease prior to the consummation of the mergers; and 

• the risks of the type and nature described under "Risk Factors" and the matters described under "Cautionary Statement
Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" beginning on pages 22 and 20, respectively, of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus.

        The Idera board also was apprised of certain interests in the mergers of Idera's directors and executive officers that may be different
from, or in addition to, the interests of Idera stockholders generally as discussed in "The Mergers—Interests of Idera Directors, Executive
Officers and Certain of their Affiliates in the Mergers" beginning on page 99 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

        This discussion of the information and factors considered by the Idera board in reaching its conclusions and recommendation
summarizes the material factors considered by the board, but is not intended to be exhaustive. In view of the wide variety of factors
considered in connection with its evaluation of the mergers and the complexity of these matters, the Idera board did not find it practicable,
and did not attempt, to quantify, rank or assign any relative or specific weights to the various factors that it considered in reaching its
determination to approve the merger agreement and to recommend that Idera stockholders vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the merger
agreement.

        The Idera board conducted an overall review of the factors described above and considered the factors overall to be favorable to and
to support its determination. In considering the factors described above, individual members of the Idera board may have given differing
weights to different factors.

        The Idera board unanimously approved the merger agreement and determined that the merger agreement and the
transactions contemplated thereby, including the mergers, are advisable, fair to and in the best interests of Idera and its
stockholders. The Idera board unanimously recommends that Idera stockholders vote "FOR" the proposal to adopt the merger
agreement.

BioCryst's Reasons for the Mergers; Recommendation of the BioCryst Board

        By unanimous vote, the BioCryst board, at a meeting held on January 21, 2018, determined that the merger agreement and the
transactions contemplated thereby, including the mergers, are fair, advisable and in the best interests of BioCryst and its stockholders. In
addition, subject to the terms of the merger agreement, the BioCryst board resolved to recommend that the BioCryst stockholders approve
the adoption of the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby. THE BIOCRYST BOARD UNANIMOUSLY
RECOMMENDS THAT BIOCRYST STOCKHOLDERS VOTE "FOR" THE ADOPTION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT,
"FOR" THE APPROVAL ON A NON-BINDING ADVISORY BASIS, THE COMPENSATION THAT MAY BECOME
PAYABLE TO BIOCRYST'S NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS THAT IS BASED ON OR OTHERWISE RELATES TO THE
MERGERS AND "FOR" THE ADJOURNMENT OF THE BIOCRYST SPECIAL MEETING, IF NECESSARY OR
APPROPRIATE, TO SOLICIT ADDITIONAL PROXIES IF THERE ARE NOT SUFFICIENT VOTES TO ADOPT THE
MERGER AGREEMENT.

        In evaluating the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, the BioCryst board consulted with BioCryst senior
management, its outside legal counsel and financial advisors. This explanation of BioCryst's reasons for the mergers and all other
information presented in this section should be read in light of the factors discussed in the section entitled "Cautionary Statement
Regarding

Forward-Looking Statements" beginning on page 20 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus. In recommending that BioCryst stockholders
vote their shares of BioCryst common stock in favor of adoption of the merger agreement, the BioCryst board considered a number of
factors, including the following (not necessarily in order of relative importance):

• Compelling Strategic Combination.  The BioCryst board's belief that due to the strategic fit of BioCryst and Idera, the
mergers represent a compelling strategic combination that will result in a more competitive combined company focused on
rare diseases that will have available to it strategic opportunities to enhance stockholder value that would not have been
available to BioCryst by itself, based on consideration of factors including: 

• BioCryst and Idera believe that the mergers will result in a dynamic combined company that integrates and
capitalizes on both BioCryst's and Idera's separate and complementary talents, experiences and expertise to
successfully commercialize late stage development candidates and to expand the number of rare disease targets that
can be advanced into development; 

• the combined company will have a more robust product pipeline led by two Phase 3 programs, two Phase 2 rare
disease programs and a variety of early stage programs and supporting assets; 

• risk diversification for BioCryst stockholders, as the combined company will have more drug candidates and
therefore more opportunities for success; and 

• the combined company will have synergistic discovery capabilities that will expand the number of future rare
disease targets to evaluate and advance into development. 

• All Stock Consideration.  The all-stock consideration provides BioCryst stockholders with an opportunity to participate in
the equity value of the combined company, including future growth from successful commercialization of product
candidates and the expected synergies resulting from the mergers. In addition, the BioCryst board considered the fact that
(i) the merger agreement provides for fixed exchange ratios and that no adjustment will be made in the merger
consideration to be received by BioCryst stockholders or Idera stockholders in the mergers as a result of possible increases
or decreases in the trading price of the BioCryst common stock or Idera common stock following the announcement of the
mergers and (ii) based on the shares of BioCryst common stock and Idera common stock outstanding or reserved for
issuance, BioCryst stockholders would own approximately 51.6% of the combined company calculated on a fully diluted
basis using the treasury stock method. 

• Financial Strength and Opportunities.  The BioCryst board's belief that the combined company will have increased
financial strength and flexibility, with approximately $243 million in pro forma net cash, excluding any repayment of
existing debt, as of December 31, 2017, to support ongoing clinical and commercial activities, as well as opportunities to
further strengthen the combined company's cash position through partnering arrangements. 

• Best Available Alternative for Enhancing Stockholder Value.  The BioCryst board's determination, after consultation with
management and its financial and legal advisors, that entering into the merger agreement with Idera was more favorable to
BioCryst stockholders than other alternatives available to BioCryst, including continued operation of BioCryst on a
standalone basis or the pursuit of potential alternative transactions. In making its determination, the BioCryst board took
into account factors including (i) the BioCryst board's assessment of BioCryst's business and operations, financial prospects
and conditions and the determination that continued operation of BioCryst on a standalone basis was not likely to produce,
on a risk-adjusted basis, values that would create more value for BioCryst stockholders than the value created by the
combined company, (ii) the BioCryst board's belief as to the potential to create

Table of Contents

meaningful synergies resulting from a combination with Idera, from which BioCryst stockholders will be positioned to
benefit based on their ownership of approximately 51.6% of the combined company calculated on a fully diluted basis at
closing using the treasury stock method, (iii) the BioCryst board's belief that the transaction creates risk diversification for
stockholders as Holdco will have more opportunities for success and (iv) the BioCryst board's belief that an all-stock
transaction allows BioCryst stockholders to participate, pro rata, in any upside.

• Appropriate Time to Pursue a Transaction.  In light of the status of BioCryst's development programs and the current stage
of BioCryst's businesses, the BioCryst board believed it was an opportune time to pursue a strategic transaction. 

• Financial Analyses of J.P. Morgan and Receipt of Fairness Opinion.  J.P. Morgan's oral opinion, and the financial analyses
in connection therewith, rendered to the BioCryst board, subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion, dated
January 21, 2018, that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters
considered and limitations on the review undertaken by J.P. Morgan in preparing the opinion, the BioCryst exchange ratio
of 0.50 shares of Holdco common stock to be paid for each share of BioCryst common stock pursuant to the merger
agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of shares of BioCryst common stock, as more fully
described in the section titled "The Mergers—Opinion of BioCryst's Financial Advisor—J.P. Morgan" beginning on
page 94 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus. 

• Opportunity to Receive Alternative Transaction Proposals.  BioCryst's right, in circumstances specified in the merger
agreement, to respond to and negotiate unsolicited takeover proposals made before the time BioCryst's stockholders
approve the proposal to adopt the merger agreement. 

• High Likelihood of Completion.  The BioCryst board's view that the likelihood of completion of the mergers is high,
particularly in light of the following: 

• execution of voting and support agreements between BioCryst and certain Idera stockholders who collectively own
approximately 18% of the outstanding Idera common stock pursuant to which such stockholders agreed to vote in
favor of the adoption of the merger agreement and against any competing proposal at the Idera special meeting; 

• the BioCryst board's view, after consultation with its legal counsel, concerning the likelihood that regulatory
approvals and clearances necessary to consummate the mergers would be obtained; and 

• the terms of the merger agreement and the conditions to closing the mergers, including: 

• the requirement that BioCryst and Idera take any and all steps necessary (subject to agreed limitations) to
obtain regulatory approval; 

• that Idera is prohibited from soliciting other competing proposals, subject to a customary 'fiduciary out'
exception permitting it to take certain actions in response to certain unsolicited proposals; and 

• the limited nature of the conditions to each party's obligation to complete the transaction. 

• Arm's Length Terms and Other Factors Related to the Merger Agreement.  The BioCryst board's view that the merger
agreement was the product of arm's length negotiations and contained

Table of Contents

customary terms and conditions, and its consideration of a number of other factors pertaining to the merger agreement,
including:

• the structure of the transaction should allow sufficient time for a third party to pursue a superior proposal if it
desired to do so; 

• subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the merger agreement, the ability of the BioCryst board to change its
recommendation to the BioCryst stockholders if BioCryst receives a superior proposal or upon the occurrence of an
intervening event that was not known to or reasonably foreseeable by the BioCryst board as of January 21, 2018; 

• termination provisions in the merger agreement, including that the end date under the merger agreement (which
may be extended under specified circumstances) on which either party, subject to specified exceptions, can
terminate the merger agreement should provide sufficient time to consummate the transaction; 

• Idera's obligation to pay BioCryst a termination fee of $25 million if the merger agreement is terminated by
BioCryst after the Idera board has effected an "Idera adverse recommendation change" (as defined in "The Merger
Agreement—Changes in Board Recommendations" beginning on page 124 of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus) or entered into a definitive agreement in respect of a competing proposal within 12 months
after termination of the merger agreement (as further described in the section entitled "The Merger Agreement"
beginning on page 116), and Idera's obligation to pay BioCryst a fixed expense reimbursement of $6 million under
certain circumstance if the merger agreement is terminated as the result of a failure by Idera stockholders to
approve the merger agreement; 

• BioCryst's ability to specifically enforce, or seek damages upon any breach of, Idera's obligations under the merger
agreement; and 

• the unanimous approval of the merger agreement by the BioCryst board, which consists of a majority of
independent directors who are not affiliated with BioCryst and are not employees of BioCryst or any of its
subsidiaries, and which retained and received advice from BioCryst's outside financial and legal advisors in
evaluating, negotiating and recommending the terms of the merger agreement.

        The BioCryst board also considered a number of uncertainties and risks in its deliberations concerning the mergers and the other
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the following (not necessarily in order of relative importance):

• that the merger agreement includes a "force the vote" provision requiring each of BioCryst and Idera to submit the merger
agreement to their respective stockholders, irrespective of any adverse recommendation change, and that BioCryst cannot
terminate the merger agreement in order to accept a superior proposal, which could discourage other potential parties from
making a competing offer; 

• that under the terms of the merger agreement, BioCryst is unable to solicit other competing proposals during the pendency

• that, under specified circumstances, BioCryst may be required to pay fees and expense reimbursement to Idera in the event
the merger agreement is terminated and the effect this could have on BioCryst, including: 

• the possibility that the termination fee payable by BioCryst under certain circumstances could discourage other
potential parties from making a competing offer; although the BioCryst board believed that the termination fee was
reasonable in amount and would not unduly deter any other party that might be interested in making a competing
proposal; 

• if the mergers are not consummated, BioCryst may be required to pay its own expenses associated with the merger
agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby; and 

• BioCryst's obligation to pay Idera a termination fee of $25 million if the merger agreement is terminated by Idera
after the BioCryst board has effected a "BioCryst adverse recommendation change" (as defined in "The Merger
Agreement—Changes in Board Recommendations" beginning on page 124 of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus) or entered into a definitive agreement in respect of a competing proposal within 12 months
after termination of the merger agreement (as further described in the section entitled "The Merger Agreement"
beginning on page 116 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus), and BioCryst's obligation to pay Idera a fixed
expense reimbursement of $6 million under certain circumstance if the merger agreement is terminated as the result
of a failure by BioCryst stockholders to approve the merger agreement; 

• the significant costs involved in connection with entering into the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated
thereby, including the mergers, and the substantial time and effort of management required to complete the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement, including the mergers, which may disrupt BioCryst's business operations; 

• that the consummation of the mergers require regulatory approvals and the risk that notwithstanding BioCryst's and Idera's
obligations with respect to obtaining regulatory approvals, governmental entities may seek to impose unfavorable terms or
conditions, or otherwise fail to grant, such approvals; 

• the possibility that the mergers might not be consummated, and the possible adverse effect of termination of the merger
agreement on BioCryst or the trading price of BioCryst common stock, and related risks including: 

• that, even if the merger agreement is approved by BioCryst stockholders, Idera stockholders may not approve the
merger agreement; 

• that, even if the merger agreement is approved by BioCryst stockholders and Idera stockholders, there can be no
assurance that all other conditions to the parties' obligations to complete the mergers will be satisfied; and 

• that BioCryst may be at risk for loss of members of management and other key personnel following announcement
of the transaction, and may not be able to effectively replace such persons, which could adversely affect BioCryst's
business during the period prior to consummation of the mergers, or if the mergers are not consummated, as
BioCryst's operations are largely dependent on the skill and experience of its management and key personnel; 

• the restrictions on the conduct of BioCryst's business prior to the consummation of the mergers, including the requirement
that BioCryst conduct business in the ordinary course, subject to specific limitations, which may delay or prevent BioCryst
from undertaking business opportunities that may arise before the completion of the mergers and that, absent the merger
agreement, BioCryst might have pursued;

to, those of BioCryst stockholders generally; for more information about such interests, see the section titled "The Mergers
—Interests of BioCryst Directors and Executive Officers in the Mergers" beginning on page 106 of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus; 

• risks of the type and nature described under the sections titled "Risk Factors" and "Cautionary Statements Regarding
Forward-Looking Statements" beginning on pages 22 and 20, respectively, of this joint proxy statement/prospectus; and 

• U.S. federal income tax consequences of the mergers to U.S. holders of BioCryst common stock, as further described under
the section titled "U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Mergers" beginning on page 137 of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus.

The BioCryst board considered all of these factors as a whole and believed that, overall, the potential benefits of the mergers to BioCryst's
stockholders outweighed the uncertainties and risks of the mergers.

        The foregoing discussion of factors considered by the BioCryst board is not intended to be exhaustive, but includes the material
factors considered by the BioCryst board. In light of the variety of factors considered in connection with its evaluation of the mergers and
the complexity of these matters, the BioCryst board did not find it practicable to, and did not, quantify, rank or otherwise assign relative
weights to the specific factors considered in reaching its determinations and recommendations. Moreover, each member of the BioCryst
board applied his or her own personal business judgment to the process and may have viewed factors differently or given different weight
or merit to different factors. The BioCryst board did not undertake to make any specific determination as to whether any factor, or any
particular aspect of any factor, supported or did not support its ultimate determination. The BioCryst board based its recommendation on
the totality of the information presented. The BioCryst board evaluated the factors described above, among others, and reached the
conclusion that it is in the best interests of BioCryst and its stockholders, and declared it advisable, to enter into the merger agreement, and
unanimously approved the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the merger, and
resolved to recommend the adoption of the merger agreement by BioCryst stockholders and resolved that the adoption of the merger
agreement be submitted to a vote at a meeting of BioCryst stockholders.

Certain Financial Forecasts Utilized by the Idera Board and Idera's Financial Advisor in Connection with the Mergers 

        The unaudited prospective financial data presented below includes projections prepared by Idera management. Idera does not, as a
matter of course, normally make public long-term projections or publicly disclose financial projections or forecasts as to future
performances, revenues, earnings or other results given, among other things, the unpredictability of the underlying assumptions and
estimates inherent in preparing financial projections and forecasts. As a result, Idera does not endorse unaudited prospective financial
information as a reliable indication of future results.

        The unaudited financial projections concerning Idera and BioCryst set forth below, as well as the synergy estimates and unaudited
financial projections for the combined company after the completion of the mergers set forth below, were made available as described
below to the Idera board in its review and evaluation of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, and to Goldman Sachs for
its use and reliance in connection with its financial analyses and opinion to the Idera board described under "The Mergers—Opinion of
Idera's Financial Advisor—Goldman Sachs" beginning on page 84 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus and, in the case of the Idera
Unadjusted Management Projections, to BioCryst. The summary of these financial projections is not being included in this joint proxy

Financial Forecasts Related to Idera

        Idera management prepared unaudited unadjusted financial projections for Idera (the "Idera Unadjusted Management Projections")
for the fiscal years ending December 31, 2018 through 2030. The Idera Unadjusted Management Projections were based on numerous
variables and assumptions including key assumptions around the following: (1) capitalization and expenditure estimates; (2) product
pricing and pricing increases; (3) composition of patients, (4) product launch dates and (5) market share. The Idera Unadjusted
Management Projections are being described herein solely because they were provided to BioCryst in connection with its review and
evaluation of the mergers. The Idera Unadjusted Management Projections are summarized in the following table:

 

        Using the Idera Unadjusted Management Projections, Idera management prepared unaudited financial projections for Idera (the
"Idera Adjusted Management Projections") for the fiscal years ending December 31, 2018 through 2030, which were adjusted based on
numerous variables, including the following: (1) Idera management's assessment of the probability of success for Idera's products;
(2) Idera's federal net operating loss balance and the future usability of such tax attributes; (3) expectations around future equity
financings; and (4) capitalization estimates. The Idera board utilized the Idera Adjusted Management Projections in connection with its
review and evaluation of the mergers, and Goldman Sachs used the Idera Adjusted Management Projections in connection with its
financial analyses and opinion to the Idera board, as described in the section titled "The Mergers—Opinion of Idera's Financial Advisor—

Financial Forecasts Related to BioCryst

        BioCryst management prepared unaudited unadjusted financial projections for BioCryst for the fiscal years ending December 31,

Certain Financial Forecasts Utilized by the BioCryst Board and BioCryst's Financial Advisor in Connection with the Mergers 

        BioCryst does not normally make public long-term projections as to future revenues, earnings or other results due to the uncertainty
of the underlying assumptions and estimates. However, in connection with the BioCryst board's review of potential strategic alternatives,
BioCryst management provided the BioCryst board and J.P. Morgan with forecasts for the performance of BioCryst's business for the
fiscal years 2018 through 2037. These prospective forecasts were based on internal assumptions about the probability of success for
product candidates, probability of regulatory approvals, launch timing, pricing, market growth, market share, competition, the commercial
life of the product candidates, and other relevant factors related to the commercialization of each of BioCryst's products and product
candidates (the "BioCryst Adjusted Management Projections"). In addition, BioCryst management provided forecasts which were not risk
adjusted to include a probability of success for BioCryst's product candidates (the "BioCryst Unadjusted Management Projections," and
together with the BioCryst Adjusted Management Projections, the "BioCryst Management Projections"). BioCryst management provided
Idera solely with the BioCryst Unadjusted Management Projections. The BioCryst Management Projections, which are summarized below,
were made available to the BioCryst board for purposes of considering and evaluating the transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement, and to J.P. Morgan for use in performing its financial analyses in connection with rendering its fairness opinion, which is
attached as Annex C to this joint proxy statement/prospectus. BioCryst makes and has made no representation to Idera, in the merger
agreement or otherwise, concerning the BioCryst Management Projections. For purposes of the BioCryst Adjusted Management

        The BioCryst Adjusted Management Projections summarized above were prepared by BioCryst management based on assumptions,
including the following: (i) a tax rate of 23.5%, (ii) net operating losses of $487 million, with no limitations on use, and (iii) a net cash
balance of $143 million. The BioCryst Adjusted Management Projections are based upon financial, operating and commercial assumptions
developed solely using the information available to BioCryst management at the time the BioCryst Adjusted Management Projections
were created.

Financial Forecasts Related to Idera

        Idera management provided BioCryst with long-term projections for fiscal years 2018 through 2030, that did not include adjustments
for the probability of success for Idera's product candidates. At the direction of the BioCryst board, BioCryst management adjusted Idera
management's long-term projections and extended the projections to 2034 (the "BioCryst Adjusted Idera Projections"), by applying
BioCryst management's internal assumptions about the probability of success, regulatory approval, launch timing, pricing, market growth,
market share, competition, commercial life of the product candidates, and other relevant factors related to the commercialization of each of
Idera's product candidates, as well as projections of operating expenses, which included research and development expenses, selling and
marketing expenses, and general administrative costs not attributed to a specific product, as well as tax rate assumptions. The BioCryst
Adjusted Idera Projections, which are summarized below, were made available to the BioCryst board for purposes of considering and
evaluating the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, and to J.P. Morgan for use in performing its financial analysis in
connection with rendering its fairness opinion, in this joint proxy statement/prospectus. For more information on J.P. Morgan's fairness
opinion, see the section entitled "The Mergers—Opinion of BioCryst's Financial Advisor—J.P. Morgan" beginning on page 94 of this joint
proxy statement/prospectus. The following table presents a summary of the BioCryst Adjusted Idera Projections:

Important Information About the Financial Forecasts 

        The inclusion of the BioCryst Adjusted Management Projections, the BioCryst Unadjusted Management Projections, the BioCryst
Adjusted Idera Projections, the Idera Adjusted BioCryst Projections, the Idera Unadjusted Management Projections, the Idera Adjusted
Management Projections, the Combined Company Projections and any other materials referring to or derived from such projections (all
such projections and other materials being referred to as the "Financial Forecasts") in this joint proxy statement/prospectus should not be
regarded as an indication that any of BioCryst, J.P. Morgan, Idera, Goldman Sachs, their advisors or any of their respective affiliates,
officers, directors, partners, advisors or other representatives considered, or now considers, those projections to be predictive of actual
future results, and does not constitute an admission or representation by BioCryst or Idera that this information is material. There can be
no assurance that the projected results will be realized or that actual results will not be materially lower or higher than estimated, whether
or not the mergers are completed.

        The forecasts and the adjusted Idera forecasts, while prepared with numerical specificity, necessarily were based on numerous
variables and assumptions that are inherently uncertain, many of which are beyond BioCryst's control. The forecasts and adjusted Idera
forecasts reflect numerous estimates and assumptions made by BioCryst and Idera based on information available at the time of
preparation, and no assurances can be made regarding future events or that the assumptions made in preparing the Financial Forecasts will
accurately reflect future conditions. In preparing the Financial Forecasts, BioCryst management and Idera management made assumptions
regarding, among other things, future economic, competitive, regulatory and financial market conditions and future business decisions that
may not be realized and that are inherently subject to significant uncertainties and contingencies, including, among others, risks and
uncertainties described or incorporated by reference in the sections entitled "Risk Factors" and "Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-
Looking Statements" on pages 22 and 20, respectively, of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, all of which are difficult to predict and
many of which are beyond the control of BioCryst and Idera and will be beyond the control of the combined company. There can be no
assurance that the underlying assumptions or projected results in the Financial Forecasts will be realized, and actual results will likely
differ, and may differ materially, from those reflected in the Financial Forecasts, whether or not the mergers are completed. As a result, the
Financial Forecasts cannot be considered predictive of actual future operating results, and this information should not be relied on as such.

        Since the Financial Forecasts cover multiple years, the information by its nature becomes less predictive with each successive year.
BioCryst stockholders and Idera stockholders are urged to review the SEC filings of BioCryst and Idera for a description of risk factors
with respect to the businesses of BioCryst and Idera, as well as the risks and other factors described or incorporated by reference in the
sections entitled "Risk Factors" and "Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" on pages 22 and 20, respectively, of
this joint proxy statement/prospectus. The Financial Forecasts were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure, nor were they
prepared with a view toward compliance with published guidelines of the SEC, the guidelines established by the American Institute of
Certified Public Accountants for preparation and presentation of prospective financial information, or GAAP.

Table of Contents

        The Financial Forecasts include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in
isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information presented in compliance with GAAP, and non-GAAP financial measures as used
by BioCryst and Idera may not be comparable to similarly titled amounts used by other companies. The footnotes to the tables above
provide certain supplemental information with respect to the calculation of these non-GAAP financial measures. The independent
registered public accounting firms of BioCryst and Idera have not audited, reviewed, compiled or performed any procedures with respect
to the Financial Forecasts for the purpose of their inclusion herein. Accordingly, the independent registered public accounting firms of
BioCryst and Idera do not express an opinion or provide any form of assurance with respect thereto for the purpose of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus. The reports of the independent registered public accounting firms of BioCryst and Idera incorporated by reference in
this joint proxy statement/prospectus relate to the historical financial information of BioCryst and Idera. They do not extend to the
Financial Forecasts and should not be read to do so. The Financial Forecasts do not take into account any circumstances or events
occurring after the date they were prepared and do not give effect to the mergers.

        READERS OF THIS DOCUMENT ARE CAUTIONED NOT TO PLACE UNDUE RELIANCE ON THE FINANCIAL
FORECASTS. BIOCRYST AND IDERA DO NOT INTEND TO UPDATE OR OTHERWISE REVISE THE FINANCIAL
FORECASTS TO REFLECT CIRCUMSTANCES EXISTING AFTER THE DATE WHEN MADE OR TO REFLECT THE
OCCURRENCE OF FUTURE EVENTS, EVEN IN THE EVENT THAT ANY OR ALL OF THE ASSUMPTIONS
UNDERLYING THE FINANCIAL FORECASTS ARE NO LONGER APPROPRIATE, EXCEPT AS MAY BE REQUIRED BY
LAW.

Opinion of Idera's Financial Advisor—Goldman Sachs 

        At a meeting of the Idera board held on January 21, 2018, Goldman Sachs delivered to the Idera board its oral opinion, subsequently
confirmed in writing, to the effect that, as of January 21, 2018 and based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth in
Goldman Sachs' written opinion, the Idera exchange ratio of 0.20 shares of Holdco common stock for each share of Idera common stock
pursuant to the merger agreement was fair from a financial point of view to the holders (other than BioCryst and its affiliates) of shares of
Idera common stock.

        The full text of the written opinion of Goldman Sachs, dated January 21, 2018, which sets forth the assumptions made,
procedures followed, matters considered, qualifications and limitations on the review undertaken in connection with the opinion, is
attached as Annex B to this joint proxy statement/prospectus. The summary of Goldman Sachs' opinion contained in this joint
proxy statement/prospectus is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of Goldman Sachs' written opinion. Goldman
Sachs' advisory services and opinion were provided for the information and assistance of the Idera board in connection with its
consideration of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and the opinion does not constitute a recommendation as
to how any holder of shares of Idera common stock should vote with respect to the transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement or any other matter.

        In connection with rendering the opinion described above and performing its related financial analyses, Goldman Sachs reviewed,
among other things:

• the merger agreement; 

• annual reports to stockholders and Annual Reports on Form 10-K of Idera and BioCryst for the five years ended
December 31, 2016; 

• certain interim reports to stockholders and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q of Idera and BioCryst;

the Mergers"; 

• certain internal financial analyses and forecasts for Idera and certain financial analyses and forecasts for BioCryst, in each
case, on a stand-alone basis and with respect to its products and probabilities of success related thereto, and certain
financial analyses and forecasts for Holdco on a pro-forma basis giving effect to the transactions contemplated by the
merger agreement, in each case, as prepared by the management of Idera and approved for Goldman Sachs' use by Idera,
which are referred to as the Idera Adjusted Management Projections, the Idera Adjusted BioCryst Projections and the
Combined Company Projections (collectively, the "Idera Projections") on a pro forma basis giving effect to the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, in each case, as prepared by the management of Idera and approved
for Goldman Sachs' use by Idera, which are summarized above under the section titled "The Mergers—Certain Financial
Forecasts Utilized by the Idera Board and Idera's Financial Advisor in Connection with the Mergers" beginning on page 76
of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, including certain operating synergies projected by the management of Idera to
result from the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement (the "Synergies"), as approved for Goldman Sachs' use
by Idera; and 

• certain analyses prepared by the management of Idera related to the expected utilization by Idera, BioCryst and Holdco of
certain net operating loss carryforwards (the "NOL Forecasts"), as approved for Goldman Sachs' use by Idera.

        Goldman Sachs also held discussions with members of the senior managements of Idera and BioCryst regarding their assessment of
the strategic rationale for, and the potential benefits of, the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and the past and current
business operations, financial condition and future prospects of BioCryst and with members of the senior management of Idera regarding
their assessment of the past and current business operations, financial condition and future prospects of Idera; reviewed the reported price
and trading activity for the shares of Idera common stock and shares of BioCryst common stock; compared certain financial and stock
market information for Idera and BioCryst with similar information for certain other companies the securities of which are publicly traded;
and performed such other studies and analyses, and considered such other factors, as Goldman Sachs deemed appropriate.

        For purposes of rendering its opinion, Goldman Sachs, with the consent of the Idera board, relied upon and assumed the accuracy and
completeness of all of the financial, legal, regulatory, tax, accounting and other information provided to, discussed with or reviewed by,
Goldman Sachs, without assuming any responsibility for independent verification thereof. In that regard, Goldman Sachs assumed with the
consent of the Idera board that the Idera Projections, including the Synergies, and the NOL Forecasts had been reasonably prepared on a
basis reflecting the best then available estimates and judgments of the management of Idera. Goldman Sachs did not make an independent
evaluation or appraisal of the assets and liabilities (including any contingent, derivative or other off-balance-sheet assets and liabilities) of
Holdco, Idera or BioCryst or any of their respective subsidiaries and Goldman Sachs was not furnished with any such evaluation or
appraisal. Goldman Sachs assumed that all governmental, regulatory or other consents and approvals necessary for the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement would be obtained without any adverse effect on Idera, BioCryst or Holdco or on
the expected benefits of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement in any way meaningful to Goldman Sachs' analysis.
Goldman Sachs assumed that the

Table of Contents

transactions contemplated by the merger agreement would be consummated on the terms set forth in the merger agreement, without the
waiver or modification of any term or condition the effect of which would be in any way meaningful to its analysis.

        Goldman Sachs' opinion does not address the underlying business decision of Idera to engage in the transactions contemplated by the
merger agreement, or the relative merits of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement as compared to any strategic
alternatives that may be available to Idera; nor does it address any legal, regulatory, tax or accounting matters. Goldman Sachs' opinion
addresses only the fairness from a financial point of view to the holders (other than BioCryst and its affiliates) of shares of Idera common
stock, as of the date of the opinion, of the Idera exchange ratio pursuant to the merger agreement. Goldman Sachs did not express any view
on, and its opinion does not address, any other term or aspect of the merger agreement or transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement or any term or aspect of any other agreement or instrument contemplated by the merger agreement or entered into or amended
in connection with the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including, the fairness of the transactions contemplated by the
merger agreement to, or any consideration received in connection therewith by, the holders of any other class of securities, creditors, or
other constituencies of Idera; nor as to the fairness of the amount or nature of any compensation to be paid or payable to any of the
officers, directors or employees of Idera, or class of such persons, in connection with the transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement, whether relative to the Idera exchange ratio pursuant to the merger agreement or otherwise. Goldman Sachs did not express
any opinion as to the prices at which shares of Holdco common stock will trade at any time or as to the impact of the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement on the solvency or viability of Idera, BioCryst or Holdco, or the ability of Idera, BioCryst or
Holdco to pay their respective obligations when they come due. Goldman Sachs' opinion was necessarily based on economic, monetary,
market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to Goldman Sachs as of, the date of the opinion and
Goldman Sachs assumed no responsibility for updating, revising or reaffirming its opinion based on circumstances, developments or
events occurring after the date of the opinion. Goldman Sachs' advisory services and its opinion were provided for the information and
assistance of the Idera board in connection with its consideration of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and the
opinion does not constitute a recommendation as to how any holder of shares of Idera common stock should vote with respect to such
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement or any other matter. Goldman Sachs' opinion was approved by a fairness committee of
Goldman Sachs.

Summary of Financial Analyses

        The following is a summary of the material financial analyses presented by Goldman Sachs to the Idera board in connection with
rendering the opinion described above. The following summary, however, does not purport to be a complete description of the financial
analyses performed by Goldman Sachs, nor does the order of analyses described represent relative importance or weight given to those
analyses by Goldman Sachs. Some of the summaries of the financial analyses include information presented in tabular format. The tables
must be read together with the full text of each summary and are alone not a complete description of Goldman Sachs' financial analyses.
Except as otherwise noted, the following quantitative information, to the extent that it is based on market data, is based on market data as it
existed on or before January 19, 2018, the last completed trading day before Goldman Sachs delivered its opinion to the Idera board, and is
not necessarily indicative of current market conditions.

Implied Value of the Merger Consideration

        Goldman Sachs calculated an implied value of $2.24 for the 0.20 shares of Holdco common stock reflecting the Idera exchange ratio
pursuant to the merger agreement, by multiplying the closing price

exchange ratio into 0.50 shares of Holdco common stock in the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement), by 0.40 (representing
the Idera exchange ratio of 0.20 divided by the BioCryst exchange ratio of 0.50). The closing price per share of Idera common stock was
$2.55 as of January 19, 2018, the last completed trading day before Goldman Sachs delivered its opinion to the Idera board.

Illustrative Sum-of-the-Parts Discounted Cash Flow Analysis for Idera

        Using the Idera Adjusted Management Projections, Goldman Sachs performed an illustrative sum-of-the-parts discounted cash flow
("DCF") analysis to derive a range of stand-alone illustrative present values per share of Idera common stock.

        In connection with this analysis, Goldman Sachs performed separate DCF analyses with respect to the following product candidates
(and indications) of Idera, as well as the revenue and corporate cost items set forth below:

• IMO-2125 (for Melanoma, Head & Neck and Bladder cancer indications); 

• IMO-8400; and 

• nucleic acid chemistry compound.

        Using a mid-year convention and discount rates ranging from 12.5% to 14.5%, reflecting estimates of Idera's weighted average cost
of capital derived by application of a capital asset pricing model, which requires certain company-specific inputs, including the company's
target capital structure weightings, the cost of long-term debt, after-tax yield on permanent excess cash, if any, future applicable marginal
cash tax rate and a beta for the company, as well as certain financial metrics for the United States financial markets generally, Goldman
Sachs discounted to present value as of December 31, 2017, (i) probability of success ("POS"), adjusted estimates of the free cash flows to
be generated from each indication for IMO-2125 referred to above and from each of IMO-8400 and the nucleic acid chemistry compound,
in each case for the period from December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2030 (except with respect to the nucleic acid chemistry compound,
for which the period was from December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2032), all as reflected in the Idera Projections, (ii) POS-adjusted
estimates of the milestones, royalty payments and other amounts to be received by Idera from sales of its product candidates outside of the
United States pursuant to partnerships with third parties ("ex-US partnerships revenue") for the period from December 31, 2017 to
December 31, 2030, all as reflected in the Idera Projections, and (iii) estimates of corporate costs of Idera reflected in the Idera Projections
that had not been allocated to specific products, including clinical costs, research costs, and selling, general and administrative expenses,
to derive a range of illustrative equity values for each product candidate and indication and for the ex-US partnership revenue, and a range
of negative illustrative present values for the Idera corporate costs. Goldman Sachs then derived a range of illustrative equity values for
Idera by adding (a) the ranges of illustrative equity values (and the range of negative illustrative present values) it derived as described
above, (b) an illustrative present value as of December 31, 2017 of the benefits estimated to be derived by Idera from its utilization of its
net operating losses as reflected in the NOL Forecasts, calculated using a discount rate of 12%, reflecting an estimate of Idera's cost of
equity, (c) Idera's cash as of December 31, 2017, as provided by Idera management, and (d) a range of illustrative present values of the
proceeds estimated to be received by Idera from anticipated future financings as reflected in the Idera Projections, calculated using
discount rates ranging from 12.5% to 14.5%.

        Goldman Sachs then divided the range of illustrative equity values it derived for Idera as described above by the total number of fully
diluted shares of Idera common stock calculated based on information provided by Idera management plus additional shares illustratively
assumed to be issued in

the anticipated future financings at the different illustrative equity values for Idera, to derive a range of illustrative present values per share
of Idera common stock ranging from $5.19 to $6.25.

        For illustrative purposes, Goldman Sachs also performed a sensitivity analysis to analyze the impact on the range of illustrative
present values per share of Idera common stock derived from the analysis above of reducing Idera's management's POS assumption for the
Head & Neck and Bladder cancer indications for IMO-2125. The application of this reduced POS assumption resulted in a range of
illustrative present values per share of Idera common stock ranging from $3.63 to $4.37.

        Goldman Sachs also performed a sensitivity analysis to analyze the implied impact on the illustrative midpoint present value per
share of Idera common stock of $5.69 (reflecting a midpoint discount rate of 13.5%) derived from the analysis described above, by
varying certain of Idera's management's base case assumptions with respect to IMO-2125 and its indications as described below. The
following table presents the results of this analysis:

Illustrative Sum-of-the-Parts Discounted Cash Flow Analysis for BioCryst

        Using the Idera Adjusted BioCryst Projections, Goldman Sachs performed an illustrative sum-of-the-parts DCF analysis to derive a
range of stand-alone illustrative present values per share of BioCryst common stock.

        In connection with this analysis, Goldman Sachs performed separate DCF analyses with respect to the following product candidates
of BioCryst as well as the revenue and corporate cost items set forth below:

• Hereditary angiodema ("HAE") product candidates (for prophylactic treatment of HAE and for acute treatment of HAE); 

• Galidesivir; 

• RAPIVAB®; 

• Fibrodysplasis Ossificans Progressiva ("FOP"); and 

• Other development candidate.

        Using a mid-year convention and discount rates ranging from 12.5% to 14.5%, reflecting estimates of BioCryst's weighted average
cost of capital derived by application of a capital asset pricing model, which requires certain company-specific inputs, including the
company's target capital structure weightings, the cost of long-term debt, after-tax yield on permanent excess cash, if any, future applicable
marginal cash tax rate and a beta for the company, as well as certain financial metrics for the United States financial markets generally,
Goldman Sachs discounted to present value as of December 31, 2017, (i) POS-adjusted estimates of the free cash flows to be generated
from each HAE product candidate referred to above and from each of Galidesivir, RAPIVAB®, FOP and other development candidate, in
each case for the period from December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2035 (except with respect to FOP and other development candidate, for

reflected in the Idera Projections that had not been allocated to specific products, including research and development, sales and
management, and general and administrative expenses, to derive a range of illustrative equity values for each product candidate, and a
range of negative illustrative present values for the BioCryst corporate costs.

        Goldman Sachs then derived a range of illustrative equity values for BioCryst by adding (a) the ranges of illustrative equity values
(and the range of negative illustrative present values) it derived as described above, (b) an illustrative present value as of December 31,
2017 of the benefits estimated to be derived by BioCryst from its utilization of its net operating losses as reflected in the NOL Forecasts,
calculated using a discounted rate of 12%, reflecting an estimate of BioCryst's cost of equity, (c) BioCryst's net cash as of December 31,
2017 as provided by BioCryst management and (d) a range of illustrative present values of the proceeds estimated to be received by
BioCryst from anticipated future financings as reflected in the Idera Projections, calculated using discount rates ranging from 12.5% to
14.5%.

        Goldman Sachs then divided the range of illustrative equity values it derived for BioCryst by the total number of fully diluted shares
of BioCryst common stock calculated based on information provided by BioCryst management plus additional shares illustratively
assumed to be issued in the anticipated future financings at the different illustrative equity values for BioCryst, to derive a range of
illustrative present values per share of BioCryst common stock ranging from $12.42 to $15.11.

        Goldman Sachs also performed a sensitivity analysis to analyze the implied impact on the illustrative midpoint present value per
share of BioCryst common stock of $13.57 (reflecting a midpoint discount rate of 13.5%) derived from the analysis described above, by
varying certain of Idera's management's base case assumptions with respect to the HAE product candidates, FOP and other development
candidate. The following table presents the results of this analysis:

Illustrative Sum-of-the-Parts Discounted Cash Flow Analysis for Holdco

        Using the Combined Company Projections, Goldman Sachs performed an illustrative sum-of-the-parts DCF analysis to derive a range

        Using a mid-year convention and discount rates ranging from 12.5% to 14.5%, reflecting estimates of Holdco's weighted average cost
of capital derived by application of a capital asset pricing model, which requires certain company-specific inputs, including the company's
target capital structure weightings, the cost of long-term debt, after-tax yield on permanent excess cash, if any, future applicable marginal

Sachs discounted to present value as of December 31, 2017, (i) POS-adjusted estimates of the free cash flows to be generated from each
indication for IMO-2125 referred to above and from each of IMO-8400 and the nucleic acid chemistry compound, in each case for the
period from December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2030 (except with respect to the nucleic acid chemistry compound, for which the period

(iv) estimates of corporate costs of Holdco (without taking into account Synergies) reflected in the Idera Projections that had not been
allocated to specific products, including clinical costs, research and development costs, and selling, general and administrative expenses,
and (v) estimates of the benefits to be derived by Holdco from Synergies as reflected in the Idera Projections, to derive a range of
illustrative equity values for each product candidate and indication, for the ex-US partnership revenue and for the Synergies, and a range
of negative illustrative present values for the Holdco corporate costs.

        Goldman Sachs then derived a range of illustrative equity values for Holdco by adding (a) the ranges of illustrative equity values (and
the range of negative illustrative present values) it derived as described above, (b) an illustrative present value, as of December 31, 2017,
of the benefits to be derived by Holdco from its utilization of its net operating losses as reflected in the NOL Forecasts, calculated using a
discount rate of 12%, reflecting an estimate of Holdco's cost of equity, (c) Holdco's pro forma net cash, as of December 31, 2017, as
provided by Idera and BioCryst managements, and (d) a range of illustrative present values of the proceeds estimated to be received by
Holdco from anticipated future financings, as reflected in the Idera Projections, calculated using discount rates ranging from 12.5% to
14.5%.

        Goldman Sachs then divided these ranges of illustrative equity values it derived for Holdco by the total number of fully diluted shares
of Holdco common stock expected to be issued and outstanding after the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement calculated
based on information provided by Idera management plus additional shares illustratively assumed to be issued in the anticipated future
financings at the different illustrative equity values for Holdco, to derive a range of illustrative present values per share of Holdco common
stock from $13.30 to $15.95 (calculated assuming an Idera exchange ratio of 0.40 and a BioCryst exchange ratio of 1.00) (which is
equivalent to $26.60 to $31.90 based on the Idera exchange ratio of 0.20 and the BioCryst exchange ratio of 0.50 in the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement). Based on the foregoing, Goldman Sachs then derived a range of illustrative present values per
share to be received by Idera stockholders in the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement ranging from $5.32 to $6.38, which it
then compared to the range of illustrative present values per share of Idera common stock ranging from $5.19 to $6.25 derived based on
the illustrative sum-of-the-parts DCF analysis for Idera on a standalone basis described above.

        For illustrative purposes Goldman Sachs also performed a sensitivity analysis to analyze the impact on the range of illustrative
present values per share of Holdco common stock derived from the analysis above by reducing Idera management's POS assumption for
the Head & Neck and Bladder cancer indications for IMO-2125. The application of this reduced POS assumption resulted in a range of
illustrative present values per share of Holdco common stock from $11.54 to $13.87 (calculated assuming an Idera exchange ratio of 0.40
and a BioCryst exchange ratio of 1.00) (which is equivalent to $23.08 to $27.74 based on the Idera exchange ratio of 0.20 and the
BioCryst exchange ratio of 0.50 in the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement). Based on the foregoing, Goldman Sachs then
derived a range of illustrative present values per share to be received by Idera stockholders of in the transactions contemplated by the
merger agreement ranging from $4.62 to $5.55.

        Goldman Sachs also performed a sensitivity analysis to analyze the implied impact on the illustrative midpoint present value per
share of Holdco common stock of $14.56 (which is equivalent to $29.12 based on the Idera exchange ratio of 0.20 and a BioCryst
exchange ratio of 0.50 in the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement), reflecting a midpoint discount rate of 13.5%, derived
from the analysis described above, and the illustrative present values per share to be received by Idera stockholders in the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement, based on the Idera exchange ratio, by varying certain of Idera's management's base case
assumptions with respect to IMO 2125 and its indications and the HAE product candidates as described below. The following table
presents the results of this analysis:

Illustrative Pro Forma Contribution Analysis

        The results of these calculations are as follows:

General

        The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary
description. Selecting portions of the analyses or of the summary set forth above, without considering the analyses as a whole, could create
an incomplete view of the processes underlying Goldman Sachs' opinion. In arriving at its fairness determination, Goldman Sachs
considered the results of all of its analyses and did not attribute any particular weight to any factor or analysis considered by it. Rather,
Goldman Sachs made its determination as to fairness on the basis of its experience and professional judgment after considering the results
of all of its analyses. No company or transaction used in the above analyses as a comparison is directly comparable to Idera or BioCryst or
the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

        Goldman Sachs prepared these analyses for purposes of providing its opinion to the Idera board as to the fairness from a financial
point of view to the holders of shares of Idera common stock, as of the date of the opinion, of the Idera exchange ratio pursuant to the
merger agreement. These analyses do not purport to be appraisals nor do they necessarily reflect the prices at which businesses or
securities actually may be sold. Analyses based upon forecasts of future results are not necessarily indicative of actual future results, which
may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by these analyses. Because these analyses are inherently subject to uncertainty,
being based upon numerous factors or events beyond the control of the parties or their respective advisors, none of Idera, BioCryst,
Goldman Sachs or any other person assumes responsibility if future results are materially different from those forecasts.

        The Idera exchange ratio was determined through arm's-length negotiations between Idera and BioCryst and was approved by the
Idera board. Goldman Sachs provided advice to Idera during these negotiations. Goldman Sachs did not, however, recommend any
specific exchange ratio to Idera or the Idera board or that any specific exchange ratio constituted the only appropriate consideration for the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

        As described above, Goldman Sachs' opinion was one of many factors taken into consideration by the Idera board in making its
determination to approve the merger agreement. The foregoing summary does not purport to be a complete description of the analyses
performed by Goldman Sachs in connection with the delivery of its fairness opinion to the Idera board and is qualified in its entirety by
reference to the written opinion of Goldman Sachs attached as Annex B to this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

        Goldman Sachs and its affiliates are engaged in advisory, underwriting and financing, principal investing, sales and trading, research,

Pillar Invest Corporation ("Pillar"), a significant stockholder of Idera, and any of their respective affiliates and portfolio companies, or any
currency or commodity that may be involved in the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. Goldman Sachs acted as financial
advisor to Idera in connection with, and has participated in certain of the negotiations leading to, the transactions contemplated by the
merger agreement. Goldman Sachs has provided certain financial advisory and/or underwriting services to Idera and/or its affiliates from
time to time for which its Investment Banking Division has received, and may receive, compensation, including having acted as
bookrunning manager with respect to the public offering by Idera of 26,225,243 shares of Idera common stock in October 2016 and the
public offering of 38,333,334 shares of Idera common stock in October 2017. During the two-year period ended January 21, 2018,
Goldman Sachs has recognized compensation for financial advisory and/or underwriting services provided by its Investment Banking
Division to Idera and/or its affiliates of approximately $2.4 million. During the two-year period ended January 21, 2018, Goldman Sachs
has not been engaged by BioCryst and/or its affiliates to provide financial advisory and/or underwriting services for which Goldman Sachs
has received compensation. Goldman Sachs may also in the future provide financial advisory and/or underwriting services to Idera,
BioCryst, Baker Brothers, Pillar and their respective affiliates and, as applicable, portfolio companies for which its Investment Banking
Division may receive compensation. Affiliates of Goldman Sachs also may have co-invested with Baker Brothers or Pillar or their
respective affiliates from time to time and may have invested in limited partnership units of affiliates of Baker Brothers or Pillar from time
to time and may do so in the future.

        The Idera board selected Goldman Sachs as its financial advisor because it is an internationally recognized investment banking firm
that has substantial experience in transactions similar to the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. Pursuant to an
engagement letter between Idera and Goldman Sachs dated January 18, 2018, Idera engaged Goldman Sachs to act as its financial advisor
in connection with the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. The engagement letter between Idera and Goldman Sachs
provides for a transaction fee that is estimated, based on the information available as of the date of announcement, at approximately
$7.0 million, $0.7 million of which became payable at announcement of the transaction, and the reminder of which is contingent upon
consummation of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. In addition, Idera agreed to reimburse Goldman Sachs for
certain of its expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements, and to indemnify Goldman Sachs and related persons
against various liabilities, including certain liabilities under the federal securities laws.

Opinion of BioCryst's Financial Advisor—J.P. Morgan 

        Pursuant to an engagement letter dated January 14, 2018, BioCryst retained J.P. Morgan as its financial advisor in connection with the
mergers.

        At the meeting of the BioCryst board on January 21, 2018, J.P. Morgan rendered its oral opinion to the BioCryst board that, as of such
date and based upon and subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and limitations on the review
undertaken by J.P. Morgan in preparing the opinion, the BioCryst exchange ratio in the BioCryst merger was fair, from a financial point of
view, to the holders of BioCryst common stock. J.P. Morgan confirmed its January 21, 2018 oral opinion by delivering its written opinion
to the BioCryst board, dated January 21, 2018.

        The full text of the written opinion of J.P. Morgan, dated January 21, 2018, which sets forth the assumptions made, procedures
followed, matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken by J.P. Morgan, is attached as Annex C to this joint proxy
statement/prospectus and is incorporated herein by reference. This summary of the opinion of J.P. Morgan set forth in this joint proxy

prospectus is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such opinion. BioCryst stockholders are urged to read the opinion in its
entirety. J.P. Morgan's written opinion was addressed to the BioCryst board (in its capacity as such) in connection with and for the
purposes of its evaluation of the mergers, was directed only to the BioCryst exchange ratio in the BioCryst merger and did not address any
other aspect of the mergers. J.P. Morgan expressed no opinion as to the fairness of any consideration to be paid in connection with the
mergers to the holders of any other class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of BioCryst or as to the underlying decision by
BioCryst to engage in the mergers. The issuance of J.P. Morgan's opinion was approved by a fairness committee of J.P. Morgan. The
opinion does not constitute a recommendation to any stockholder of BioCryst as to how such stockholder should vote with respect to the
mergers or any other matter.

        In arriving at its opinion, J.P. Morgan:

• reviewed the merger agreement; 

• reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information concerning Idera and BioCryst and the industries in
which they operate; 

• reviewed certain internal financial analyses and forecasts, including the BioCryst Management Projections and the
BioCryst Adjusted Idera Projections (collectively, the "BioCryst Projections"), prepared by the management of BioCryst
relating to its business, as well as the estimated amount and timing of the cost savings and related expenses and synergies
expected to result from the mergers (the "Expected Synergies"); and 

• performed such other financial studies and analyses and considered such other information as J.P. Morgan deemed
appropriate for the purposes of its opinion.

        In addition, J.P. Morgan held discussions with certain members of the management of Idera and BioCryst with respect to certain
aspects of the mergers, and the past and current business operations of Idera and BioCryst, the financial condition and future prospects and
operations of Idera and BioCryst, the effects of the mergers on the financial condition and future prospects of BioCryst, and certain other
matters J.P. Morgan believed necessary or appropriate to its inquiry.

        In giving its opinion, J.P. Morgan relied upon and assumed the accuracy and completeness of all information that was publicly
available or was furnished to or discussed with J.P. Morgan by Idera and BioCryst or otherwise reviewed by or for J.P. Morgan. J.P.
Morgan did not independently verify any such information or its accuracy or completeness and, pursuant to its engagement letter with
BioCryst, J.P. Morgan did not assume any obligation to undertake any such independent verification. J.P. Morgan did not conduct and was
not provided with any valuation or appraisal of any assets or liabilities, nor did J.P. Morgan evaluate the solvency of Idera, Holdco or
BioCryst under any state or federal laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. In relying on financial analyses and
forecasts provided to J.P. Morgan or derived therefrom, including the synergies, J.P. Morgan assumed that they were reasonably prepared
based on assumptions reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments by management as to the expected future results of
operations and financial condition of Idera and BioCryst to which such analyses or forecasts relate. J.P. Morgan expressed no view as to
such analyses or forecasts (including the synergies) or the assumptions on which they were based. J.P. Morgan also assumed that the
mergers and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement will be tax-free to BioCryst stockholders for United States
federal income tax purposes, and will be consummated as described in the merger agreement. For purposes of conversion of Idera
preferred stock, J.P. Morgan assumed at the direction of BioCryst that the 20-trading-day average trading price of shares of Idera common
stock ending on the day that is three days before the closing will be $2.29. J.P. Morgan also assumed that the representations and
warranties made by BioCryst and Idera in the merger agreement and the related agreements were and will be true and correct in all
respects material to its analysis. J.P. Morgan is not a legal, regulatory or tax expert and relied on the

assessments made by advisors to BioCryst with respect to such issues. J.P. Morgan further assumed that all material governmental,
regulatory or other consents and approvals necessary for the consummation of the mergers will be obtained without any adverse effect on
Idera, Holdco or BioCryst or on the contemplated benefits of the mergers.

        The BioCryst Projections furnished to J.P. Morgan were prepared by BioCryst management on a risk-adjusted basis reflecting the
various products in the BioCryst and Idera portfolios, respectively, as well as the projected corporate assets and liabilities of BioCryst and
Idera, respectively. Neither BioCryst nor Idera publicly discloses internal management projections of the type provided to J.P. Morgan in
connection with J.P. Morgan's analysis of the mergers, and such projections were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure. These
projections were based on numerous variables and assumptions that are inherently uncertain and may be beyond the control of BioCryst
and Idera management, including, without limitation, factors related to general economic and competitive conditions and prevailing
interest rates. Accordingly, actual results could vary significantly from those set forth in such projections. For more information regarding
the use of projections, please refer to the section entitled "The Mergers—Certain Financial Forecasts Utilized by the BioCryst Board and
BioCryst's Financial Advisor in Connection with the Mergers" beginning on page 80 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

        J.P. Morgan's opinion was necessarily based on economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made
available to J.P. Morgan as of, the date of such opinion. J.P. Morgan's opinion noted that subsequent developments may affect J.P.
Morgan's opinion, and that J.P. Morgan does not have any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm such opinion. J.P. Morgan's opinion is
limited to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of BioCryst common stock of the BioCryst exchange ratio in the
BioCryst merger, and J.P. Morgan has expressed no opinion as to the fairness of any consideration to be paid in connection with the
mergers to the holders of any other class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of BioCryst or as to the underlying decision by
BioCryst to engage in the mergers. Furthermore, J.P. Morgan expressed no opinion with respect to the amount or nature of any
compensation to any officers, directors or employees of any party to the mergers, or any class of such persons relative to the BioCryst
exchange ratio applicable to the holders of BioCryst common stock in the mergers or with respect to the fairness of any such
compensation. J.P. Morgan expressed no opinion as to the price at which BioCryst common stock, Holdco common stock or Idera common
stock will trade at any future time.

        The terms of the merger agreement were determined through arm's length negotiations between BioCryst and Idera, and the decision
to enter into the merger agreement was solely that of the BioCryst board. J.P. Morgan's opinion and financial analyses were only one of the
many factors considered by the BioCryst board in its evaluation of the mergers and should not be viewed as determinative of the views of
the BioCryst board or BioCryst management with respect to the mergers or the BioCryst exchange ratio.

        In accordance with customary investment banking practice, J.P. Morgan employed generally accepted valuation methodology in
rendering its opinion to the BioCryst board on January 21, 2018 and in the presentation delivered to the BioCryst board on such date in
connection with the rendering of such opinion. The following is a summary of the material financial analyses utilized by J.P. Morgan in
connection with rendering its opinion to the BioCryst board and does not purport to be a complete description of the analyses or data
presented by J.P. Morgan. Some of the summaries of the financial analyses include information presented in tabular format. The tables are
not intended to stand alone, and in order to more fully understand the financial analyses used by J.P. Morgan, the tables must be read
together with the full text of each summary. Considering the data set forth below without considering the full narrative description of the
financial analyses, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of
J.P. Morgan's analyses.

Discounted Cash Flow Analysis

        J.P. Morgan conducted a discounted cash flow analysis for the purpose of determining an implied fully diluted equity value per share
for each of BioCryst common stock and Idera common stock. A discounted cash flow analysis is a method of evaluating an asset using
estimates of the future unlevered free cash flows generated by the asset, and taking into consideration the time value of money with respect
to those cash flows by calculating their present value. "Unlevered free cash flows" refers to a calculation of the future cash flows generated
by an asset without including in such calculation any debt servicing costs. Specifically, unlevered free cash flow for this purpose
represents tax-affected EBIT, less capital expenditures, plus depreciation, amortization and decreases in net working capital. "Present
value" refers to the current value of the cash flows generated by the asset, and is obtained by discounting those cash flows back to the
present using an appropriate discount rate. J.P. Morgan's discounted cash flow analysis treated stock based compensation as a cash
expense.

        In arriving at the implied fully diluted equity value per share of BioCryst common stock and Idera common stock, J.P. Morgan
utilized the estimated unlevered free cash flows for calendar years 2018 through 2037 and 2018 through 2034, respectively, based upon the
BioCryst Projections. At the direction of BioCryst management, terminal values were not factored into the discounted cash flow analysis
of the BioCryst Projections, as the financial forecasts provided to J.P. Morgan covered the full expected lifetime of each company's
forecasted cash flows. J.P. Morgan discounted the unlevered free cash flows and corporate assets and liabilities reflected in the BioCryst
Projections to present values as of December 31, 2017 using a range of discount rates of 12.0% to 15.0%. This discount rate range was
based upon J.P. Morgan's analysis of the weighted-average cost of capital of each of BioCryst and Idera. The implied equity values were
divided by the number of fully diluted shares outstanding at the applicable company, which analyses indicated the following implied per
share equity value range for BioCryst common stock and Idera common stock:

        The range of implied per share equity values for BioCryst was compared to BioCryst's closing price per share of $5.59 on January 19,
2018. The range of implied per share equity values for Idera was compared to Idera's closing price per share of $2.55 on January 19, 2018.

Relative Implied Exchange Ratio Analysis

        J.P. Morgan compared the results for BioCryst to the results for Idera with respect to the discounted cash flow analyses described
above.

        J.P. Morgan compared the highest equity value per share for BioCryst to the lowest equity value per share for Idera to derive the
lowest Idera exchange ratio implied by each pair of results. J.P. Morgan also compared the lowest equity value per share for BioCryst to
the highest equity value per share for Idera to derive the highest Idera exchange ratio implied by each pair of results. The implied Idera
exchange ratios resulting from this analysis, as adjusted for the 0.5000x BioCryst exchange ratio, were:

        The implied exchange ratios were compared to (i) the Idera exchange ratio under the merger agreement of 0.2000x and (ii) the Idera
exchange ratio of 0.2281x implied by the closing prices of the shares of BioCryst common stock and the shares of Idera common stock on
January 19, 2018 of $5.59 and $2.55, respectively.

Value Creation Analysis

        J.P. Morgan conducted an analysis of the theoretical value creation to the existing holders of BioCryst common stock that compared
the estimated implied equity value of BioCryst on a standalone basis based on the midpoint value determined in J.P. Morgan's discounted
cash flow analysis described above to the estimated implied equity value of former BioCryst stockholders' ownership in the combined
company, pro forma for the mergers.

        J.P. Morgan calculated the pro forma implied equity value of BioCryst common stock by (1) adding the sum of the midpoint values
determined in J.P. Morgan's discounted cash flow analysis described above for (a) the implied equity value of BioCryst on a standalone
basis of approximately $1.236 billion, (b) the implied equity value of Idera on a standalone basis of approximately $1.197 billion and
(c) the estimated present value of the Expected Synergies in the aggregate amount of approximately $155 million based on the midpoint
discount rate of 13.5%, (2) subtracting the sum of estimated (a) loss of value due to limitations on tax deductible NOLs as estimated by the
management of BioCryst of approximately $18 million and (b) transaction fees and expenses relating to the mergers of approximately
$20.8 million as estimated by the management of BioCryst and (3) multiplying such result by the pro forma equity ownership of the
combined company by the existing holders of BioCryst common stock. This analysis resulted in a pro forma implied equity value of
BioCryst common stock of approximately $1.315 billion, compared to the standalone implied midpoint of the range derived from the
discounted cash flow analysis described above of approximately $1.236 billion. There can be no assurance, however, that the Expected
Synergies, loss of value due to limitations on NOLs, transaction-related expenses and other impacts referred to above will not be
substantially greater or less than those estimated by management and described above.

Miscellaneous

        The foregoing summary of certain material financial analyses does not purport to be a complete description of the analyses or data
presented by J.P. Morgan. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis
or summary description. J.P. Morgan believes that the foregoing summary and its analyses must be considered as a whole and that
selecting portions of the foregoing summary and these analyses, without considering all of its analyses as a whole, could create an
incomplete view of the processes underlying the analyses and its opinion. As a result, the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular
analysis or combination of analyses described above were merely utilized to create points of reference for analytical purposes and should
not be taken to be the view of J.P. Morgan with respect to the actual value of BioCryst or Idera. The order of analyses described does not
represent the relative importance or weight given to those analyses by J.P. Morgan. In arriving at its opinion, J.P. Morgan did not attribute
any particular weight to any analyses or factors considered by it and did not form an opinion as to whether any individual analysis or
factor (positive or negative), considered in isolation, supported or failed to support its opinion. Rather, J.P. Morgan considered the totality
of the factors and analyses performed in determining its opinion.

        Analyses based upon forecasts of future results are inherently uncertain, as they are subject to numerous factors or events beyond the
control of the parties and their advisors. Accordingly, forecasts and analyses used or made by J.P. Morgan are not necessarily indicative of
actual future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by those analyses. Moreover, J.P. Morgan's

analyses are not and do not purport to be appraisals or otherwise reflective of the prices at which businesses actually could be acquired or
sold.

        As a part of its investment banking business, J.P. Morgan and its affiliates are continually engaged in the valuation of businesses and
their securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions, investments for passive and control purposes, negotiated underwritings,
secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements, and valuations for corporate and other purposes. J.P. Morgan
was selected to advise BioCryst with respect to the mergers on the basis of, among other things, such experience and its qualifications and
reputation in connection with such matters and its familiarity with BioCryst, Idera and the industries in which they operate.

        BioCryst has agreed to pay J.P. Morgan an estimated fee of approximately $7.0 million, $2.0 million of which became payable to J.P.
Morgan for advisory services rendered up until the time J.P. Morgan delivered its opinion, and the remainder of which is contingent upon
the consummation of the mergers. J.P. Morgan may also receive a fee from BioCryst in the event that BioCryst receives a break-up fee in
connection with the termination, or abandonment of the mergers, or failure of the mergers to occur. In addition, BioCryst has agreed to
reimburse J.P. Morgan for its expenses incurred in connection with its services, including the fees and disbursements of counsel, and will
indemnify J.P. Morgan against certain liabilities arising out of J.P. Morgan's engagement.

        During the two years preceding the date of J.P. Morgan's opinion dated January 21, 2018, J.P. Morgan and its affiliates have had
commercial or investment banking relationships with BioCryst and Idera for which J.P. Morgan and such affiliates have received
customary compensation. Such services during such period have included acting as sole bookrunner on BioCryst's offering of equity
securities in March 2017 and joint lead bookrunner on BioCryst's offering of equity securities in September 2017, and acting as joint lead
bookrunner on Idera's offerings of equity securities in October 2016 and October 2017. In addition, J.P. Morgan and its affiliates hold, on a
proprietary basis, less than 1% of the outstanding common stock of each of BioCryst and Idera. During the two year period preceding
delivery of its opinion, the aggregate fees received by J.P. Morgan from BioCryst were $5.1 million and from Idera were $2.3 million. In
the ordinary course of its businesses, J.P. Morgan and its affiliates may actively trade the debt and equity securities or financial instruments
(including derivatives, bank loans or other obligations) of BioCryst, Holdco or Idera for its own account or for the accounts of customers
and, accordingly, J.P. Morgan may at any time hold long or short positions in such securities or other financial instruments.

Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of Holdco 

        The Holdco charter will be in substantially the same form attached as Annex D to this joint proxy statement/prospectus. Please see the
section entitled "Comparison of Rights of Idera Stockholders, BioCryst Stockholders and Holdco Stockholders" beginning on page 164 of
this joint proxy statement/prospectus for a discussion of the Holdco charter.

Interests of Idera Directors, Executive Officers and Certain of their Affiliates in the Mergers 

        In considering the recommendation of the Idera board that you vote to adopt the merger agreement, you should be aware that Idera's
executive officers, directors and certain of their affiliates have interests in the mergers that may be different from, or in addition to, the
interests of Idera's stockholders generally. The Idera board was aware of these potentially differing interests and considered them, among
other matters, in reaching its decision to adopt the merger agreement and approve the mergers and to recommend that you vote in favor of
adopting the merger agreement.

Consideration for Idera Common Stock and BioCryst Common Stock at the Effective Time of the Mergers

        At the effective time of the mergers, shares of Idera common stock and BioCryst common stock beneficially owned by the executive
officers and directors of Idera and their respective affiliates will be converted into the right to receive the same merger consideration on the
same terms and conditions as the other Idera stockholders and BioCryst stockholders.

Holdings of Baker Brothers as of January 21, 2018

        As of January 21, 2018, Baker Brothers, which is affiliated with Julian Baker and Kelvin Neu on the Idera board, beneficially owned,
in the aggregate, approximately 13,992,000 shares of BioCryst common stock, or approximately 14.3% of the outstanding BioCryst
common stock, and a pecuniary interest in options to purchase 60,000 shares of BioCryst common stock. Each of Mr. Baker and his
brother, Felix Baker, respectively owned options to purchase 23,500 shares of BioCryst common stock and Mr. Neu owned
approximately 400 shares of BioCryst common stock.

        As of January 21, 2018, Baker Brothers owned, in the aggregate, 18,196,409 shares of Idera common stock, 22,151,052 warrants to
purchase Idera common stock with an exercise price of $0.01 per share of Idera common stock and 20,316,327 warrants to purchase Idera
common stock with an exercise price of $0.47 per share of Idera common stock. In addition, Messrs. Baker and Neu collectively owned an
aggregate of approximately 580,000 shares of Idera common stock and options to purchase Idera common stock.

Subsequent Changes to Holdings of Baker Brothers

        On March 15, 2018, Baker Brothers exercised 20,316,327 warrants to purchase Idera common stock at an exercise price of $0.47 per
share of Idera common stock, bringing the number of shares of Idera common stock owned by Baker Brothers to 38,512,736, excluding
any shares of Idera common stock or options to purchase Idera common stock owned by Messrs. Baker and Neu. See the section entitled
"Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners of Idera" beginning on page 158 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

Idera Equity Awards

        As of the effective time of the mergers, each Idera stock option that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the effective
time of the mergers, whether or not then vested or exercisable, will be assumed by Holdco and converted into a Holdco stock option. In
addition, each such stock option will vest in full, other than Idera stock options held by an individual who is a party to a Severance and
Change of Control Agreement. Each converted Holdco stock option will be subject to the same terms and conditions (other than, in the
case described above, vesting) as applied to the original Idera stock option immediately prior to the effective time of the mergers, except
that it will be exercisable for that number of whole shares of Holdco common stock (rounded down to the nearest whole share) equal to the
number of shares subject to the Idera stock option multiplied by the Idera exchange ratio, at an exercise price per share (rounded up to the
nearest whole cent) equal to the exercise price per share applicable to the Idera stock option divided by the Idera exchange ratio. This
treatment will be subject to certain provisions of the Code, as described in the merger agreement.

        In addition, the post-termination exercise period of each Holdco stock option will continue in the event of the holder's termination of
employment within 24 months following the effective time of the mergers (other than for cause, or due to the holder's resignation without
good reason or such other constructive termination), until the three-year anniversary of the employee's termination, but in no event past the
Holdco stock option's term. However, if that treatment would cause the Holdco stock option to cease to qualify as an incentive stock
option, then in the alternative the employee will be presented with a choice upon his or her termination of employment of whether to
extend the

post-termination option exercise period or not. For purposes of determining whether "cause" or "good reason" exist, or whether a
"constructive termination" has occurred, each term will have the meaning assigned to it (or a term of similar effect) in the applicable plan,
written award agreement or employment agreement between the employee and Idera.

        Based upon Idera stock option holdings as of May 1, 2018, the number of Idera stock options held by Idera executive officers and
non-employee directors and the stock options' treatment in the mergers is as follows:

Severance and Change of Control Agreements

        Idera has entered into a Severance and Change of Control Agreement with each of Messrs. Milano, Arcudi and Fletcher, and
Drs. Horobin and Yingling.

        The Severance and Change of Control Agreements provide that if Idera consummates a "change of control" (as defined in the
Severance and Change of Control Agreements), which is defined to include the Idera merger, it will employ the executive for a period of
24 months from the date of the consummation of the change of control. Pursuant to the Severance and Change of Control Agreements,
during such period:

• the executive's position and duties for Idera will be commensurate with the most significant of the duties and positions held
by the executive during the 90 day period preceding the date of the consummation of the change of control; 

• the executive's annual base salary will equal at least 12 times the highest monthly base salary paid to the executive during
the 12 months prior to the date of the change of control; 

• the executive will be entitled to an annual bonus equal to at least the greatest of (a) the average bonus paid to the executive
in respect of the three years immediately preceding the year in which the change of control occurs, (b) the annual bonus
paid for the year immediately preceding the year in which the change of control occurs and (c) 100% of the target bonus for
(1) the year immediately preceding the year in which the change of control occurs, (2) the year in which the change of
control occurs or (3) any year following the year in which the change of control occurs and prior to the then-current year,
whichever is highest; and 

• the executive will be entitled to certain other benefits as are consistent with the benefits paid to the executive during the
one (1) year period immediately preceding the change of control.

        The Severance and Change of Control Agreements also provide that if an executive is terminated without "cause" or resigns for "good
reason" in either case, within 24 months following a change of control (which is defined to include the Idera merger), subject to the
executive's timely execution and non-revocation of a general release of claims in a form provided by Idera and the executive's continued
compliance with the invention, non-disclosure and non-competition agreement previously entered into in connection with the
commencement of executive's employment, executives would receive a lump sum cash payment payable within 30 days after the date of
termination equal to:

• executive's target bonus for the year of termination prorated for the portion of the year worked; 

• 150% of the sum of (a) such executive's annual base salary for the year immediately preceding the year of termination and
(b) the greatest of (1) the average bonus paid or earned and accrued, but unpaid to the executive in respect of the three
years immediately preceding the year of termination, (2) the annual bonus paid for the year immediately preceding the year
of termination and (3) the target bonus for the year of termination; and 

• 150% of Idera's share of the annual premium for group medical and/or dental insurance coverage that was in place for the
executive immediately prior to the date of termination.

        In addition, all outstanding stock options held by the executive as of the date of termination will be automatically vested in full as of
the date of termination, and the executive will have the ability to exercise any such options until the longer of (i) the period of time
provided for in the applicable equity award agreement or plan, or (ii) the shorter of one year after the date of termination or the remaining
term of the applicable equity award. However, as described above, under the terms of the merger agreement the post-termination exercise
period of all outstanding stock options will continue in the event of the executive's termination of employment within 24 months following
the effective time of the mergers (other than for cause or due to the executive's resignation without good reason), until the

three-year anniversary of such executive's termination, but in no event past the remaining term of the applicable equity award.

        If the executive is terminated without "cause" or resigns for "good reason," prior to the date of a change of control, such executive
will be entitled to the following under the Severance and Change of Control Agreement, subject to the executive's timely execution and
non-revocation of a general release of claims in a form provided by Idera and the executive's continued compliance with the invention,
non-disclosure and non-competition agreement previously entered into in connection with the commencement of executive's employment:

• a lump sum cash payment payable within 30 days after the date of termination in an amount equal to the greater of (x) the
average bonus paid or earned and accrued, but unpaid to the executive in respect of the three years immediately preceding
the year of termination, and (y) the annual bonus paid for the year immediately preceding the year of termination prorated
for the portion of the year worked; 

• continued payment of the executive's base salary payable in accordance with Idera's standard payroll practices over the
one-year period following termination; and 

• if the executive elects to continue receiving group medical and/or dental insurance under COBRA (to the extent the
executive previously participated in such group insurance plans immediately prior to the date of termination), payment by
Idera of its share of the premium for such coverage that it pays for active and similarly-situated employees who receive the
same type of coverage for the one-year period following termination.

        The Severance and Change of Control Agreements expire on December 31, 2018, subject to successive one-year renewals on each
anniversary thereof unless notice of termination has been provided by a party pursuant to the terms of the Severance and Change of
Control Agreements.

Employee Benefits

        The merger agreement requires Holdco to continue to provide certain compensation and benefits through December 31, 2018, as well
as take certain actions in respect of employee benefits provided to Idera employees, including its executive officers. For a detailed
description of these requirements, please see the section entitled "The Merger Agreement—Employee Benefits Matters" beginning on
page 127 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

Indemnification and Insurance

        Under the merger agreement, certain indemnification and insurance rights exist in favor of Idera's current and former directors and
officers. Such indemnification and insurance rights are further described in the section entitled "The Merger Agreement—Other Covenants
and Agreements" beginning on page 130 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

Idera Stockholder Advisory Vote On Merger-Related Compensation For Idera's Named Executive Officers Proposal

Golden Parachute Compensation

        This section sets forth the information required by Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K regarding the compensation for each named
executive officer of Idera that is based on or otherwise relates to the mergers. This compensation is referred to as "golden parachute"
compensation by the applicable SEC disclosure rules, and in this section we use such term to describe the merger-related compensation
that may become payable to Idera's named executive officers. The "golden parachute" compensation that may become payable to these
individuals is subject to a non-binding advisory vote of Idera's

stockholders, as described below in this section. To the extent any of Idera's named executive officers' compensation arrangements are
described in "The Mergers—Interests of Idera Directors, Executive Officers and Certain of their Affiliates in the Mergers" beginning on
page 99 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, they are incorporated herein by reference.

        Each named executive officer would receive approximately the amounts set forth in the table below. Please note that the amounts
indicated below are estimates based on the material assumptions described in the notes to the table below, which may or may not actually
occur. Some of these assumptions are based on information currently available and, as a result, the actual amounts, if any, that may
become payable to a named executive officer may differ in material respects from the amounts set forth below. Furthermore, for purposes
of calculating such amounts, Idera has assumed:

• a closing date of the mergers of May 1, 2018 (which, as required by SEC rules, is the latest practicable date prior to the
filing of this joint proxy statement/prospectus); 

• the employment of each of the named executive officers is terminated without "cause" or by the named executive officer
for "good reason," in either case, on the date of the consummation of the mergers and executed and did not revoke a
general release of claims in favor of Idera and complied with all applicable restrictive covenants; and 

• the value of the accelerated vesting of any Idera equity award is calculated assuming a market price per share of Idera
common stock equal to $1.96 (which equals the average closing price of a share of Idera common stock on the Nasdaq over
the first five business days following January 22, 2018, the date of the first public announcement of entering into the
merger agreement).

Under the Severance and Change of Control Agreements, upon a qualifying termination by Messrs. Milano, Arcudi
and Fletcher, and Drs. Horobin and Yingling within 24 months following a change of control, all outstanding stock
options held by the executive as of the date of termination will be automatically vested in full as of the date of
termination, and the executive will have the ability to exercise any such options until the three-year anniversary of
such executive's termination, but in no event past the remaining term of the applicable equity award.

(3) Under the Severance and Change of Control Agreements, upon a qualifying termination by Messrs. Milano, Arcudi

eligible to receive 150% of Idera's share of the annual premium for group medical and/or dental insurance coverage
that was in place for the executive immediately prior to the date of termination, payable in a lump sum cash payment
within 30 days after the date of termination.

Table of Contents

        The vote on the Idera merger-related compensation proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote on the adoption of the merger
agreement and the approval of the mergers. Accordingly, you may vote on the proposal to adopt the merger agreement and vote not to
approve, on a non-binding advisory basis, the compensation that may become payable to Idera's named executive officers that is based on
or otherwise relates to the mergers, or vice versa. Because the vote to approve the compensation that may become payable to Idera's
named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the mergers is advisory only, it will not be binding on Idera. Accordingly,
if the merger agreement is adopted and the mergers are approved and completed, the compensation payments that are contractually
required to be paid by Idera to its named executive officers will or may be paid, subject only to the conditions applicable thereto,
regardless of the outcome of the advisory (non-binding) vote of Idera stockholders.

Vote Required

        Approval of, on a non-binding advisory basis, the compensation that may become payable to Idera's named executive officers that is
based on or otherwise relates to the mergers requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of Idera common stock
present in person or represented by proxy at the Idera special meeting and voting on the proposal, although such vote will not be binding
on Idera, the Idera board or any of its committees, or, following completion of the mergers, the combined company. Abstentions, failures
to vote (i.e., not submitting a proxy and not voting in person) and broker non-votes will have no effect on the proposal, assuming a quorum
is present.

Interests of BioCryst Directors and Executive Officers in the Mergers 

        In considering the recommendation of the BioCryst board that you vote to adopt the merger agreement, you should be aware that
BioCryst's executive officers and directors have interests in the mergers that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of
BioCryst's stockholders generally. The BioCryst board was aware of these potentially differing interests and considered them, among other
matters, in reaching its decision to adopt the merger agreement and approve the mergers and to recommend that you vote in favor of
adopting the merger agreement.

Continued Service with the Combined Company

        As of the effective time of the mergers, unless otherwise agreed by BioCryst and Idera in writing, the Holdco Board will comprise
nine members, four of whom will be current Idera directors that the Idera board will designate (and each of whom must be reasonably
acceptable to BioCryst) and four of whom will be current BioCryst directors that the BioCryst board will designate (and each of whom
must be reasonably acceptable to Idera). The BioCryst board and the Idera board will jointly designate one other director, who must not be
a current director, officer or affiliate of either board. BioCryst's designees are Mr. Stonehouse, current chief executive officer and director
of BioCryst, Mr. Ingram, current chairman of the BioCryst board, who will serve as chairman of the Holdco board, Dr. Hutson, a director
of BioCryst, and Mr. Lee, currently a director of BioCryst, assuming each of them remains eligible as of immediately prior to the effective
time of the mergers. The Holdco directors' remuneration has not been fixed as of the date of this filing.

BioCryst Stock Options

        As of the effective time of the mergers, each BioCryst stock option that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the
effective time of the mergers, whether or not then vested or exercisable, will vest in full and be assumed by Holdco and converted into a
Holdco stock option. Each converted Holdco stock option will be subject to the same terms and conditions (other than vesting) as applied
to the original BioCryst stock option immediately prior to the effective time of the mergers,

except that it will be exercisable for that number of whole shares of Holdco common stock (rounded down to the nearest whole share)
equal to the number of shares subject to the BioCryst stock option multiplied by the BioCryst exchange ratio, at an exercise price per share
(rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to the exercise price per share applicable to the BioCryst stock option divided by the BioCryst
exchange ratio. This treatment will be subject to certain provisions of the Code, as described in the merger agreement.

        In addition, the post-termination exercise period of each Holdco stock option will continue in the event of the holder's termination of
employment within 24 months following the effective time of the mergers (other than for cause, or due to the holder's resignation without
good reason or such other constructive termination), until the three year anniversary of the employee's termination, but in no event past the
Holdco stock option's term. However, if that treatment would cause the Holdco stock option to cease to qualify as an incentive stock
option, then in the alternative the employee will be presented with a choice upon his or her termination of employment of whether to
extend the post-termination option exercise period or not. For purposes of determining whether "cause" or "good reason" exist, or whether
a "constructive termination" has occurred, each term will have the meaning assigned to it (or a term of similar effect) in the applicable
plan, written award agreement or employment agreement between the employee and BioCryst. In the absence of those documents, the
definitions set forth in the retention agreements described below will apply.

        Based upon BioCryst stock option holdings as of May 1, 2018, the number of BioCryst stock options held by BioCryst executive
officers and non-employee directors and the stock options' treatment in the mergers is as follows:

BioCryst Restricted Stock Units

        As of the effective time of the mergers, each BioCryst RSU that is outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the mergers
will be assumed by Holdco and will vest in full and be converted into a Holdco RSU. Each converted Holdco RSU will be subject to the
same terms and conditions (other than vesting) as applied to the original BioCryst RSU immediately prior to the effective time of the
mergers, except that it will be a restricted stock unit to acquire that number of whole shares of Holdco common stock (rounded down to
the nearest whole share) equal to the number of shares subject to the BioCryst RSU multiplied by the BioCryst exchange ratio. For a
detailed discussion of the treatment of BioCryst RSUs, see the section titled "The Merger Agreement—Treatment of BioCryst Stock
Options and RSUs" beginning on page 129 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

        Based upon BioCryst RSU holdings as of May 1, 2018, the number of BioCryst RSUs held by BioCryst executive officers and non-
employee directors and the restricted stock units' treatment in the mergers is as follows:

BioCryst Retention Agreements

        Prior to the mergers, BioCryst may enter into retention agreements (in a form substantially similar to that agreed upon by BioCryst
and Idera) with up to 45 individuals providing for payments of up to $1.5 million in the aggregate. Some of the retention agreement
participants may be BioCryst executive officers. None of the retention agreement participant list, the value of each retention award or the
terms of the retention agreements have been established as of the date of this filing.

following reasons: (i) a violation of a federal or state law or regulation that materially and adversely impacts BioCryst's
business; (ii) conviction or plea of no contest to a felony under the laws of the United States or any state; (iii) a breach of

employer that materially and adversely impacts BioCryst; (iv) fraud or misappropriation of property belonging to BioCryst
or its affiliates; or (v) willful misconduct or gross negligence in connection with the performance of Mr. Stonehouse's
duties; provided, however, that no act or failure to act on the part of Mr. Stonehouse could be considered "willful" unless it

interests of BioCryst. 

• "Constructive Termination" means a resignation of employment within 30 days of the occurrence of any of: (i) a reduction
in Mr. Stonehouse's responsibilities or any change in Mr. Stonehouse's status or title with regard to his employment; (ii) a
reduction in Mr. Stonehouse's base salary, unless such reduction occurs prior to the mergers and is made in connection with
a fiscal downturn of BioCryst pursuant to which the base salaries of all executive officers of BioCryst are reduced by a
comparable percentage; or (iii) a relocation of Mr. Stonehouse's principal office to a location more than 50 miles from the
location of his then-current principal office.

assignment or proprietary information agreement with BioCryst or with a former employer; (vi) failure to satisfactorily
perform the employee's duties after having received written notice of such failure and at least 30 days to cure such failure;
or (vii) misconduct or gross negligence in connection with the performance of the employee's duties.

events which occurs within six months following the mergers: (i) a material reduction in the employee's responsibilities;
(ii) a material reduction in the employee's base salary, unless such reduction is comparable in percentage to, and is part of,
a reduction in the base salary of all executive officers of BioCryst; or (iii) a relocation of the employee's principal office to
a location more than 50 miles from the location of his or her principal office immediately preceding the mergers.

above). The amounts reported below are estimates based on multiple assumptions that may or may not actually occur, including
assumptions described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

Employee Benefits 

        The merger agreement requires Holdco to continue to provide certain compensation and benefits through December 31, 2018, as well
as take certain actions in respect of employee benefits provided to BioCryst employees, including its executive officers. For a detailed
description of these requirements, please see the section entitled "The Merger Agreement—Employee Benefits Matters" beginning on
page 127 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

Indemnification and Insurance

        Under the merger agreement, certain indemnification and insurance rights exist in favor of BioCryst's current and former directors
and officers. Such indemnification and insurance rights are further described in the section entitled "The Merger Agreement—Other
Covenants and Agreements" beginning on page 130 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

BioCryst Stockholder Advisory Vote On Merger-Related Compensation For BioCryst's Named Executive Officers Proposal 

Golden Parachute Compensation

        This section sets forth the information required by Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K regarding the compensation for each named
executive officer of BioCryst that is based on or otherwise relates to the mergers. This compensation is referred to as "golden parachute"
compensation by the applicable SEC disclosure rules, and in this section we use such term to describe the merger-related compensation
that may become payable to BioCryst's named executive officers. The "golden parachute" compensation that may become payable to these
individuals is subject to a non-binding advisory vote of BioCryst's stockholders, as described below in this section. To the extent any of
BioCryst's named executive officers' compensation arrangements are described in "The Mergers—Interests of BioCryst's Directors and
Officers in the Mergers" beginning on page 106 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, they are incorporated herein by reference.

        Each named executive officer would receive approximately the amounts set forth in the table below. Please note that the amounts
indicated below are estimates based on the material assumptions described in the notes to the table below, which may or may not actually
occur. Some of these

assumptions are based on information currently available and, as a result, the actual amounts, if any, that may become payable to a named
executive officer may differ in material respects from the amounts set forth below. Furthermore, for purposes of calculating such amounts,
BioCryst has assumed:

• a closing date of the mergers of May 1, 2018 (which, as required by SEC rules, is the latest practicable date prior to the
filing of this joint proxy statement/prospectus); 

• the employment of each of the named executive officers is terminated without "cause" on the date of the consummation of
the mergers and executed and did not revoke a general release of claims in favor of BioCryst and complied with all
applicable restrictive covenants; and 

• the value of the accelerated vesting of any BioCryst equity award is calculated assuming a market price per share of
BioCryst common stock equal to $4.84 (which equals the average closing price of a share of BioCryst common stock on
the Nasdaq over the first five business days following January 22, 2018, the date of the first public announcement of
entering into the merger agreement).

Table of Contents

        The vote on the BioCryst merger-related compensation proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote on the adoption of the
merger agreement and the approval of the mergers. Accordingly, you may vote on the proposal to adopt the merger agreement and vote not
to approve, on a non-binding advisory basis, the compensation that may become payable to BioCryst's named executive officers that is
based on or otherwise relates to the mergers, or vice versa. Because the vote to approve the compensation that may become payable to
BioCryst's named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the mergers is advisory only, it will not be binding on
BioCryst. Accordingly, if the merger agreement is adopted and the mergers are approved and completed, the compensation payments that
are contractually required to be paid by BioCryst to its named executive officers will or may be paid, subject only to the conditions
applicable thereto, regardless of the outcome of the advisory (non-binding) vote of BioCryst stockholders.

Vote Required

        Approval of, on a non-binding advisory basis, the compensation that may become payable to BioCryst's named executive officers that
is based on or otherwise relates to the mergers requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of BioCryst common
stock present, in person or represented by proxy, at the BioCryst special meeting and voting on the proposal, although such vote will not
be binding on BioCryst, the BioCryst board or any of its committees, or, following completion of the mergers, the combined company,
assuming a quorum is present. Abstentions, failures to vote (i.e., not submitting a proxy and not voting in person) and broker non-votes
will have no effect on the proposal, assuming a quorum is present.

Holdco Board, Management and Certain Governance Matters Following the Mergers 

        Immediately following the effective time of the mergers, the board of the combined company will consist of nine members,
including: Vincent J. Milano, a director and the current chief executive officer of Idera, James A. Geraghty, the current chairman of the
Idera board, Maxine Gowen, Ph.D., a director of Idera, Mark Goldberg, M.D., a director of Idera, Jon P. Stonehouse, a director and the
current chief executive officer of BioCryst, Robert A. Ingram, the current chairman of the BioCryst board, Nancy Hutson, Ph.D., a director
of BioCryst, Kenneth B. Lee, Jr., a director of BioCryst, and one person to be mutually agreed to by the Idera board and the BioCryst
board who shall not be a director, officer or affiliate of either Idera or BioCryst. All directors, other than Messrs. Milano and Stonehouse,
will qualify as ``independent directors" under the Nasdaq rules.

        Upon completion of the mergers, Mr. Ingram will serve as the chairman of the board of the combined company, and Mr. Milano will
serve as the chief executive officer of the combined company.

        The corporate headquarters for the combined company and its subsidiaries will be located in Exton, Pennsylvania, and the primary
location for research and development for the combined company and its subsidiaries will be located in Birmingham, Alabama.

Regulatory Clearances Required for the Mergers 

        Under the HSR Act, BioCryst and Idera must file notifications with the FTC and the Antitrust Division and observe a mandatory pre-
merger waiting period before completing the mergers. On February 2, 2018, each of BioCryst and Idera filed its notification under the
HSR Act. BioCryst and Idera are committed to working cooperatively with the staff of the reviewing authority as it conducts its review of
the mergers. On February 15, 2018, the FTC notified Idera and BioCryst that their request for early termination of the applicable waiting
period was granted.

        BioCryst and Idera cannot assure you that the FTC, the Antitrust Division or private parties will not initiate actions to challenge the
mergers before or after they are completed. Any such challenge to the mergers could result in a court order enjoining the mergers or in
restrictions or conditions that

Table of Contents

would have a material adverse effect on the combined company if the mergers are completed. Such restrictions and conditions could
include requiring the divestiture or spin-off of assets or businesses. Under the terms of the merger agreement, each of BioCryst and Idera
are required to take any and all steps necessary to obtain approval from any antitrust or competition governmental entity in order to
complete the mergers, but neither BioCryst nor Idera is required to agree to any sale, transfer, license, separate holding, divestiture or other
disposition of, or to any prohibition of or any limitation on the acquisition, ownership, operation, effective control or exercise of full rights
of ownership, or other modification of rights in respect of any material business, product line or asset, or otherwise modify any material
business practice or contractual relationship. No additional stockholder approval is expected to be required or sought for any decision by
BioCryst or Idera to agree to any terms and conditions necessary to resolve any regulatory objections to the mergers.

Listing of Holdco Common Stock 

        It is a condition to the completion of the mergers that the shares of Holdco common stock to be issued to Idera stockholders or
BioCryst stockholders pursuant to the mergers be authorized for listing, and Idera and BioCryst have agreed to use their reasonable best
efforts to cause such shares to be listed, on the Nasdaq, subject to official notice of issuance.

De-Listing and Deregistration of Idera Stock 

        Upon completion of the mergers, the Idera common stock currently listed on the Nasdaq will cease to be listed on the Nasdaq and will
subsequently be deregistered under the Exchange Act.

De-Listing and Deregistration of BioCryst Stock 

        Upon completion of the mergers, the BioCryst common stock currently listed on the Nasdaq will cease to be listed on the Nasdaq and
will subsequently be deregistered under the Exchange Act.

No Appraisal Rights 

        Under the DGCL, holders of Idera common stock and BioCryst common stock are not entitled to appraisal rights in connection with
the mergers. See the section entitled "No Appraisal Rights" beginning on page 169 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

Litigation Related to the Mergers 

        Three putative class action complaints have been filed in connection with the proposed transaction announced on January 22, 2018.
On March 6, 2018 plaintiff Melvin Klein filed a lawsuit captioned Klein v. BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc., et al., No. 1:18-cv-00358,
against BioCryst along with members of the BioCryst board, Idera, Holdco, Merger Sub A and Merger Sub B in United States District
Court for the District of Delaware. On March 14, 2018, plaintiff Lisa Raatz filed a lawsuit captioned Raatz v. Idera Pharmaceuticals, Inc.,
et al., No. 1:18-cv-10485, against Idera, along with members of the Idera board, BioCryst, Holdco, Merger Sub A and Merger Sub B in
United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. Both lawsuits allege violations of Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, and SEC Rule 14a-9, for alleged material misstatements or omissions in connection with the proposed transaction.
On March 22, 2018, plaintiff Ricky Cohen filed a lawsuit captioned Cohen v. Idera Pharmaceuticals, Inc., et al., No. 1:18-cv-00428,
against Idera, along with the members of the Idera board in United States District Court for the District of Delaware. All three complaints
include demands for, among other things, an injunction preventing defendants from closing the proposed transaction absent certain
disclosures of information identified in the complaints. BioCryst and Idera believe these complaints are without merit and intend to

THE MERGER AGREEMENT 

        The following section summarizes material provisions of the merger agreement, which is attached as Annex A to this joint proxy
statement/prospectus and is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The rights and obligations of Idera and BioCryst are governed
by the express terms and conditions of the merger agreement and not by this summary or any other information contained in this joint
proxy statement/prospectus. Idera stockholders and BioCryst stockholders are urged to read the merger agreement carefully and in its
entirety as well as this joint proxy statement/prospectus before making any decisions regarding the mergers, including the adoption of the
merger agreement, the issuance of shares of Holdco common stock to Idera stockholders and BioCryst stockholders pursuant to the
mergers or the adoption of the Holdco charter, as applicable.

        The merger agreement is attached as Annex A to this joint proxy statement/prospectus to provide you with information regarding its
terms and is not intended to provide any factual information about Idera or BioCryst. The merger agreement contains representations and
warranties by each of the parties to the merger agreement. These representations and warranties have been made solely for the benefit of
the parties to the merger agreement and:

• may not be intended as statements of fact, but rather as a way of allocating the risk between the parties in the event the
statements therein prove to be inaccurate; 

• have been qualified by certain disclosures that were made between the parties in connection with the negotiation of the
merger agreement, which disclosures are not reflected in the merger agreement itself; and 

• may apply standards of materiality in a way that is different from what may be viewed as material by you or other
investors.

        Accordingly, the representations and warranties and other provisions of the merger agreement should not be read alone, but instead
should be read together with the information provided elsewhere in this joint proxy statement/prospectus and in the documents
incorporated by reference into this joint proxy statement/prospectus. See "Where You Can Find More Information" beginning on page 172
of this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

        This summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the merger agreement.

Terms of the Mergers; Merger Consideration 

        The merger agreement provides that, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the merger agreement and in accordance
with the DGCL, at the effective time of the mergers, Merger Sub A, a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Holdco, will
merge with and into Idera, and Merger Sub B, a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Holdco, will merge with and into
BioCryst. Idera and BioCryst will be the surviving corporations in the mergers and each will become a wholly owned subsidiary of
Holdco. At the effective time of the mergers, each issued and outstanding share of Idera common stock (other than shares owned by Idera,
BioCryst, Holdco, Merger Sub A, or Merger Sub B, or any subsidiary of each of the aforementioned entities, or by Idera as treasury
shares, which will cease to remain outstanding and will be canceled and retired and cease to exist) will be converted into the right to
receive 0.20 shares of Holdco common stock, with cash paid in lieu of fractional shares. At the effective time of the mergers, each issued
and outstanding share of Idera preferred stock (other than shares owned by Idera, BioCryst, Holdco, Merger Sub A, or Merger Sub B, or
any subsidiary of each of the aforementioned entities, or by Idera as treasury shares, which will cease to remain outstanding and will be
canceled and retired and cease to exist) will be converted into the right to receive an amount of shares of Holdco common stock equal to
(i) $1.00 divided by the 20-trading-day average trading price of Idera common stock, ending with the trading day prior to the third day
prior to the closing date, multiplied by (ii) 0.20, with cash paid in lieu of fractional shares. At

the effective time of the mergers, each issued and outstanding share of BioCryst common stock (other than shares owned by Idera,
BioCryst, Holdco, Merger Sub A, or Merger Sub B, or any subsidiary of each of the aforementioned entities, or by BioCryst as treasury
shares, which will cease to remain outstanding and will be canceled and retired and cease to exist) will be converted into the right to
receive 0.50 shares of Holdco common stock, with cash paid in lieu of fractional shares. The Idera exchange ratio and BioCryst exchange
ratio are fixed and will not be adjusted to reflect stock price changes prior to the closing of the mergers.

        Holdco will not issue fractional shares of Holdco common stock pursuant to the merger agreement. Instead, each holder of Idera
common stock, Idera preferred stock or BioCryst common stock who otherwise would have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of
Holdco common stock will be entitled to receive a cash payment in lieu thereof representing that stockholder's proportionate interest, if
any, in the proceeds from the sale by the exchange agent of Holdco common stock equal to the excess of (i) the aggregate number of
shares of Holdco common stock to be delivered by Holdco in the mergers over (ii) the aggregate number of whole shares of Holdco
common stock to be distributed to the holders of Idera common stock, Idera preferred stock or BioCryst common stock in the mergers
(such excess, the "excess shares"). The sale of the excess shares by the exchange agent will be executed on the Nasdaq and will be
executed in round lots to the extent practicable. Until the proceeds of such sale or sales have been distributed to the holders of Idera
common stock, Idera preferred stock and BioCryst common stock, the exchange agent will hold such proceeds in trust for the holders of
Idera common stock, Idera preferred stock and BioCryst common stock that would otherwise receive fractional shares of Holdco common
stock (the "common shares trust"). The portion of the common shares trust to which each holder of Idera common stock, Idera preferred
stock and BioCryst common stock will be entitled, if any, will be determined by multiplying the amount of the aggregate proceeds
comprising the common shares trust by a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount of the fractional share interest to which such
holder of Idera common stock, Idera preferred stock and BioCryst common stock would otherwise be entitled and the denominator of
which is the aggregate amount of fractional share interests to which all holders of Idera common stock, Idera preferred stock and BioCryst
common stock would otherwise be entitled.

        If, from the date of the merger agreement until the effective time, the number of issued and outstanding shares of Holdco common
stock, BioCryst common stock, Idera common stock or Idera preferred stock changes into a different number of shares or a different class
by reason of any reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split), recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares,
readjustment or other similar transaction, or a stock dividend or stock distribution is declared with a record date within the period between
the date of the merger agreement and the effective time of the mergers, then the exchange ratios will be equitably adjusted to provide the
holders of Idera common stock, Idera preferred stock and BioCryst common stock the same economic effect as contemplated by the
merger agreement prior to such event.

Completion of the Mergers 

        Unless the parties agree otherwise, the closing of the mergers will take place within three business days after all conditions to the
completion of the mergers have been satisfied or waived. The mergers will be effective when the parties file the certificates of merger with
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in accordance with the DGCL, or at such later time as the parties agree and specify in the
certificates of merger. The Holdco charter will be filed with the certificates of merger and will become effective at the same time as the
mergers.

Exchange of Shares in the Mergers 

        Prior to the dissemination of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, BioCryst and Idera will have appointed an exchange agent to
handle the exchange of shares of BioCryst common stock, Idera

common stock and Idera preferred stock for shares of Holdco common stock in the mergers. At the effective time of the mergers, shares of
BioCryst common stock, Idera common stock and Idera preferred stock will be converted into the right to receive shares of Holdco
common stock without the need for any action by the holders of BioCryst common stock, Idera common stock or Idera preferred stock.

        As promptly as practicable (but in no event later than three business days) after the effective time of the mergers, Holdco will cause
the exchange agent to mail a letter of transmittal to each holder of record of BioCryst common stock, Idera common stock and Idera
preferred stock (as of immediately prior to the effective time of the mergers) specifying, among other things, that delivery will be effected,
and risk of loss and title to any certificates representing BioCryst common stock, Idera common stock or Idera preferred stock, as
applicable, will pass, only upon delivery of such certificates to the exchange agent. The letter will also include instructions explaining the
procedure for surrendering shares of BioCryst common stock, Idera common stock or Idera preferred stock held in book-entry form in
exchange for shares of Holdco common stock.

        After the effective time of the mergers, shares of BioCryst common stock, Idera common stock and Idera preferred stock will no
longer be outstanding, will be automatically canceled and will cease to exist and each certificate, if any, that previously represented shares
of BioCryst common stock, Idera common stock or Idera preferred stock will represent only the right to receive the merger consideration
as described above, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Holdco common stock and any dividends or other distributions to which the
holders of shares of Holdco common stock are entitled with a record date after the effective time of the mergers. With respect to such
shares of Holdco common stock deliverable upon the surrender of BioCryst common stock, Idera common stock and Idera preferred stock,
until holders of such BioCryst common stock, Idera common stock and Idera preferred stock have surrendered such BioCryst common
stock, Idera common stock or Idera preferred stock, as applicable, to the exchange agent for exchange, those holders will not receive
dividends or other distributions with respect to such shares of Holdco common stock with a record date after the effective time of the
mergers.

        The merger agreement contains reciprocal representations and warranties. Each of BioCryst and Idera has made representations and
warranties regarding, among other things:

• corporate organization, standing and corporate power;

• absence of joint ventures, off-balance sheet partnerships or other similar contracts intended to avoid disclosure of material
liabilities; 

• absence of certain changes and events from October 1, 2017 through the date of execution of the merger agreement;

• benefits matters and ERISA compliance;

• intellectual property; 

• compliance with applicable health care laws and permits; 

• brokerage or other finders' fees that may be payable in connection with the mergers; 

• opinions from financial advisors;

        The merger agreement also contains certain representations and warranties of BioCryst with respect to the lack of prior business
activities and capitalization of Holdco, Merger Sub A and Merger Sub B and each entity's authority with respect to the execution and
delivery of the merger agreement.

        Many of the representations and warranties in the merger agreement are qualified by a "materiality" or "material adverse effect"
standard (that is, they will not be deemed to be untrue or incorrect unless their failure to be true or correct, individually or in the aggregate,
would, as the case may be, be material or have a material adverse effect). Under the merger agreement, a "material adverse effect" means,
with respect to a party, any change, event, development, condition, occurrence or effect that is, or would reasonably be expected to be,
materially adverse to the business, condition (financial or otherwise), assets, liabilities or results of operations of such party and its
subsidiaries, taken as a whole, except that none of the following will be deemed in themselves, either alone or in combination, to
constitute, and none of the following will be taken into account in determining whether there has been or will be, a material adverse effect:

• any changes resulting from general market, economic, financial, capital markets or political or regulatory conditions; 

• any change of law or GAAP; 

• any changes resulting from any act of terrorism, war, national or international calamity, or any worsening thereof;

• any changes generally affecting the industries in which the applicable company and its subsidiaries conduct their
businesses; 

• any changes resulting from the execution of the merger agreement or the announcement or pendency of the mergers,
including any loss of employees or any disruption in or termination of (or loss of or other negative effect or change with
respect to) supplier, distributor or similar business relationships or partnerships resulting from the transactions under the
merger agreement; 

• changes in the applicable company's stock price or the trading volume of the applicable company's stock or any change in
the credit rating of the applicable company (but not, in each case, the underlying cause of any such changes, unless such
underlying cause would otherwise be excepted from the definition of material adverse effect); 

• any changes or effects resulting from any action required to be taken by the terms of the merger agreement; 

• the failure to meet internal or analysts' expectations, projections or results of operations (but not, in each case, the
underlying cause of any such changes, unless such underlying cause would otherwise be excepted from the definition of
material adverse effect); or 

• any legal proceeding arising from or relating to the mergers.

        Any changes of the sort referred to in the first four bullets above may be taken into account in determining whether there has been a
material adverse effect if, and only to the extent, such changes have a disproportionate impact on the applicable company and its
subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as compared to other participants in the industries in which such company and its subsidiaries conduct their
businesses.

        The representations and warranties do not survive the effective time of the mergers.

Conduct of Business Pending the Effective Time 

        In the merger agreement, BioCryst and Idera have each agreed that until the effective time of the mergers, subject to certain specified

• use commercially reasonable efforts to keep available the services of their current officers, employees and consultants and
to preserve the goodwill and current relationships with persons having business relations; and

        In addition, each of BioCryst and Idera has agreed that until the effective time of the mergers, it and its respective subsidiaries will
not do any of the following without the prior written consent of the other party (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed):

No Solicitation of Competing Proposals 

        Each of BioCryst and Idera has agreed that, from the time of the execution of the merger agreement until the earlier of the effective
time of the mergers and the termination of the merger agreement, it will not and it will cause its subsidiaries and representatives not to,
directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage or induce, or take any other action designed to facilitate, any inquiries or
the making of any proposal which constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, any "competing proposal" (as defined in "The
Merger Agreement—No Solicitation of Competing Proposals" beginning on page 123 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus) or
(ii) engage in any discussions or negotiations regarding any competing proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (x) BioCryst and Idera
may ascertain facts from a third party making a competing proposal for the sole purpose of the BioCryst board or Idera board informing
itself about the terms of the competing proposal and the third party that made it and (y) if, prior to obtaining the approval of the BioCryst
stockholders or the Idera stockholders, as applicable, and following receipt of a bona fide written competing proposal that the BioCryst
board or Idera board, as applicable, determines in good faith (after receiving advice of its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) is or
would reasonably be expected to lead to a "superior proposal" (as defined in "The Merger Agreement—No Solicitation of Competing
Proposals" beginning on page 123 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus) and that was not, directly or indirectly, solicited, initiated or
knowingly encouraged in violation of the merger agreement, the BioCryst board or Idera board, as applicable, determines in good faith,
after consultation with outside legal counsel, that a failure to take any action with respect to such competing proposal would constitute a
breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable law, BioCryst or Idera may, in response to such competing proposal and subject to certain
notification requirements under the merger agreement, (A) furnish information with respect to BioCryst or Idera, as applicable, to such
third party making such competing proposal pursuant to an acceptable confidentiality agreement, and (B) engage in discussions or
negotiations with such third party regarding such competing proposal.

        Each of BioCryst and Idera has further agreed that, until the effective time of the mergers or the termination of the merger agreement,
it will not, and will cause its respective subsidiaries and representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i) approve, endorse, recommend or
enter into, or publicly propose to approve, endorse, recommend or enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding,
agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement or similar definitive agreement with respect to any competing proposal,
(ii) take any action to make the provisions of any takeover statute inapplicable to any transactions contemplated by a competing proposal,
(iii) terminate, amend, release, modify or knowingly fail to enforce any provision of, or grant any permission, waiver or request under, any
standstill agreement entered into by the applicable party in respect of or in contemplation of a competing proposal (other than to the extent
the BioCryst board or Idera board, as applicable, determines in good faith after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that failure to
take any of such actions would constitute a breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable law) or (iv) propose to do any of the foregoing.

        A "competing proposal" with respect to a party means any proposal or offer from a third party relating to (i) a merger, reorganization,
sale of assets, out license, share exchange, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, dissolution, liquidation, joint venture or
similar transaction involving BioCryst or Idera, or any of their respective subsidiaries, (ii) the acquisition by any person of 20% or more of
the consolidated assets of BioCryst or Idera, and their respective subsidiaries, as determined on a book-value or fair-market-value basis,
(iii) the purchase or acquisition, in any manner, directly or indirectly, by any person of 20% or more of the issued and outstanding shares
of BioCryst common stock or Idera common stock or any other equity interests in BioCryst or Idera, (iv) any purchase, acquisition, tender
offer or exchange offer that, would result in any person beneficially owning 20% or more of the shares of BioCryst common stock or Idera
common stock or any other

equity interests of BioCryst, Idera or any of their respective subsidiaries or (v) any combination of the foregoing.

        A "superior proposal" with respect to a party means a bona fide written competing proposal (except the references therein to "20%"
will be replaced by "80%") made by a third party which, in the good faith judgment of the BioCryst board or Idera board, as applicable,
and after consultation with its outside financial and legal advisors, taking into account the various legal, financial and regulatory aspects of
the competing proposal, including its financial terms and the third party making such competing proposal, (i) if accepted, is reasonably
likely to be consummated, (ii) if consummated, would result in a transaction that is more favorable to BioCryst stockholders or Idera
stockholders, as applicable, from a financial point of view, than the mergers and the other transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement and (iii) if a cash transaction (in whole or in part), financing for which is then fully committed or reasonably determined to be
available.

        The merger agreement requires that BioCryst and Idera, as applicable, promptly, and in any event no later than 24 hours, after such
party receives (i) any competing proposal or indication that a third party is considering making a competing proposal, (ii) any request for
non-public information relating to BioCryst or Idera or their respective subsidiaries other than requests for information that would not
reasonably be expected to result in a competing proposal or (iii) any inquiry or request for discussions or negotiations regarding any
competing proposal, to notify the other party in writing of any of the foregoing occurrences, the identity of the party making such request
and a copy of such competing proposal. Each party will keep the other party reasonably informed of the status (and in any event within
24 hours of any material changes, developments, discussions or negotiations) of any request, inquiry or competing proposal, and any
material developments with respect thereto. Without limiting the foregoing, each party will promptly (and in any event within 24 hours)
notify the other party if it determines to begin providing information or to engage in discussions or negotiations concerning a competing
proposal. Each party will, either prior to or concurrently with, provide the other party with any non-public information concerning such
party that it provided to any third party in connection with any competing proposal which was not previously provided to the other party.

Changes in Board Recommendations 

        Each of the BioCryst board and the Idera board has agreed that it will not (i) withhold, withdraw, modify or qualify, in a manner
adverse to the other party, the approval, determination of advisability or recommendation by such board with respect to the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement, as applicable, (ii) make, or permit any director or executive officer to make, any public statement
in connection with either special meeting by or on behalf of the applicable board that would reasonably be expected to have the same
effect or (iii) approve, determine to be advisable or recommend any competing proposal (each, a "BioCryst Adverse Recommendation
Change" or "Idera Adverse Recommendation Change," as applicable).

        Notwithstanding the restrictions described above, at any time prior to obtaining the relevant stockholder approval, the BioCryst board
or Idera board, as applicable, may, in response to any bona fide written competing proposal, make a BioCryst Adverse Recommendation
Change or Idera Adverse Recommendation Change, as applicable, if (i) the BioCryst board or Idera board, as applicable, has determined
in good faith, after consultation with its outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such competing proposal constitutes a
superior proposal, (ii) the BioCryst board or Idera board, as applicable, provides the other party four business days prior written notice of
its intention to take such action, (iii) during the four business days following such written notice, if requested by the other party, the board
of directors effecting the recommendation change and its representatives have negotiated in good faith with the other party regarding any
revisions to the terms of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement proposed by the other party in response to such competing
proposal and (iv) at the end of the four business day period described in clause (iii), the BioCryst board or the Idera board,

as applicable, concludes in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that the competing proposal
continues to be a superior proposal and, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to make a BioCryst Adverse
Recommendation Change or Idera Adverse Recommendation Change, as applicable, would constitute a breach of the fiduciary duties of
the BioCryst board or the Idera board, as applicable, under applicable law. Any material amendment or modification to any competing
proposal requires an additional notice under clause (ii) above and the negotiation period described in clause (iii) above will be extended an
additional two days from the date of receipt of such additional notice.

        In addition, at any time prior to obtaining the relevant stockholder approval, the BioCryst board or Idera board, as applicable, may
make a BioCryst Adverse Recommendation Change or Idera Adverse Recommendation Change, as applicable, if (i) such board of
directors determines that an "intervening event" (as defined in "The Merger Agreement—Changes in Board Recommendations" beginning
on page 124 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus) has occurred and is continuing and (ii) such board of directors determines in good
faith (after consultation with outside counsel) that the failure to make a BioCryst Adverse Recommendation Change or an Idera Adverse
Recommendation Change, as applicable, in response to such intervening event would constitute a breach of its fiduciary duties under
applicable law; provided that (x) the BioCryst board or the Idera board has given the other party at least four business days prior written
notice of its intention to take such action and specifying in reasonable detail the circumstances related to such determination and (y) prior
to effecting a BioCryst Adverse Recommendation Change or an Idera Adverse Recommendation Change, the applicable party has
negotiated, and has caused its representatives to negotiate, in good faith with the other party during such notice period to the extent such
other party wishes to negotiate, to enable such party to revise the terms of the merger agreement, such that the failure to make a BioCryst
Adverse Recommendation Change or an Idera Adverse Recommendation Change, as applicable, would not constitute a breach of its
fiduciary duties under applicable law.

        An "intervening event" with respect to a party means any material event, development or change in circumstances that first occurs,
arises or becomes known to BioCryst or Idera or its respective board, as applicable, after the date of the merger agreement, to the extent
that such event, development or change in circumstances was not reasonably foreseeable as of the date of the merger agreement; provided,
however, that in no event will the following events, developments or changes in circumstances constitute an intervening event: (i) the
receipt, existence or terms of a competing proposal or any matter relating thereto or consequence thereof, (ii) any change in the price, or
change in trading volume, of BioCryst common stock or Idera common stock (provided, however, that the exception to this clause (ii) will
not apply to the underlying causes giving rise to or contributing to such change or prevent any of such underlying causes from being taken
into account in determining whether an intervening event has occurred), and (iii) meeting or exceeding internal or analysts' expectations,
projections or results of operations (provided, however, that the exception to this clause (iii) will not apply to the underlying causes giving
rise to or contributing to such circumstances or prevent any of such underlying causes from being taken into account in determining
whether an intervening event has occurred).

        If the BioCryst board or the Idera board effects a BioCryst Adverse Recommendation Change or an Idera Adverse Recommendation
Change, as applicable, such board of directors will nonetheless continue to be obligated to hold its special meeting and submit the
proposals described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus to its stockholders for their vote, as applicable.

Efforts to Obtain Required Stockholder Votes 

        Under the terms of the merger agreement, BioCryst and Idera have agreed that the BioCryst board and the Idera board will each call,
hold and convene a meeting of its stockholders promptly after the declaration of effectiveness of the registration statement, of which this

prospectus forms a part, by the SEC. BioCryst and Idera have also agreed that the BioCryst board and the Idera board will each use its
reasonable best efforts to call, give notice of, convene and hold its respective special meetings on the same date.

        Idera and BioCryst have also agreed to use their respective reasonable best efforts to obtain stockholder approval for the proposal to
adopt the merger agreement. Unless the merger agreement is terminated prior to the date of the Idera special meeting or the BioCryst
special meeting, as applicable, Idera and BioCryst must submit the merger agreement to a stockholder vote even if its respective board of
directors no longer recommends adoption of the merger agreement. The Idera board and the BioCryst board have approved the merger
agreement and declared the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the mergers, advisable to and in the
best interests of Idera and BioCryst and their respective stockholders, as applicable, and adopted resolutions directing that the merger
agreement be submitted to the Idera stockholders and the BioCryst stockholders, respectively, for their consideration.

Efforts to Complete the Mergers 

        Each party to the merger agreement has agreed to use its reasonable best efforts to take all appropriate actions and to do all things
reasonably necessary to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including using
reasonable best efforts to obtain all waivers, permits, consents, approvals, authorizations, qualifications and orders of all governmental
entities and parties to contracts with Idera, BioCryst or any of their respective subsidiaries that may be or become necessary for the
performance of obligations pursuant to the merger agreement and the consummation of the transactions thereunder.

        Each of BioCryst and Idera has agreed to make all filings required under the HSR Act and other antitrust laws with respect to the
mergers as promptly as reasonably practicable (and, in the case of the required Notification and Report Form under the HSR Act, each of
BioCryst and Idera filed such form on February 2, 2018).

        Each party to the merger agreement has agreed to, and to cause each of its subsidiaries to, take any and all steps necessary to obtain
approval of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement by any antitrust or competition governmental
entity, including taking all steps necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every legal impediment under any applicable antitrust law that
may be asserted by any antitrust or competition governmental entity so as to enable the parties to close the transactions as promptly as
reasonably practicable, and in any event prior to the "outside date" (as defined in "The Merger Agreement—Termination of the Merger
Agreement" beginning on page 133 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus).

        Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with the receipt of any necessary approvals or clearances of a governmental entity,
neither BioCryst nor Idera will be required to agree to any sale, transfer, license, separate holding, divestiture or other disposition of, or to
any prohibition of or any limitation on the acquisition, ownership, operation, effective control or exercise of full rights of ownership, or
other modification of rights in respect of any material business, product line or asset, or otherwise modify any material business practice or
contractual relationship.

        Without the prior written approval of the other party, no party shall effect or agree to any business combination or acquisition of any
assets, licenses, rights, product lines, operations or businesses of any person that would reasonably be expected to prevent or materially
delay consummation of the transactions.

Governance Matters After the Mergers 

        Immediately following the effective time of the mergers, the board of the combined company will consist of nine members,
including: Vincent J. Milano, a director and the current chief executive officer of Idera, James A. Geraghty, the current chairman of the
Idera board, Maxine Gowen, Ph.D., a director of Idera, Mark Goldberg, M.D., a director of Idera, Jon P. Stonehouse, a director and the
current chief executive officer of BioCryst, Robert A. Ingram, the current chairman of the BioCryst board, Nancy Hutson, Ph.D., a director
of BioCryst, Kenneth B. Lee, Jr., a director of BioCryst, and one person to be mutually agreed to by the Idera board and the BioCryst
board who shall not be a director, officer or affiliate of either Idera or BioCryst. All directors, other than Messrs. Milano and Stonehouse,
will qualify as "independent directors" under the Nasdaq rules.

        Upon completion of the mergers, Mr. Ingram will serve as the chairman of the board of the combined company, and Mr. Milano will
serve as the chief executive officer of the combined company.

        The corporate headquarters for the combined company and its subsidiaries will be located in Exton, Pennsylvania, and the primary
location for research and development for the combined company and its subsidiaries will be located in Birmingham Alabama.

Amendments to Governance Provisions

        The board of the combined company will be authorized and have the power to amend, alter, change, adopt and repeal the Holdco
bylaws at any regular or special meeting of the board of the combined company at which there is a quorum by the affirmative vote of a
majority of the total number of directors present at such meeting, or by unanimous written consent.

        Stockholders of the combined company will also have power to amend, alter, change, adopt and repeal the Holdco bylaws at any
annual or special meeting by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of
capital stock of Holdco entitled to vote thereon.

Employee Benefits Matters 

        Each employee of Idera, BioCryst or any of their respective subsidiaries who continues employment with Holdco or any of its
subsidiaries following the closing date of the mergers (each a "continuing employee") will continue to receive, through December 31, 2018
(i) base salary or wages and annual bonus opportunity that are not less than the base salary or wages and annual bonus opportunity
received by such continuing employee immediately prior to the effective time of the mergers and (ii) retirement, health and welfare,
severance and other benefits (including equity awards but excluding defined benefit arrangements and retiree health and welfare
arrangements), in each case, that are, in the aggregate, no less favorable than those provided to such continuing employee immediately
prior to the closing date of the mergers.

        To the extent permitted by applicable laws, Holdco will credit each continuing employee with his or her years of service with Idera,
BioCryst or any of their respective subsidiaries and predecessor entities, under any employee benefit plans, programs and arrangements in
which such continuing employee participates following the consummation of the mergers (the "post-closing plan"), to the same extent as
such continuing employee was entitled immediately prior to the consummation of the mergers to credit for such service under any similar
Idera benefit plan or BioCryst benefit plan, for purposes of eligibility for participation and vesting. This credit will not extend (i) for
purposes of accrual of benefits, other than for purposes of determining the level of vacation, travel and/or severance benefits, (ii) if doing
so would result in duplication of benefits or (iii) for purposes of defined benefits plans or retiree welfare plans, except to the extent
required by applicable law.

        In addition, for purposes of each post-closing plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical, vision and/or other health benefits to
any continuing employee and his or her dependents, Holdco will use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) cause all waiting periods, pre-
existing condition exclusions, evidence of insurability requirements and actively-at-work requirements of such post-closing plan to be
waived for such continuing employee and his or her covered dependents, to the extent any such waiting periods, pre-existing condition
exclusions, evidence of insurability requirements and actively-at-work requirements were waived or were inapplicable under the
comparable Idera benefit plan or BioCryst benefit plan, (ii) fully credit each continuing employee with all deductible payments, co-
payments and other out-of-pocket expenses incurred by such continuing employee and his or her covered dependents under the medical,
dental, pharmaceutical or vision benefit plans of Idera or BioCryst (or their respective subsidiaries), as applicable, prior to the
consummation of the mergers during the plan year in which the consummation of the mergers occurs for the purpose of determining the
extent to which such continuing employee has satisfied the deductible, co-payments, or maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable
to such continuing employee and his or her covered dependents for such plan year under any pre-closing plan providing medical, dental,
pharmaceutical, vision or health benefits, as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such plan, and (iii) credit the accounts of
such continuing employees under any post-closing plan that is a flexible spending plan with any unused balance in the account of such
continuing employee under the applicable Idera benefit plan or BioCryst benefit plan.

Treatment of Idera Stock Options and Warrants 

Idera Stock Options

        As of the effective time of the mergers, each Idera stock option that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the effective
time of the mergers, whether or not then vested or exercisable, will be assumed by Holdco and converted into a Holdco stock option. In
addition, each such stock option will vest in full, other than Idera stock options held by an individual who is a party to a Severance and
Change of Control Agreement. Each converted Holdco stock option will be subject to the same terms and conditions (other than, in the
case described above, vesting) as applied to the original Idera stock option immediately prior to the effective time of the mergers, except
that it will be exercisable for that number of whole shares of Holdco common stock (rounded down to the nearest whole share) equal to the
number of shares subject to the Idera stock option multiplied by the Idera exchange ratio (0.20), at an exercise price per share (rounded up
to the nearest whole cent) equal to the exercise price per share applicable to the Idera stock option divided by the Idera exchange ratio.
This treatment will be subject to certain provisions of the Code, as described in the merger agreement.

Idera Warrants

        At the effective time of the mergers, each outstanding Idera warrant and Idera pre-funded warrant to purchase shares of Idera common
stock will be assumed by Holdco and converted into a warrant to acquire Holdco common stock on the same terms and conditions as were
in effect immediately prior to the completion of the mergers, except that each Idera warrant and Idera pre-funded warrant (i) will cover a
number of whole shares of Holdco common stock (rounded down to the nearest whole share) equal to the number of shares of Idera
common stock subject to the Idera warrant or Idera pre-funded warrant, as applicable, multiplied by 0.20, and (ii) will have an exercise
price per share of Holdco common stock (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to the per share exercise price of the Idera warrant
or Idera pre-funded warrant, as applicable, divided by 0.20.

Treatment of BioCryst Stock Options and RSUs 

BioCryst Stock Options

        As of the effective time of the mergers, each BioCryst stock option that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the
effective time of the mergers, whether or not then vested or exercisable, will vest in full and be assumed by Holdco and converted into a
Holdco stock option. Each Holdco stock option will be subject to the same terms and conditions (other than vesting) as applied to the
original BioCryst stock option immediately prior to the effective time of the mergers, except that it will be exercisable for that number of
whole shares of Holdco common stock (rounded down to the nearest whole share) equal to the number of shares subject to the BioCryst
stock option multiplied by the BioCryst exchange ratio (0.50), at an exercise price per share (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal
to the exercise price per share applicable to the BioCryst stock option divided by the BioCryst exchange ratio. This treatment will be
subject to certain provisions of the Code, as described in the merger agreement.

BioCryst RSUs

        As of the effective time of the mergers, each BioCryst RSU that is outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the mergers
will be assumed by Holdco and will vest in full and be converted into a Holdco RSU. Each converted Holdco RSU will be subject to the
same terms and conditions (other than vesting) as applied to the original BioCryst RSU immediately prior to the effective time of the
mergers, except that it will be a restricted stock unit to acquire that number of whole shares of Holdco common stock (rounded down to
the nearest whole share) equal to the number of shares subject to the BioCryst RSU multiplied by the BioCryst exchange ratio.

Treatment of Equity Plans and Employee Stock Purchase Plans 

        As of the effective time, and unless otherwise terminated in accordance with the merger agreement, Holdco will assume the BioCryst
Stock Incentive Plan (the "BioCryst equity plan"), the Idera 1995 Director Stock Plan, the Idera 1997 Stock Incentive Plan, the Idera 2005
Stock Incentive Plan, the 2008 Stock Incentive Plan and the 2013 Stock Incentive Plan (collectively, the "Idera equity plans"), the
BioCryst amended and restated employee stock purchase plan (the "BioCryst ESPP") and the Idera employee stock purchase plan (the
"Idera ESPP").

        Following the Effective Time, Holdco will continue to maintain any such assumed plans (each, as may be amended or terminated
from time to time in accordance with its terms), and will be able to grant "incentive stock options" under each such plan. As of
immediately prior to the effective time: (i) the maximum number of shares of BioCryst common stock that may be issued under the
BioCryst Stock Plan and the BioCryst ESPP upon the exercise of incentive stock options (including outstanding grants) is 24,190,000 and
1,475,000, respectively (subject to certain adjustments in the applicable plan in accordance with the Treasury Regulations promulgated
thereunder), (ii) employees of BioCryst are eligible to receive incentive stock options under each of the BioCryst equity plan and the
BioCryst ESPP, (iii) the maximum number of shares of Idera common stock that may be issued under the Idera 2005 Stock Incentive Plan,
the 2008 Stock Incentive Plan, the 2013 Stock Incentive Plan and the Idera ESPP upon the exercise of incentive stock options (including
outstanding grants) is 1,125,000, 6,000,000, 32,171,438 and 500,000, respectively (subject to certain adjustments in the applicable plan in
accordance with the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder) and (iv) employees of Idera are eligible to receive incentive stock
options under each such Idera equity plan and the Idera ESPP. As of immediately following the effective time, by virtue of the mergers,
(i) the maximum number of shares of Holdco common stock that may be issued under the BioCryst equity plan and the BioCryst ESPP as
incentive stock options (including outstanding grants) shall be 24,190,000 and 1,475,000, respectively (subject to certain adjustments

and (y) to reflect the Idera exchange ratio) and (iv) the employees of Holdco and its subsidiaries shall be eligible to receive incentive stock
options under the Idera equity plans and the Idera ESPP.

        As soon as practicable following the date of the merger agreement, the Idera board and the BioCryst board will take all actions with
respect to the Idera ESPP and the BioCryst ESPP, respectively, that are necessary to provide that the offering period otherwise in effect on
the closing date will terminate, and any options then-outstanding under the Idera ESPP and the BioCryst ESPP, respectively, will be
exercised, on the date immediately preceding the closing date or on an earlier date as mutually agreed in writing by BioCryst and Idera.
Unless as otherwise mutually agreed in writing by BioCryst and Idera no later than 10 business days prior to the effective date of the
mergers, the Idera board and the BioCryst board will take all actions with respect to the Idera ESPP and the BioCryst ESPP, respectively,
that are necessary to provide that subject to the consummation of the mergers, the applicable plan will terminate effective immediately
prior to the effective time of the mergers.

Compensation Actions between Signing of Merger Agreement and Completion of Mergers 

        Under the terms of the merger agreement, BioCryst may not, except either in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice with respect to individuals with a title below Vice President, or to the extent required by applicable law or the existing terms of

subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the following additional conditions:

• the representations and warranties of the other party, other than the representations related to corporate organization,
capitalization, the authority with respect to the execution, delivery, and performance of the merger agreement and the due

advisor, with respect to BioCryst only, the representation that none of Holdco, Merger Sub A or Merger Sub B has engaged
in any business activity other than in connection with the merger agreement, and the non-occurrence of any event or
development having a material adverse effect on the other party since October 1, 2017, will be true and correct in all
respects (without giving effect to any materiality or material adverse effect qualifications contained in such representations
and warranties) as of the closing date (other than those representations and warranties that address matters only as of a
particular date, which need only be true and correct as of such date), except to the extent that any failures of such
representations and warranties to be so true and correct, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect; 

• the representations and warranties of the other party relating to corporate organization, the authority with respect to the
execution, delivery, and performance of the merger agreement and the due and valid authorization and enforceability of the
merger agreement, the fees payable to a financial advisor, broker or finder in connection with the transactions under the

that has had, or would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on the
other party; 

• with respect to BioCryst's and Holdco's obligations, BioCryst's receipt of an opinion from Skadden to the effect that the
BioCryst merger will qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code or, alternatively, the
mergers together will be treated as an "exchange" described in Section 351 of the Code; and 

• with respect to Idera's obligation, receipt of an opinion from Latham to the effect that the mergers will together be treated
as an "exchange" described in Section 351 of the Code.

Termination of the Merger Agreement 

        The merger agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the effective time of the mergers, even after the receipt of the required
stockholder approvals, under the following circumstances:

• by mutual written consent of BioCryst and Idera; 

• by either BioCryst or Idera: 

• if any law or final and non-appealable order is promulgated, entered, enforced, enacted or issued or deemed
applicable to the mergers by any governmental entity of competent jurisdiction which permanently prohibits,
restrains or makes illegal the consummation of the mergers; except that the right to terminate the merger agreement
under the provision described in this bullet will not be available to any party whose failure to perform any of its
obligations under the merger agreement is the principal cause of the enactment or issuance of such law or order; 

• if the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement are not consummated by July 21, 2018, except if, as of
July 21, 2018, all the conditions to closing have been satisfied or waived other than the conditions related to the
receipt of antitrust approvals, the termination date will be automatically extended to October 21, 2018 (such date,
including any such permitted extension thereof, the "outside date"); provided that the right to terminate the merger
agreement under the provision described in this bullet will not be available to any party whose failure to perform
any of its obligations under the merger agreement is the principal cause of the failure of the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement to be consummated by such time; 

• if the BioCryst stockholders fail to approve the adoption of the merger agreement at the BioCryst special meeting;
provided that the right to terminate the merger agreement under the provisions described in this bullet will not be
available to BioCryst if BioCryst's failure to perform any of its obligations under the merger agreement is the
principal cause of the failure to obtain the approval of the BioCryst stockholders; or

that the right to terminate the merger agreement under the provisions described in this bullet will not be available to
Idera if Idera's failure to perform any of its obligations under the merger agreement is the principal cause of the
failure to obtain the approval of the Idera stockholders; 

• by Idera:

• if the Idera board makes an Idera Adverse Recommendation Change.

        In the event of a valid termination of the merger agreement, written notice will be given by the terminating party to the other party
specifying the provision pursuant to which such termination is made. In the event of a valid termination of the merger agreement, the
merger agreement will be terminated and will become void and have no effect, without any liability or obligation on the part of any party,
except that certain provisions regarding the termination fee and other general matters will survive such termination and nothing in the
merger agreement will relieve any party from liabilities or damages incurred or suffered as a result of any willful and material breach by
such party of any of its respective representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements set forth in the merger agreement. The
termination of the merger agreement will not affect the obligations of the parties contained in the confidentiality agreement between
BioCryst and Idera.

Expenses and Termination Fees; Liability for Breach 

        Each party shall pay all fees and expenses incurred by it in connection with the mergers and the other transactions contemplated by
the merger agreement, provided, however that the parties will share equally all fees and expenses in relation to the printing and mailing of
this joint proxy statement/prospectus, all SEC filing fees relating to the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and any fees in
connection with the approval of the mergers pursuant to any antitrust or competition law.

        BioCryst will be obligated to pay a termination fee of $25 million to Idera if:

agreement at the BioCryst special meeting, (B) BioCryst has breached or failed to perform any of its representations,
warranties or covenants set forth in the merger agreement, which breach or failure to perform (1) is incapable of being
cured by BioCryst by the outside date, or is not cured by BioCryst by the earlier of (x) 20 business days following delivery

Amendments, Extensions and Waivers 

        The merger agreement may be amended, modified or supplemented by the parties at any time before or after the receipt of the
approvals of the BioCryst stockholders or Idera stockholders required to consummate the mergers.

        At any time prior to the effective time of the mergers, any party may (i) extend the time for performance of any obligations or other
acts of the other party, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other party contained in the merger
agreement and (iii) waive compliance by the other party with any of the agreements or conditions contained in the merger agreement.

        Notwithstanding the foregoing, after approval of the merger agreement by the BioCryst stockholders and/or Idera stockholders, there
may not be, without further approval of such stockholders, any amendment or waiver for which applicable law requires further stockholder
approval.

Parties in Interest 

        Nothing in the merger agreement, express or implied, confers upon any person other than the parties (and their respective successors
and permitted assigns) any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of the merger agreement, except that for
six years from the effective time of the mergers, the combined company will indemnify each present (as of the effective time of the
mergers) and former director and officer of BioCryst, Idera and any of their subsidiaries (in each case, when acting in such capacity)
against all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, judgments, inquiries, fines and reasonable fees, costs and expenses incurred in connection
with any action pertaining to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the effective time of the mergers, including in connection with the
merger agreement.

        For additional information regarding indemnification of directors and officers, see the section entitled "The Merger Agreement—
Other Covenants and Agreements" beginning on page 130 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

Specific Performance 

        BioCryst and Idera have agreed in the merger agreement that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions
of the merger agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. To that end, the parties
agreed that each will be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent actual or threatened breaches of the merger agreement and
to enforce specifically the performance of terms and provisions of the merger agreement. The parties further waive the defense of
adequacy of remedies at law and any requirement under law to post a bond or other security as a prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief.

U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGERS 

        The following is a general discussion of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the mergers to U.S. holders of BioCryst
common stock and Idera common stock.

        This discussion is based on the Code, applicable Treasury regulations, administrative interpretations and court decisions, each as in
effect as of the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus and all of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. Any
such change could affect the validity of this discussion. This discussion addresses only holders of BioCryst common stock or Idera
common stock who hold their stock as a capital asset within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for
investment). This discussion does not address any non-income taxes or any foreign, state or local tax consequences of the mergers. This
discussion does not address all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to holders of BioCryst common stock or Idera
common stock in light of their particular circumstances, including any tax consequences arising under the unearned income Medicare
contribution tax pursuant to the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or to holders subject to special rules, including,
without limitation:

• persons subject to the alternative minimum tax; 

• tax-exempt and governmental organizations; 

• banks, insurance companies and other financial institutions; 

• brokers or dealers in securities; 

• regulated investment companies and real estate investment trusts; 

• persons who hold BioCryst common stock or Idera common stock as part of a hedging or conversion transaction or as part
of a short-sale or straddle; 

• certain U.S. expatriates and former citizens or long-term residents of the United States; 

• persons whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar; 

• partnerships or other pass-through entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes (and investors therein); and 

• persons who acquired BioCryst common stock or Idera common stock pursuant to the exercise of options or otherwise as
compensation.

        For purposes of this discussion, a "U.S. holder" is a beneficial owner of BioCryst common stock or Idera common stock that is:

• an individual citizen or resident of the United States; 

• a corporation (or any other entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) created or organized in or
under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia; 

• an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or 

• a trust (i) that is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and all the substantial decisions of
which are controlled by one or more U.S. persons or (ii) that has a valid election in effect under applicable U.S. Treasury
regulations to be treated as a U.S. person.

        If a partnership (or an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) holds BioCryst common
stock or Idera common stock, the tax treatment of a partner will generally depend on the status of the partner and the activities of the
partnership. Partners of

partnerships holding BioCryst common stock or Idera common stock should consult their own tax advisors.

        THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION DOES NOT PURPORT TO BE A COMPLETE ANALYSIS OR DISCUSSION OF ALL
OF THE POTENTIAL TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGERS. PLEASE CONSULT YOUR OWN TAX ADVISORS AS
TO THE SPECIFIC TAX CONSEQUENCES TO YOU OF THE MERGERS, INCLUDING TAX RETURN REPORTING
REQUIREMENTS AND THE APPLICABILITY AND EFFECT OF U.S. FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL AND FOREIGN
INCOME AND OTHER TAX LAWS IN LIGHT OF YOUR PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES.

General 

        It is a condition to BioCryst's obligation to complete the BioCryst merger that BioCryst receive an opinion from Skadden, dated as of
the closing date, to the effect that the BioCryst merger will qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code
or, alternatively, the mergers together will be treated as an "exchange" described in Section 351 of the Code. It is a condition to Idera's
obligation to complete the Idera merger that Idera receive an opinion from Latham, dated as of the closing date, to the effect that the
mergers together will be treated as an "exchange" described in Section 351 of the Code.

        These opinions will be based on customary assumptions and representations from BioCryst and Idera, as well as certain covenants
and undertakings by Holdco, BioCryst, Idera, Merger Sub A and Merger Sub B. If any of the assumptions, representations, covenants or
undertakings is incorrect, incomplete or inaccurate or is violated, the validity of the opinions described above may be affected and the tax
consequences of the mergers could differ, perhaps substantially, from those described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

        An opinion of counsel represents counsel's best legal judgment but is not binding on the IRS or any court, so there can be no certainty
that the IRS will not challenge the conclusions reflected in the opinion or that a court would not sustain such a challenge. Neither BioCryst
nor Idera intends to obtain a ruling from the IRS regarding the qualification of the BioCryst merger as a "reorganization" within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code nor of the treatment of the mergers together as an "exchange" described in Section 351 of the Code.
If the IRS were to successfully challenge the treatment of the mergers describe above, the tax consequences could differ, perhaps
substantially, from those described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus. The following discussion assumes the receipt and accuracy of
the opinions described above.

U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Mergers to U.S. Holders of BioCryst Common Stock and Idera Common Stock 

Exchange of BioCryst Common Stock and Idera Common Stock for Holdco Common Stock

        Subject to the discussion below relating to the receipt of cash in lieu of fractional shares, a U.S. holder of BioCryst common stock or
Idera common stock that receives shares of Holdco common stock in the mergers:

• will not recognize any gain or loss upon the exchange of shares of BioCryst common stock or Idera common stock for
shares of Holdco common stock in the BioCryst merger or the Idera merger, respectively; 

• will have a tax basis in the shares of Holdco common stock received in the BioCryst merger or the Idera merger (including
fractional shares for which cash is received) equal to the tax basis of the shares of BioCryst common stock or Idera
common stock, respectively, surrendered in exchange therefor; and

Table of Contents

• will have a holding period for shares of Holdco common stock received in the BioCryst merger or the Idera merger
(including fractional shares for which cash is received) that includes its holding period for its shares of BioCryst common
stock or Idera common stock, respectively, surrendered in exchange therefor.

Cash in Lieu of Fractional Shares

        No fractional shares of Holdco common stock will be distributed to stockholders of BioCryst or Idera in connection with the mergers.
A U.S. holder that receives cash in lieu of fractional shares of Holdco common stock as a part of the mergers will generally recognize
capital gain or loss measured by the difference between the cash received for such fractional shares and the portion of the U.S. holder's tax
basis in the shares of BioCryst common stock or Idera common stock allocable to the fractional shares. Such capital gain or loss will
generally be long term capital gain or loss if the holding period for such fractional shares of Holdco common stock is more than one year.
Long term capital gain of certain non-corporate taxpayers, including individuals, is generally taxed at preferential rates. The deductibility
of capital losses is subject to limitations.

        U.S. holders that acquired different blocks of BioCryst common stock or Idera common stock at different times or different prices
should consult their tax advisor regarding the manner in which gain or loss should be determined in their specific circumstances.

Information Reporting and Backup Withholding 

        Certain U.S. holders of BioCryst common stock or Idera common stock may be subject to information reporting and backup
withholding of U.S. federal income tax with respect to any cash received in lieu of fractional shares of Holdco common stock pursuant to
the mergers. Backup withholding will not apply, however, to a U.S. holder that furnishes a correct taxpayer identification number and
certifies that it is not subject to backup withholding on IRS Form W-9 or is otherwise exempt from backup withholding and provides proof
of the applicable exemption. Backup withholding is not an additional tax and any amounts withheld will be allowed as a refund or credit
against the U.S. holder's U.S. federal income tax liability, if any, provided that such U.S. holder timely furnishes the required information
to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service.

ACCOUNTING TREATMENT 

        Holdco prepares its financial statements in accordance with GAAP. The mergers will be accounted for using the acquisition method
of accounting with Idera being considered the acquirer of BioCryst for accounting purposes. This means that Idera will allocate the
purchase price to the fair value of BioCryst tangible and intangible assets and liabilities at the acquisition date, with the excess purchase
price being recorded as goodwill. Under the acquisition method of accounting, goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at
least annually.

        Although the business combination of Idera and BioCryst is a "merger of equals," GAAP requires that one of the two companies in
the merger be designated as the acquirer for accounting purposes based on the evidence available. Based on a comprehensive review of the
requirements of ASC 805, Business Combinations, management of Idera and BioCryst concluded that Idera is the accounting acquirer
based on a number of factors, including (i) the composition of management of Holdco, including the current chief executive officer of
Idera who will be the chief executive officer of Holdco, as well as the designation of other Idera personnel in senior management positions
of Holdco (the most determinative factor in the analysis), and (ii) the Holdco Board will be evenly split between former directors of Idera
and BioCryst, with no such director having the ability to cast a tie breaking vote. As a result, the historical financial statements of Idera
will become the historical financial statements of the combined company.

Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements 

        The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements give effect to the mergers and was prepared in
accordance with the regulations of the SEC. Based on a comprehensive review of the requirements of ASC 805, Business Combinations,
management concluded that Idera is the accounting acquirer based on a number of factors, including (i) the composition of management of
Holdco, including the current chief executive officer of Idera who will be the chief executive officer of Holdco, as well as the designation
of other Idera personnel in senior management positions of Holdco (the most determinative factor in the analysis), and (ii) the Holdco
Board will be evenly split between former directors of Idera and BioCryst, with no such director having the ability to cast a tie breaking
vote. As a result, the historical financial statements of Idera will become the historical financial statements of the combined company.

        The mergers are considered a business combination and therefore will be accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting
under GAAP. Under the acquisition method of accounting for purposes of these unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial
statements, management of Idera and BioCryst have determined a preliminary estimated purchase price, calculated as described in Note 2
to these unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements. The BioCryst assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection
with the mergers are recorded at their estimated acquisition date fair values. A final determination of these estimated fair values will be
based on the actual net assets of BioCryst that exist as of the date of completion of the mergers.

        The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as of March 31, 2018 assumes that the closing of the mergers took place
on March 31, 2018 and combines the historical balance sheets of Idera and BioCryst as of such date. The unaudited pro forma condensed
combined statement of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and the year ended December 31, 2017 assumes that the
closing of the mergers took place as of January 1, 2017, the beginning of the earliest period presented, and combines the historical results
of Idera and BioCryst for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and the year ended December 31, 2017, respectively. The historical
financial statements of Idera and BioCryst, which are included elsewhere in this joint proxy statement/prospectus have been adjusted to
give pro forma effect to events that are (i) directly attributable to the mergers, (ii) factually supportable, and (iii) with respect to the
statements of operations, expected to have a continuing impact on the combined results.

        The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements are based on the assumptions and adjustments that are described
in the accompanying notes. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements and pro forma adjustments have been
prepared based on preliminary estimates of fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Differences between these preliminary
estimates and the final acquisition accounting will occur and these differences could have a material impact on the accompanying
unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements and the continuing company's future results of operations and financial
position. The actual amounts recorded as of the completion of the mergers may differ materially from the information presented in these
unaudited pro forma combined financial statements as a result of the amount of cash used for BioCryst operations prior to the closing of
the mergers, changes in the fair value of a share of BioCryst common stock, the timing of the closing of the mergers, and other changes in
BioCryst assets and liabilities that occur prior to the completion of the mergers.

        The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements do not give effect to the potential impact of current financial
conditions, regulatory matters, operating efficiencies, synergies or other savings or expenses that may be associated with the integration of
the two companies. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements have been prepared for illustrative purposes only
and are not necessarily indicative of the financial position or results of operations in future periods or the results that actually would have
been realized had Idera and BioCryst been a combined company during the specified periods.

        The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements, including the notes thereto, should be read in conjunction with
the separate Idera and BioCryst historical financial statements included elsewhere in this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

Notes to the Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements 

1. Description of Transaction and Basis of Presentation 

Description of Transaction

        On January 21, 2018, the BioCryst board and the Idera board unanimously approved, and BioCryst and Idera have entered into, the
merger agreement with respect to a strategic business combination. Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, (i) Merger Sub A will
merge with and into Idera, with Idera surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of Holdco, and (ii) Merger Sub B will merge with and into
BioCryst, with BioCryst surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of Holdco. Upon completion of the mergers, BioCryst and Idera, and
their respective subsidiaries, shall become wholly owned subsidiaries of Holdco.

        At the effective time of the mergers, (i) each issued and outstanding share of BioCryst common stock will be converted into the right
to receive 0.50 of a newly issued share of Holdco common stock, (ii) each issued and outstanding share of Idera common stock will be
converted into the right to receive 0.20 of a newly issued share of Holdco common stock and (iii) each issued and outstanding share of
Idera preferred stock will be converted into the right to receive an amount of Holdco common stock based on its liquidation preference.
The exchange ratios will not be adjusted for changes in the market price or number of shares outstanding of either Idera common stock or
BioCryst common stock between the date of signing the merger agreement and completion of the mergers.

        Upon closing of the mergers, BioCryst stockholders (including holders of securities convertible, exchangeable or exercisable for
shares of BioCryst common stock) will beneficially own approximately 51.6% of Holdco, and Idera stockholders (including holders of
securities convertible, exchangeable or exercisable for shares of Idera common stock) immediately prior to the effective time of the
mergers will beneficially own 48.4% of Holdco, each calculated on a fully diluted basis using the treasury stock method. Upon closing of
the mergers, the name of the combined company will become Valenscion Incorporated and shares of the combined company are expected
to continue trading on the Nasdaq.

        In addition, as of the effective time of the mergers, each BioCryst stock option that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior
to the effective time of the mergers, whether or not then vested or exercisable, will vest in full and be assumed by Holdco and converted
into a Holdco stock option based on the BioCryst exchange ratio (0.50). Each converted Holdco stock option will be subject to the same
terms and conditions (other than vesting) as applied to the original BioCryst stock option immediately prior to the effective time of the
mergers, except that it will be exercisable for that number of whole shares of Holdco common stock (rounded down to the nearest whole
share) equal to the number of shares subject to the BioCryst stock option multiplied by the BioCryst exchange ratio, at an exercise price
per share (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to the exercise price per share applicable to the BioCryst stock option divided by
the BioCryst exchange ratio. This treatment will be subject to certain provisions of the Code, as described in the merger agreement.
Additionally, each BioCryst RSU that is outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the mergers will be assumed by Holdco and
will vest in full and be converted into a Holdco RSU based on the BioCryst exchange ratio. Each converted Holdco RSU will be subject to
the same terms and conditions as applied to the original BioCryst RSU immediately prior to the effective time of the mergers.

        As of the effective time of the mergers, each Idera stock option that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the effective
time of the mergers, whether or not then vested or exercisable, will be assumed by Holdco and converted into a Holdco stock option based
on the Idera exchange ratio (0.20). In addition, each such stock option will vest in full, other than Idera stock options held by an individual
who is a party to a Severance and Change of Control Agreement. Each converted Holdco stock option will be subject to the same terms
and conditions (other than, in the case described above, vesting) as applied to the original Idera stock option immediately prior to the
effective

time of the mergers, except that it will be exercisable for that number of whole shares of Holdco common stock (rounded down to the
nearest whole share) equal to the number of shares subject to the Idera stock option multiplied by the Idera exchange ratio, at an exercise
price per share (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to the exercise price per share applicable to the Idera stock option divided by
the Idera exchange ratio. This treatment will be subject to certain provisions of the Code, as described in the merger agreement.

Basis of Presentation

        The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements use the historical financial statements of Idera and BioCryst,
which are prepared in accordance with GAAP, and include pro forma adjustments to present the pro forma financial position and results of
operations of the combined company pursuant to the rules and regulations of Article 11 of Regulation S-X of the SEC. The historical
financial statements of Idera and BioCryst have only been adjusted to show pro forma effects that are (i) directly attributable to the
mergers, (ii) factually supportable, and (iii) with respect to the statements of operations, expected to have a continuing impact on the
combined results.

        The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as of March 31, 2018 is presented as if the mergers had been completed
on March 31, 2018. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2018
and for the year ended December 31, 2017 assumes that the mergers took place as of January 1, 2017, the beginning of the earliest period
presented and combines the historical results of Idera and BioCryst for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and for the year ended
December 31, 2017, respectively. Based on the terms of the mergers, Idera has been determined to be the acquiring company for
accounting purposes and the mergers will be accounted for as a business combination in accordance with GAAP. Accordingly, the assets
and liabilities of Idera will be reported as of the closing date of the mergers at their respective historical carrying values and the acquired
net assets of BioCryst will be recorded as of the closing date of mergers at their fair values. For the purpose of these unaudited pro forma
condensed combined financial statements, management of Idera and BioCryst have determined a preliminary estimated purchase price for
the business combination, and such amount has been calculated as described in Note 2 to these unaudited pro forma condensed combined
financial statements. The net assets acquired in connection with the mergers are at their estimated fair values. A final determination of
these estimated fair values will be based on the actual net acquired assets of BioCryst as of the closing date of the mergers.

2. Preliminary Purchase Price 

        The estimated preliminary purchase price, which represents the consideration transferred to BioCryst equity holders in the mergers, is
calculated based on the number of shares of Holdco common stock that BioCryst equity holders will own as of the closing of the mergers,
as well as a portion of BioCryst equity awards that will be exchanged for Holdco equity awards. The accompanying unaudited pro forma
condensed combined financial statements reflect an estimated purchase price of approximately $484 million, which consists of the
following (in thousands except for per share amounts):

Estimated fair value of BioCryst shares issued and outstanding(1)  $ 463,969 
Estimated fair value of BioCryst stock options and RSUs(2)   20,300 
Total preliminary estimated purchase price  $ 484,269 

(1) The estimated fair value of BioCryst shares issued and outstanding was based upon the estimated fair value of
Holdco common stock of $9.40 per share as of May 4, 2018, which was determined by dividing the aggregate
market capitalization of Idera and BioCryst by

liabilities of BioCryst are recorded based on their estimated fair values as of the closing date of the mergers. The excess of the
consideration paid over the estimated fair values of net assets acquired will be recorded as goodwill on the unaudited condensed combined
consolidated balance sheet.

        The preliminary purchase price to acquire BioCryst is based on the estimated fair value of Holdco common stock, as of May 4, 2018.
The preliminary purchase price was allocated among the assets

148

the aggregate number of fully diluted shares outstanding as of such date, taking into account the Idera and
BioCryst exchange ratios.

(2) The estimated fair value of BioCryst options and BioCryst RSUs includes the fair value of both vested
BioCryst options and BioCryst RSUs and the portion of the fair value of unvested BioCryst options and
BioCryst RSUs that relates to the precombination service period. The estimated fair value of BioCryst options
were determined using the Black Scholes option pricing model, and the estimated fair value of BioCryst RSUs
was estimated using the estimated market price of Holdco common stock of $9.40 as of May 4, 2018.

The actual number of Holdco shares of common stock issued to BioCryst stockholders upon the completion of the
mergers will be based on the actual number of shares of BioCryst common stock issued and outstanding when the
mergers close, and the valuation of those shares will be based on the per share price of Holdco common stock at that
time. Likewise, the number of BioCryst options and BioCryst RSUs that will be converted into Holdco options and
Holdco RSUs upon completion of the mergers will be based on the actual number of awards that are outstanding
when the mergers close, and the valuation of these awards will also utilize the estimated per share price of Holdco
common stock at that time. Accordingly, the total purchase price for the mergers could differ from the amount in the
unaudited proforma condensed combined financial statements, and that difference could be material. A 10% increase
(decrease) to the Holdco common stock price would increase (decrease) the purchase price by $49.5 million, with a
corresponding change to goodwill. Therefore, the estimated consideration expected to be transferred reflected in these
unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements does not purport to represent what the actual
consideration transferred will be when the mergers are completed.

acquired and liabilities assumed using BioCryst's balance sheet as of March 31, 2018 as follows (in thousands):

        The fair value estimates are preliminary because the mergers have not yet been completed. Identifiable intangible assets are required
to be measured at fair value and these acquired assets could include assets that are not intended to be used or sold or that are intended to be
used in a manner other than their highest and best use. For purposes of these unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial
statements, the combined company assumed that all assets will be used in a manner that represents the highest and best use of those assets.

        Identifiable intangible assets acquired include the following in-process research and development:

        The estimated fair value of the acquired intangible assets are based on a preliminary valuation as of March 31, 2018. The fair value of
the "Peramivir Product Rights" was determined using the income approach, including the application of probability factors related to the
likelihood of success of entry into various territories. The estimated useful life of the Peramivir Product Rights is seven years for purposes
of recognizing amortization expense. The fair value of the acquired in-process research and development represents the estimated fair
value of BioCryst's research and development pipeline. Management of Idera and BioCryst estimated the fair value of in-process research
and development projects using the multi-period excess earnings method which is a variation of the income approach. It

also took into consideration information and certain program-related documents and forecasts prepared by management.

        The fair value of in-process research and development is capitalized as of the acquisition date and is subsequently accounted for as
indefinite-lived intangible assets until completion or abandonment of the associated research and development efforts. Accordingly, during
the development period after the completion of the mergers, these assets will not be amortized into earnings; instead, these assets will be
subject to periodic impairment testing. Upon successful completion of the development process for an acquired in-process research and
development project, determination as to the useful life of the asset will be made. The asset would then be considered a finite-lived
intangible asset and amortization of the asset into earnings would begin over the remaining estimated useful life of the asset.

        Goodwill represents the excess of the preliminary acquisition consideration over the estimated fair values of net assets acquired.
Goodwill will not be amortized but will be tested for impairment at least annually or whenever certain indicators of impairment are
present. In the future, if it is determined that goodwill is impaired, an impairment charge would be recorded at that time. Qualitative
factors supporting the recognition of goodwill due to the mergers include the combined company's anticipated enhanced ability to secure
additional capital, gain operational synergies, and the potential value created by having a more robust clinical development portfolio. The
goodwill is not expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.

        The final determination of the fair value estimates is anticipated to be completed as soon as practicable after completion of the
mergers and will be based on the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the closing date of the mergers. The final
amounts recorded for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed could differ significantly from the amounts presented in the unaudited pro
forma condensed combined financial statements.

3. Pro Forma Adjustments 

        The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements include pro forma adjustments to the historical financial
statements of Idera and BioCryst that are (i) directly attributable to the mergers, (ii) factually supportable, and (iii) with respect to the
unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations, expected to have a continuing impact on the results of operations of
the combined company.

        Based on Idera's management's review of BioCryst's summary of significant accounting policies, the nature and amount of any
adjustments to the historical financial statements of BioCryst to conform to the accounting policies of Idera are not expected to be
significant.

awards. This amount is excluded from the unaudited pro-forma condensed combined statements of operations because it is a
charge directly attributable to the mergers that will not have a continuing impact on the combined company's operations; however,

SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS OF IDERA 

        The following table sets forth, as of April 30, 2018, certain information regarding the beneficial ownership of Idera common stock
by:

• each person or entity, including any "group" as that term is used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act, who is known to
own beneficially more than 5% of the issued and outstanding shares of Idera common stock; 

• each current director of Idera; 

• each of the Named Executive Officers of Idera; and 

• all directors and executive officers of Idera as a group.

        Beneficial ownership is determined in accordance with the SEC's rules. The SEC has defined "beneficial ownership" of a security to
mean the possession, directly or indirectly, of voting power and/or investment power. In computing percentage ownership of each person,
shares of common stock subject to options, warrants or rights held by that person that are currently exercisable, or exercisable within
60 days of April 30, 2018, are deemed to be outstanding and beneficially owned by that person. These shares, however, are not deemed
outstanding for the purpose of computing the percentage ownership of any other person.

        To Idera's knowledge and except as indicated in the notes to this table and pursuant to applicable community property laws, each
stockholder named in the table has sole voting and investment power with respect to the shares set forth opposite such stockholder's name.
Percentage of ownership is based on 217,310,991 shares of Idera common stock issued and outstanding on April 30, 2018. All fractional
common share amounts have been rounded to the nearest whole number.

DESCRIPTION OF HOLDCO CAPITAL STOCK 

        This section of this joint proxy statement/prospectus summarizes the material terms of Holdco's capital stock that will be in effect if
the mergers are completed and is not complete. You are encouraged to read (1) the Holdco charter, which is attached as Annex D to this
joint proxy statement/prospectus and is incorporated herein by reference, (2) the Holdco bylaws, which will be in effect as of the effective
time of the mergers and a form of which is included as Annex E to this joint proxy statement/prospectus and is incorporated herein by
reference and (3) the applicable provisions of the DGCL. The following summary should be read in conjunction with the section entitled
"Comparison of Rights of Idera Stockholders, BioCryst Stockholders and Holdco Stockholders" beginning on page 164 of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus.

        After giving effect to the Holdco charter, Holdco's authorized capital stock will consist of shares made up of:

• 380,000,000 shares of Holdco common stock, par value $0.01 per share; and 

• 20,000,000 shares of Holdco preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share, the rights and preferences of which may be
established from time to time by the Holdco board.

        At the effective time of the mergers, each issued and outstanding share of Idera common stock (other than shares held by Idera,
BioCryst, Holdco, Merger Sub A or Merger Sub B, or any subsidiary of each of the aforementioned entities, or by Idera as treasury shares,
which will be canceled and retired and cease to exist) will be converted into the right to receive 0.20 fully paid and nonassessable shares of
Holdco common stock (plus cash in lieu of fractional shares).

        At the effective time of the mergers, each issued and outstanding share of Idera preferred stock (other than shares held by Idera,
BioCryst, Holdco, Merger Sub A or Merger Sub B, or any subsidiary of each of the aforementioned entities, or by Idera as treasury shares,
which will be canceled and retired and cease to exist) will be converted into the right to receive a number of fully paid and nonassessable
shares of Holdco common stock equal to (i) $1.00 divided by the 20-trading-day average trading price of Idera common stock, ending with
the trading day prior to the third day prior to the closing date, multiplied by (ii) 0.20 (plus cash in lieu of fractional shares).

        At the effective time of the mergers, each issued and outstanding share of BioCryst common stock (other than shares held by Idera,
BioCryst, Holdco, Merger Sub A or Merger Sub B, or any subsidiary of each of the aforementioned entities, or by BioCryst as treasury
shares, which will be canceled and retired and cease to exist) will be converted into the right to receive 0.50 fully paid and nonassessable
shares of Holdco common stock (plus cash paid in lieu of fractional shares).

        We expect a total of approximately 52.8 million Holdco shares to be issued to Idera stockholders and 56.5 million Holdco shares to be
issued to BioCryst stockholders in connection with the mergers. We expect that, immediately following the consummation of the mergers,
there will be a total of approximately 109.3 million Holdco shares outstanding.

Description of Holdco Common Stock 

Dividends

        Subject to the rights, if any, of holders of any series of outstanding preferred stock, if and when issued and subject to applicable law,
holders of Holdco common stock will be entitled to receive dividends when, as and if declared by the Holdco board out of funds legally
available for payment.

Table of Contents

Voting Rights

        Subject to the rights, if any, of the holders of any series of preferred stock if and when issued and subject to applicable law, each
holder of Holdco common stock will be entitled to one vote per share and all voting rights will be vested in the Holdco common stock.
Holders of shares of Holdco common stock will have noncumulative voting rights, which means that the holders of more than 50% of the
shares voting for the election of directors can elect 100% of the directors and the holders of the remaining shares will not be able to elect
any directors.

Liquidation Rights

        Subject to the rights, if any, of holders of any series of outstanding preferred stock, if and when issued and subject to applicable law,
in the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of Holdco, whether voluntary or involuntary, the holders of shares
of Holdco common stock shall have equal rights to receive the assets and funds of Holdco available for distribution to Holdco stockholders
and such assets or funds shall be distributed pro rata in accordance with the number of shares of Holdco common stock held by each such
holder.

Preemptive Rights

        The shares of Holdco common stock to be issued at the effective time of the mergers will be validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable. Holders of shares of Holdco common stock will not be entitled to preemptive rights. Shares of Holdco common stock will
not be convertible into shares of any other class of capital stock.

Description of Holdco Blank Check Preferred Stock 

        Under the Holdco charter, without further Holdco stockholder action, the Holdco board is authorized to provide for the issuance of
preferred stock in one or more series, the shares of each of which series may have such voting powers, full or limited, or no voting powers,
and such designations, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights, and qualifications, limitations or restrictions
thereof, as shall be permitted under the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, such shares may provide that such series
shall be superior or rank equally or be junior to the preferred stock of other series to the extent permitted by law.

Anti-Takeover Provisions 

General

        Some provisions of DGCL, the Holdco charter and the Holdco bylaws could discourage or make it more difficult to acquire control of
the combined company by means of a tender offer, open market purchases, a proxy contest or otherwise. A description of these provisions
is set forth below.

Meetings and Elections of Directors

        The Holdco bylaws provide that special meetings of stockholders may be called only by the Holdco board or secretary of Holdco
pursuant to a resolution adopted by the board of directors. The Holdco charter prohibits stockholders from calling special meetings.

        The Holdco charter provides that Holdco stockholders cannot act by written consent in lieu of a meeting; provided, however, that any
action required or permitted to be taken by the holders of any series of preferred stock, voting separately as a series or separately as a class
with one or more other such series, may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, to the extent expressly so
provided by the applicable certificate of designation for such series of preferred stock.

Table of Contents

        The Holdco charter and the Holdco bylaws provide that any vacancies in the Holdco board, however occurring, shall be filled by an
affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining directors then in office, even if less than a quorum, or by the sole remaining director, and
shall not be filled by Holdco stockholders.

No Cumulative Voting

        The Holdco charter does not grant stockholders the right to vote cumulatively.

Advance Notice Procedure

        The Holdco bylaws provide an advance notice procedure for stockholders to nominate director candidates for election or to bring

COMPARISON OF RIGHTS OF IDERA STOCKHOLDERS,
BIOCRYST STOCKHOLDERS AND HOLDCO STOCKHOLDERS 

        Both Idera and BioCryst and are incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware and, accordingly, the rights of the Idera
stockholders and BioCryst stockholders are currently governed by the DGCL. Holdco will continue to be a Delaware corporation
following completion of the mergers and will be governed by the DGCL.

        Upon completion of the mergers, the Idera stockholders and the BioCryst stockholders will become Holdco stockholders, and the
current certificate of incorporation of Holdco will be amended and restated as of the effective time of the mergers in substantially the form
attached as Annex D to this joint proxy statement/prospectus. The current bylaws of Holdco will be amended and restated at the effective
time of the mergers in substantially the form of the Holdco bylaws attached as Annex E to this joint proxy statement/prospectus. Following
the mergers, the rights of the former Idera stockholders and the former BioCryst stockholders will thereafter be governed by the DGCL
and by the Holdco charter and the Holdco bylaws.

        The following description summarizes the expected material differences between the rights of the Idera stockholders, BioCryst
stockholders and Holdco stockholders, but is not a complete statement of all those differences, or a complete description of the specific
provisions referred to in this summary. Stockholders should read carefully the relevant provisions of the DGCL and the respective
certificates of incorporation and bylaws of Idera, BioCryst and Holdco. For more information on how to obtain the documents that are not
attached to this joint proxy statement/prospectus, see "Where You Can Find More Information" beginning on page 172 of this joint proxy

        2.3    Certain Adjustments.     Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if, from the date of this Agreement until
the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Boat Common Stock, Island Common Stock or Island Preferred Stock shall have been
changed into a different number of shares or a different class by reason of any reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split),
recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares, readjustment, or other similar transaction, or a stock dividend or stock
distribution thereon shall be declared with a record date within said period, the applicable Island Merger Consideration, the Island
Exchange Ratio and the Boat Exchange Ratio and the Boat Merger Consideration and any other similarly dependent items, as the case may
be, shall be equitably adjusted to provide the holders of Island Common Stock, Island Preferred Stock or Boat Common Stock, as
applicable, the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.

        2.4    Fractional Shares.     

        (a)   No fractional shares of Holdco Common Stock or shall be issued in the Mergers, but in lieu thereof each holder of Island
Common Stock, Island Preferred Stock or Boat Common Stock otherwise entitled to a fractional share of Holdco Common Stock
will be entitled to receive, from the Exchange Agent in accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.4, a cash payment in lieu
of such fractional share of Holdco Common Stock representing such holder's proportionate interest, if any, in the proceeds from the
sale by the Exchange Agent (reduced by any fees of the Exchange Agent attributable to such sale) in one or more transactions of
shares of Holdco Common Stock equal to the excess of (A) the aggregate number of shares of Holdco Common Stock to be
delivered to the Exchange Agent by Holdco pursuant to Section 2.5(a) over (B) the aggregate number of whole shares of Holdco
Common Stock to be distributed to the holders of shares of Island Common Stock, Island Preferred Stock or Boat Common Stock
pursuant to Section 2.5(b) (such excess, the "Excess Shares"). Island, Boat and Holdco acknowledge that payment of the cash
consideration in lieu of issuing fractional shares of Holdco Common Stock was not separately bargained-for consideration but
merely represents a mechanical rounding off for purposes of avoiding the expense and inconvenience to Holdco that would
otherwise be caused by the issuance of fractional shares of Holdco Common Stock. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time,
the Exchange Agent, as agent for the holders of Island Common Stock, Island Preferred Stock and Boat Common Stock that would
otherwise receive fractional shares of Holdco Common Stock, shall sell the Excess Shares at then prevailing prices on the
NASDAQ in the manner provided in the following paragraph.

        (b)   The sale of the Excess Shares by the Exchange Agent, as agent for the holders of Island Common Stock, Island Preferred
Stock and Boat Common Stock that would otherwise receive fractional shares of Holdco Common Stock, shall be executed on the
NASDAQ and shall be executed in round lots to the extent practicable. Until the proceeds of such sale or sales have been
distributed to the holders of Island Common Stock, Island Preferred Stock and Boat Common Stock, the Exchange Agent shall
hold such proceeds in trust for the holders of Island Common Stock, Island Preferred Stock and Boat Common Stock that would
otherwise receive fractional shares of Holdco Common Stock (the "Common Shares Trust"). The Exchange Agent shall determine
the portion of the Common Shares Trust to which each holder of Island Common Stock, Island Preferred Stock or Boat Common
Stock shall be entitled, if any, by multiplying the amount of the aggregate proceeds comprising the Common Shares Trust by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the amount of the fractional share interest to which such holder of Island Common Stock,
Island Preferred Stock or Boat Common Stock would otherwise be entitled and the denominator of which is the aggregate amount
of fractional share interests to which all holders of Island Common Stock, Island Preferred Stock and Boat Common Stock would
otherwise be entitled (the "Fractional Shares Cash Amount").

        (c)   As soon as practicable after the determination of the amount of cash, if any, to be paid to holders of Island Common
Stock in lieu of any fractional shares of Holdco Common Stock, the Exchange Agent shall make available such amounts to such
holders of shares of Island Common Stock without interest, subject to and in accordance with Section 2.5.

        2.5    Exchange of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares.     

        (a)   Prior to the dissemination of the Joint Proxy Statement to the stockholders of Island and the stockholders of Boat, Boat
and Island shall appoint a nationally recognized financial institution or trust company to act as exchange agent (the "Exchange
Agent") for the payment and delivery of the Island Merger Consideration and the Boat Merger Consideration. At or prior to the
Effective Time, Holdco shall (and Boat and Island shall cause Holdco to) deposit, in trust for the benefit of the holders of Island
Common Stock, the holders of Island Preferred Stock and the holders of Boat Common Stock, with the Exchange Agent for
exchange in accordance with this Article 2, a number of shares of Holdco Common Stock equal to the total shares of Holdco
Common Stock issuable pursuant to Section 2.1 (together with the Fractional Shares Cash Amount, the "Exchange Fund"). The
Exchange Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions, deliver the whole shares of Holdco Common Stock contemplated to be
issued pursuant to Section 2.1, the Fractional Shares Cash Amount out of the Exchange Fund. The Exchange Fund shall not be
used for any other purpose.

        (b)    Exchange Procedures.    As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time (but in no event later than three
(3) Business Days thereafter), Holdco shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of an Island Certificate,
Island Book-Entry Share, Boat Certificate or Boat Book-Entry Share, in each case which shares were converted into the right to
receive the applicable Island Merger Consideration or Boat Merger Consideration at the Effective Time pursuant to this
Agreement: (i) a letter of transmittal, which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Island
Certificates and Boat Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Island Certificates and Boat Certificates to the Exchange
Agent, and shall otherwise be in such form and have such other provisions as Boat, Island and the Exchange Agent may reasonably
specify, and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of the Island Certificates, Island Book-Entry Shares, Boat Certificates and
Boat Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the applicable Island Merger Consideration or Boat Merger Consideration, as applicable,
and the method of payment of such holder's Fractional Shares Cash Amount. Upon surrender of Island Certificates, Island Book-
Entry Shares, Boat Certificates or Boat Book-Entry Shares for cancellation to the Exchange Agent or to such other agent or agents
as may be appointed by Island and Boat, and upon delivery of a letter of transmittal, duly executed and in proper form with all
required enclosures and attachments, with respect to such Island Certificates, Island Book-Entry Shares, Boat Certificates or Boat
Book-Entry Shares, the holder of such Island Certificates, Island Book-Entry Shares, Boat Certificates or Boat Book-Entry Shares

Merger Consideration, as applicable, to a Person other than the registered holder of the Island Certificate or Boat Certificate so
surrendered and shall have established to the satisfaction of Holdco that such Taxes either have been paid or are not required to be
paid. Delivery of the applicable Island Merger Consideration or Boat Merger Consideration, as applicable, with respect to Island
Book-Entry Shares and Boat Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to the Person in whose name such shares are registered. Until
surrendered as contemplated hereby, each Island Certificate, Island Book-Entry Share, Boat Certificate or Boat Book-Entry Share
shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the applicable Island Merger
Consideration or Boat Merger Considerations provided in this Agreement.

        (c)    Transfer Books.    At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of Island and Boat shall be closed and thereafter there
shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of Island Common Stock or Island Preferred Stock on the records of Island or
shares of Boat Common Stock on the records of Boat. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Island Certificates, Island
Book-Entry Shares, Boat Certificates and Boat Book-Entry Shares representing shares of Island Common Stock, Island Preferred
Stock and Boat Common Stock, as applicable, outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights
with respect to such shares except as otherwise provided for herein or by applicable Law. If, after the Effective Time, Island

entitled to require the Exchange Agent to deliver to it any shares of Holdco Common Stock or cash remaining in the Exchange
Fund made available to the Exchange Agent and not delivered to holders of Island Certificates, Island Book-Entry Shares, Boat
Certificates or Boat Book-Entry Shares and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look only to Holdco (subject to abandoned
property, escheat or other similar Laws) only as general creditors thereof with respect to the applicable Island Merger
Consideration or Boat Merger Consideration, as applicable, payable upon due surrender of their Island Certificates, Island Book-
Entry Shares, Boat Certificates or Boat Book-Entry Shares and compliance with the procedures in Section 2.5. If, prior to six years
after the Closing Date (or otherwise immediately prior to such time on which any payment in respect hereof would escheat to or
become the property of any Governmental Entity pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws), any
holder of Island Certificates, Island Book-Entry Shares, Boat Certificates or Boat Book-Entry Shares has not complied with the
procedures in Section 2.5 to receive the applicable Island Merger Consideration or Boat Merger Consideration to which such
holder would otherwise be entitled, the applicable Island Merger Consideration or Boat Merger Consideration to which such holder
would otherwise be entitled in respect of such Island Certificates, Island Book-Entry Shares, Boat Certificates or Boat Book-Entry
Shares shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Holdco, free and clear of all claims or interest of
any Person previously entitled thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Boat, the Island Surviving Corporation, the Boat
Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, or any Representative or affiliate thereof, shall be liable to any holder of an Island
Certificate, Island Book-Entry Shares, Boat Certificate or Boat Book-Entry Shares for Island Merger Consideration or Boat Merger

Book-Entry Share, Boat Certificate or Boat Book-Entry Share shall surrender such Island Certificate, Island Book-Entry Share,

        (a)   As of the Effective Time, each Island Warrant and each Island Pre-Funded Warrant that is outstanding and unexercised
immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not then exercisable, shall be assumed by Holdco and shall be converted into a
warrant (a "Holdco Warrant") to acquire Holdco Common Stock. Each such Holdco Warrant as so assumed and converted shall
continue to have, and shall be subject to, the same terms and conditions as applied to the Island Warrant or Island Pre-Funded
Warrant, as applicable, immediately prior to the Effective Time except that, as of the Effective Time, each such Holdco Warrant as

Stock (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the exercise price per share of Island

        (b)   Not later than the Closing Date, Holdco shall deliver to the holders of Island Warrants and to the holders of Island Pre-
Funded Warrants any notices required under the terms of the Island Warrants or Island Pre-Funded Warrants, as applicable, in
