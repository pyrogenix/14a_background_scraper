ORCHESTRA-PRÉMAMAN S.A.

October 10, 2017
Dear Fellow Shareholder:

Orchestra-Prémaman S.A. together with the other participants in this solicitation (collectively, "Orchestra" or "we"), is the
largest shareholder of Destination Maternity Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Destination" or the "Company"), beneficially
owning a total of 1,922,820 shares of Common Stock, $.01 par value per share, representing approximately 13.8% of the shares
outstanding. Orchestra has owned shares of Destination continuously since August 2015. We believe Destination possesses attractive
assets, highly-recognizable brands, good but expensive locations, and a talented team of dedicated employees. However, the
Company's stock price has declined precipitously since the current directors took office, and we believe that they are not up to the
challenge of righting Destination's direction.

For the reasons set forth in the attached Proxy Statement—which we urge you to read today—we believe that new directors
are needed to drive the change that is required at Destination to address the Company's decreasing revenue and prolonged stock
underperformance. We further believe that it would be a mistake to reward Michael J. Blitzer, Barry Erdos, Melissa Payner-Gregor
and B. Allen Weinstein (the "Status Quo Nominees") with re-election given their performance and the drop in Destination's stock
price during their tenures, and wonder what search process the Nominating and Governance Committee conducted if it believes that
these are the best qualified candidates for the Company's Board of Directors (the "Board") to recommend to Destination's shareholders.
We believe that a vote against each of the Status Quo Nominees will send a powerful message of shareholder dissatisfaction to the
Board, which can result in resignations and the appointment of new directors who can bring a shareholder-focused mindset to the
boardroom and who can start a turnaround at Destination that is in the best interests of all shareholders.

We are therefore seeking your support to vote AGAINST the re-election of each of the Status Quo Directors—Michael J.
Blitzer, Barry Erdos, Melissa Payner-Gregor and B. Allen Weinstein—as directors at the Company's annual meeting of
shareholders currently scheduled to be held on Thursday October 19, 2015, at 9:15 a.m., Eastern Standard Time, at the corporate
headquarters of the Company located at 232 Strawbridge Drive, Moorestown, New Jersey 08057 (including any adjournments or
postponements thereof and any meeting which may be called in lieu thereof, the "Annual Meeting").  By voting AGAINST the Status
Quo Directors, shareholders will be sending a strong message to the Board that they are dissatisfied with the status quo and that
meaningful change is required.  Our proxy solicitation is a platform for shareholders to express their views regarding Destination and
to influence the Board with respect to any decisions regarding Board composition and accountability at our Company.

Your vote AGAINST the election of the Status Quo Directors will serve as a referendum on their poor stewardship of
shareholder value as measured by the single most important measure of success at a public company—the stock price as determined by
open market trading. YOU have an important opportunity as shareholders to have our voices heard at the upcoming Annual Meeting.

We note that when the number of directors to be elected does not exceed the number of nominees, as is the case here, the
Bylaws of the Company (the "Bylaws") provide that the election of directors at Destination requires the vote of the majority of the
shares present in person, or represented by proxy, at any meeting of the shareholders called for the purpose of the election of directors
at which quorum is present. 



9/1/2019 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/896985/000101359417000730/dmc-defc-101017.htm

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/896985/000101359417000730/dmc-defc-101017.htm 3/35

Importantly, the Company has a director resignation policy in place, whereby any director who receives a greater
number of votes "against" his or her election than votes "for" his or her election must promptly tender his or her resignation
to the Board.  The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee (the "Governance Committee") would then promptly assess the
appropriateness of any such nominee continuing to serve as a director and recommend to the Board the action to be taken with respect
to such tendered resignation. If our proxy solicitation results in any director failing to receive a majority of the votes cast for his or her
election, then we believe it would clearly be inappropriate for any such director to continue to serve on the Board.  We believe
the failure of the Board to accept any such tendered resignations that may result from the Annual Meeting would be an
egregious violation of proper corporate governance, and in direct opposition to a clear shareholder directive.
 

Orchestra believes that our interests are fully aligned with the interests of all Destination shareholders. We believe there is
significant value to be realized at Destination.  Given the Company's continuing track record of decreasing revenue and prolonged
stock underperformance under the oversight of the Status Quo Directors, we strongly believe that the Board must be reconstituted to
ensure that the interests of the shareholders, the true owners of Destination, are appropriately represented in the boardroom, and that
the Board takes the necessary steps to help the Company's shareholders realize maximum value for their investment. The first step on
that pathway is for shareholders to vote against the re-election of the Status Quo Directors who have made Destination what it is today,
instead of improving its stock prices from where it was when they first took office. We note that the Board, not Orchestra, gave you the
power to trigger mandatory resignation letters from each Status Quo Director you vote against and deny re-election. Therefore we call
upon the Status Quo Directors to provide a detailed explanation of the search process for new directors (the "Search Process") they will
conduct if shareholders vote  against the re-election of the Status Quo Directors. Orchestra strongly believes that it would be a
fundamental breach of fiduciary duty and abdication of director responsibility if all the Status Quo Directors were to abandon their
posts—or threaten to do so—without identifying sufficiently qualified replacement directors if you, the shareholders, exercise your
rights to vote against all of the Status Quo Directors.

Orchestra stands ready to engage with the Company to find better qualified replacement directors in the event shareholders
vote not to re-elect any or all of the Status Quo Directors. In Orchestra's opinion, the Company would benefit from the addition of new,
dynamic directors with proven experience and success in:

· E-commerce and digital marketing;

· Cost reduction and proper pricing strategies;

· Optimizing customer relationship management systems;

· Improving floor plan profitability through the introduction of complimentary product offerings; and

· Rationalizing and rebalancing the relationship between revenue and headquarter costs by increasing the former while
responsibly pruning the latter.

We urge you to consider carefully the information contained in the attached proxy statement and then support our efforts by
signing, dating and returning the enclosed BLUE proxy card today. The attached proxy statement and the enclosed BLUE proxy card
are first being furnished to the shareholders on or about October 11, 2017.

If you have already submitted a different color proxy card in relation to the Annual Meeting, you have every right to revoke or
change the voting instructions set out therein by signing, dating and returning a later dated BLUE proxy card or by voting in person at
the Annual Meeting. We urge you to do so immediately, as there is little time before the Annual Meeting.

ANNUAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS

OF

DESTINATION MATERNITY CORPORATION
---------------------------

PROXY STATEMENT
OF

ORCHESTRA-PRÉMAMAN S.A.
---------------------------

PLEASE SIGN, DATE AND MAIL THE ENCLOSED BLUE PROXY CARD TODAY

 Orchestra-Prémaman S.A. together with the other participants in this solicitation (collectively, "Orchestra", "us" or "we"), is
the largest shareholder of Destination Maternity Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Destination" or the "Company"), beneficially
owning a total of 1,922,820 shares of Common Stock, $.01 par value per share, representing approximately 13.8% of the shares
outstanding. Orchestra has owned shares of Destination continuously since August 2015. We are writing to you because we believe that
new directors are needed to drive the change that is required at Destination to address the Company's decreasing revenue and
prolonged stock underperformance and have serious doubts that the current directors nominated for re-election under the Company's
proxy statement—specifically Michael J. Blitzer, Barry Erdos, Melissa Payner-Gregor and B. Allen Weinstein (the "Status Quo
Nominees")—can fully exploit the opportunities that will be available to the Company in both the short- and long-term. We are seeking
your support and your vote at the annual meeting of the shareholders of the Company currently scheduled to be held on Thursday,
October 19, 2015, at 9:15 a.m. Eastern Standard Time, at the Company's corporate headquarters located at 232 Strawbridge Drive,
Moorestown, New Jersey 08057 (including any adjournments or postponements thereof and any meeting which may be called in lieu
thereof, the "Annual Meeting") to vote AGAINST the election of the Status Quo Directors to the Company's Board of Directors (the
"Board").

Our BLUE proxy card will also allow shareholders to vote on the following proposals that are being presented by the
Company for shareholder consideration at the Annual Meeting:

1. to ratify the action of the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors in appointing KPMG LLP ("KPMG") as
independent registered public accountants to audit the consolidated financial statements of the Company and its
subsidiaries for the fiscal year ending February 3, 2018 and the Company's internal control over financial reporting as
of February 3, 2018;

2. to approve an amendment to the Company's 2005 Equity Incentive Plan (as amended and restated, the "2005 Plan")
which would authorize the Company to grant an additional 1,000,000 shares of common stock in respect of awards
under the 2005 Plan, with 625,000 of such additional shares of common stock issuable in respect of awards of
restricted stock or restricted stock units;

3. to hold an advisory vote on executive compensation;

4. to hold an advisory vote on the frequency of executive compensation voting; and

5. to transact such other business as may properly come before the meeting or any adjournments thereof.
 



9/1/2019 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/896985/000101359417000730/dmc-defc-101017.htm

Orchestra is composed of Orchestra-Prémaman S.A., a public limited company organized under the laws of France
("Orchestra-Prémaman") and Yeled Invest S.A., a private company organized under the laws of Luxembourg ("Parent").

This Proxy Statement and the enclosed BLUE proxy card are first being furnished to shareholders on or about
October 11, 2017.

As of the date hereof, Orchestra collectively owns an aggregate of 1,922,820 shares of Common Stock. We intend to vote such
shares of Common Stock, and all proxies delivered to Orchestra:

· AGAINST the election of Messrs. Blitzer, Erdos, Weinstein and Ms. Payner-Gregor;

the fiscal year ending February 3, 2018 and the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of
February 3, 2018;

· ABSTAIN on the approval of the amendment to the Company's 2005 Equity Incentive Plan;

· AGAINST the approval of the advisory vote on the compensation of the Company's named executive officers, as
described herein; and

· 1 YEAR for the frequency of executive compensation voting.

The Board has fixed September 18, 2017 as the record date for determining holders of Common Stock who are entitled to vote
at the Annual Meeting (the "Record Date"). According to the Company, as of the Record Date the Company had outstanding
13,960,777 shares of Common Stock entitled to be voted. Each share of Common Stock entitles the record holder to one vote on each
matter to be voted upon at the Annual Meeting. The mailing address of the principal executive offices of the Company is 232
Strawbridge Drive, Moorestown, New Jersey 08057. Shareholders of record at the close of business on the Record Date will be entitled
to vote at the Annual Meeting.

THIS SOLICITATION IS BEING MADE BY ORCHESTRA AND NOT ON BEHALF OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS
OR MANAGEMENT OF THE COMPANY. WE ARE NOT AWARE OF ANY OTHER MATTERS TO BE BROUGHT BEFORE

BACKGROUND TO THE SOLICITATION

A chronology of our interactions with the Company as it pertains to the Annual Meeting is as follows:

· On July 27, 2017 Orchestra agreed to certain "standstill" provisions by signing and delivering the Termination
Agreement dated on that same date.

· On August 29, 2017, Orchestra alerted Destination that those standstill provisions had terminated automatically
pursuant to Section 6(e)(vii) of the Termination Agreement because Destination's share price had fallen below
mandated levels for a period of seven (7) consecutive trading days.

· On August 31, 2017, a representative of Orchestra met with two of the sitting directors of Destination and discussed
some of Orchestra's concerns about the direction of the Company.

· On September 25, 2017, Orchestra issued a "Stop, Look & Listen Letter" by press release and as filed with the SEC
on the same date.

· On September 27, 2017, Orchestra filed an amendment to its Schedule 13D filing that stated in Item 4, among other
intentions, that Orchestra "intend[s] to encourage the issuer to undertake a strategic review process including, without
limitation, a potential sale of the Issuer or certain of its businesses or assets, in which [Orchestra] may participate, as
a means of enhancing shareholder value." Orchestra expressly reserved the ability to change its intention with respect
to any and all matters referred to in Item 4.

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/896985/000101359417000730/dmc-defc-101017.htm 11/35

REASONS FOR THE SOLICITATION

Orchestra is a long-term and significant investor in the Company, having made its initial investment in the Company in
August 2015 and currently owns approximately 13.8% of the Company. Orchestra has owned shares of  Destination continuously since
August 2015. In our opinion, our ownership aligns us well with the interests of shareholders in general because we share their
economic risks and would share in their economic upside if the Company prospers from our strategic vision. Orchestra has been an
involved shareholder of the Company for an extended period of time and has engaged with management and the Board from time to
time, including in connection with the now terminated merger (see "ADDITIONAL PARTICIPANT INFORMATION").  Based on the
publicly known factors discussed in this proxy statement, we believe that the leadership of the Status Quo Directors has been
ineffective, that the stock price has fallen as a result and that consequently shareholders have suffered.  We believe that re-election is
unwarranted and that because of the resignation requirements in the Company's Bylaws, a sufficiently strong vote AGAINST the
election of each of the Status Quo Directors can and should create the conditions for identifying and appointing a fresh set of directors
with new ideas, who can plausibly undertake a turnaround that can create confidence in the market.

The Company has Missed its Self-Appointed Goals

Under the Status Quo Directors, the company has adopted and then repeatedly publicly discussed major goals, and has
repeatedly missed them. For example, as disclosed in Destination's 10-K for the fiscal year ending January 28, 2017 (the "Relevant 10-
K"), in late in fiscal 2014 the Company commenced its self-proclaimed "turnaround plan" to remedy problems in:

· Business processes;

· Inventory management;

· Sales productivity;

· Real estate optimization; and

· Cost controls, among other things.

The existence of the various goals of the turnaround plan were acknowledged in the 2016 Q4 Earnings Call (the "Earnings
Call").

Yet in the Relevant 10-K, the Company was forced to admit that its progress in implementing all of these critical plans was
slow, resulting in a decline in net sales and other underperformances. In an April 19, 2017 article on RISnew.com entitled "Can
Destination Maternity Turn Things Around", the CEO and President Anthony M. Romano is further quoted as saying that "… our
company has been in the midst of an ongoing turnaround which has proved more challenging than anticipated." Similarly in the
Earnings Call, Destination acknowledged that "…we have experienced challenges in implementing our turnaround."  Don't you think
that the Status Quo Directors, as the Board responsible for the oversight of the turnaround plans, should be held accountable for this
repeatedly admitted failure to implement these goals successfully?

Orchestra believes that the best directors take responsibility for important corporate goals that are not met.  By renominating
themselves for another term, do you believe that the Status Quo Directors are accepting accountability for these failures? If you do not,
then join Orchestra in conveying your dissatisfaction by voting AGAINST each of the Status Quo Directors on the BLUE proxy card
today.

The Company's Stock Price Drop Speaks for Itself

We believe the single most effective metric to use when measuring value creation or value destruction at a public company is
its stock price. While many of the Company's peers have experienced an overall upward trend in their stock prices, as indicated by the
S&P 500 Apparel Retail Index, Destination has suffered a staggering stock price decline since approximately November of 2013 –
each Status Quo Director was a member of the Board prior to November 2013 and has overseen this value destruction.

Source: FactSet Research Systems Inc.

Our calculations based on publicly available sources show that as compared to the closing stock price of the Company on
September 22, 2017 (the business day immediately prior to the day Orchestra issued its Stop, Look and Listen Letter) the Company's
stock price has dropped by over 85% since each Status Quo Director joined the Board. The below chart shows the Company's closing
stock price as of the day each of the Status Quo Directors joined the Board, the closing stock price of the Company as of September 22,
2017 and the percentage decrease between these two dates.

The above figures are not characterizations. They are cold, mathematical facts. That is the stock price devaluation that the
Status Quo Directors have delivered.

Orchestra asks: How much more of the same can you afford to take?

TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE. WE BELIEVE THAT SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT TO THE BOARD IS NEEDED NOW!

PROPOSAL NO.1

ELECTION OF DIRECTORS

According to the Company's proxy statement, the Board currently consists of five members whose terms will expire at the
Annual Meeting. The Bylaws provide for the size of the Board to be determined by Board action taken from time to time. The
Company is nominating four of its five existing directors for re-election at the Annual Meeting, and reducing the size of the Board of
Directors to four members at the commencement of the Annual Meeting. For the reasons stated above, we are seeking your support at
the Annual Meeting to vote AGAINST the election of Michael J. Blitzer, Barry Erdos, Melissa Payner-Gregor and B. Allen
Weinstein.
 

The Company has adopted a majority vote standard in director elections where the number of nominees does not exceed the
number of directors to be elected.  According to Article II, Section 2 of the Bylaws, a majority of the votes cast means that the number
of shares voted "for" a director must exceed the number of shares voted "against" that director.   As described further in the Company's
proxy statement, each Status Quo Director has tendered a contingent resignation that would become effective if (i) the nominee does
not receive a majority of the votes cast with respect to his or her election at the Annual Meeting and (ii) the Board accepts such
resignation. The Bylaws provide that if an incumbent director does not receive a majority of the votes cast for his or her re-election, the
Nominating and Governance Committee (the "Governance Committee") of the Board shall make a recommendation to the Board as to
whether the Board should accept the director's resignation, reject the director's resignation or take such other action as the Governance
Committee may recommend. The Board will act on the Governance Committee's recommendation and publicly disclose its decisions
and the rationale behind such decision within 90 days from the date of the certification of election results.
 

Accordingly, if we are successful in soliciting your support to vote AGAINST the Status Quo Directors such that each of the
Status Quo Directors receive more votes "against" his or her election than votes "for" his or her election at the Annual Meeting, each
of the Status Quo Directors must tender his or her resignation to the Board for consideration by the Governance Committee. If our
proxy solicitation results in any director failing to receive a majority of the votes cast for his or her re-election, then we believe it
would clearly be inappropriate for any such director to continue to serve on the Board.  We believe the failure of the Board to accept
any such tendered resignations that may result from the Annual Meeting would be an egregious violation of proper corporate
governance, and in direct opposition to a clear shareholder directive.

We therefore also call upon the Status Quo Directors to provide a detailed explanation of the search process for new directors
they will conduct if shareholders vote  against the re-election of the Status Quo Directors. Orchestra strongly believes that it would be a
fundamental breach of fiduciary duty and abdication of director responsibility if all the Status Quo Directors were to abandon their
posts—or threaten to do so—without identifying sufficiently qualified replacement directors if you, the shareholders, exercise your
rights to vote against all of the Status Quo Directors.

Therefore, this is not a choice between the Status Quo Directors and no directors, as that could only happen if the Status Quo
Directors seriously violated their fiduciary duties to act in the best interest of shareholders.  This is a choice between a chance for
change versus more of the same.  If you do not vote against the Status Quo Directors, you will not have another opportunity to have
your voice heard in the selection of the Board until the 2018 annual meeting.

Please note that the Status Quo Directors are not the nominees of Orchestra, have not consented to be named in these proxy
materials, and are the nominees of Destination. Because the Status Quo Directors are not Orchestra's nominees and have not consented
to be named in this proxy statement, they are not participants in this solicitation. The names, backgrounds and qualifications of the
Status Quo Directors, and other information about them, can be found in the Company's proxy statement.
 

WE URGE YOU TO VOTE "AGAINST" THE ELECTION OF MESSRS. BLITZER, ERDOS, WEINSTEIN AND
MS. PAYNER-GREGOR ON THE ENCLOSED BLUE PROXY CARD.

PROPOSAL NO. 2

 
RATIFICATION OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

As discussed in further detail in the Company's proxy statement, the Board is seeking an advisory shareholder vote ratifying
the appointment of KPMG LLP as the Company's independent registered public accountants to audit and report on the consolidated
financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries for fiscal year 2017, and the Company's internal control over financial
reporting as of February 3, 2018, and to perform such other appropriate accounting and related services as may be required by the
Audit Committee.

According to the Company's proxy statement, the submission of the appointment of KPMG LLP is not required by law or by
the Bylaws of the Company. The Board is nevertheless submitting it to the shareholders to ascertain their views. If the shareholders do
not ratify the appointment, the selection of other independent registered public accountants will be considered by the Board. If
KPMG LLP shall decline to accept or become incapable of accepting its appointment, or if its appointment is otherwise discontinued,
the Board will appoint other independent registered public accountants.

WE RECOMMEND A VOTE "FOR" WITH RESPECT TO THE APPROVAL OF THIS PROPOSAL AND INTEND TO
VOTE OUR SHARES "FOR" THIS PROPOSAL.

SHARES OF COMMON STOCK REPRESENTED BY PROPERLY EXECUTED BLUE PROXY CARDS WILL BE VOTED
AT THE ANNUAL MEETING AS MARKED AND, IN THE ABSENCE OF SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS, "FOR" WITH

PROPOSAL NO. 3

APPROVAL OF AMENDMENT OF THE COMPANY'S 2005 EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN

As discussed in further detail in the Company's proxy statement, the Company is asking shareholders to approve an
amendment (the "Amendment") to the Company's 2005 Equity Incentive Plan (the "2005 Plan"). If approved, the Amendment will
increase the number of shares of Common Stock available for issuance under the 2005 Plan from 2,800,000 (not more than 1,500,000
of which have been or would be used for restricted stock or restricted stock unit awards) to 3,800,000 (not more than 2,500,000 of
which have been or would be used for restricted stock or restricted stock unit awards). Other than with respect to the increase in shares
of Common Stock available for issuance under the 2005 Plan, the terms of the 2005 Plan are materially consistent with the terms of the
2005 Plan as previously disclosed. The terms of the 2005 Plan are summarized below.

According to the Company's proxy statement, the Board determined that the number of shares remaining under the 2005 Plan
may not be sufficient to support our equity incentive programs and, accordingly, has adopted the Amendment, subject to shareholder
approval. Such approval will require the affirmative vote of a majority of the voting power of all outstanding shares of the Company's
Common Stock present or represented and entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting. The Amendment will not become effective unless
and until shareholder approval is obtained. If shareholders do not approve the Amendment, the 2005 Plan will instead remain in effect
in accordance with its pre-existing terms.

For a full discussion of the Amendment and the 2005 Plan, please see the Company's proxy statement.  The Amended and
Restated 2005 Plan, as approved by the Board, is attached to the Company's proxy statement as Appendix A.

WE RECOMMEND A VOTE "ABSTAIN" WITH RESPECT TO THE APPROVAL OF THIS PROPOSAL AND INTEND
TO VOTE OUR SHARES "ABSTAIN" WITH RESPECT TO THE APPROVAL OF THIS PROPOSAL.

SHARES OF COMMON STOCK REPRESENTED BY PROPERLY EXECUTED BLUE PROXY CARDS WILL BE VOTED

PROPOSAL NO. 4

ADVISORY VOTE RELATED TO EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION

As discussed in further detail in the Company's proxy statement, the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and
the related rules of the SEC enable the Company's shareholders to vote to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the
compensation of the Company's named executive officers as disclosed in this proxy statement in accordance with the SEC's rules. At
the Company's Annual Meeting of Shareholders held in February 2011, the Company's shareholders were asked to vote on whether the
"Say-on-Pay" advisory vote should be held annually, every two years or every three years. The Company shareholders indicated a
preference for holding such a vote on an annual basis. The Board determined, as a result of such vote on the frequency of the advisory
vote to approve our executive compensation, that the Company will hold a "Say-On-Pay" shareholder advisory vote to approve the
Company's executive compensation every year.

Specifically, the Company is asking shareholders to vote for the following resolution:

"RESOLVED, that the Company's shareholders approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of the named executive
officers, as disclosed in the Company's Proxy Statement for the 2017 Annual Meeting of Shareholders pursuant to the compensation
disclosure rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the Summary
Compensation Table and the other related tables and disclosure."

The say-on-pay vote is advisory, and therefore not binding on the Company, the Compensation Committee or the Board.

Although only advisory, we believe a vote against this proposal sends a powerful message to Destination's management that
shareholders are dissatisfied with the Company's stock price decline, which continues to harm shareholders while executive
compensation is insulated and not declining along with market price.

WE RECOMMEND A VOTE "AGAINST" WITH RESPECT TO THE APPROVAL OF THIS PROPOSAL AND INTEND
TO VOTE OUR SHARES "AGAINST" THIS PROPOSAL

SHARES OF COMMON STOCK REPRESENTED BY PROPERLY EXECUTED BLUE PROXY CARDS WILL BE VOTED

PROPOSAL NO. 5

ADVISORY VOTE ON THE FREQUENCY OF EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION VOTING

As discussed in further detail in the Company's proxy statement, in accordance with the requirements of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 and the related rules of the SEC, the Company's shareholders have the opportunity to indicate how frequently
the Company should seek an advisory vote on the compensation of the Company's named executive officers, as disclosed pursuant to
the Securities and Exchange Commission's compensation disclosure rules. By voting on this Proposal 5, shareholders may indicate
whether they would prefer an advisory vote on named executive officer compensation every one, two or three calendar years. The
Company's shareholders voted on a similar proposal in February 2011 with the majority voting to hold the "say-on-pay" vote every
year.

Specifically, the Company is asking shareholders to vote for the following resolution:

"RESOLVED that the Company hold a shareholder advisory vote to approve the compensation of the Company's named
executive officers, as disclosed pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, with a
frequency of once every one year, two years or three years, whichever receives the affirmative vote of the majority of the shares present
in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote at the meeting."

Shareholders may cast their votes on their preferred voting frequency by choosing the option of one year, two years, three
years, or abstain from voting. Because this vote is advisory and not binding on the Board or the Company in any way, the Board may
decide that it is in the best interests of the Company's shareholders and the Company to hold an advisory vote on executive
compensation more or less frequently than the option approved by the Company's shareholders.

Orchestra believes that—particularly given the troubled performance of Destination and its stock price performance—it is
prudent for shareholders to express their views on the Company's executive compensation annually, as opposed to less frequently.

WE RECOMMEND A VOTE FOR EVERY "1 YEAR" FOR THE ADVISORY VOTE ON THE FREQUENCY OF
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION VOTING AND INTEND TO VOTE OUR SHARES FOR EVERY "1 YEAR".

SHARES OF COMMON STOCK REPRESENTED BY PROPERLY EXECUTED BLUE PROXY CARDS WILL BE VOTED
AT THE ANNUAL MEETING AS MARKED AND, IN THE ABSENCE OF SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS, FOR EVERT "1

YEAR" WITH RESPECT TO THE APPROVAL OF THIS PROPOSAL.



9/1/2019 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/896985/000101359417000730/dmc-defc-101017.htm

VOTING AND PROXY PROCEDURES

Only shareholders of record on the Record Date will be entitled to notice of and to vote at the Annual Meeting. Shareholders
who sell their shares of Common Stock before the Record Date (or acquire them without voting rights after the Record Date) may not
vote such shares. Shareholders of record on the Record Date will retain their voting rights in connection with the Annual Meeting even
if they sell such shares of Common Stock after the Record Date. Based on publicly available information, Orchestra believes that the
only outstanding class of securities of the Company entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting is the Common Stock.

Shares of Common Stock represented by properly executed BLUE proxy cards will be voted at the Annual Meeting as
marked and, in the absence of specific instructions, will be voted as follows: AGAINST the election of Messrs. Blitzer, Erdos,
Weinstein and Ms. Payner-Gregor, FOR on the ratification of the appointment of KPMG as independent registered public
accountants to audit the consolidated financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries for the fiscal year ending
February 3, 2018 and the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of February 3, 2018, ABSTAIN on the approval of the
Company's 2005 Plan, AGAINST on the approval of the advisory vote on the compensation of the Company's named executive
officers and for 1 YEAR on the approval of the advisory vote on the frequency of executive compensation voting, and in the discretion
of the persons named as proxies on all other matters as may properly come before the Annual Meeting, as described herein and for the
election of directors as set forth below.

According to the Company's proxy statement for the Annual Meeting, the Board is currently composed of five directors whose
terms will expire at the Annual Meeting. The Company is nominating four of its five existing directors for re-election at the Annual
Meeting, and the Board will reduce the size of the Board to four members at the commencement of the Annual Meeting. We are not
seeking control of the Board and have not proposed our own nominees. We are simply urging you to vote AGAINST the election
of the Status Quo Directors.

Quorum; Broker Non-Votes;

The presence, in person or by proxy, of holders of Common Stock entitled to cast at least a majority of the votes which all
holders of the Common Stock are entitled to cast will constitute a quorum for purposes of the transaction of business.

As discussed in the Company's proxy statement, abstentions and broker non-votes (described below) are counted in determining
whether a quorum is present. Abstentions with respect to any proposal other than the election of directors (Proposal 1) will have the
same effect as votes against the proposal, because, in the case of all other proposals approval requires a vote in favor of the proposal by
a majority of the shares entitled to vote present at the Annual Meeting in person or represented by proxy. A "broker non-vote" occurs
when a broker submits a proxy that does not indicate a vote for some of the proposals because the beneficial owners have not instructed
the broker on how to vote on such proposals and the broker does not have discretionary authority to vote in the absence of instructions.
Brokers may be entitled to vote uninstructed shares with respect to the ratification of the selection of independent registered public
accountants, but brokers are not entitled to vote uninstructed shares with respect to other matters. Broker non-votes are not considered
to be shares "entitled to vote" (other than for quorum purposes), and will therefore have no effect on the outcome of any of the matters
to be voted upon at the Annual Meeting.

Votes Required for Approval

Each share of Common Stock entitles the holder thereof to one vote on the election of each of the nominees for director and
on any other matter that may properly come before the Annual Meeting. Shareholders are not entitled to cumulative voting in the
election of directors.



9/1/2019 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/896985/000101359417000730/dmc-defc-101017.htm

Adoption of Proposals 2, 3, 4 and 5 require the affirmative vote of the majority of shares of Common Stock present in person
or represented by proxy and entitled to vote at the meeting.

Election of Directors ─ The Company's Bylaws provide for majority voting in director elections where the number of
nominees does not exceed the number of directors to be elected. Because the number of nominees properly nominated for the Annual
Meeting is the same as the number of directors to be elected at the Annual Meeting, the election of directors majority voting applies.
As a result, in order to be elected, a nominee must receive a majority of the votes cast with respect to his or her election (or re-
election, in the case of any nominee who is an incumbent director), which means the number of votes "for" a nominee must exceed the
number of votes "against" that nominee. Abstentions are not counted as votes cast. Incumbent nominees have tendered a contingent
resignation which would become effective if (i) the nominee does not receive a majority of the votes cast with respect to his or her
election at the Annual Meeting and (ii) the Board of Directors accepts such resignation.

Ratification of the appointment of KPMG LLC ─ The ratification of the appointment of KPMG LLP will require the
affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of Common Stock present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote at the
meeting. According to the Company's proxy statement, abstentions with respect to this proposal will have the same effect as a vote
"against" and broker non-votes will not count as votes cast "for" or "against" this proposal.

Approval of Amendment of The Company's 2005 Equity Incentive Plan – The approval of this proposal requires the affirmative
vote of a majority of the shares of Common Stock present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote at the meeting.
According to the Company's proxy statement, abstentions with respect to this proposal will have the same effect as a vote "against" and
broker non-votes will not count as votes cast "for" or "against" this proposal.

Advisory Vote Related to Executive Compensation ─ The approval of this proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority
of the shares of Common Stock present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote at the meeting. According to the
Company's proxy statement, abstentions with respect to this proposal will have the same effect as a vote "against" and broker non-votes
will not count as votes cast "for" or "against" this proposal.

Advisory Vote on the Frequency of the Executive Compensation Voting ─  The approval of this proposal requires the
affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of Common Stock present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote at the
meeting. According to the Company's proxy statement, abstentions with respect to this proposal will have the same effect as a vote
"against" and broker non-votes will not count as votes cast "for" or "against" this proposal.

To vote, please complete, sign, date and return the enclosed BLUE proxy card or, to appoint a proxy over the Internet or by
telephone, follow the instructions provided herein. If you attend the Annual Meeting and wish to vote in person, you may withdraw
your proxy and vote in person. If your shares of Common Stock are held in the name of your broker, bank or other nominee, as it
appears from public information that most shares of Common Stock are, you must obtain a proxy, executed in your favor, from the
holder of record to be able to vote at the Annual Meeting. Orchestra's proxy solicitors at Saratoga Proxy Consulting LLC can help
answer your voting and proxy questions.

Revocation of Proxies

Shareholders of the Company may revoke their proxies at any time prior to exercise by attending the Annual Meeting and
voting in person (although attendance at the Annual Meeting will not in and of itself constitute revocation of a proxy) or by delivering
a written notice of revocation. The delivery of a subsequently dated proxy which is properly completed will constitute a revocation of
any earlier proxy. The revocation may be delivered either to us in care of Saratoga Proxy Consulting LLC at 520 8th Avenue, 14th
Floor, New York, NY 10018 or to the Company at 232 Strawbridge Drive, Moorestown, New Jersey 08057, or any other address
provided by the Company. Although a revocation is effective if delivered to the Company, we request that either the original or
photostatic copies of all revocations be mailed to us in care of Saratoga Proxy Consulting LLC at 520 8th Avenue, 14th Floor, New
York, NY 10018. IF YOU WISH TO JOIN US IN VOTING AGAINST THE ELECTION OF THE STATUS QUO
DIRECTORS TO THE BOARD, PLEASE SIGN, DATE AND RETURN PROMPTLY THE ENCLOSED BLUE PROXY
CARD IN THE POSTAGE-PAID ENVELOPE PROVIDED.

To ensure that your shares are voted in accordance with your wishes, you should also contact the person responsible
for your account and give instructions for a BLUE proxy card to be issued representing your shares of Common Stock.

facsimile, telephone, telegraph, Internet, in person and by advertisements.
 

Orchestra has entered into an agreement with Saratoga Proxy Consulting LLC for solicitation and advisory services in

Proxy Consulting LLC will employ approximately 12 persons to solicit shareholders for the Annual Meeting.
 

The entire expense of soliciting proxies is being borne by us. Costs of this solicitation of proxies are currently estimated to be
approximately $300,000. We estimate that through the date hereof, the expenses incurred in connection with this solicitation are
approximately $175,000.

On December 19, 2016, and as previously disclosed in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed on December 20, 2016 (the "Initial
Report") by the Company, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement") with Orchestra-
Prémaman and its wholly owned subsidiary, US OP Corporation ("Merger Sub"), pursuant to which it was contemplated that Merger
Sub would merge with and into the Company, with the Company surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Orchestra-
Prémaman (the "Merger"). On the same date, and in connection with the Merger Agreement, the Company also entered into a
Governance Agreement with Orchestra-Prémaman and certain of its affiliates (the "Governance Agreement"). As of the date of the
Initial Report, Orchestra beneficially owned approximately 13.7% of the Company's then outstanding Common Stock and was
therefore considered a "related person" under Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K.

As disclosed in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed on July 27, 2017 (the "July 27 Current Report") by the Company, on July
27, 2017, the Company, Orchestra-Prémaman, and certain other affiliates of Orchestra-Prémaman entered into a Termination
Agreement (the "Termination Agreement") pursuant to which they agreed to terminate the Merger Agreement and various ancillary
agreements entered into in connection with and in contemplation of the Merger, in each case effective immediately. We note that on the
date of the Initial Report, December 20, 2016, Destination's stock price closed at $5.90 per share. Although Orchestra did not calculate
a final valuation for the transaction, that closing price for Destination's stock suggests that the market was assigning an implied value
of approximately $295,302,396.07 to the transaction and the combined company, based on the agreement that Destination shareholders
were to own approximately 28 percent of the surviving entity and 14,014,351 shares of Common Stock were outstanding as of
December 2, 2016, as disclosed in the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended October 29, 2016.

The foregoing description of the Termination Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the
Termination Agreement, which is incorporated by reference herein and is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to the July 27 Current Report. A copy of
the press release issued by the Issuer relating to the execution of the Termination Agreement is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to the July 27
Current Report and is incorporated herein by reference.

giving or withholding of proxies; (vii) no associate of any Participant in this solicitation owns beneficially, directly or indirectly, any
securities of the Company; (viii) no Participant in this solicitation owns beneficially, directly or indirectly, any securities of any parent
